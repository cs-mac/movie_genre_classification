1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,158
Based in the live of
Countess Erzebet Bathory (1560-1614)

2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>History is a tale told by the victors.
Who are the victors?</i>

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,993
<i>Barbaric warriors, mad kings, and greedy traitors.</i>

4
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,269
<i>Maybe most of our histories are made of fables
fabricated by those glorious victors.</i>

5
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,195
<i>This is the story of Countess Erzebet Bathory.</i>

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,992
<i>Not just as history remembers her
but also how I remember her.</i>

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,390
<i>Countess Erzebet Bathory was born into
one of the Hungary's most illustrious families in 1560.</i>

8
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,949
Your future wife...

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,954
<i>She was promised to Ferenc Nadasky's at birth</i>

10
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,592
Erzebet, come here.

11
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,465
They stole a horse, they deserve to be punished.

12
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:04,102
<i>History tells us, from very early age,
Erzebet learnt to be fearless</i>

13
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,382
<i>...unfeeling...</i>

14
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:12,905
<i>...curious...
The seed will turn into a big tree one day.</i>

15
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,025
<i>...and pittyless</i>

16
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:41,016
Why is it when you put someone under the ground
they do not grow like seed?

17
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:45,942
The seeds are alive, whereas people
we buried in the ground are dead.

18
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:50,020
- But if we bury them alive?
- They suffocate and die.

19
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,382
So we get eaten by worms.

20
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,665
The body melts away
but the soul passes on to heaven or hell.

21
00:02:56,827 --> 00:03:01,981
You will go to heaven just like your Papa.
The soul is eternal my dear.

22
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:09,031
If it was not, I would have to raise an army
to conquer death.

23
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,668
He is so lovely, I want him to be my husband.

24
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:21,195
When he reachs his marrying age,
you will be old and worn.

25
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,750
Count Nadasky will be your husband.

26
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:38,936
I beg you not to harm him.
I love him, Mother.

27
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:43,774
The only love you shall feel is to Our Lord,
you should respect your husband.

28
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:47,089
But as for peasants and servants
you must never fornicate with them.

29
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:52,093
Your peasant will die as he deserves. And you will stay
in your room. So no ones will know of yours silly mistake.

30
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:58,057
- It is a boy.
- Leave.

31
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:01,290
But Mother, my child.

32
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,905
<i>She was married to Ferenc Nadasky at 15.</i>

33
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:12,303
<i>Her mother died soon after.</i>

34
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:16,021
<i>Erzebet managed her estate masterfully.</i>

35
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:22,631
<i>Soon many noble families from kingdoms of Bohemia
to Poland were in debt to her and her husband.</i>

36
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:27,229
<i>She even lent large sums of money to the king himself.</i>

37
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:32,227
<i>She gave Nadasky 3 children.
The first child was born 10 years into the union.</i>

38
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,543
<i>She hardly spent any time with her husband.</i>

39
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:42,497
<i>In less than 50 years</i>

40
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:47,135
<i>the Turks has slaughtered and enslaved
half the population of Hungary.</i>

41
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:51,502
<i>Nadasky and his men were the only warriors they feared.</i>

42
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:56,060
<i>Erzebet funded a hospital for the poor.</i>

43
00:04:56,224 --> 00:05:00,422
<i>But bad-told said, that many of them never came out alive.</i>

44
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,674
<i>Though a devoted protestant</i>

45
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:05,411
<i>Erzebet believed many heretic's theories.</i>

46
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,433
<i>Darvulia, who some claimed was witch,</i>

47
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,195
<i>managed Erzebet's wealth so well</i>

48
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:14,374
<i>that some believed
she knew the recipe for making gold.</i>

49
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:21,066
<i>The combination of Nadasky's military powers</i>

50
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:24,062
<i>and Erzebet's intelligence and unbending will</i>

51
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:30,574
<i>quickly made them the most feared,
respected and powerful family in the kingdom.</i>

52
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:47,607
- Good afternoon, my King.
- Good afternoon, Dear Count Nadasky.

53
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:51,993
Your majesty, I have come to demand
my pay for this last year of war.

54
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:55,504
Of course, you are welcome to stay
for a few days if you wish

55
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:57,223
while we gather the amount.

56
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,924
- We're having excutions all day tomorrow.
- Um, unfortunatly, I have no time to wait.

57
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:04,394
- I must leave before night fall.
- What a shame.

58
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:07,335
Half in gold and half in talers will do.

59
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,253
Good day, My King.

60
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:25,001
A gift from the King.

61
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:34,007
With what he still owes us,
he should have gotten me the holy grail.

62
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,882
Mother, Father is back.

63
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:59,369
Please leave the room... Now.

64
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,410
- Leave.
- I brought you my pay. And...

65
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:06,406
Oh, thank you daddy. A bird.

66
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,861
- I feel a bit sick.
- It is the wine.

67
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,346
My head hurts.

68
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:12,837
You're burning up.

69
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,310
Let me get Darvulia.
She will surely have good remedy for you.

70
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:20,130
I do not need the help of Satan.

71
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,148
More.

72
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,594
You saved me, my love.

73
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,230
I can see the beautiful morning light.

74
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,352
I am sorry dear, but he is gone.

75
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:16,106
Count Ferenc Nadasky
was a good husband and father.

76
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:20,423
But above all, a great warrior.

77
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:25,460
Today he's standing joyfully with Jesus
at the right hand of God.

78
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:31,945
Soon we will be with him
at their side for eternity.

79
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,347
I have sent the soldiers back to war.

80
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,408
You will let in Cachtice while I am gone.

81
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,102
I must bring the children to a safer place...

82
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,308
..and show the Court
Ferenc's dead has not weaken me.

83
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:55,333
- Are we ever coming back, Mother?
- Of course, but for now you will stay in Vienna.

84
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,495
You will learn music,
French and Latin with best teachers.

85
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,319
And aunt Klara will take you
to see plays and fireworks.

86
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,533
- Fireworks?
- Yes.

87
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:13,588
- You see it is essential to pay soldiers well.
- I know, dear countess.

88
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:17,429
But the peasants who escape this slaughter
are dying of hunger.

89
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,706
Please, have patience and allow me to pay you later.

90
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,891
- It will be difficult...
- Should I assign a guardian to manage your estate?

91
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:26,947
You know I disapprove of a widow
handling her lands alone.

92
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,744
I can manage perfectly well.

93
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,366
You know, my husband had little to do
with such matters.

94
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:35,988
Well, then you can sell some land,
hire younger men and pay them less.

95
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:39,783
I am not too keen to impoverish
my estate and send children to war.

96
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:41,466
But if you demand it, I will.

97
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:46,151
I will keep the Turks out of what is left of Hungary
no matter what it costs me.

98
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:51,832
You are my best ally.

99
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:03,878
Dear Niece, I'm delighted you decided
to leave your little angels with me.

100
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,728
It will not be fair to keep them at Cachtice.

101
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:08,542
Your husband's death must have been
a dreadful shock to them.

102
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,472
Indeed. He died so fast, and in bed.

103
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:15,602
He probably caught a shameful illness
from one of those Turkish whores.

104
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,363
Last time my husband came home
from the battle front,

105
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:21,329
His little skin-theca almost fell off.

106
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:24,074
Not a great loss, from what you've told me.

107
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,302
Countess Bathory, I heard the king
owes you so much from Nadasky.

108
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:33,110
He is so poor that he cannot afford
to pay you for more than a year.

109
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:36,798
Yes, the King owes me a fortune
which is to my advantage.

110
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:41,158
Might he not perhaps take offence
in such wealth since you are a Protestant?

111
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:44,417
Our king openly tolerates Protestants.

112
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:45,732
Thank you Count Thurzo.

113
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,714
It is my right not to share my posessions
with the Catholic Church.

114
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,921
For centuries your friends in Rome
orchestrated countless...

115
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,093
..murders of inocents, especially women.

116
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,490
Your word suprise me.

117
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,930
Are you defending witches, Countess?

118
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,554
Please, this conversation is boring me!

119
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,634
I apologize.

120
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,431
I was just asking the Countess
about her admirable wealth.

121
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:08,675
Ne pose pas de cuestions si
tu connais deja la reponse.

122
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:14,105
My little niece knows six languages,
including ancient Greek.

123
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,160
It is possible for a woman's mind...

124
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,777
- ..to be sharper than than a man's?
- Of course it is.

125
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,271
But I have heard that their emotions are...

126
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:24,387
..always get best of them
so their intelligence ultmately, wasted.

127
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,074
I agree that most women are weak.

128
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:29,470
And it is in the area of heart
that the weakness seems to lie.

129
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,697
A man's weakness is located
in the lower place of the body.

130
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:37,049
At somewhat less noble part.

131
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,665
I think men and women are both equal and different.

132
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,724
- Equal? That is a very bold statement.
- You do not listen, Bishop.

133
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,890
My cousin said "and different".

134
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:50,107
We all have our strengths and weaknesses.

135
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,262
What are your weaknesses, Countess?

136
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,868
I am a woman. I love beautiful dresses and gold jewelry.

137
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:02,897
Just like you, dear Bishop.

138
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:12,455
Are you sure the woman at Cachtice
can manage your estate wisely?

139
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:16,335
Darvulia is young but she is more than wise
to maintaining my wealth.

140
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,610
She is the most knowledgable woman in the land.

141
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,744
- After you.
- Of course.

142
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:24,047
I've heard you've earned
a large amount of money recently.

143
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,020
Yes, a very profitable transaction.

144
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,291
It did cost many the life and freedom
of many Bohemian peasants.

145
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,167
Everything has its price.

146
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:37,481
- Turkish lines are quite near your castle.
- Indeed.

147
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:41,220
Don't you feel endangered to stand alone near the wars?

148
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:47,063
- I am not alone and the war is my duty.
- Have you considered remarrying?

149
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:52,016
Our union would make us most powerful.

150
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:57,605
Dear Gyorgy, you know very well, it would
be improper for me to marry you

151
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:01,242
You are a Count by mariage
whereas nobility has be in my blood for centuries.

152
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:06,486
I know, dear cousin. All I'm saying is
if you feel yourself need you can always count on me.

153
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,289
What matters is
that we are all united against the Turks.

154
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:11,332
Of course.

155
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,453
We must leave for the ball, Erzebet.
Dear Count, will you join us?

156
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,679
Unfortunately I'm leaving for Prague early tomorrow.

157
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,058
What a shame. Have a good journey then.

158
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,968
- Did he dare to ask you?
- Of course.

159
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,844
I knew it. He insisted of coming.

160
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,156
I am not fond of his manners.
He's always wearing last year's fashion.

161
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,138
Do not marry him.

162
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,424
Safe journey.

163
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:55,626
There is that French doctor I want you to meet.
He'd like to visit your hospital.

164
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,787
I am afraid it has become more of a mass grave
than a hospital lately.

165
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:05,551
Also, there is an astronomer who says
the earth is not moving in the circle around the sun...

166
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:10,947
..but all over the place.
Maybe that is why I've been so dizzy lately.

167
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:19,175
- Countess Erzebet Bathory.
- Enchante de faire votre connaissance

168
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:24,099
- Je tiens a rendre a l'hopital. Madam?
- Biensur quand vous voulez!

169
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,414
Excuse-moi.

170
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,035
Do you happen to know who that young man is?

171
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,905
Istvan Thurzo. Gyorgy's only son.

172
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:36,575
- He moved back to Vienna recently.
- He was a child just yesterday.

173
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:38,083
Yesterday? Then do not wait too long.

174
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:41,417
He might grow old and bald
before the night is over.

175
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,509
- Klara.
- Istvan.

176
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,917
We had dinner with your father,

177
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,849
but unfortunately he could not join us to the ball.

178
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:56,747
I would like you to meet my little niece.

179
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:59,507
I do not think I have the pleasure of meeting you before.

180
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,352
Oh, would you excuse me.

181
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:07,548
Please to meet you, Count Thurzo.
I knew your late mother quite well, she was lovely.

182
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,436
I am Countess Bathory.

183
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:16,316
- Countess Erzebet Bathory?
- Yes. Whatever you heard about me.

184
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:19,999
That everyone respects and fears you.

185
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:25,888
- Forgive me...
- I do not object to being feared.

186
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,567
- Do I inspire fear in you?
- Not at all.

187
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:32,769
I'm so very honored to meet you.

188
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,288
And I you.

189
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:43,290
- I am awfully sorry about Count Nadasky.
- It was a dreadful shock to my children.

190
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:47,197
Might be a manner to ask
but does widowhood forbid you to dance?

191
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,337
No.

192
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:52,289
- You're a good dancer for one who's so young.
- I'm not that young, I'm 21.

193
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:55,737
Oh, 21?

194
00:17:55,901 --> 00:18:01,737
- Would you care to dance the next one?
- I need a moment to myself.

195
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:12,099
- He is to my taste.
- Much more exciting than his father, isn't he?

196
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:14,424
- Are you going to have an affair?
- Perhaps.

197
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,057
You must.

198
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:20,060
- Every word he speaks seems so sincere.
- Well, he might be sincere.

199
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:23,896
Ever since his mother died,
he's been very devoted to his studies in Krakow.

200
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,452
The Italian countess he was about to marry
died before they even met.

201
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:32,234
Now his father has found him
a new wife in Denmark.

202
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:35,668
Istvan has spent very little time at the court.

203
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,773
You mean he still has a chance to go to heaven?

204
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:39,991
He has not yet been corrupted by power?

205
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:45,217
A genuine and virtuous young man... How lovely.

206
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,220
- What are you looking at?
- Sorry.

207
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,932
- Do you find them pretty?
- Pardon?

208
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,917
- My lips.
- Yes. That is...

209
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,364
- Do you wish to kiss them?
- No!

210
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,350
No?

211
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:12,309
- Oh, yes ...
- Then why do you not?

212
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:17,386
- In front of every one?
- Do you care?

213
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,222
We have arrived.

214
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:40,664
- Why are you shaking?
- I do not know.

215
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,005
You must rest.

216
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:45,446
I do not believe I will be able
to rest until we meet again.

217
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,491
I have to ride back tomorrow.

218
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,410
May I see you early so I can spend
every moment with you before you leave?

219
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:53,664
Every moment?

220
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:55,984
It is only because I know what I feel.

221
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:04,616
- You can meet me at my aunt's villa before noon.
- Thank you.

222
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,835
I must go before I lose my mind.

223
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:17,202
Wait... do you have to go?

224
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:24,315
Since we will meet in the morning,
and we only have less than a day.

225
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:37,794
I know what we've done is sinful,
but it does not feel wrong in my heart.

226
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:41,115
My heart feels warmer than ever.

227
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:46,074
- Was I careful?
- You have nothing to worry about.

228
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,671
Kissing you feels like making love to you.

229
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,037
- And making love to you feels like...
- Like what?

230
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,072
I cannot find words to describe it.

231
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:24,071
Is it not strange to think as we're enjoying ourselves today,
warm in each other's arms

232
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:26,910
others are dying at war?

233
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,387
We're all in the hands of God.

234
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:35,506
Let us rejoice we are not the ones
dying in war today.

235
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:17,835
It is morning. I ought to leave soon.

236
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:19,500
Must you travel today?

237
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:22,817
I have many matters to attend to at Cachtice.

238
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,230
War is a messy job for a lonely woman.

239
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:30,712
I understand.

240
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:38,065
I will have my valet bring you a letter
every week until we meet again.

241
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:29,618
Be careful, they cost me a fortune in Vienna.

242
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:32,216
I have this one made for you, my dear.

243
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,166
I have so much to tell you.

244
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,649
I had an affair with a young man.
It was so lovely.

245
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,693
Good.

246
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:41,207
Do you have more of that ointment
to make my skin softer?

247
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,239
Softer for that young man?

248
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:50,492
- Lust, it will gain you nothing.
- It's not lust, not this time.

249
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:54,780
I have never felt this way.
Even when I was a girl.

250
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:59,493
- I thought you were strong.
- Darvulia, love is not a sign of weakness.

251
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:03,018
- It is the most noble feeling known to man.
- Assuming he is one.

252
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:06,254
You should see his skin.
So soft, so perfect.

253
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:09,844
Is it him you're fond of
or just texture of his young skin?

254
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,300
Do not be a witch!

255
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:14,166
- How old?
- 21.

256
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,178
- Who is he?
- Istvan Thurzo.

257
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:18,836
His father wishes for their bloodline
to be tied to mine.

258
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,395
Oh, you're planning on asking for his hand?

259
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:25,665
Keep him as a lover, if you wish,
but do not forget your rank.

260
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:29,880
- He is 21 while you're soon to be 39.
- He's very mature for his age.

261
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:34,210
Erzebet, young people change their mind all the time.

262
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,997
He can have any woman.

263
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:40,087
I am not enjoying your company 
today you old hag.

264
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,621
I am your servant as always.

265
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,125
But I remind you that I am younger than you.

266
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:45,270
Enough!

267
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:04,456
Time has no respect for beauty.

268
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:09,412
<i>Countess, a letter.</i>

269
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,636
Erzebet, you know I will marry soon.

270
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,462
Yes, I have heard.

271
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,391
It hurts me to even think
I could touch another woman.

272
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,314
Istvan, marry her, have children...
and be my lover always.

273
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,679
But I will be so far away.
And I want to be only yours.

274
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,755
No other woman could mean anything to my heart.

275
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,515
- To your heart?
- Yes.

276
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,514
I've never felt this way.

277
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:36,036
<i>Is it a sin to love someone in this manner?</i>

278
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:40,635
When I am with him, I feel joy and beauty.

279
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,282
When I away from him,
I feel pain as if hundreds of tigers...

280
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:46,188
..tigers are tearing apart my entire body.

281
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,589
- His soul is in a better place.
- Who's?

282
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:55,433
- Count Nadasky's.
- Of course.

283
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:58,580
It is such an honor to have you pray
in our humble village church.

284
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:01,391
And thank you again for your generous donation.

285
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:05,953
It is nothing, father. God has given me so much.

286
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:20,240
Countess, you shouldn't be out here. It is so cold.

287
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:24,527
- I'm waiting for a letter.
- Must be a very important letter.

288
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,879
- Very.
- What a beautiful dress.

289
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:33,754
- What's your name?
- Pola.

290
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:39,643
Here, take it. It's yours.

291
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:43,798
Go now. Leave the Countess alone.

292
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:48,247
It has been over a week
and I have not received his letter yet.

293
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,713
You have to be careful of what you wish for.

294
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,577
Your two destinies are to be tied
in a manner that did you not expect.

295
00:27:57,266 --> 00:28:00,576
It is my desire.

296
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:08,985
- And more if the magic works soon.
- Gold is not main thing that binds me to you.

297
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:12,855
And you can spend your nights with me.

298
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,660
I will need something of his.
Something he gave you preferably.

299
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,992
Just for tonight.

300
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:31,980
My beautiful love what a fool I was to worry.

301
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:34,327
Your messenger had simply been delayed.

302
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,897
He will meet me at the Von Varad ball in a week.

303
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:39,557
I shall leave tomorrow.

304
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,469
- So soon?
- I will visit the children.

305
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:30,187
Dear Countess, you look even more as splendid...

306
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:31,864
...than in the paintings I've seen of you.

307
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:38,688
- I am Count Dominic Vizakna.
- A flatterer is a secret enemy I've heard.

308
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:44,640
Is seduction merely on of you hobbies
or your life's main occupation?

309
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:48,358
Forgive me for intruding
but you seem somewhat morose.

310
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,751
I suppose I can not hide my emotions very well.

311
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:54,625
Can I help you feel better in anyway?

312
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,318
I am afraid the reason for my pain isn't cureable.

313
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:03,352
Then it can only be
that horrible sickness called "love".

314
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,186
Truly this person does not deserve your love

315
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:10,726
if he is capable of hurting such 
a precious woman.

316
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,047
A nobel man is looking for you, Countess.

317
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:24,404
I missed you so.

318
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:26,603
I'm not ba able to see you for long tonight.

319
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:29,720
- I have important matters to deal with.
- This late, what is it?

320
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:33,246
- I wish to leave Vienna with you tomorrow at midday.
- Where to?

321
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,561
To your castle. I would like 
to stay with you.

322
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,239
Very well I could visit my children early...

323
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:46,244
I will be with you not later than midday.
I promise.

324
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:52,196
Wait! If there is a reason for your haste,
you're not telling me,

325
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:53,595
I must know what is it.

326
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:56,732
Is it that you do not feel the same
as you did a month ago?

327
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,569
I do feel the same.

328
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:03,799
And the next few days will prove my true devotion.

329
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:18,481
Dear Countess, he is not worthy of your love.

330
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:22,719
- You are wrong about him.
- Will you like company tonight?

331
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:27,243
Do you not see the lines on my face?
I have no time to play, good night!

332
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:53,047
<i> Dear Istvan. I have waited,
and you've given me no sign.</i>

333
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,525
<i>Young people often change their minds...</i>

334
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,764
<i>because they think they have all the time in the world.</i>

335
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:04,525
<i>Often death takes us
before we have had the chance to taste love.</i>

336
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:10,801
<i>Because when love was right in front of us,
we were too busy looking for it elsewhere.</i>

337
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:16,205
<i>Please tell me I was not fooled,
and your feelings were true.</i>

338
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:37,277
- You have no right to keep me in this room.
- You've disobeyed me and met with her again.

339
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:46,793
- She has being waiting for me since yesterday.
- I've found out about your foolish plan to escape with her.

340
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:51,434
She has countless minions,
you are just one of many, my son.

341
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:54,690
I do not believe she feels the same about me
as she does about her other lovers.

342
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:56,658
You got what you wanted from her.

343
00:32:56,963 --> 00:33:02,196
- Everything that is conquered, is destroyed.
- Conquered?

344
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:09,633
If the goal was to honor Countess Bathory,
yes, the goal was reached, more than once.

345
00:33:09,803 --> 00:33:13,478
But unlike you, I do not see
anything destructive in the act of love.

346
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:19,553
We are not talking about a land to conquer
or a competitor who must be bested.

347
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:25,154
We are talking about a kind woman
and a very noble feeling we share.

348
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:29,275
The same noble feeling that you share
with Baroness von Kraj?

349
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:33,187
You know very well that I have not seen von Kraj
since I met Erzebet.

350
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:35,932
I do love her, father.

351
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:41,588
Love is a myth to keep the minds
of young peasants and virgins occupied with a dream.

352
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:47,066
- It has no place in our world.
- In your world!

353
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:51,586
I do not understand you though.
It would be beneficial for you if I married Erzebet.

354
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:54,719
So you could grant me a tiny portion of her land?

355
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:59,099
She never marry you.
Your blood is not noble enough.

356
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,342
- You are leaving today for Denmark.
- I will not.

357
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,297
Would you like to know how grieved the Countess is?

358
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:10,413
She is already in the company of Count Vizakna.

359
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:15,116
- You know his reputation?
- That is a lie.

360
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,819
They met two days ago and not left each other since.

361
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,299
You have already been forgotten.

362
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:33,875
If you are wise, everything that
is mine will be yours one day.

363
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,716
Have a good journey.

364
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:46,611
Guards ...

365
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:51,452
This man will stay with you
until he decides not to disobey me again.

366
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:02,455
<i>My father had arranged my marriage
to the daughter of a wealthy Danish trading partner.</i>

367
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:07,212
<i>I was married to Hanne Aagesen against my will.</i>

368
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,467
<i>It was only years later, on his death bed,</i>

369
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:15,202
that my father confessed to me
some of the truths about Erzebet.

370
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,894
<i>But I arrived so late to decide,</i>

371
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,210
that I could only understand
a few words between his screams.

372
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:29,895
<i>I heard just enough to realize that what is known
about the Countess is made of many lies.</i>

373
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:36,852
<i>In fact, almost all I know about her
from that day on, I was told.</i>

374
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:47,694
Count Vizakna is waiting for an answer.

375
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:50,640
I am so honored you have agreed
to spend time with me.

376
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,357
and supprised you wish to ride.

377
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,576
- Which part of the kingdom were you born in?
- In the castle of Bekov.

378
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,571
There are amusing rumors about that castle.

379
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:04,334
A noble family that only lives at night
and eats newborns so I've heard.

380
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:08,403
It is because of a skin condition
that afflicts most of my family,

381
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:10,049
we are not fond of sunlight.

382
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:13,934
But do not worry. I do not feed on newborns.

383
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,379
Have you read that book about Turkish customs?

384
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:20,463
They drink the blood of boys
to take on their strength.

385
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,703
I have not read it,
but I am not surprised to hear such infamy.

386
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,982
Your young friend was in such a hurry the other night.

387
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,668
Yes, I have not heard from him since.
I'm concerned he may have gotten hurt or...

388
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:39,850
I saw him just this morning
near San Nicholas with a friend.

389
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:41,454
He seemed quite well.

390
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,696
- A friend?
- Yes.

391
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,142
- A woman?
- No.

392
00:36:46,307 --> 00:36:48,744
She was too young to be called a woman.

393
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:53,115
- Probably his little sister.
- He has no little sister.

394
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:56,243
- Oh.
- Maybe you're right about him.

395
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,989
I did not even get a word of apology.

396
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,837
Making me wait all day.

397
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:09,145
You old witch!
Your repulsive look scared my horse.

398
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:13,432
Powerful now, but soon you will look like me.

399
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:18,031
- And then you shall see.
- How dare you. Out of my sight!

400
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:24,146
Countess, you can not let someone
who insults you in this manner go unpunished.

401
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:42,428
- Did someone bring a letter when I was away?
- No, Countess.

402
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:44,282
This dress makes me look old and worn.

403
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:46,102
I wish to change, now.

404
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:53,272
I wish to pray and fast until he answers my letter.
Leave me to myself.

405
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:59,673
Dear Lord, why are you punishing me?

406
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:09,020
How can you give me this beautiful love
and take it away from me so fast?

407
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:28,426
Water alone will not keep you alive very long.

408
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:31,125
Erzebet, it has been 3 weeks.

409
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:34,420
If you let yourself die,
what will happen to your lands and children.

410
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,266
I do not know.

411
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:39,852
I do not understand how a strong woman
can fall for such a weak young man?

412
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:45,780
He is not weak. He is pure and kind.

413
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:50,175
Before I met him, my life was meaningless,
and I had no idea.

414
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:03,591
News from Cachtice.

415
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:06,665
- The Countess is ill.
- Ill?

416
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:10,506
- Some say she's got mad, she is heartbroken.
- Istvan?

417
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:17,020
Their silly love affair might in
fact serve us in some way.

418
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:20,356
I thought it will be wise to take hold of these.

419
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:22,955
Although it was an no small cost.

420
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:29,880
Soon my son would dwell fully in melancholy.
He is naturally like his mother.

421
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:33,557
He has inherited so little of my character.

422
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:38,352
But I want this proof of her lunacy... at any cost.

423
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,797
I shall kill him!

424
00:40:40,962 --> 00:40:43,278
He just played with me. Who is he?

425
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:45,248
A son of a whore in a brothel?

426
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:53,232
He wrote about a young married woman.
The Baroness von Kraj.

427
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:56,151
Only 17 and very pretty.

428
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,227
He says he loves her more
than anything in the world.

429
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:02,378
That his heart could only be hers.

430
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:07,995
He writes that he's sorry that he mistook
his feelings of admiration and respectful love.

431
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:11,787
That I reminded him so much of his late mother!

432
00:41:15,718 --> 00:41:17,948
Look!

433
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:21,471
Smooth and flawless.

434
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:25,204
Even if she smells like horseshit,
any man will choose her over me.

435
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:31,551
Erzebet, forget about him. I beg you!

436
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:37,605
How?

437
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:40,886
A man dressed in black is at the door, asking for you.

438
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:46,077
- A young man?
- Count Dominic Vizakna, he says.

439
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:50,128
- Should we let him in?
- Of course.

440
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:56,641
I wish to see him alone.

441
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:09,084
- What brings you here so late?
- I do not like to travel during the day.

442
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:13,398
You frighten my maids.
All my soldiers are at war.

443
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:16,969
We are careful about who we let in here.

444
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:24,047
I have brought you that book on
Turkish customs I was telling you about.

445
00:42:27,404 --> 00:42:29,449
Traveled a long way to bring me a book?

446
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,629
It concerned me to hear nothing from you
since that afternoon.

447
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:36,438
I've been quite busy.

448
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:45,966
The truth is I could not wait any longer
to see you again.

449
00:42:56,584 --> 00:43:00,020
Let me show you other ways of using this belt.

450
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:05,895
And on someone who might find it
more suited to his taste.

451
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:11,536
<i>When my father first told me of the nature
of her liason with Dominic Vizakna</i>

452
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:15,743
<i>I could not believe
she was capable of such decadents.</i>

453
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:19,692
- Did you truly enjoy that?
- Yes.

454
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,737
- How can you?
- You do not know...

455
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:25,367
..because you do not have a taste for recieving pain.

456
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:31,298
- Did you enjoy inflicting it though?
- I'm not sure.

457
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:38,659
I wish to be your servant... always.

458
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:44,023
I'm not young and foolish. I mean what I say.

459
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:47,510
I wish to be alone.

460
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:11,810
I came to tell you I do not like the man
that visited you in the night.

461
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:14,132
I was such a fool to believe in Istvan's love.

462
00:44:14,915 --> 00:44:17,588
I was just too old to be loved.

463
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:20,324
That is not true.

464
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:24,522
Maybe I should never have shown
my face to him in the daylight.

465
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:40,050
Look at me. I'm rotting.

466
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:45,479
- She was right.
- Who?

467
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:52,196
The old witch in the park.
She put a curse on me.

468
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:58,350
Or is it that your ointments are no longer effective?
Make something that works!

469
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:02,113
Erzebet, I will not have you talk to me
in this manner.

470
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:07,471
What are you looking at?
Come and brush my hair.

471
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:26,065
It's bad enough my face has wrinkles.
Now you want me be bald like an old man?

472
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:34,708
Look at what you've done!

473
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,091
Leave! Leave!

474
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:24,364
<i>No one knows what she saw in the mirror,</i>

475
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:29,371
<i>if it was because the soft morning light
merely illuminated her face in an unusual manner,</i>

476
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,687
<i>or if her reason had weakened.</i>

477
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,893
Thank you, my Lord.

478
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,776
You can stay at the castle.
We'll take care of you until you're healed.

479
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,172
This is for you from the Countess.

480
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,410
The countess is a good woman.
I did pull her hair a bit too hard.

481
00:46:59,624 --> 00:47:05,176
Dorothea, Susanna needs you down in the kitchen.

482
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:19,621
- How old are you, my child?
- 16.

483
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:24,427
- Where is your family?
- In Novaky.

484
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:31,270
- That's quite far. Do you see them often?
- I visit once a year.

485
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:37,678
Are you a virgin?

486
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:43,197
- Yes, Countess.
- Of course.

487
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,953
Feel better.

488
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:19,272
- Her wound is completely healed.
- I told you to remove the scab every time.

489
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:22,511
I did, but it healed anyway.

490
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:27,530
Darvulia, come have a closer look.

491
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:33,369
- I do not see any difference.
- Nonsense.

492
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,737
Helena, Dorothea what you see?

493
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:47,175
- It looks smoother to me.
- Yes, yes, absolutely.

494
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,672
Yes, it is the Lord's answer 
to my prayers.

495
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,927
Not only the look,
but the feel of my skin is incredibly different.

496
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:58,813
As if I was younger.
I believe it is because she is a virgin.

497
00:49:00,622 --> 00:49:03,610
The purity of her blood seems
to be the reason why it is working.

498
00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:08,339
It is a true miracle.

499
00:49:08,508 --> 00:49:11,466
It is for your own good.

500
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:16,175
Did I kill you?

501
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,645
Almost.

502
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:25,415
I felt the cold breath of death
and I saw two doors opening to a bright light.

503
00:50:25,576 --> 00:50:29,967
You mean heaven was opening
its doors to you?

504
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:34,368
I doubt you will go to heaven
with your inclination for these games.

505
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:39,610
In fact I am sure to go to hell
so why not do exactly what I wish during my time here.

506
00:50:41,896 --> 00:50:47,289
I am so fond of you that I could not stay away
from you for more than a week.

507
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:51,169
To my behavior to that old woman,
I thought you might have being frightened of me.

508
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:56,956
On the contrary. That old witch deserved to die.
You were too kind.

509
00:50:58,157 --> 00:51:01,150
For a while I thought she had
put a curse on me.

510
00:51:01,317 --> 00:51:04,354
I looked so old and worn.

511
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:08,829
You look exceptionally ravishing tonight.

512
00:51:08,997 --> 00:51:13,036
- Tonight more than the other night?
- Yes, more than the day we met.

513
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:15,028
More than our afternoon in the park.

514
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:19,156
Tonight it seems the sun itself
is glowing from under your skin.

515
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:23,150
Now that I look closely,

516
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:26,036
It is quite magical.

517
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:31,829
Tonight you look no more 
than 20 years of age.

518
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:35,431
I know.

519
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:55,231
Countess ...

520
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:58,116
What is happening?

521
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:03,466
You are giving me something beautiful.
Something I had lost.

522
00:52:04,877 --> 00:52:08,074
But when will it stop?

523
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:13,948
When you are empty, my child.
It is God's will.

524
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,572
<i>It is said that it is how the murder started.</i>

525
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,095
<i>To achieve her mad pursuit
of eternal youth and beauty,</i>

526
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:29,535
<i>she needed fresh blood, more and more.</i>

527
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:41,538
<i>God, is it wrong for one to stay beautiful and young?</i>

528
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,941
<i>All around you is beauty.</i>

529
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:51,216
<i>If only Istvan could see me today.</i>

530
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,575
You seem to be only one
that can not see the blood is working.

531
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:02,695
Fortunately, Dominic was there to notice...

532
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:05,139
..how different I've looked ever since I started.

533
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:07,447
I will not trust a word comes out from his mouth.

534
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:09,848
Will you stop this before it is too late.

535
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:15,495
I tried to stop,
but I already felt less alert.

536
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:20,776
I applied the blood again and I felt an
incredible strength invading every part of my body.

537
00:53:20,936 --> 00:53:22,851
The blood is not making you any younger.

538
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:25,234
On the contrary, you're starting 
to smell of death.

539
00:53:28,016 --> 00:53:30,807
- Leave.
- Your vanity will be your undoing.

540
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,366
And you impudence will bring yours.

541
00:53:32,736 --> 00:53:37,366
- Leave and never come back.
- No, I care too much.

542
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:42,885
Is it true that you have shared
love only with women?

543
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,009
That makes you a virgin then.

544
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,714
There have been so many maids dying
at the castle lately.

545
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:17,039
They were clumsy little geese.
Some cut themselves while cocking and got sick.

546
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:18,908
Others fell down the stairs.

547
00:54:19,078 --> 00:54:23,708
- Here.
- Thank the Countess for me.

548
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:29,896
We shall stop bringing the girls to church.

549
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,510
I know the Countess wants to give them
proper burials, but above all...

550
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:36,463
..the Countess want fresh blood.

551
00:54:39,262 --> 00:54:41,989
Quite an invention.

552
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:46,151
I want make sure the witches around here
are bled before they are burned.

553
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:52,154
I have heard that the moisture in the body
keeps them from burning in the inside.

554
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:36,616
<i>It is said that cage allowed her
to bleed the girls...</i>

555
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:39,442
<i>..more effectively with very little blood wasted.</i>

556
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:47,114
<i>The murders quickly multiplied.
Witnesses said she used up to ten girls a month.</i>

557
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:53,039
<i>I wrote Erzebet many letters
but never received one from her.</i>

558
00:55:53,202 --> 00:55:56,356
<i>After I was assured of her affair with Count Vizakna,</i>

559
00:55:56,841 --> 00:55:59,565
I stopped writing and resigned 
myself to my fate.

560
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,794
What a stunning jewel, matches your beauty.

561
00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:07,034
A token from King Matthias
for my army's many victories.

562
00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:14,074
- Must be exhausting to deal with war.
- Indeed. And it is costing me a fortune.

563
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:20,491
It is a shame that a beautiful woman
has to worry about such matters.

564
00:56:20,653 --> 00:56:24,692
After all, it is said that the Queen
of England lost her looks just...

565
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:28,926
..because of her war with Spain.

566
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:36,930
- Do you care for me?
- No.

567
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:41,576
You are not beautiful enough.
Your features are almost like those of a Turk.

568
00:56:42,054 --> 00:56:45,416
Oh, unlike Istvan?

569
00:56:45,514 --> 00:56:51,191
- Do not say his name.
- Would you like me to kill him for you?

570
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,913
- Is he back?
- He is visiting Vienna, with his wife.

571
00:56:55,631 --> 00:57:00,083
So, should I, be his death?

572
00:57:01,314 --> 00:57:03,329
No.

573
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:33,302
- What are you looking for?
- I thought the Countess has sent you away?

574
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:38,070
I come her at night to watch over her.
Make sure no harm is done to her.

575
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:43,770
- You are a rat. I know who sends you.
- I am just here to please the Countess.

576
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:49,066
No, you are here to flatter
her worst side - her cruelty.

577
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:51,403
You are quite a beauty.

578
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:56,874
I did not know witches could
have such pretty features.

579
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:01,537
- Do not touch me with your poisonous hands!
- Not poisonous, soft and loving.

580
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,375
If you come back, you will die.

581
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,816
I will die? How would I die?

582
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,923
Will you ask Satan for his gracious help?

583
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:14,043
Countess Bathory is the one who keeps you
from being burn at the stake.

584
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:18,401
But now it's clear that she is more fond of me
than she's of you, so

585
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,706
Let us see who dies first.

586
00:58:43,777 --> 00:58:48,532
<i>Seasons passed
and Erzebet spent less and less time at court.</i>

587
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:53,327
<i>She would visit Vienna only to see her children.</i>

588
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,396
<i>She claimed that she was busy with the war, </i>

589
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:58,639
<i>but slowly the rumor spread
that she stayed at Cachtice.</i>

590
00:58:58,674 --> 00:59:02,371
<i>Because her evil practices.</i>

591
00:59:02,537 --> 00:59:06,735
<i>Witnesses later claimed that the dead girls
were left in the wood around the castle.</i>

592
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:10,886
<i>And most of the bodies were never found.</i>

593
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:27,295
<i>Erzebet allegedly kept percise record of every murder.</i>

594
00:59:27,456 --> 00:59:31,495
<i>Her journals were presented main proof
against her at the trial.</i>

595
00:59:31,656 --> 00:59:36,411
<i>Even though she denied ever
having written them.</i>

596
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:40,649
<i>My Lord, perhaps what I am doing is wrong.</i>

597
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:43,398
<i>The blood has been giving
me rashes of late.</i>

598
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:46,929
<i>Maybe peasant blood is too rough for my skin.</i>

599
00:59:46,964 --> 00:59:50,894
Darvulia has called for you. She is very ill.

600
00:59:51,056 --> 00:59:54,898
Poisoned by her own venom no doubt.
I do not wish to see her.

601
01:00:02,502 --> 01:00:04,597
Many girls have gone.

602
01:00:04,598 --> 01:00:08,069
I found a body last year in the forest,
no blood left in her.

603
01:00:08,462 --> 01:00:10,087
There are demons in there.

604
01:00:10,088 --> 01:00:12,035
Maybe it's Bathory herself.

605
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:13,036
You have to do something.

606
01:00:15,262 --> 01:00:18,540
Be sure you give it to the king himself.

607
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:57,507
My lord, the demons are here.

608
01:01:00,397 --> 01:01:02,708
How can you let this happen, my lord?

609
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:07,199
I gave you so much.

610
01:01:14,779 --> 01:01:18,931
He betrayed the Countess.
The King must not be informed.

611
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:22,808
Stop that messenger, Janos. Hurry.

612
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:02,179
Count Vizakna left early,
and one of you journals is missing.

613
01:04:02,348 --> 01:04:04,784
He will not come back
now that he knows.

614
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:07,147
We should send someone out to kill that villain.

615
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:11,096
It would be wise.

616
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:17,298
I came to tell you Darvulia has died.
She left a letter to you.

617
01:04:17,468 --> 01:04:24,067
<i>My love, do not let another stranger
into your castle.</i>

618
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:28,665
<i>You have given them the weapons
to destroy everything you have built.</i>

619
01:04:28,828 --> 01:04:34,619
<i>I shall miss only one thing from your world
which is no longer mine.</i>

620
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,178
<i>Your soft kisses.</i>

621
01:04:38,348 --> 01:04:42,182
<i>I have loved you always.</i>

622
01:04:42,348 --> 01:04:45,385
<i>Erzebet, you have gone too far.</i>

623
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,251
<i>Everything that is alive must die,
and you will too.</i>

624
01:04:49,698 --> 01:04:50,698
<i>No matter what you do.</i>

625
01:04:51,994 --> 01:04:57,626
<i>There is beauty in letting 
time do its duty.</i>

626
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:18,628
I wish to leave for Vienna to visit my children.

627
01:05:38,516 --> 01:05:42,145
<i>You killed our priest, you demon.</i>

628
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:45,513
Back to Cachtice!

629
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,464
Make sure the general gets it soon.

630
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:53,208
We need soldiers to protect us.

631
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:55,867
An angry crowd can be more vicious 
than a pack of wolves.

632
01:06:18,237 --> 01:06:21,468
Where is Janos? 
He has been gone for weeks.

633
01:06:21,637 --> 01:06:25,232
You sent him to get 
girls from far away.

634
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:28,594
Give me a mirror.

635
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:48,012
The blood is making me sick
but without it I am dying.

636
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:53,410
Bring me a virgin. Even a boy.

637
01:06:53,577 --> 01:07:00,096
No, no boys. God created them in His image.

638
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,783
Countess.

639
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,345
This is the the only girl we could fine.

640
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:55,836
She is not too healthy, but she is a virgin.

641
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:09,063
- How old are you, my sweet?
- Twelve, I think.

642
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:15,385
- You do not know?
- I was found, Countess.

643
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:21,194
- So you have no family?
- No.

644
01:08:21,256 --> 01:08:24,910
They feed me when I clean up the pig sty.

645
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:27,644
Come.

646
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:32,526
Pola, I remember you.

647
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:34,687
Come.

648
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:39,809
I wish to tell you something.

649
01:08:39,976 --> 01:08:44,015
Pola, run away. Run, leave this castle.

650
01:08:44,176 --> 01:08:47,168
Run, or I will kill you.

651
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:49,531
Pola!

652
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:35,798
<i>After my father's death, I found records of...</i>

653
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:38,631
<i>...large sums of money sent to Dominic Vizakna.</i>

654
01:09:38,882 --> 01:09:42,141
<i>As well as a letter
mentioning women of lower nobility who...</i>

655
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:44,211
..disappeared around that time.

656
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:57,327
- Who are you?
- I am Kasia from Rosenheim.

657
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:59,680
My parents find you and punish you for this.

658
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:02,764
- How old are you?
- 15.

659
01:10:03,063 --> 01:10:06,439
- Are you a virgin?
- Yes, of course.

660
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:11,729
And you?

661
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:17,760
I'm 22 and I am married.
I am the Baroness von Kraj.

662
01:10:19,562 --> 01:10:22,459
Janos, I kill you.

663
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,452
You have brought a married woman.
She is of no use to me.

664
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:27,674
And her husband will be looking for her.

665
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:30,257
I would like to know
why we have been brought here by force?

666
01:10:30,258 --> 01:10:32,674
I will punish the traitor myself
who got us into this.

667
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:37,160
- Did you say "Kraj"?
- Yes.

668
01:10:44,762 --> 01:10:48,835
Kraj, how lovely to meet you.

669
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:53,792
You are right. My husband will be looking for me.

670
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,381
Not if I have a letter of farewell brought to him,

671
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:59,122
confessing you run away with your lover.

672
01:10:59,562 --> 01:11:02,634
Istvan Thurzo, is it not?

673
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:08,195
You are mad. I have not seen Istvan in years.

674
01:11:10,928 --> 01:11:12,592
But I remember a rumor...

675
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:16,940
about an illustrious countess,
who has fallen madly in love with him.

676
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:23,205
And gave herself to him so easily.

677
01:11:25,008 --> 01:11:29,126
Could you possibly be Erzebet?

678
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,639
Collect the blood before it is wasted.

679
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:49,400
It was no manners to pull us out of bed
in the middle of the night.

680
01:11:49,564 --> 01:11:54,433
I did not want to wait too long because...

681
01:11:55,884 --> 01:11:58,637
..of the smell.

682
01:11:58,804 --> 01:12:04,835
We are not sure how many have perished this way.
Maybe hundreds over the past years.

683
01:12:06,866 --> 01:12:10,017
Not a drop of blood left in the poor girls.

684
01:12:10,186 --> 01:12:15,579
Your mother has been using her hospital
to justify the numerous deaths.

685
01:12:15,746 --> 01:12:22,902
- I wish to visit my mother and see for myself.
- This is just one of many.

686
01:12:23,066 --> 01:12:27,537
Would you wish to see more?
Most of them are in much poorer shape.

687
01:12:27,706 --> 01:12:31,585
- I am not going.
- But you are a man, you must.

688
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:36,275
- I am not going either.
- Well I'm not going alone.

689
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,936
Your Majesty...

690
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,208
There are reports that girls have been...

691
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:58,274
..disappearing near Countess Bathory's castle
for a few years.

692
01:12:58,309 --> 01:13:03,732
Many peasants have come all the way to Vienna
claiming that hundreds have died.

693
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:07,336
The girls were tortured before their death.

694
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,971
- I see nothing wrong in that.
- And bled to death.

695
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,895
Many are claiming Countess Bathory is assisted
by witches and blood-thirsty demons.

696
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,338
Witches and Demons?
The Countess Bathory involved in witchcraft?

697
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,254
Possibly.

698
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:31,734
Her strength always seemed unnatural.
Her army mysteriously invincible.

699
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:36,371
Probably driven by some spell? It's fascinating.

700
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,794
A priest was found dead as well.

701
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:42,115
If the Countess is proven to be guilty of using witchery,

702
01:13:43,913 --> 01:13:49,033
You will be cleared of debts to her
and can seize her estate.

703
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:54,028
Sign this and I shall send the men
to investigate murders in Cathtice.

704
01:13:55,913 --> 01:14:01,067
Every month, I signed dozens of death warrants
for those witches.

705
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:04,955
And it becomes worse than the plague. 
When will it stop?

706
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:06,482
When men become wise.

707
01:14:06,553 --> 01:14:10,102
Which will not be soon.

708
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:27,123
The King has heard of the murders
and suspects Bathory of witchcraft.

709
01:14:29,062 --> 01:14:30,577
We must send our men today.

710
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:34,166
Her children signed the agreement.

711
01:14:35,382 --> 01:14:37,863
They are eager to get their share.

712
01:14:38,731 --> 01:14:42,201
The Harpy will be charged with murder.

713
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:46,967
I assured her children that witchcraft
would not be mentioned at her trial.

714
01:14:47,131 --> 01:14:50,521
So her estate can not be seized 
by the King.

715
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:54,684
It will allow her to bequeath her possessions
to whomever she wishes.

716
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:59,322
The king was going to hear of her 
doings soon enough

717
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:02,608
and her children would have been 
completely destitute.

718
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:05,946
She has little choice but sign this...

719
01:15:06,678 --> 01:15:08,557
..in order to protect her children.

720
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:12,471
The agreement entitles you to take over her land...

721
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:16,638
..and the extrordinary army she and her husband
have raised over the years.

722
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:22,110
I see you have doubts. But the truth is
that hundreds of young women have died.

723
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:27,139
Peasant girls first, but noble women have
vanished now also right near her land.

724
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:31,826
- You used to know one of them.
- Yes. But why send me?

725
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:36,302
As I recalled, you were once quite close
to Countess Bethory.

726
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:40,145
As I recalled, you were not very pleased about it.

727
01:15:42,036 --> 01:15:46,552
- Why not send him?
- She would kill me.

728
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:51,426
I believe you are the one
to take care of this matter, my son.

729
01:15:51,596 --> 01:15:55,475
And she is very cautious.
It is easier for you to approach her.

730
01:15:55,636 --> 01:16:00,232
- Can I say no?
- No.

731
01:16:00,396 --> 01:16:03,187
You saw some of the girls
I found near her castle.

732
01:16:03,681 --> 01:16:06,618
My body still bears 
the scars of her lunacy.

733
01:16:06,756 --> 01:16:09,145
- Would you care to see?
- No.

734
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:12,786
She is a murderess.

735
01:16:13,876 --> 01:16:19,109
I want everything taken care of
before the King can get to Cachtice.

736
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:21,874
This is for you my son.

737
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:25,686
After this, you will be
the most powerful man in the Kingdom.

738
01:16:26,556 --> 01:16:30,151
- After you.
- Of course.

739
01:16:40,705 --> 01:16:43,094
We are leaving today.

740
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,800
Do not feel remorseful.

741
01:16:53,062 --> 01:16:56,239
She begged me to kill you, 
not so long ago.

742
01:16:57,665 --> 01:17:02,375
- Why did you not?
- She did not offer to pay me.

743
01:17:04,785 --> 01:17:07,024
It is strange to think that the hand that...

744
01:17:07,025 --> 01:17:09,456
..once stroke her will soon strike her.

745
01:17:10,305 --> 01:17:14,093
I will only strike her if she is guilty.

746
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:21,899
You know which sin is worst? 
Murder or greed?

747
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:27,279
We will soon find out.

748
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,749
In hell.

749
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,792
Beware of her. She is mad.

750
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,953
And she will try to kill you.

751
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,911
Stop!

752
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,952
Dismount.

753
01:17:53,832 --> 01:17:58,348
I wish to see her doings with my own eyes
before we arrest her.

754
01:17:58,512 --> 01:18:00,420
They will stay here until we send for them.

755
01:18:00,487 --> 01:18:04,121
Do not fear, she only has few men protecting her.

756
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:06,784
It is not fear of facing a murderess that upsets me.

757
01:18:07,226 --> 01:18:11,885
The excitement of seeing her again
mixed with the sorrow of losing her forever.

758
01:18:21,472 --> 01:18:25,385
Horsemen, 2 horsemen riding towards us.

759
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:45,441
Dorothea, my white dress. Hurry.

760
01:18:48,488 --> 01:18:51,241
You answered my prayers.

761
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:55,593
Dear Count Thurzo, what a surprise
after all this time.

762
01:18:56,401 --> 01:18:58,350
What has it been? Three years?

763
01:18:58,928 --> 01:19:01,166
- Five.
- How quickly time flies.

764
01:19:02,274 --> 01:19:03,195
Yes.

765
01:19:05,248 --> 01:19:07,842
Let me ask you, how have you been, my lady.

766
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,811
I have been quite busy with this awful war.

767
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:15,645
So, what brings you here?

768
01:19:15,808 --> 01:19:17,948
I was riding to Krakow when...

769
01:19:17,949 --> 01:19:19,982
..my companion pointed out your beautiful castle.

770
01:19:21,029 --> 01:19:25,682
I thought maybe we could stay one night...
or even a bit longer.

771
01:19:27,968 --> 01:19:29,853
I apologize about the flies.

772
01:19:31,888 --> 01:19:34,029
My men left a horse rotting outside the castle...

773
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,102
..and we have not been able
to get rid of them ever since.

774
01:19:41,162 --> 01:19:46,031
- So you're married now?
- I was married for four years.

775
01:19:46,202 --> 01:19:50,161
My wife died one year ago bearing our first child.

776
01:19:50,322 --> 01:19:53,439
It died soon after.

777
01:19:53,602 --> 01:19:56,070
I am so sorry to hear that.

778
01:19:56,242 --> 01:20:00,360
She was the daughter of a 
powerful Danish merchant.

779
01:20:00,522 --> 01:20:03,992
My father needed a new trading allies.

780
01:20:04,162 --> 01:20:08,519
I am truly happy about your visit, Dear Istvan.

781
01:20:08,682 --> 01:20:14,678
I can not tell you how often I've wished
for this day to come.

782
01:20:31,362 --> 01:20:35,640
Why did God have us 
born 20 years apart?

783
01:20:35,802 --> 01:20:41,638
It will not stop me from loving you.

784
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,837
Come to my room.

785
01:20:48,006 --> 01:20:49,992
I have had a long journey.

786
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:54,142
Let me rest first. Then I shall come to you.

787
01:20:55,646 --> 01:20:59,924
I was so afraid you would say no.

788
01:21:00,086 --> 01:21:04,921
Why did you have to break my heart
with that abominable letter?

789
01:21:05,086 --> 01:21:09,716
What did I write in any of my letters
that could have possibly upset you?

790
01:21:09,886 --> 01:21:12,450
The one and only letter 
I received from you...

791
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,887
..confessing your love for
the Baroness von Kraj.

792
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:20,075
Kraj used to be mine but after I met you,
I never saw her again.

793
01:21:20,246 --> 01:21:25,479
And I certaily never sent such a letter.

794
01:21:26,846 --> 01:21:31,317
My father, he must have written it in my name.

795
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:35,638
How could I have doubted you?

796
01:21:41,326 --> 01:21:46,878
I only trusted my valet to deliver
the many letters I wrote to you.

797
01:21:47,046 --> 01:21:50,721
Begging you to forgive me.

798
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:55,482
But I was sent away by force.

799
01:21:58,962 --> 01:22:00,848
Let us be stronger than your father's desperate...

800
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:03,849
attempt to destroy our beautiful love.

801
01:22:04,602 --> 01:22:07,833
It's not too late. Come.

802
01:22:08,002 --> 01:22:10,562
No.

803
01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:13,361
Why not?

804
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:32,070
Your hands are so cold.
Why are you shaking, my love?

805
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,870
It is the joy of seeing you again.

806
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,033
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

807
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:45,273
I almost lost my mind.

808
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:55,553
There is nothing more painful
than feeling betrayed by someone you love so deeply.

809
01:22:57,324 --> 01:23:01,795
I always promised myself to take revenge

810
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:05,513
but when I saw you riding from afar

811
01:23:05,684 --> 01:23:09,962
all my anger vanished, all I felt was love.

812
01:23:30,777 --> 01:23:33,221
<i>No matter how much I cared for her,</i>

813
01:23:33,495 --> 01:23:36,418
<i>another part of me believed
what I've had heard and seen.</i>

814
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:43,488
<i>There was too much evidence, too many witnesses,</i>

815
01:23:43,657 --> 01:23:48,333
<i>for me to believe that she could be innocent.</i>

816
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:03,458
Have you lost your mind?

817
01:24:04,099 --> 01:24:07,753
You're here to find out about the cruel murders,
not to spend the night with her.

818
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:12,756
<i>I'm so fond of her.
I do not believe she could hurt anyone.</i>

819
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:16,956
Do not let that sorrow charm you. She will eat you alive.

820
01:24:17,117 --> 01:24:22,874
Perhaps if her heart had not been broken,
she would have not become who she is.

821
01:24:23,037 --> 01:24:26,035
God made her this way - or the devil more like it.

822
01:24:26,036 --> 01:24:28,503
Her evil was forged this way from birth.

823
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:33,627
- What if I disobeyed my father and escaped.
- You didn't.

824
01:24:33,797 --> 01:24:37,804
So we will never know.
Let us find out who she really is.

825
01:24:37,852 --> 01:24:40,473
Let's find out someting not good...

826
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:56,234
Master, you do not want to see this.

827
01:24:56,396 --> 01:24:59,915
A pile of rotting corpses, dismembered children.

828
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:01,476
Their eyes eaten by worms.

829
01:25:01,676 --> 01:25:06,625
The devil himself could not be more effective.

830
01:25:37,723 --> 01:25:41,511
Countess Bathory, you are under arrest.

831
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:44,857
The accomplices have confessed to all the murders.

832
01:25:44,858 --> 01:25:47,273
The girls were bled to death in the cage.

833
01:25:48,514 --> 01:25:52,198
<i>Erzebet's servants' confessions were made under torture.</i>

834
01:25:52,363 --> 01:25:55,400
<i>The Countess herself was absent for her own trial.</i>

835
01:25:55,563 --> 01:25:58,740
<i>It was decided to hide her uncontainable madness.</i>

836
01:25:58,741 --> 01:25:59,741
<i>And thus to protect her name.</i>

837
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:04,322
Death by strangulation is what the shrews deserve.

838
01:26:04,483 --> 01:26:07,520
As for that creature, decapitation.

839
01:26:07,683 --> 01:26:09,741
He can hear but not speak.

840
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:48,666
<i>Countess Bathory is condemned
to be walled up inside her bedroom for life.</i>

841
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:52,586
<i>A small openning will be left
to provide food and water.</i>

842
01:26:53,351 --> 01:26:57,151
<i>No mirrors will be left in the room
in order to punish the Countess for her vanity.</i>

843
01:26:57,352 --> 01:27:01,256
Many witnesses've testifed to the murders and atrocities...

844
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:04,256
..committed by the Countess and her accomplices.

845
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:10,027
Bodies were found around Cathtice castle.
Some were partially eaten by the Countess.

846
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:14,009
Also found were the journals written
by the Countess Bathory herself...

847
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:16,288
..documenting the murders in detail.

848
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,195
As well as letters from Darvulia,
the witch, heretical books,

849
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,148
and finally the cage she tortured the girls in.

850
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,949
Even if it seems the Countess may not 
have practiced witchcraft,

851
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,132
We do have one witness who has confirmed that...

852
01:27:32,133 --> 01:27:35,669
..he saw her copulating with the devil himself.

853
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,435
All evidence will be destroyed
per the decision of Count Thurzo

854
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:44,853
in order to keep the Countess' name
as untained as possible.

855
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,600
By signing this document, the Countess...

856
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:50,571
..bequeaths all her possessions
to Count Gyorgy Thurzo.

857
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,422
Cachtice will be seeded to her children.

858
01:27:54,637 --> 01:27:58,464
The king is now cleared of any debts
to the Bathory Nadasky family.

859
01:27:59,034 --> 01:28:04,870
Now, if the devil allows you to... sign this.

860
01:28:24,062 --> 01:28:27,501
You have orchestrated this masterfully, I must say.

861
01:28:28,163 --> 01:28:30,302
You have murdered innocent women.

862
01:28:30,302 --> 01:28:33,931
- Hundreds.
- Lies.

863
01:28:34,102 --> 01:28:37,890
How many innocents have been sacrificed
in your pursuit of wealth?

864
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:40,688
Your arguing persistence in denying
the truth only confirms...

865
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:43,216
..that you are now bereft of reason.

866
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:47,933
Unfortunately not. I will go to my grave completely sane.

867
01:28:48,102 --> 01:28:51,573
Your tale merely confirms
that women are mad and vain.

868
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:53,803
And should not be given the right to rule.

869
01:28:54,742 --> 01:28:59,338
Your fable will be keep the populace occupied
for very long time.

870
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:02,470
They will be terrified of the blood-thirsty myth...

871
01:29:02,488 --> 01:29:06,601
..that you made of me, and forget about
the evils that are indeed very real.

872
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:10,078
Oh cousin Erzebet, if it's not for me
you would've been burned at the stake.

873
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,680
My gratitude for sparing me a quick death.

874
01:29:14,423 --> 01:29:19,983
And if it were not for you,
I would have never felt love.

875
01:29:22,303 --> 01:29:25,375
Eternal love.

876
01:29:28,212 --> 01:29:35,368
Is it not strange to think
as I stand here today, sentenced to die alone...

877
01:29:35,532 --> 01:29:40,606
so many lovers are warm at each other's arms.

878
01:29:52,372 --> 01:29:54,647
Proceed.

879
01:30:58,132 --> 01:31:02,364
<i>God, you have abandoned me.</i>

880
01:31:02,532 --> 01:31:04,982
<i>In war hundreds are killed and tortured.</i>

881
01:31:04,983 --> 01:31:07,608
<i>And they are left there to rot
and feed the vultures.</i>

882
01:31:08,292 --> 01:31:11,011
<i>And yet, we glorify our warriors.</i>

883
01:31:11,172 --> 01:31:14,482
<i>We give them laurel wreaths and honors.</i>

884
01:31:14,652 --> 01:31:19,851
<i>But till I get installment.
I can not be humiliated this way.</i>

885
01:31:20,012 --> 01:31:23,084
<i>Give me a illness that will kill me fast.</i>

886
01:31:23,252 --> 01:31:28,770
<i>I can not do it myself. I must go to heaven. Amen.</i>

887
01:31:28,932 --> 01:31:31,323
<i>God perhaps you are trying my faith.</i>

888
01:31:32,134 --> 01:31:35,134
Perhaps you are punishing me
because I loved him more than I loved you.

889
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:39,980
<i>Man has created God in his image,
which gives him dominance over everything else.</i>

890
01:31:40,142 --> 01:31:42,417
<i>Birds, lions, trees and women.</i>

891
01:31:42,582 --> 01:31:46,894
<i>I wish I've been born a man,
I would have killed thousands in battle...</i>

892
01:31:47,062 --> 01:31:52,090
<i>..taken over countries, burned witches.
I would've been a hero.</i>

893
01:31:58,436 --> 01:32:01,951
<i>That is it. You are nothing but a myth.</i>

894
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:04,620
<i>The Greeks created gods for everything...</i>

895
01:32:04,621 --> 01:32:08,398
..because they could not figure out
why the sea, why love, why death.

896
01:32:08,836 --> 01:32:14,149
<i>Now we have created you to appease
and feed our fears and ignorance.</i>

897
01:32:14,316 --> 01:32:19,344
<i>Because we have so many questions and so few answers.</i>

898
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:26,706
<i>I have used you and prayers to forgive myself
for my horrible sins.</i>

899
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:31,791
<i>A proper burial or feeding the wolves
is the same thing.</i>

900
01:32:31,956 --> 01:32:35,665
<i>Holy water is just dirty water.</i>

901
01:32:36,898 --> 01:32:39,014
<i>Why am I so scared to die?</i>

902
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:42,932
<i>Because I do not belive in you
or in the eternity of the soul.</i>

903
01:32:43,098 --> 01:32:48,491
<i>When I die, I shall rot.
And nothing will be left of me.</i>

904
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:52,731
<i>Love is the dagger that stabbed me in the back.</i>

905
01:32:53,352 --> 01:32:58,949
<i>If you are not a myth, absolve me of my sins
and give me blood to keep me young.</i>

906
01:33:02,872 --> 01:33:06,262
<i>I thank you, my Lord.</i>

907
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:38,136
- No coffin?
- It was a very cold winter, there's no wood left.

908
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,691
Sort her legs.

909
01:33:39,691 --> 01:33:41,841
I don't want touch her, she's been dead for weeks.

910
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:47,537
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

911
01:34:06,638 --> 01:34:12,907
<i>History is a tale told by the victors.
And that is what is left of her.</i>

912
01:34:13,078 --> 01:34:16,851
<i>A tale of a mad murderess and a blood-thirsty devil.</i>

913
01:34:16,856 --> 01:34:21,008
<i>Was she really guilty of all the murders? If any?</i>

914
01:34:21,176 --> 01:34:25,567
<i>Or did my father fabricate most of the evidence?</i>

915
01:34:25,736 --> 01:34:29,411
<i>There's nothing in this world you can be certain of.</i>

916
01:34:29,576 --> 01:34:31,125
<i>All I know is whatever she was,</i>

917
01:34:31,126 --> 01:34:33,760
<i>whatever crime she might have been guilty of.</i>

918
01:34:34,096 --> 01:34:38,647
<i>I loved her deeply, and I believe she loved me.</i>

919
01:34:38,816 --> 01:34:41,246
<i>But history does not concern itself with that,</i>

920
01:34:42,272 --> 01:34:44,738
<i>for truth has been sealed behind the brick wall.</i>

921
01:34:44,776 --> 01:34:49,008
<i>And time will soon bury us all.</i>
