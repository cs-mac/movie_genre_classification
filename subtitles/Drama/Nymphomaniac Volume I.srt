2
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,930
Hello?

3
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,640
You've had an accident.

4
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,730
You need an ambulance, I'll call for one. I'll be right back.

5
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,620
Lie still here.

6
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,030
No...

7
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,120
No.

8
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,090
No what?

9
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,050
I don't need an ambulance.

10
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
I can clearly see you do.

11
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,980
I'll call for one.

12
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,250
In that case, I'll be up and gone before you have the time to come back.

13
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,490
I'm hurt.

14
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,510
That's possible...

15
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,750
...but it doesn't matter to me.

16
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,590
I assume you don't want me to call the police, either.

17
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,630
Yes, that's exactly right.

18
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,120
Is there anything you want?

19
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,990
I'd like a cup of tea, some milk.

20
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,860
You have to come with me.

21
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,660
I don't serve tea in the street.

22
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,900
Can you walk?

23
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,020
Yea.

24
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,880
I've even bought a cake.

25
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,980
I'll wash your clothes.

26
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,590
Not my coat.

27
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,240
Smells rather badly.

28
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,830
It's my coat.

29
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,690
It's your coat.

30
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,330
So,what happened?

31
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,780
Where you robbed?

32
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,360
It was my own fault.

33
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,990
I'm just a bad human being.

34
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,750
I've never met a bad human being.

35
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,890
Well, you have now.

36
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,270
Do you want to talk about it?

37
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,940
You wouldn't understand.

38
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,110
Well, try me.

39
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,270
I wouldn't know where to start.

40
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,360
Why is that ridiculous fish hook hanging there?

41
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,450
That's a fly.

42
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,190
I caught a fish with it once, a rather big one...

43
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,190
...strangely enough.

44
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,250
Fly fishing is about tying feathers and other things to a hook...

45
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,760
...so it resembles something the fish likes to eat.

46
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,730
And because the fly is very light, you have to have a line that is heavy.

47
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,250
It creates the velocity when you cast.

48
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,630
You fish a lot?

49
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,450
Well...some.

50
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,400
But I don't catch much.

51
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,840
When I was young, I...I had a book that I...I worshipped.

52
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,710
It was an old book by Izaak Walton called "The Complete Angler".

53
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,890
It was like a romantic nature bible to me.

54
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,450
Maybe I don't know where to start.

55
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:38,280
But if you'll turn to stone heart...I'll have to tell you the whole story...

56
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,410
...and it will be long.

57
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,860
Long....is good.

58
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,750
And moral, I'm afraid.

59
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,370
To begin with the bait...

60
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,710
...I discovered my cunt as a two year old.

61
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,350
At an early age, I was mechanically inclined.

62
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,620
Kinetic energy, for example, has always fascinated me.

63
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,810
And my friend...let's call her "B"...always came up with the ideas.

64
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,980
Playing "frogs" was one of B's classics.

65
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,180
Joe, are you alright?

66
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,120
Just a moment!

67
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,560
Are you done?

68
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,840
For Christ's sakes leave them alone.

69
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,300
I loved my father very much...

70
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,930
...he was a doctor.

71
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,080
My mother's name was Katherine.

72
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,370
My father called her "K".

73
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,680
I suppose she was what you'd call a "cold bitch".

74
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,770
She always had her back turned when she played solitaire.

75
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,170
I hated solitaire.

76
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,760
When we had P.E., I'd climb up into the ropes and hang there for ages...

77
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,720
...with the rope between my legs.

78
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,200
The "sensation" we called it.

79
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,180
I remember very distinctly this word- "sensation".

80
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,450
Perhaps the only difference between me and other people...

81
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,310
...was that I've always demanded more from the sunset.

82
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,050
More spectacular colours...

83
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,450
...when the sun hit the horizon.

84
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,250
That's perhaps my only sin.

85
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,580
What are you insisting that children are sinful?

86
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,630
Not children...

87
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
...me.

88
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,220
I don't see sin anywhere...

89
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,490
...but then I'm not religious.

90
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,740
But that's because you don't know the rest of the story.

91
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,130
And by the way, I'm not religious either.

92
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,990
Why would you take the most unsympathetic aspect of religion such as the concept of "sin"...

93
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,610
...and let it survive beyond religion?

94
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,510
I don't understand the self hatred.

95
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,190
That's what I said...

96
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,950
...you wouldn't understand.

97
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,090
No, I'm...

98
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,520
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

99
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,930
Please continue?

100
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,930
Nervus...

101
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,240
...Pudendus

102
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,550
Nervus.... Dorsalis.... Clitoriius

103
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,960
My dad loved telling me about the trees, and their leaves...

104
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,290
...and considered it part of a good eduction.

105
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,210
When the Ash tree was created...

106
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,380
...it made all the other trees in the forest jealous.

107
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,790
It was the most beautiful tree.

108
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,960
You couldn't say anything bad about it.

109
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,670
Then in the winter...

110
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,650
...when the Ash tree lost all of it's leaves.

111
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,100
All the trees noticed it's black buds...

112
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,780
...and started laughing.

113
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,530
"Oh look"...

114
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,130
..."the Ash tree's had it's fingers in the ashes".

115
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,610
See?

116
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,220
You could always...

117
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,420
...tell the Ash tree in the Winter by the black buds.

118
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,200
He especially loved the childish education stories he told...

119
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,870
...to help me remember what I had learned.

120
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,780
I knew how much he loved telling those stories and sometimes...

121
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,330
...I pretended I had forgotten them.

122
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,090
Am I boring you?

123
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,780
No, no...

124
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,470
..I'm just looking forward to how you may get fishing weaved into your tail.

125
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,330
You could start with the fly on the wall there.

126
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,140
It's called a "nymph".

127
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,350
It would tie in elegantly with your discussion about nymphomania.

128
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,670
The nymph...

129
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,120
...is, um, an early stage...

130
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,060
...in the life of an insect.

131
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,430
I was a quite young nymph.

132
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,420
It was imperative for me to get rid of my virginity.

133
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll play.

134
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,710
I kind of knew this boy "J"...

135
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,820
...who had a moped.

136
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,510
So in my eyes he was rather sophisticated.

137
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,990
I was fifteen...

138
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,930
...and perhaps my girlish, romantic expectations were a bit high.

139
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,760
He had good, strong hands.

140
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,910
I liked his hands.

141
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,480
Hello?

142
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,880
Hi.

143
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:26,810
Hi.

144
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,090
If I asked you to take my virginity, would that be a problem?

145
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,530
No, I don't see a problem.

146
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,750
So...um...

147
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,120
Where shall I go?

148
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,080
It's the fucking carburetor.

149
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,130
I just can't work it out, can you imagine that?

150
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
It's not very good.

151
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,210
Hmm?

152
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,050
It's not very good.

153
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,260
No, it bloody isn't.

154
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,430
It was the whole bloody idea of having a moped.

155
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,970
You should probably take off your knickers, yea?

156
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,160
He shoved his cock inside me and humped me three times.

157
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,670
Then he turned me over, like a sack of potatoes...

158
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,340
...then he humped me five times in the ass.

159
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,050
I never forgot those two humiliating numbers.

160
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,530
Three and five.

161
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,640
Those are Fibonacci numbers.

162
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,920
Yea, maybe...

163
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,200
In any case, it hurt like hell.

164
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,120
I swore I'd never sleep with anyone again.

165
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,170
But of course, that only lasted a short while.

166
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,780
And now to get back to your fishing...

167
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,630
A couple of years later...

168
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,880
...I was at my friend B's...

169
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,690
...and as always, she had a new idea...

170
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,270
...financed by her younger brother's piggy banks...

171
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,620
...which she regularly emptied.

172
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,000
We put on clothes later known as...

173
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,490
...the "fuck me now" clothes.

174
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,300
The idea was a competition...

175
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:49,060
...we were to go on a train trip.

176
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,430
B said there was no need for tickets.

177
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,660
The one who had fucked the most men when we reached the destination...

178
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,650
...would win the chocolate sweets.

179
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:23,420
<b>♪</b>

180
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,040
...interrupt here?

181
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,060
What you were doing when you walked down that corridor...

182
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,360
...you were reading the river!

183
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:44,900
<b>♪</b>

184
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,560
Most of the large fish
stay sheltered from the current to save energy...

185
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,670
...and to hide from their prey.

186
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,770
Where the fish hides, the mystery entails
a very complicated hierarchy.

187
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,830
The topography decides where the most attractive places are...

188
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,690
...and the biggest fish
chooses the best positions.

189
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,530
Smile and only make eye contact.

190
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,950
If you have to talk to 'em, you have to ask 'em a bunch of
Wh- questions if you want more than a yes or no answer.

191
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,920
Then it'll just happen outside...
you just take them to the lavatory and you have sex with them.

192
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,240
Oh.

193
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,350
What if it's nasty?

194
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,780
Then you just think of the bag of chocolate sweeties!

195
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,180
What...

196
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,610
...what time is it?

197
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:04,880
Ten.

198
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,520
Where...do you come from?

199
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,840
From home.

200
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,080
Who knows where the lavatory is?

201
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,670
Well, if you take a right, you will arrive at a lavatory,
at the end of the corridor.

202
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:50,880
At the same time, it is so cleverly arranged,
that if you take a left turn, you will also arrive at a lavatory,
since at the end of the next corridor, there is also one.

203
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,100
Let me show you where the lavatory is.

204
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,700
It turned out to be shockingly easy.

205
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,340
In no time, B was ahead 5-3...

206
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,580
...and it was exactly right.

207
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,810
Look them in the eye, and smile.

208
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,560
But then suddenly, it stopped.

209
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,780
That's a very clear parallel to fishing in the stream.

210
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,820
As it happens, either none of the fish are feeding...

211
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,330
...or they all feed at the same time. They go into <i>feeding frenzy</i>.

212
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,620
All back.

213
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,810
And then just as suddenly as it started, it stops.

214
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,130
The fish most readily bite at the beginning of a light rain, and I think
that's because they feel safe...

215
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,670
...when they swim in the stream...

216
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,420
...because they can't be seen from above. The water surface is disturbed.

217
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,740
But then it started again.

218
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,850
Although, a bit more slowly

219
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,350
Yea...I think I know how.

220
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,330
Because fly fishing can be done in several phases.

221
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,850
And if the fish stop biting, you move on to phase two.

222
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,660
And in phase two, you not only imitate an insect, but an insect in trouble.

223
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,820
You pull...you pull the line...you tug it...irregularly.

224
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,540
So the fish gets the impression that it's dealing with an injured and easy prey.

225
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,330
And then helplessly, let the fly float down the river, yea?

226
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,770
And then half-heartedly, make a few jumps forward again.

227
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,800
It can be done...it can be done very elegantly.

228
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,640
Are you alright?

229
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,320
It's Betty.

230
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,470
I was just told that she's very ill.

231
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,850
Is Betty a close family member?

232
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,480
You could say that.

233
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,620
She's my dwarf hamster.

234
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,490
Dwarf hamster?

235
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,440
You can't be serious.

236
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,250
Well, what was I to do?

237
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,090
And then, I did have a dwarf hamster when I was young

238
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,120
That you were very close to?

239
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,780
Not at all, a bloody nuisance.

240
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,810
Dwarf hamster? It would've been worse if it were a person.

241
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,120
Don't say that!

242
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,310
I'm extremely fond of my hamster.

243
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,180
Yes, I think that's a rather cynical thing to say about Betty.

244
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,160
Yes, I had made the cage nice and cozy for her when...when I got her.

245
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,970
I bet she liked that.

246
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,230
Betty was excited.

247
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,090
One of nature's most meaningless creatures.

248
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,920
You're aware that the choice of a dwarf hamster
possibly suggests certain sexual connotations?

249
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,180
I can see that now, but it was really not a conscious choice.

250
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,320
Will you show me where the lavatory is?

251
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,780
I...have to blow my nose.

252
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,770
We were running out of subjects, and B was ahead on points....

253
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,800
...which led us to * first-class compartment.

254
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,570
Tickets please!

255
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,690
Thank you.

256
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,820
Ladies?

257
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,940
Tickets?

258
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,000
Wow.

259
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,390
I think I might have lost it.

260
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,490
Perhaps.

261
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,100
Drop yours as well, did ya?

262
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,460
I haven't bought a ticket for your shitty train.

263
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,660
It's so bloody slow,
we should've been at the end of the track a half an hour ago.

264
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,300
Regardless of that ladies, you still need a ticket, sweetheart.

265
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,590
Eight pounds each, please.

266
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,610
Oop!

267
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,910
I accidentally tore it up!
You can't expect me to pay for scraps of paper.

268
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,980
Have another one.

269
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,310
Oh, great Idea..oh, that one's disappeared, too! Huh!

270
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,700
Don't worry, we'll just the police to collect the payment
at the next station, how about that?

271
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Now, let's just take it easy there, shall we?

272
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,860
Apparently the young ladies have left without any money.
If it's ok with you, I'd like to pay for their tickets.

273
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,790
No, sir, it's not. Just leave your money where it is,
we'll have the police deal with these two.

274
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,320
Actually, we did have sort of an agreement that I was to pay, I just forgot about it.

275
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,100
I see.

276
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,200
Two first class tickets,
for two first class ladies.

277
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,770
Enjoy the rest of your journey.

278
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,780
Tickets please!

279
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,960
Now that you've been so nice to us...

280
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,500
...we'd like to be nice to you, too.

281
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,620
Oh, that's very kind of you
but there's no need to.

282
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,540
I mean that.

283
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,430
Well, I already lost anyway.

284
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,890
I'm willing to give you five extra points...

285
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,520
...if you can get that one in there.

286
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,690
I decided, perhaps a bit desperately,
that the only thing standing between me and 
 the bag of chocolate sweets...

287
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,100
...was an unequivocal provocation of this man.

288
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,640
Excellent! An induced take!

289
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,980
When all other attempts fail...

290
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,050
...the dramatic provocation can get an
otherwise completely passive fish to bite.

291
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,470
They will react instinctively to the right provocation...

292
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,020
...which would not be a fly, but, for instance,
a brightly coloured warbler, preferably red.

293
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,760
The very best is one we call <i>the finish weapon</i>...

294
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,430
...the so-called <i>Rappala</i>.

295
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,670
You've bought a gift.

296
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,900
Yes.

297
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,010
It's for my wife.

298
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,450
You travel first class and buy us our tickets...

299
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,710
...why then not buy a decent gift for your wife?

300
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,100
You can see it comes from the station.

301
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,040
Of course I should have......bought her something.....something better, but...

302
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,060
...let's just say I was suddenly in a hurry to get home.

303
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,090
Why would a man like you...

304
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,580
...such an ordinary life, suddenly have to hurry?

305
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,670
It has to do with family.

306
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,730
My wife and I decided that we...

307
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,520
...we miss having children, after all.

308
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,800
And that if we are to have children, it has to be now.

309
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,830
So my wife called yesterday to say that she...

310
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,940
...she started ovulating.

311
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,480
And all signs point to maximum fertility precisely tonight.

312
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,610
You see?

313
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:23,460
And that's why I bought her a gift at the station,
I had to get a ticket home as quickly as possible.

314
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,140
Well, I understand now.

315
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,920
What is it you understand?

316
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,480
Why you didn't have sex with us.

317
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,100
It wasn't because I didn't want to.

318
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,210
Please.

319
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,740
I'm begging you, stop.

320
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,380
It's okay.

321
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,460
No it's not.

322
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,610
You've been as horny as hell...

323
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,990
...but you wouldn't give up your load.

324
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,250
Stop!

325
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,910
Wow!

326
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,930
So oral sex...

327
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,100
...became in the eye of the angler your...

328
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,970
...your <i>finish weapon.</i>

329
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,800
Is that your only comment?

330
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,240
What else...what else do you want me to say?

331
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,280
That I behaved reprehensibly?

332
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,630
That already my actions exemplify that I'm a...
...that I'm a terrible human being.

333
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,060
Um, uh...that's not the way I see it.

334
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:55,240
On the contrary, I...I saw it as a...
...as a very pleasurable and humorous story.

335
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,340
I've consciously used and hurt others...

336
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,730
...for the sake of my own satisfaction.

337
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,360
And what I've told you so far only begins to suggest that.

338
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,880
But when you told the story you were...you were cheerful!

339
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,520
Full of humor!

340
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,680
But the only thing you've done...

341
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,600
...except giving a few people an experience to remember, is that you...

342
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,370
...you relieved us from his load...

343
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,510
...with some...some youthful hubris.

344
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,080
And I read somewhere that...
if you keep the load too long, the sperm will die.

345
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,220
Or worse, degenerate!

346
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,680
Maybe thanks to you, "Mr.S" and his wife now have a
healthy and well-functioning child!

347
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:46,210
I discovered my power as a woman...
...and used it without any concern for others.

348
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,350
That's completely unacceptable.

349
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,540
Oh, my little darling..

350
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,330
Don't you "little darling"" me!

351
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,770
No.

352
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,870
All I wanted to say was that...

353
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,670
...if you have wings, why not fly?

354
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,450
No more stories...

355
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,660
...I need to sleep.

356
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,720
No, no!

357
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,950
This is beginning to amuse me.

358
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,240
I don't even know your name.

359
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,400
My name is Joe.

360
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,030
I'm Seligman.

361
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,190
What a fucking ridiculous name.

362
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,240
It's Jewish.

363
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,600
You said you weren't religious.

364
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,830
No, but my great grandfather was.

365
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,260
My parents gave me the name as...sort of...

366
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,050
...sentimental association to Judaism.

367
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,440
But we've always been...

368
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,280
anti-Zionists...

369
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,170
...which is not the same as being antisemitic.

370
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,360
Certain political powers tried to convince us.

371
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,240
"Seligman"...

372
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,900
...means the..."the happy one".

373
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,680
So, are you happy now?

374
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,640
Oh, I suppose I am.

375
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,570
In my own way.

376
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,370
Even if I'm the kind of person who cut the nails of the right hand first.

377
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,000
What does that mean?

378
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:08,440
Well I divide humanity into two groups:
The people who cut the nails on the left hand first and
the people who cut the nails of the right hand first.

379
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,490
My theory is- that the people cut the nails of the left hand first,
they..they...they're more lighthearted.

380
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,910
They have a tendency to enjoy life more....

381
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,570
...because they go straight for the easiest task.

382
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,950
Save the...difficulties for later.

383
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,810
So what do you do?

384
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,830
Always the left hand first.
I don't think there's a choice.

385
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,630
Go for the pleasure first always.

386
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,240
And then once you've done the left hand,
only the right hand remains.

387
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,110
That's the easiest one left.

388
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,360
I never thought of it like that.

389
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,570
My...you're never too old...

390
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,490
...never too old to learn.

391
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,280
That’s a rugelach.

392
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,260
M-hm, yea it's a Jewish cake.

393
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,750
There's that sentimentality again.

394
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,280
Yea, but it's more than rugelach...

395
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,050
...it's a rugelach served with a cake fork.

396
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,120
A rugelach, in my opinion, is pastry,
which there is no excuse for eating with a cake fork.

397
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,080
To serve it with a cake fork is irritatingly unmanly.

398
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,530
Not to say, downright feminine.

399
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,330
However, it can bring us further with the story.

400
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,950
I also knew someone...

401
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,080
...who consumed rugelach...

402
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,200
...everyday...

403
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,850
...almost ritually...

404
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,180
...with a cake fork.

405
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,470
And although we'll be jumping a bit in time...

406
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,390
I have to tell you about Jerôme.

407
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:10,410
As far as I can see, the next chapter doesn't contain as direct an accusation
against my person as the rest of the story.

408
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:19,540
The chapter will also make a sentimental soul like you happy
as it contains observations on the subject of love.

409
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,550
Can I tell you something?

410
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,110
Sure.

411
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,360
Sure.

412
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,040
Yea.

413
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,250
Yea, sure.

414
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,080
It might not be important to you...
... but it is to me.

415
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,540
...but it is to me.

416
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,130
I've never had an orgasm before.

417
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,950
Really?

418
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,340
You're my first one.

419
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,230
You don't know how happy that makes me.

420
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,660
I love you.

421
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,990
You're my first.

422
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,000
Well, I have to admit...

423
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,590
...quite a lot of girls say that.

424
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,750
The train trip had increased my appetite...

425
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,060
...and soon, B and I started a club that we called "The Little Flock".

426
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,090
Mea Vulva Mea Maxima Vulva

427
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,210
B of course took the lead as she was the most daring of us.

428
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,770
She was raised Catholic.
I'm sure you're familiar with the practices of the Catholic Church.

429
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,500
...Mea Maxima Vulva
Mea Vulva Mea Maxima

430
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,780
That's interesting...

431
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,700
Blasphemic, satanic...

432
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,300
...the music.

433
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,810
Interval between B and F.

434
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,040
It's a tritone, the "devil's interval".

435
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,400
It was banned from music in the middle ages.

436
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,830
Well, the "Vacuum Cleaner" invented it.
She took piano lessons.

437
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,700
Vacuum Cleaner?

438
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,800
The Vacuum Cleaner possessed a special talent for floppy cocks.

439
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,780
She had some kind of vacuum in her cunt...

440
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,650
I...I was imagining something like that.

441
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,830
It was about fucking,
and about having the right to be horny.

442
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,130
We masturbated together, that kind of thing.

443
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,930
But it was rebellious.

444
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,780
We weren't allowed to have boyfriends.
No fucking the same guy more than once.

445
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,850
What did you rebel against?

446
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,350
Love.

447
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,050
Love?

448
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,980
We were committed to combat the love-fixated society.

449
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,880
I really believed in our little flock...
but of course that was naïve of me.

450
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,680
Over time...

451
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,500
Even the strongest couldn't stay true to our manifest.

452
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,880
February the 5th:
My third intercourse this week again with Alex.

453
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,600
Third?

454
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,720
Haven't we stated that we'd fuck each guy once?

455
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,170
I don't think...you can understand Alex

456
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:37,910
I don't want to.

457
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,300
Our relationship...

458
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,240
Relationship?

459
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:41,650
There you are.

460
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,640
Do you think
you know everything about sex?

461
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,460
The secret ingredient to sex...
is love.

462
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,940
For me love was just lust
with jealousy added.

463
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,190
Everything else was total nonsense.

464
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,830
For every hundred crimes committed in the name of love...

465
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,840
...only one is committed in the name of sex.

466
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,830
That's quite a statement.

467
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,390
Well, it all strengthened my wish for a serious education.

468
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,860
Glasgow

469
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,780
Aberdeen

470
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,090
Why are you smiling?

471
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,740
Nothing.

472
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,250
Well, I just pictured how an education would be conveyed in your storytelling.

473
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,300
Well, that's nothing to smile about.

474
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,740
Oh, I understand that.

475
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
So what kind of education did you get?

476
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,740
I began studying medicine, like my father.

477
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,160
But it was harder and harder for me to concentrate, so...

478
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,810
I studied less and less, till finally I dropped out.

479
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,260
So instead, I began to look for a job.

480
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:25,700
It turned out it was hard to get a job that paid even halfway decently.

481
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,620
I didn't really know how to do anything.

482
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:36,030
So I didn't have high hopes when I applied
for a position as an assistant at a printing house.

483
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,160
So, could you tell me a little bit more about your background?

484
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,220
Um...

485
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,530
Education-wise.

486
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,430
Oh.

487
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,640
Well, I finished high school...

488
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,500
...and decided to study medicine...

489
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,180
...but I couldn't finish.

490
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,180
I know it sounds really pointless coming here.

491
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,940
Right.

492
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,680
I just...I just really need the job, and I've tried everywhere.

493
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,380
I don't usually give jobs to people just because they need one.

494
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,500
What about secretarial skills?

495
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,140
Do you have any of those?

496
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,810
No, I didn't think you needed skills.

497
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,940
You didn't think you needed skills
for this position as a secretary?

498
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:22,900
No.

499
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,290
Can you open an envelope?

500
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,070
Yes, I...yes I think I can open an envelope.

501
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,260
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

502
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,130
I shall discuss this conversation with Mr. Jerôme, my boss.

503
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,540
Do you think there's a chance?

504
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,710
I don't.

505
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:13,500
Well, apparently...
having absolutely no experience is absolutely fine for this job.

506
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,280
You've got it.

507
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,230
Does that mean I should start tomorrow?

508
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,660
Yea, I suppose it does.

509
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,720
Good morning...right.

510
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,780
Yes?

511
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,910
Good morning, sir.

512
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:41,550
Good morning.

513
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,030
I just wanted wanted to introduce you to
our new junior secretary, Joe.

514
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,080
I believe you wanted to explain her work duties.

515
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,700
Hi.

516
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,940
This is the new junior secretary.

517
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,940
Just tell her to copy.

518
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,350
Yes, of course, sir.

519
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,910
Thank you.

520
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:55,730
Hi.

521
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:00,880
Jerôme!

522
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,370
Your first love.

523
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,390
I bet you didn't think I'd make something of myself, right?

524
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,910
And now here I sit...

525
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,870
Director's chair of M & J Morris, Limited.

526
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,090
Yea, it's quite surprising.

527
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,110
Surprising?

528
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,200
It's a sign from God!

529
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,200
You know, I've thought about you often since then.

530
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,000
Have you thought of me?

531
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,260
Well...

532
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,230
Usually, you know, my uncle sits here.

533
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,050
Mm-hm.

534
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,660
But he's developed a bit of a tummy problem,
so he's at the spa taking long baths.

535
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,270
Drinking lots of water, poor guy.

536
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,780
And no one knows for how long.

537
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,300
So now I'm the J in M & J Morris, Limited.

538
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,620
How about that?

539
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,800
We print cards and envelopes, nonsense like that.

540
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,630
It's a bloody complicated business, you know,
I don't understand a word of it.

541
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,770
Come, I'll show you around.

542
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,260
Yes?

543
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,160
Ladies?

544
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:07,760
Yes, sir.

545
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,820
Oh, look, there you are. Good job.

546
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,460
Every time you do a good job, I say "good job, ladies"

547
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,410
Thank you, sir.

548
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,240
What's her name?

549
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,960
I don't know.

550
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,990
"Good Job Liz".

551
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,890
"Good Job Liz".

552
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,270
"Good Job Liz"!

553
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,190
What's that mean?

554
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,070
Fuck!

555
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:44,530
Prayers.

556
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,820
Why, is there no alarm?

557
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,840
The which?

558
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:50,670
Isn't that...

559
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,500
Alarm, right, this. Good thinking.

560
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,220
Imagine...

561
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,660
...you look just as great all these years later.

562
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,250
Oh, no...

563
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:09,830
No.

564
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,250
No?

565
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,160
No, Jerôme, this won't work.

566
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,070
Which won't work?

567
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:17,590
This.

568
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,280
Why not?

569
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,870
You're not really my type.

570
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,720
That's how it's gonna be?

571
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,340
Yes.

572
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:30,680
Alright.

573
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,400
Fuck's sake.

574
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,220
Okay...

575
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,760
Give me your hand.

576
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,130
Get a fireman's grip...

577
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:07,730
You okay?

578
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,410
Yea!

579
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,720
Why didn't you have sex with him?

580
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,940
I'm not quite sure.

581
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,050
I've shagged lots of idiots.

582
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,130
I suppose he fired you, then.

583
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:21,950
No...

584
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,670
If he had fired me, then he would have lost.

585
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:35,420
As I didn't recall anyone having defined my work duties,
I decided to clean up in order to smooth the waters.

586
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,960
Good morning...

587
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:45,760
Any calls?

588
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,670
No, sir.

589
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,280
What have you done?

590
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,120
Oh, I cleaned up.

591
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,550
You cleaned up?

592
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,380
It was quite messy and...

593
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:01,870
Liz?

594
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:02,970
Yes, sir?

595
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:04,760
She cleaned up.

596
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,820
I know, I..I didn't know, sir. I was away from my desk.

597
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,090
Are you completely mad?

598
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,610
What is a steamed pastry doing here?

599
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,710
I thought I saw you eat...

600
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:21,510
You thought...

601
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,590
Mmm, you're not supposed to think.

602
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,180
I don't pay you to think, do I?

603
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,050
This is a do-over.

604
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,190
A do over?

605
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,700
Right.

606
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,190
Take your time, take it outside, and do it again.

607
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,260
One moment.

608
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,120
Come in.

609
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,660
Would now be a good time for some tea and cake?

610
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,630
Sure, why not.

611
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,040
Where the fuck's my cake fork?

612
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,230
Cake fork?

613
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,100
right.

614
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,190
Well...

615
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,030
I would have got you one but it just...feels inappropriate.

616
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,870
Unmanly.

617
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:33,630
Feminine.

618
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,980
Well, on the other hand, you must say that a cake fork is...
...is a rather practical tool.

619
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,500
It's like a cross between...
a knife and a fork.

620
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:51,570
The point is, that you're supposed to be able to hold the cake dish with one hand,
and then cut it with the other.

621
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,570
And then eat it.

622
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,390
With the fork.

623
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,880
It's not feminine, it's at least bourgeois.

624
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,430
They say that the...the Bolsheviks...

625
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,560
...during their rampage through Russia...

626
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,090
...would separate the men from the boys,
or rather the bourgeoisie from the the proletariat...

627
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,420
...they...they brought a boy.

628
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,300
And before burning down a house, they sent him in...

629
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,410
...to make sure they had cake forks.

630
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,860
That's not true.

631
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,680
I don't have the story first-hand.

632
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,280
Hello.

633
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,280
Hi.
-Hi.

634
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,410
I was wondering if you could help me.

635
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,630
Somebody got very dirty, like this.

636
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,400
See, you put your dirty fingers on there.

637
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,710
Maybe we should wash your hands.

638
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,800
Yup, better...

639
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,090
You must be very talented.

640
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,980
Yea, sure.

641
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,430
If you'd ask Jerôme, he would have said that I was the one who'd declared war.

642
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:12,290
Many times, he'd take me into town,
just so I could hold his coat.

643
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,020
There!

644
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:14,990
Where?

645
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,170
Right over behind the green car.

646
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,940
It's not big enough.

647
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,470
It is, there's plenty of space.

648
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,200
I saw it, it's not enough space.

649
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,400
I'm telling you, there's plenty of space.

650
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:36,430
No.

651
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,870
Can I try?

652
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,170
Can you try?

653
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,180
I'm a wizard at this.

654
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,610
I just tried it, it's not enough space, Joe. You saw me do it...
it's not enough space! Okay?

655
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,350
Can I try?

656
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:54,820
You wanna try?

657
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:58,750
Why not.

658
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,690
It was about this time that a dramatic change
happened inside of me.

659
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:58,180
I could suddenly see...
a kind of order in the mess.

660
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,380
It was all very, very wrong.

661
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:05,300
I wanted to be one of Jerôme's things.

662
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,160
I wanted to be picked up...

663
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,090
...and put down, again and again.

664
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,450
I wanted to be treated by his hands...

665
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,470
...according to some sophisticated principle that I didn't understand.

666
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,650
His strong hands.

667
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,370
Yes, but now it was no longer just about his hands.
It's if everything about him was different...

668
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:37,450
...which, of course, it wasn't, and I knew that in my head.
And I scolded myself for seeing him in this new light.

669
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,770
Love is blind.

670
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,470
No, no, no...it's worse!

671
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,190
Love distorts things.

672
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,550
Or even worse. Love is something you've never asked for.

673
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,760
The erotic was something I asked for,
or even demanded of men.

674
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,840
But this idiotic love...

675
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,910
I felt humiliated by it.

676
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,380
And all the dishonesty that follows.

677
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:11,400
The erotic is about saying "yes".

678
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:16,170
Love appeals to the lowest instincts...

679
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,030
...wrapped up in lies.

680
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,890
How do you say "yes" when you mean "no"
and vice versa?

681
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,950
I'm ashamed of what I became.

682
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,950
But it was beyond my control.

683
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,630
You know what you're doing now.

684
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,400
No, what am I doing?

685
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,870
You're defending your personality.

686
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,210
I thought the point was to reveal it.

687
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:56,140
But this time, I took up walking again.
I walked in the forest.

688
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,080
The forest of my childhood.

689
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,150
I took the same walk, again and again.

690
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,260
Right turn after the gatehouse...

691
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,890
...and right again by the Ash tree...

692
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,950
...which has the most beautiful leaves in the forest.

693
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,780
And further on, past the lady with her poodle.

694
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,740
And the old man on the bench.

695
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:39,300
I couldn't free myself of the image of Jerôme
with his careless elegance.

696
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:49,080
And during this time, when I was with other men...

697
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:52,620
...I forbade them to touch my body with their hands.

698
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:59,830
And soon...
...I stopped having sex altogether.

699
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,500
I tried to meet him one more time.

700
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,070
I found out where he lived...

701
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,750
...but of course, never dared ring their doorbell.

702
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,320
I worked for a long time on a letter...

703
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,540
...in which I told him about my feelings for him.

704
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:26,140
A month would pass before I had built up enough courage
to deliver it.

705
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,390
I'm sorry, isn't this Jerôme's office?

706
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:46,120
I'm happy to say that this never has been,
and never will be Jerôme's office.

707
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,760
My nephew has been standing in for my while I've been unwell.

708
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,900
Was that a letter for him?

709
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,190
Yes.

710
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,350
Give it to me and I will make sure he gets it.

711
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:07,650
Can promise when that might be, as he is long gone.

712
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:14,780
How the young finance their irrepressible desire for travel
is a mystery to me.

713
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,820
So he's gone?

714
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,870
Deserted us, yes.

715
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:23,780
Raving about a trip around the world
and married and all.

716
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,560
Married?

717
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:26,550
Married, yes.

718
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,990
Flown the coop with my secretary.

719
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,160
Liz.

720
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,320
And your job?

721
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,750
It turned out that Jerôme's uncle demanded a bit more
knowledge about the business then.

722
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,750
That was the end of love, then.

723
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,460
Well, maybe not quite as simple.

724
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:01,070
But more about that...later...as they say in the novels.

725
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,850
And Jerôme...just disappeared?

726
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:05,860
Yes.

727
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,100
Though, I tried to keep him, in my own way, mentally...

728
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,940
...as I masturbated on the train amongst other people.

729
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,750
You masturbated on the train? On...on the seat?

730
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,870
Yes, of course.

731
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,230
I did a jigsaw puzzle.

732
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,740
A jigsaw puzzle?

733
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,740
I found details in the other passengers
that reminded me of Jerôme.

734
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:26,880
But in the long run, I couldn't hold on to the details of him,
no matter how hard I tried.

735
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:34,660
Maybe that how it is with memory,
you...you remember silhouettes...essentials.

736
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,690
But tht's not necessarily a bad thing.

737
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,660
Of course a silhouette in the winter,
the trees are difficult to tell apart.

738
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,440
My father wrestled courageously with his flora and tree-type guides.

739
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,030
It's actually...

740
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,340
...the souls of the trees we see in the winter.

741
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,450
In summer, everything is green and ideallic,
but in winter...

742
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,220
...the branches on the trunks, they all stand out.
Look how crooked they all are.

743
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,020
The branches have to carry all the leaves into the sunlight.

744
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,660
Just one long struggle for survival.

745
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,150
My father surprised me by calling the naked trunks
the "souls of the trees".

746
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,670
A poetic thought that was rare for him.

747
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:35,910
'Cause by his own account, he preferred the empirical sciences.

748
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,900
And after Jerôme?

749
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,720
I reacted, um...

750
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,860
...well...let's just say...

751
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,720
...aggressively.

752
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,200
Oh.

753
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,060
-By intensifying my hunt for men.

754
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:01,730
You know these supermarket doors that open and close
by way of some kind of sensor?

755
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:09,140
Now compare these doors to my cunt,
and add an extraordinarily sensitive sensor.

756
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:19,600
My sensitive door opening gave me an opportunity to
develop my morphological studies from leaves to genitals.

757
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:30,810
I embarked on a trip through, what in the lingo of children's books,
one might call...

758
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,480
"The Country of the Big, Bad Cocks".

759
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:39,830
"The Country of the Small, Yellow Cocks", and so on.

760
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:45,620
And most of all, I battled my way through
an untold number of circumsized cocks.

761
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:53,010
And by the way, did you know that if you combine all the foreskin
cut off through history...

762
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,030
...it would reach to Mars and back again?

763
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:17,930
Mrs. H.

764
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,990
By now, I had built up a sizable circle of men...

765
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,610
...and was starting to have trouble remembering who was who.

766
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,530
<i>Hello sweetheart, wanna meet?</i>

767
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:47,210
<i>It's Fischer. I'm laying here, thinking of you and
some of what you said.</i>

768
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,360
<i>I'm not angry at all, if that's what you're thinking.</i>

769
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:55,490
<i>Hi Joe, it's Rob again. I had a really good time seeing you.
Give me...ah...give me a call.</i>

770
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,410
<i>Hi Joe, I left a couple of messages. Is everything alright?</i>

771
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:04,820
I quickly gave up trying to remember
the individual relationships.

772
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,900
It was impossible.

773
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,560
And impossible to predict what they wanted to hear.

774
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,910
So I invented a method.

775
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:19,660
It was all based on chance.

776
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,380
A '1' meant an overly loving answer.

777
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,960
A '2' not quite as passionate, but still positive.

778
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:37,060
And so on up to '5', which was a complete rejection.

779
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:39,570
And '6'- no answer at all.

780
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,640
Hey Eddie, it's me.

781
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,110
Listen, I've given us some more thought,
and I've come to the conclusion that we're done.
Bye.

782
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:02,840
The trick with this method was that
I didn't have to worry about the individual relationships.

783
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:02,920
Hi Patrick, it's Joe.

784
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:10,850
But instead, became completely unpredictable,
which of course, drove the men even wilder.

785
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:18,210
You're quite annoying...so...I don't want to see you anymore.
Please don't call back.

786
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,010
That sounds rather stressful.

787
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,180
Yes, actually it was.

788
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,220
But fortunately, I had my little book of comfort.

789
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,690
When I needed comfort or peace..

790
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,060
...I took out my herbarium...

791
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,700
...and looked at my favourite leaves.

792
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:38,280
Ash...

793
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,140
...Trembling Aspen...and Lime.

794
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,590
When you're dealing with a larger group of lovers, as I was...

795
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,980
...there will typically be a difference in their qualities.

796
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,650
"H" was a sticky bastard.

797
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:03,200
You've got to leave, I've got business to attend.

798
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,820
But he's not coming until 7.

799
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:06,790
No...

800
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,550
...but 7 isn't that far away.

801
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,530
Do you love me?

802
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,950
"A" was to arrive at 7...

803
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:26,840
...and I needed to get "H" out of there.

804
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,310
I love you too much.

805
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:37,710
You keep promising, but I understand now,
that you'll never leave...

806
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,840
...your family for my sake.

807
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,670
It's sad, but...

808
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:47,020
...it's your choice.

809
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,840
It's not satisfying for me that I can't have you completely.

810
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:58,240
Which is why...we can't see each other any longer.

811
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:03,890
Goodbye.

812
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,380
Look...

813
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,430
Have a...nice life.

814
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,080
My darling.

815
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:45,600
I'm yours.

816
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,750
I left her.

817
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,330
-<i>Has he gone inside?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

818
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,560
<i>Is the door closed?</i>

819
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,330
Uh, hello.

820
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:16,890
Hi.

821
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:21,790
Apologize. We...uh...had promised not to come up.

822
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:30,580
We just wanted to...make sure he got here safely
now that he's made the big decision.

823
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,970
May the children...see him inside?

824
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,690
What a nice place.

825
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:57,800
It's...so Bohemian.

826
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,190
Oh, that's right...

827
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,720
...you need the car key.

828
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,270
Uh, no, I don't need the car.

829
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,570
Oh, yes you do.

830
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:10,840
He likes the car.

831
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,400
Here.

832
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:15,980
-Now, please, c'mon, just take it.
-I don't want it.

833
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,920
-Just take it
-I don't want the fucking car!

834
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,240
It's alright...

835
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,570
...we'll get the bus home.

836
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,910
Children might as well get used to public transport now, right?

837
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,690
Of course their...standard of living won't be the same anymore, but...

838
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:43,800
What's this?

839
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,290
It's a present.

840
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:49,680
A pillow...he has embroidered himself.

841
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,140
-And who's it for?
-Daddy

842
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,300
I do hope it's alright if the children call their father "daddy" here.

843
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:07,120
If you prefer, they can...call him..."him"
...or simply..."the man".

844
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:12,250
To be honest, my first thought was never, ever to let either of you see the children, but...

845
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,770
...then I changed my mind.

846
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:19,350
I thought it only right that their father be confronted
by the little people whose lives he has destroyed.

847
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,910
Give Daddy your present.

848
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,540
It's a car little dear had embroidered.

849
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:34,080
I'm aware that not everyone can see it but...

850
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,040
...with the heart, one can see much...

851
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:40,260
...however unimportant that information may be to you.

852
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:46,950
Would it be alright if I showed the children the whoring bed?

853
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:51,410
After all, they also have a stake in this event.

854
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,780
We need to see it!

855
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,910
Right?

856
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,500
<i>Let's go see Daddy's favourite place!</i>

857
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,360
Come on, boys.

858
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:13,090
So this is where it all happened!

859
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,720
You should try to memorize this room.

860
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,890
Especially the bed.

861
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:28,800
It'lll stand you in good stead later in therapy.

862
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:35,040
Here I sit, rambling on about therapy
without a thought of what it might cost.

863
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,060
I do hope you don't think we're here to beg.

864
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,830
I'm sorry...I'm sorry.

865
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,530
I'm being silly, Mommy's being silly.

866
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,200
Let's have a cup of tea.

867
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,550
The children's father likes two lumps of sugar in his tea.

868
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,930
- I'll get it.
- Mm-mm
- No, no, no...please, please, please.

869
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,770
Hello!

870
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,530
Hello?

871
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,310
Yes!

872
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,290
- Uh...
- How nice!

873
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,710
Lovely...boys?

874
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,490
...come here!

875
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,690
This might be interesting!

876
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,220
- My son...yes.
- Yes, hello, hello.

877
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,060
Look him in the eyes.

878
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,530
I'm Andy, hello.

879
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,870
Friend of Joe's then?

880
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,490
Yea.

881
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,660
You known each other long?

882
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:03,030
Um...not that long, no.

883
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,280
Not terribly long?

884
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:04,860
No.

885
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,480
Oh!

886
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,960
A ménage à trois.

887
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,230
It's all so exotic.

888
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:20,820
So...

889
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,610
...broad minded.

890
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,990
On that point...

891
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:28,620
...I failed.

892
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,630
No doubt about it.

893
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:33,960
Boys?

894
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,720
Now is the time to be alert...

895
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,760
...and ask all the questions you hearts desire.

896
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,240
Because...

897
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,720
...I hope...

898
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:51,380
...that you shall never have to encounter such people,
or be in such a situation ever again.

899
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:56,380
Well...hm?
You don't have any questions?

900
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:58,630
No?

901
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,800
Well, I'll start, shall I?

902
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:10,080
Approxamately how many lives...
do you think she has time to destroy in one day?

903
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:11,680
Five?

904
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:13,490
Fifty?

905
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:16,270
Or several hundreds?

906
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,240
Alright.

907
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,180
This is just a big misunderstanding.

908
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,930
Boys...

909
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,630
I don't...I don't love your father.

910
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,560
She's just saying that to make us feel better,
I'm sure you understand that.

911
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,740
Because if it were a joke, I mean...

912
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:44,690
if...

913
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:49,060
...if this were really a joke, it would be a joke so cruel...

914
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,900
...no one can be...that cruel.

915
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:06,490
To destroy a mesh of feelings woven over twenty years
is no...joke...I can assure you.

916
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,030
Well...

917
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:23,950
...if three is a crown, then...
seven must be a bit of a challenge for the pretty miss.

918
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:31,010
I must say, I have a hard time picturing her enjoying lonliness.

919
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,830
I think we'd better grab the chance to get away...

920
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,940
...before things become grotesque.

921
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,970
NO! No, no!

922
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,830
You wouldn't want to give your father a guilty conscience now, would you?

923
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,380
So how did this episode affect your life?

924
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:15,560
Not at all.

925
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:18,950
Not at all?

926
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:20,880
No.

927
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:24,530
You can't make an omlette without breaking a few eggs.

928
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:30,640
Ah, that's true.

929
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,670
Some people...

930
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:41,140
...blame the addict.
Other people...feel sorry for the addict.

931
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:46,320
But I was an addict out of lust, not out of need.

932
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,200
You would say that, wouldn't you.

933
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:54,980
And lust that led to destruction around me...
everywhere I went.

934
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:57,850
Well...

935
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,020
Addiction sometimes leads to an...
absense of empathy.

936
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:09,200
You can't fight a lion and
blow the noses of your children at the same time.

937
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,510
For me, nymphmania was callousness.

938
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,570
You're very stubborn.

939
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,810
But what about yourself?

940
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,900
How did you feel during all this?

941
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:37,670
Did you feel good?

942
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,670
Or did you feel bad?

943
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:49,790
Mrs. H was right about the lonliness.

944
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,730
I'd be lying if I said it hadn't been my constant companion.

945
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,860
So you were with all these men and...still felt alone.

946
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,810
I didn't want to tell you about it...

947
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,160
...but you've led me into a trap.

948
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,740
It was a certain feeling.

949
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:30,210
Oh, how awful everything has to be so trivial.

950
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:42,860
When I was seven, I had to have an operation.

951
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,220
Nothing serious, but it did require anesthesia.

952
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:53,060
I had already been premedicated
I was feeling alright.

953
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,830
But when I looked into the room where the doctors and nurses were preparing for the operation...

954
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:07,160
It was if I had to pass through an impenetrable gate...
all by myself.

955
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,030
It wasn't just that I missed my Mum...

956
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,530
...I don't think I missed my Dad,
even though he was the nice one.

957
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:21,720
It was as if I was completely alone in the universe.

958
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:28,360
As if my whole body was filled with lonliness and tears.

959
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,100
And I'm still not allowed to feel sorry for you?

960
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:58,800
Shall we go on?

961
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,650
What are you reading?

962
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,730
I'm not reading it really, I'm just...

963
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:13,930
...reacquainting myself with Edgar Allen Poe.

964
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:16,090
I don't know him.

965
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,200
Well, he was a...

966
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:23,300
...very anxiety ridden man.

967
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:33,330
He died in the most fearful way you can imagine...

968
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,800
...in something called <i>Delerium Tremens</i>.

969
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,090
It occurs when...a long time abuse of alcohol is followed by...

970
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,860
...by a sudden abstinence.

971
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,360
And your body goes into some kind of hypesensitive shock.

972
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:56,580
You can see the most horrifying hallucinations of...

973
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:04,360
...rats and snakes and cockroaches coming out of the floor and...
worms slithering on the walls.

974
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:13,480
Once the entire nervous system is on high alrert, and you have a constant panic and paranoia...

975
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,890
...and then the circulatory system fails.

976
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,920
But the panic and horror...

977
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,950
...remains...

978
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,340
...until the moment of death.

979
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,600
I know what delirium is.

980
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:52,150
During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the air...

981
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,940
...while the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens...

982
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:02,620
I had been passing alone, on a horseback,
through a singularly dreary tract of country.

983
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,830
And at length found myself...
at the shades of the evening drawn...

984
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:11,550
...within view of the melancholy house...
of Usher.

985
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,730
<i>Hey Dad?</i>

986
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:56,790
Hey, love.

987
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,190
How are you?

988
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,550
I fought with Mum.

989
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,250
She's...she's not coming.

990
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:17,550
You're not allowed to fight with her...
you know K's fear of hospitals.

991
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:25,930
I know she's not coming...we already said everything we needed to say.

992
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,840
K and I said goodbye at home.

993
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,100
I don't want her here at all.

994
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,760
I can't accept that.

995
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,980
I have to.

996
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:45,630
She's a cowardly, stupid bitch!

997
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,680
No she's not.

998
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:50,580
<i>Yea...</i>

999
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,000
No, she's not.

1000
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:52,770
Yes.

1001
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:53,560
No she's not.

1002
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:55,770
Yes, she is. You've never understood that.

1003
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:12,890
Doesn't it scare you?

1004
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,020
No.

1005
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,930
How can you not be afraid?

1006
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,850
I've seen so many die...

1007
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:36,750
And there's the...

1008
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,340
...Epicurus quote about not fearing death...

1009
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,290
"When we are, death has not come...

1010
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:50,590
and when death has come....we are not".

1011
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,020
You know what's going to happen.

1012
01:28:57,430 --> 01:29:00,390
I also know all the drugs the doctors have to offer.

1013
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,710
So, no...

1014
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,870
I am not...I am not afraid.

1015
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,930
<i>My beautiful girl.</i>

1016
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:15,350
<i>Beautiful Dad.</i>

1017
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,290
K!! K!!

1018
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,350
Daddy it's okay...

1019
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:44,400
K?

1020
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,020
Daddy...

1021
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:05,360
It's gonna be okay...

1022
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,690
Don't you want to take a little walk?

1023
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,700
I'll, um, stay with your father in the meantime.

1024
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,430
You'll stay?

1025
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:34,280
You'll stay here?

1026
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:34,710
Yes.

1027
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:19,940
Ash tree leaf.

1028
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,100
Where'd you find them?

1029
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,600
They were in the park!

1030
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,780
Truly is the most beautiful tree in the forest.

1031
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:43,190
Dad...

1032
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:47,410
...how do you recognize it in winter?

1033
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,780
I've told you a hundred times.

1034
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,860
I can't remember.

1035
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,080
When the Ash tree was created...

1036
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,330
...it made all the other trees in the forest jealous...

1037
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,730
...because it was...

1038
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:15,280
...it was the most beautiful tree in the forest.

1039
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,300
It had the strongest wood.

1040
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:26,250
It was the...."World Tree" in Norse mythology.

1041
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,240
And...you couldn't say anything bad about it.

1042
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:37,020
And when all the other trees...

1043
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,560
...saw the Ash tree with it's...

1044
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,810
...black buds...

1045
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,350
...they all started laughing.

1046
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,570
"Oh look...

1047
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:52,100
...the Ash tree has had it's fingers in the ashes".

1048
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,170
Daddy!

1049
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,760
What the hell's wrong?

1050
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,020
Daddy, what's wrong?

1051
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:20,390
Hey, it's me!

1052
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:21,530
It's me, then.

1053
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:23,990
HELP!

1054
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:30,900
Okay.

1055
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,070
It's okay.

1056
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,450
Oh, It's alright sweetheart.

1057
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,230
We have to fit him.

1058
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,150
What are you doing?

1059
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:58,570
What are you doing to me?

1060
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:04,600
JOE!

1061
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:30,760
You should take a break.

1062
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:35,370
Excuse me?

1063
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:39,920
[inaudible]

1064
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,040
Hi, Mister....don't worry

1065
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,760
When he died...

1066
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:43,490
...I had no feelings left.

1067
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:47,010
Well, that's certainly understandable.

1068
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,750
No, I don't know what happened to me.

1069
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,640
It was very shameful.

1070
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,130
Shameful?

1071
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,530
I don't understand.

1072
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,340
I lubricated.

1073
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:49,880
I know you like to present yourself in a negative way,
and that you have this kind of dark bias that you're worse than everyone else...

1074
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:52,520
...but this story doesn't add to that belief.

1075
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:58,290
It's extremely common to react sexually in a crisis.

1076
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,090
It may be shameful to you, but...

1077
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:04,850
In literature, there's many worse examples.

1078
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:35,330
You listen to music, I see...

1079
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:36,640
Yes.

1080
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,830
I like it a lot.

1081
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,360
Shall I find a tape?

1082
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:46,020
No, there's a tape already in the machine...
I'd like to hear that.

1083
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,290
Something I've been listening to a lot lately...

1084
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,780
...though, it's not an entirely complete recording, unfortunately.

1085
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,480
What is it?

1086
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,000
It's Bach.

1087
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,930
From his little...organ book.

1088
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:01,970
<i>Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ.</i>

1089
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,010
The theme is originally a hymn...

1090
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,610
Bach rearranged it and....embellished it a little.

1091
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:15,540
He was the master of polyphony,
if you know what that is.

1092
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:16,380
No.

1093
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:18,140
Yet another thing I don't know.

1094
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:20,220
Polyphony is um...

1095
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:24,080
...from the middle ages, it's an entirely European phenomenon.

1096
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:27,450
It's distinguished by...by the idea that...

1097
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:31,130
...every voice...is it's own melody.

1098
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:34,750
But...together in harmony.

1099
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:40,410
Bach's forerunner, Palestrina, he...he wrote many works...

1100
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,930
...for several choirs at the same time...

1101
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:45,050
...wallowing in...Polyphony.

1102
01:40:55,710 --> 01:41:00,600
And in my eyes, Bach perfected the melodic expression in the harmony.

1103
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,480
And also, also mixed up with some...

1104
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:08,150
...incomprehensible mistique regarding numbers.

1105
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,720
Most likely based on the Fibonacci Sequence.

1106
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:16,920
You know the one that starts with a 0, then comes to 1

1107
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:31,520
The sequence is created by adding the two previous numbers to create the new one,
so 0+1 makes 1 and 1+1 makes 2 and 2+1 makes 3 and 3+2 makes 5 and 5+3 makes 8...

1108
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:32,900
...and 8+5 makes 13.

1109
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:38,510
The sequence has an interesting connection to Pythagoras Theorem and The Golden Section.

1110
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:45,000
It was all about finding out the divine methodology in Art and Architecture.

1111
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,130
A bit like the way he tritoned...

1112
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:51,600
...which as played in your little club was supposed to be a Satanic interval.

1113
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:57,300
The sum of the numeric value represented in Bach's name is 14...

1114
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:00,210
...a number he often used in his compositions.

1115
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:07,590
The clever thing about Bach's name, is that the numeric value of the individual letters...
Are all Fibonacci numbers.

1116
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:13,080
This piece has three voices.

1117
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,650
A bass voice...

1118
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:22,450
The second voice played with the left hand...

1119
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,880
First voice played with the right hand.

1120
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,620
It's called<i> Cantus Firmus</i>.

1121
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:37,050
And together, these three voices create the Polyphony.

1122
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,330
Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as...

1123
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:46,450
...someone who can't get enough...

1124
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:50,260
...and therefore, has sex with many different people.

1125
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:53,940
Well, that of course is true, but if I'm to be honest...

1126
01:42:54,290 --> 01:43:01,160
...the sum of all these different sexual experiences.

1127
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:07,100
So in that way...I have only one lover.

1128
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:17,650
Since the music has three voices, I will limit myself to talking about three lovers.

1129
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:20,820
The bass is easy...

1130
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,270
...that's "F".

1131
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:26,600
F had a red car that he bought used.

1132
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:34,180
As I was having sex with seven or eight men every night at the time...

1133
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,340
...scheduling was tricky.

1134
01:43:36,990 --> 01:43:39,660
And they all had to have precise appointments.

1135
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,070
F was a good man.

1136
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,530
If he was scheduled for 10 o'clock...

1137
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:49,880
...he always showed up around 9 and parked down in the street.

1138
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,480
I always smiled when I saw him.

1139
01:43:54,280 --> 01:44:00,160
Often I took pity on him and gave him a cup 
 of coffee, while I was finishing with the one before.

1140
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:07,850
It's hard to say why I'm choosing to talk about F, but he was reassuring.

1141
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:11,500
And he knew exactly what I wanted when we had sex.

1142
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,580
No, I'd go ever further...

1143
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:19,460
...and say there was a kind of telepathy when we had sex.

1144
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:24,560
Without words, he knew exactly what I wanted...

1145
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:27,970
...where he should touch me, and what he should do.

1146
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:34,170
The most sacred goal for F...was my orgasm.

1147
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:35,750
<i>Quack!</i>

1148
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:37,170
<i>...and then...</i>

1149
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,430
<i>...the swans answered...</i>

1150
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:41,520
<i>...in the same voice.</i>

1151
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:45,710
And granted him privileges none of the others received.

1152
01:44:52,970 --> 01:45:00,480
F was the bass voice...monotone...predictable...and ritualistic.
No doubt about it.

1153
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:04,710
But also, the foundation that is so important...

1154
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:07,830
...even if on it's own, it doesn't mean much.

1155
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,180
"G" was quite different.

1156
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,340
The only one I had to, and wanted to wait for.

1157
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:51,750
When he finally turned up, and I opened the door...

1158
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,030
...he didn't immediately enter...

1159
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,240
...the way a cat doesn't when you let it in...

1160
01:45:57,730 --> 01:45:59,900
...as if, once the door is open...

1161
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:02,060
...it has all the time in the world.

1162
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:11,280
But he was more than a cat.

1163
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,690
He was like some kind of jaguar...or leopard.

1164
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,240
He moved like them...

1165
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,600
...which turned me on to no end.

1166
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,250
He was in charge.

1167
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:35,340
That's the way it was.

1168
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:40,570
Despite my success in managing the complicated logistics in arranging
up to 10 daily sexual satisfactions...

1169
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:43,110
...while also having a full-time job...

1170
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,570
...I was still prone to a certain sadness.

1171
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:49,660
So when my busy life allowed a few breaks...

1172
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:52,060
...I used them to take my walks.

1173
01:47:53,470 --> 01:47:57,550
These repeated walks became a kind of metaphor for my life...

1174
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,880
...monotonous and pointless.

1175
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:06,280
Yes, precisely like the movements of a caged animal.

1176
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,980
Basically, we're all waiting for permission to die.

1177
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,600
No...

1178
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,130
No, no, no, no, there....

1179
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:27,720
There are some completely unrealistic coincidences in your story about Jerôme.

1180
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:32,130
First, by chance he hires you as...

1181
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:33,920
...as an assistant.

1182
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:38,460
And then you take a walk in a forest that is littered with photographs of him,
and not only that...

1183
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:40,200
...he's present!

1184
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:45,410
And then like a God, pulls you up to him through the clouds!

1185
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:47,760
Goodness gracious.

1186
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:57,260
Jerôme was there because he just had a fight with his wife,
who in anger, tore up the photographs they just had developed from their travels.

1187
01:49:57,410 --> 01:50:00,030
Oh.... I don't know if I can believe this.

1188
01:50:00,110 --> 01:50:02,900
Which way do you think you would get the most out of my story...

1189
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:05,570
...by believing in it, or by not believing in it?

1190
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:08,000
No, you're right

1191
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,210
You might have a point with all this.

1192
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:18,100
The secret ingredient to sex...is love.

1193
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:25,360
The third voice is the secret ingredient.

1194
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:50,030
Fill...all my holes.

1195
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:44,900
<i>Fuck!</i>

1196
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:50,850
What's wrong?

1197
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,140
I can't feel anything!

1198
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:56,880
What?

1199
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:58,600
I can't feel anything.

1200
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:02,760
<i>I can't feel anything.</i>

1201
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:08,150
I can't feel anything!

1202
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:32,000
