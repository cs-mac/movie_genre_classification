1
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,455
At the behest of Louis XIV,

2
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:36,761
Joffrey of Peyrac, the Count of Toulouse,
was burnt at the stake for witchcraft,

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,270
Angelique survived.

4
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,603
Hounded by the King's men,

5
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,436
she took refuge in the Cour des Miracles.

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,873
She built up a new fortune,
joining the bourgeoisie.

7
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,848
She finally decided
to win back a place at Court

8
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,221
by marrying her cousin,
Philippe of Plessis-Belliere.

9
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,025
Fascinated by Angelique's beauty,

10
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,255
the King grudgingly gave his blessing.

11
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:09,098
Soon the Flanders War
took his friend from him,

12
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,337
but opened the way to
an otherwise doomed love.

13
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,755
I am dying, Sire.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,297
You are raving.

15
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,602
It's because of the fever.

16
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,464
No, Sire.

17
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,073
Life is leaving my body,

18
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,409
but my wits remain.

19
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,676
- The King loves my wife.
- What?

20
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,110
Yes.

21
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,789
The King of France

22
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,955
wants the only possession
I am unable to relinquish,

23
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,294
my wife.

24
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,929
But, Sire,

25
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,431
I too love Angelique.

26
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,173
And since

27
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:06,111
I cherish my King more than my own life,

28
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:12,681
existence had become
too heavy a burden to bear.

29
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,182
My friend.

30
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,961
I pray Your Majesty will forgive me

31
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,496
for being so brutally forthright.

32
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,361
The only excuse

33
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,469
is my present situation.

34
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:54,330
ANGELIQUE AND THE KING

35
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,693
Don't stiffen up, Monsieur Cantor.
Look at your brother.

36
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,664
- Swim, darling!
- I'm afraid.

37
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,374
Monsieur, the men of our family
are never afraid!

38
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,734
You will uphold that tradition.

39
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,334
Why are you so hard on the boy?

40
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,638
In this day and age,
only the strong survive.

41
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,311
I love my sons too much
to mollycoddle them.

42
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,008
Madame, I find you as splendid as ever.

43
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,007
Desgrez. A man of Court now?

44
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,849
Monsieur of Reynie and myself
are at present lighting up Paris.

45
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,616
A lantern at each crossroads.

46
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,090
Our capital, the City of Light!

47
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,420
- What brings you here?
- The King.

48
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,027
- What does he want?
- You.

49
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,890
A joke?

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,266
The truth! With your mourning over,
he would like to see you at Court.

51
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,562
I refuse!

52
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:19,611
That is rather delicate.
For the King's wishes are our commands.

53
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,039
I shall not go!

54
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,114
I do not wish to see the King.

55
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,149
Twice he took my happiness.

56
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,554
First with Joffrey, and then with Philippe.

57
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,383
It was the war that took
Plessis-Belliere, not the King.

58
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,189
The war didn't kill him,
he let himself be killed.

59
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,825
As you well know.

60
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,128
In that case...

61
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,776
The King has a diplomatic mission for you.

62
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,904
A mission?

63
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,182
Of the highest importance.

64
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,578
Well, he could give it to another.

65
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,476
You will remain here,

66
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,881
and your sons will know
neither glory nor honors.

67
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,526
By their birth they deserve regiments.

68
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,288
Instead of that, they'll be country squires,

69
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,333
wielding swords while wearing clogs!

70
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,000
What is the nature of this mission?

71
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,699
It's enormous!
Economic, political, strategic and military.

72
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,535
It would have been a unique opportunity

73
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,372
to scale with ease
the higher rungs of glory.

74
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,342
- You're mocking me.
- No.

75
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,509
The feat you could accomplish

76
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,781
would eclipse the name
of Madame of Montespan,

77
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,547
the King's favorite.

78
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:45,190
- Explain.
- I cannot. I am but the messenger.

79
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,334
You know what you are, Desgrez?
A corrupter!

80
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,029
Hardly!

81
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,399
So be it! I shall go to Court
and endure the King...

82
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,908
Unless it is he who has to endure me!

83
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,422
- What is it?
- It's Bontemps, Sire.

84
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,819
Enter!

85
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,436
The person is here, Sire.

86
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,701
Louis!

87
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,820
- What's going on?
- Work, Madame. Always work.

88
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,918
Sleep now.

89
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,097
And you, Sire, will you not sleep?

90
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,829
Affairs of state
must come before sleep, Madame.

91
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,955
Sire, I...

92
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,388
Stand up.

93
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,906
The Court has missed you.

94
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,302
The King, too.

95
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,786
Time has changed nothing, Madame.
Quite the contrary,

96
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,984
as regards my feelings for your person.

97
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:57,891
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but Monsieur Desgrez spoke of a mission.

98
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,562
I see that your inflexibility, too,
remains unchanged.

99
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,667
If my character displeases you,
I shall try not to let it show.

100
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,735
It does not displease me.
It amuses and enchants me.

101
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,704
Wounds me, too, on occasion.

102
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,287
The kingdom of Persia.

103
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,820
The Russians have proposed an alliance.

104
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,363
Were this to be ratified,
all Christendom would be in peril.

105
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,998
The Persians must be allied to us,
not to the Muscovites.

106
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,035
Lord above, Sire! What can I do?

107
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,965
See to it that the alliance treaty is signed.

108
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,338
- You wish me to go to Persia?
- No.

109
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,340
His Excellency Bachtiary Bey,
the Shah's Ambassador, is in Paris.

110
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,350
I know nothing of diplomacy.

111
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,348
- We are not of that opinion.
- I don't speak Persian.

112
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,016
Your eyes, your smile, your posture

113
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,254
and even your hair speak Persian.

114
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,292
You will have Saint-Amon as interpreter.

115
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,096
Saint-Amon? He doesn't have all his wits!

116
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,564
But he has his tongue.

117
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,167
Of all my diplomats,
only he speaks Persian.

118
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,078
May I know what exactly
Your Majesty expects of me?

119
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,646
Make the Bey laugh,

120
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,475
tell him of our customs.

121
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,246
In short, tempt him to Versailles.

122
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,782
So far, Saint-Amon's blunders
have kept him away.

123
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,824
Sire, this is a mission
for a courtesan, not a diplomat!

124
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,525
Good God! So much wrath!

125
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,363
I simply thought that
where a mediocre man had failed,

126
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,126
a woman such as yourself
could easily succeed.

127
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,398
What kind of woman is that, Sire?

128
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,467
You do not entrust this mission
to the Marquise of Plessis-Belliere,

129
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,605
but to the widow of the sorcerer of Peyrac!

130
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,305
At times you go too far!

131
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,845
You paint me blacker than I am.

132
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,047
And I shall prove it to you.

133
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,685
Monsieur Colbert!

134
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,365
Yes, Madame, my best minister
sleeps but four hours a night.

135
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,467
Exactly according
to Your Majesty's wishes, Sire.

136
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,368
Thank you, Monsieur Colbert.

137
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,745
The restitution order

138
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,873
for the Hotel de Beautreillis,

139
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:35,044
the property of your first husband,
Joffrey of Peyrac, the Count of Toulouse.

140
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,918
Thank you, Sire.

141
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,958
Will you see the Persian Ambassador?

142
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,438
Will Your Majesty permit me
to think it over?

143
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,805
We feel ready to permit you anything.

144
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,845
Sire, I would not like to think
that you consider this

145
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,745
the price of my acceptance.

146
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,244
Madame!

147
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,481
You are quite impossible.

148
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,518
But, whatever you do, never change.

149
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,038
Men!

150
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,615
Sire, forgive me for intruding,

151
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,155
but I thought Your Majesty should know

152
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,621
that Madame
the Marquise of Montespan is awake.

153
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,827
- Very awake?
- Prodigiously so, Sire.

154
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,498
Bontemps, you are able
to express so much in a single word!

155
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,251
Wait for me here.

156
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,400
It can't be!

157
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,130
Who are you?

158
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,202
- And who are you?
- This is my home.

159
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,650
Who are you?

160
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,356
My name is Savary. I'm an apothecary.

161
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,259
- How did you get in?
- Secretly.

162
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:12,693
After the bailiffs took the Count of Peyrac's
furniture and treasures,

163
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,472
I tidied the place up as best I could,

164
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,536
and moved in.

165
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,968
Why?

166
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,545
I was the humble disciple
of the greatest philosopher ever.

167
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,442
The Count knew about everything, Madame.

168
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,581
- Come.
- The Count knew about everything.

169
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,125
He knew about metals buried
under mountains, Oriental perfumes,

170
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,218
Venetian poisons and medicines unknown
to the Sorbonne.

171
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,763
He was close to the great secret,

172
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,595
the chemical process by means of which

173
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:46,569
man could control a force
capable of overturning the world!

174
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,607
Such a man could not have died
at the stake.

175
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,577
Alas! From the day he was arrested,
I never again saw the Count of Peyrac.

176
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,408
And that?

177
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,545
I lit it, for my work.

178
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,816
Come.

179
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,089
And this?
Whose shirt is this, all stained with blood?

180
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,501
It was your husband's, Madame.

181
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,140
I bought it off the executioner
immediately afterwards.

182
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,476
Tell me he isn't dead! Tell me he's alive!

183
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,379
Madame, you must not entertain
unreasonable hopes.

184
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,683
I was right there.

185
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,382
I saw the flames lick his legs,
reach his chest,

186
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,792
blacken his head and totally consume him.

187
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:14,892
It's you.

188
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,484
Your disappointment
is hard to bear, Madame.

189
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,659
Here already, then?

190
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,789
How did you know to find me here?

191
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:26,028
I know everything.
This can be very tiresome, mind you,

192
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,232
because one then understands
that one knows nothing!

193
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,406
Isn't that true, Monsieur Savary?

194
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,473
You know him?

195
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,110
Yes. Alchemy and the authorities
have never gone together well.

196
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,949
What are you doing here?

197
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,709
He is my host!

198
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,284
In that case...

199
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,519
It will soon be dawn.

200
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,818
At 8:00 this morning,
His Excellency Bachtiary Bey

201
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,419
will be attending an execution in Suresnes.

202
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,398
It would be an opportune moment
to make his acquaintance.

203
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,760
I shall not go.

204
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,437
- But I thought...
- You thought wrong!

205
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,605
I shall leave you, then.

206
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,377
Thank you.

207
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,971
Monsieur Apothecary, known criminal.

208
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,675
Madame of Peyrac and Plessis-Belliere.

209
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,936
He said Bachtiary Bey!

210
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,698
- Bachtiary Bey!
- So?

211
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,330
When I was in the East I heard about him.

212
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,569
He is ambassador and general-in-chief
of the Atlantic.

213
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,305
He never travels
without his amphora of naphtha.

214
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,571
Naphtha?

215
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,776
It's a liquid material

216
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,649
with infernal and magical properties.

217
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,777
Made in Persia?

218
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:55,258
It is not made. It springs unbidden
from the bowels of the earth.

219
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:59,055
Madame, if you could procure
just a little for me,

220
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,294
you would help me to continue
your husband's work.

221
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,433
In that case, I shall go.

222
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,107
A pity! He has already left.

223
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:16,680
When Desgrez leaves quickly,
he never goes very far.

224
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,412
Here he is.

225
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,817
You have changed your mind, Madame?

226
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,559
No. But I shall go all the same.

227
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:06,329
Chief Executioner, His Excellency asks...

228
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:12,934
He would like to know the procedure
for making the suffering last.

229
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,177
- It's over, I hope.
- Yes, yes.

230
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,252
Madame, His Excellency wishes you
to watch the spectacle at his side.

231
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,123
The spectacle?

232
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,787
It is one, alas.

233
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,928
Spectaculum means
"that which draws the attention."

234
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,596
Spectaculum!

235
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,499
Please.

236
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:05,212
As yet, His Excellency has only been
sent women unworthy of his rank.

237
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:09,350
Filthy, repulsive creatures.
He asks whether you are a gift.

238
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,595
His Excellency is... What's the word?

239
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,492
He's mortified, that's it,

240
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,969
at having missed the end of the torture.

241
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,132
How can he now recommend it
to the Shah?

242
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,401
He wishes to see it again.

243
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,574
- The torture?
- Yes.

244
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,473
I have no other prisoner.

245
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,851
- What did he say?
- To take one of his guards.

246
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,281
He's mad!

247
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,916
That word doesn't exist in Persian.

248
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,284
Translate it!

249
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:55,166
His Excellency orders you
to his residence for a light meal.

250
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,707
- He orders me?
- I'm only the translator!

251
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,076
Tell him that I submit.

252
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,578
Please take a seat, Madame.

253
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,012
So Your Excellency speaks French?

254
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,345
I do.

255
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,521
I hope you had fun.

256
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,054
I rarely have fun, Madame.

257
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,186
Was it those filthy trollops

258
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,990
who taught you such elegant French?

259
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,026
No.

260
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:36,368
It was a Jesuit priest
who was my tutor for nearly ten years.

261
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,870
Dead now, alas.

262
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,104
Did you try out a torture on him?

263
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,646
No, I pushed him into the lion's den.

264
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,547
They didn't leave a scrap.

265
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,085
He had thrashed me for a Latin text.

266
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,288
He thought my translation was too free.

267
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,588
I hate receiving blows
which I am unable to return.

268
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,499
As does everyone.

269
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,862
Not women.

270
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,597
You believe that?

271
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,295
I hope so, for their sake.

272
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,068
You are odious!

273
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,870
No man could speak to me thus and live.

274
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,539
I am a woman.

275
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,548
In my country, women are silent,
and hide their faces.

276
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,652
In France, they powder their noses
and men listen to them.

277
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,155
I hoped to find a civilization here.
You're nothing but barbarians!

278
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,489
Who are you? An ambassador?

279
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,786
No.

280
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,656
- A gift from the King?
- No.

281
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,856
Well, then?

282
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,668
I am the Marquise of Plessis-Belliere,

283
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,429
someone particularly interested in naphtha.

284
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,405
Don't tell me you are also versed
in the sciences?

285
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,170
And why not?

286
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:54,117
I begin to see why Monsieur Colbert
says the French are ungovernable.

287
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,485
Yet I shall show you the naphtha.

288
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:28,775
His Excellency Bachtiary Bey,

289
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,585
knowing that I negotiated
the Treaty of the Pyrenees

290
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,315
and therefore the King's marriage,

291
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,054
said to me, "My dear fellow..."

292
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,970
Monsieur Desgrez tells me that,
despite the orders you were given,

293
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,514
you left Madame of Plessis
alone with the Bey!

294
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,814
Yet all the blonde harlots
previously sent to the Bey

295
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,557
ended up as bloody corpses
along the banks of the Seine.

296
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,556
Your idiocy is no new thing, either!

297
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:14,497
On the Treaty of the Pyrenees
your incompetence was limitless!

298
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,162
You are revoked without title or pension!
Get out!

299
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,740
But, Desgrez, in your opinion,
can the Marquise suffer the same fate?

300
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,806
I fear the Bey cannot distinguish
between a French marquise

301
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,409
and a French streetwalker.

302
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,856
But why did he cut their throats?

303
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:43,751
Sire, I am intimately acquainted
with the passions of evildoers,

304
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,955
but not those of Orientals.

305
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,662
Take a hundred horses and bring her back!

306
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,135
Forgive me, but it is impossible
to intervene officially.

307
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,438
Or the Bey will leave for good.

308
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,845
Not like that.

309
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,414
How, then?

310
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,722
In France, Your Excellency,
a woman must be won.

311
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,064
When a man desires a woman,

312
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,398
he must first woo her.

313
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,594
What is that?

314
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,873
It means all the attentions
a man can show a woman,

315
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,513
which produce reciprocal attentions
from the woman to the man.

316
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,085
I prefer my method.

317
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,815
- And what is that?
- Rape.

318
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,161
My dress!

319
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:46,443
You can put on a robe of my country
while we clean yours.

320
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,291
You'd be the most beautiful
woman in my harem.

321
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,961
In that costume you seem closer to me.

322
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,312
- Because of my dress?
- Yes.

323
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,853
- But you ordered her to do it!
- Yes.

324
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,192
Make them stop!

325
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,887
It's only just begun.
She's to receive at least 100 lashes.

326
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,753
- For obeying you?
- Yes.

327
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,821
And if she'd disobeyed?

328
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,561
She would have suffered
a long, painful death.

329
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,664
- So...
- So she had no choice.

330
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,135
The thing that complicates life
for you Europeans is choice.

331
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,439
Stop it now!

332
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,878
I enjoy the sound of the whip
in certain circumstances.

333
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,578
It stirs the senses
and pushes one to one's limits.

334
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,185
Stop it!

335
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,286
You disappoint me.

336
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,957
Happy now?

337
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,532
I have never known such a monster!

338
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,914
What are you doing?

339
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,649
I have eliminated the problem of choice.

340
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,531
I shall give you time to gather your wits.

341
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,933
I shall come back later, and
you will be mine, willing or not.

342
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,953
Call your men
and give the order that I can leave.

343
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,927
My guards won't see me
beaten by a woman.

344
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,399
I'll cut your throat.

345
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:57,794
Death is nothing.

346
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,294
There's the artery.

347
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,333
To the right, a little higher.

348
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,573
One quick movement.

349
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,233
What are you waiting for?

350
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,710
There you are again,
the problem of choice.

351
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,395
Now there's no problem of choice.

352
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,937
Don't kill him!

353
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,209
She's right, gentlemen.

354
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,445
You'll pay with your life!

355
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,323
I can't afford it, it's all I have!

356
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,154
You will not take her!

357
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,490
Let me go!

358
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,895
Let me go, you fool!

359
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,858
Madame, you are saved.

360
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,731
I never asked for your help. Who are you?

361
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,533
Prince Vladimir Stanislas Racoczi.

362
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,131
Prince?

363
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,502
And Count, seventeen times.

364
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,178
I'm entitled to ride my horse into churches
and cathedrals.

365
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,715
Very practical!

366
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,219
Apart from your many titles,

367
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,812
what else do you do?

368
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,386
I hope, Madame.

369
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,584
For what, the moon?

370
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,855
No, for the liberation of Hungary.
I am heir to the throne.

371
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,668
For whom did you abduct me?

372
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,401
For myself.

373
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,470
- When my stepbrother...
- Who is your stepbrother?

374
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,438
Louis XIV, the Sun King!

375
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,205
Really?

376
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,544
When I was in his favor,
I saw you at Versailles.

377
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,443
And your beauty immediately
captured my heart.

378
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,488
- Will you marry me?
- Are you mad?

379
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,586
All Magyar princes are!

380
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,457
My great-uncle, Mathias Zapoli,
Bishop of Budapest,

381
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,058
so feared a flood that he had an ark built!

382
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,404
I called him Uncle Noah!

383
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,734
You're very silly but charming.

384
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,003
Shall we wed, then?

385
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,010
Praise the Lord, you're safe!

386
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,385
The King will be pleased, Prince.

387
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,344
- He's truly a prince?
- Of the purest line.

388
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,314
And you truly abducted me out of love?

389
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,726
It was at my request.

390
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,562
For a large sum of money?

391
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,961
You sabotaged my mission!

392
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,102
I'll see about this!

393
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,176
She was stolen from me
and the King didn't even replace her!

394
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,546
But Your Excellency speaks French!

395
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,842
Spare me the false surprise.

396
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,614
If we deliver the culprit to you,
will your ire be appeased?

397
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,713
No.

398
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,755
But send his head to my ship in Toulon.

399
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,794
Figuratively speaking!

400
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,523
No! His head in a basket.

401
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,825
You shall have it.
But the King awaits you in Versailles.

402
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,629
I beg you on my knees!

403
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,063
- Are you still on your feet?
- I have gout.

404
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,501
Disgusting!

405
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,203
Because of my failure I was revoked.

406
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,338
Your King is very kind.
I'd have had you impaled!

407
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,709
Impaled? But that's abominable!

408
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,187
As the King's brother says,

409
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:22,458
"Impalement begins so nicely
but ends so badly!"

410
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,860
You despicable dog!

411
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,424
What a life!

412
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,155
Your Excellency, no! Listen...

413
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,738
Madame! I cannot believe my eyes.

414
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,301
You saved my life. It is yours.

415
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:42,939
I have no need of it!

416
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,241
Yesterday, I was your prisoner.

417
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,145
I could have succumbed,

418
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,852
but I was abducted
and had to pay a ransom.

419
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,088
You cost me a fortune!

420
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,417
I shall send you a case of rubies.

421
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,089
No amount of jewels
will excuse your conduct.

422
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,628
I have come to tell you, in person,

423
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,023
that you will never see me again.

424
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,090
I wish to see you again.

425
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,568
No Frenchwoman is more beautiful
or unsettling.

426
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,765
Tell me where I can see you again,
be it just once.

427
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:14,273
At Court, Monsieur.
At Court, to which I belong.

428
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,683
Will he come?

429
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:30,919
Of course. He promised me.

430
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,121
He promised Madame of Plessis-Belliere.

431
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,527
I have told His Majesty
and Monsieur Colbert

432
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,794
that you had no hand
in the Bey's coming here.

433
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,090
He has come. Now, Monsieur Desgrez,

434
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:06,955
you'll have to offer him the head
of your friend, Prince Racoczi.

435
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,070
His Majesty the King!

436
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,644
Well done, Madame. And thank you.

437
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,891
My dear, you have to face facts.

438
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,988
This is a glorious day
for Angelique of Plessis-Belliere.

439
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:45,297
You stink, Vardes! Morally, I mean.

440
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,375
The Ambassador of Persia!

441
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,093
Thank you.

442
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,772
I beg Your Majesty to allow me

443
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,536
to introduce His Excellency

444
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:31,273
Zoukim Bachtiary Bey, Prince Kadjar,

445
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,717
Ambassador Extraordinaire of the Shah,

446
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,749
to Your Majesty.

447
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:42,319
Your Excellency... We, King Louis,

448
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,785
bid you welcome to our Court of Versailles.

449
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,132
The Persian's got a few names!

450
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,741
- What are you doing here, Barcarolle?
- I'm your guardian angel.

451
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,093
Your Excellency, bravo!

452
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,632
Although unable to understand
the meaning of your speech,

453
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,734
we had no need of any translation,

454
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,134
so clearly did your voice
express the friendship of the Shah,

455
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,399
your King.

456
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,441
Shall we sign the treaty?

457
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,343
I don't know who likes you most,
the monarch or the cannibal!

458
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:18,788
Your Excellency, we are
most grateful for the diversity

459
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,617
and profusion of your gifts.

460
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,422
We, too, would like
to offer you a personal present,

461
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,128
something to remind you
of France and our friendship.

462
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,757
Sire, I have already chosen.

463
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,062
Impossible, Your Excellency.

464
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,129
Why?

465
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,938
Because the Marquise of Plessis-Belliere

466
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,038
is the King's favorite!

467
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,111
This is very sad news to me.

468
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:28,485
But Your Majesty has chosen
the most beautiful and intelligent.

469
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,786
Indeed, Your Excellency.

470
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,128
Allow me to thank
Madame of Plessis-Belliere.

471
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,562
Your greatness is matched only
by your fairness, Sire.

472
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,701
Madame, you may choose.

473
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,874
Sire, I have already chosen.

474
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,250
What is that? Some exotic perfume?

475
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,647
No, Sire.

476
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,784
It is to science

477
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,122
what the philosopher's stone
was to alchemy.

478
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,095
Madame, you have conquered me.

479
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,724
Henceforth, I shall do whatever you ask.

480
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,772
What do you say to so many victories?

481
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,281
Today I regret but one thing.

482
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,821
That what Monsieur Colbert
said earlier was a lie.

483
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,321
No, no!

484
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,864
Go on, go away!

485
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,904
That nauseous oily taste,
like nothing else...

486
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,212
No doubt about it. This is it!

487
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,618
- Thanks might be in order!
- Thank you.

488
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,745
I risked my life for your nauseous oil.

489
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,346
Very kind of you.

490
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,157
What will you do with it?

491
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,388
Hard to say. I'm not at that stage yet.

492
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,064
I'm only at the point
of formulating hypotheses.

493
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,092
You're nowhere, you mean!

494
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,634
Madame, the nature of things

495
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,863
is full of nowheres!

496
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:22,996
Words!

497
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,605
When the Chinese
discovered black powder,

498
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,337
that too began with words,

499
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,604
but it ended with a huge explosion!

500
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:32,807
Old lunatic!

501
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:25,924
Who's there?

502
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,000
Nobody.

503
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,674
I'm a pariah twice over now.

504
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,377
Because of you,
the Hungarians remain in chains.

505
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,420
Is this any time to wake people up?

506
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,418
And why creep in like a thief?

507
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,848
Your friend Desgrez is hunting me down.

508
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,860
His armed men are at my heels.

509
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,263
For what crime?

510
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,797
I saved your life.

511
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,291
Ridiculous!

512
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,338
Ridiculous? The Bey demanded my head.

513
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,741
And since the King needs the Bey,
and not me,

514
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,105
- he promised it to him.
- Impossible!

515
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,870
- You knew all about it.
- I assure you I didn't.

516
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,409
It's despicable!

517
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,985
Politics is built on spilt blood.

518
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,017
The King is your stepbrother.

519
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:20,920
Families, you know...

520
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,085
No one saw you come?

521
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,218
If you're afraid, I can leave.

522
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,326
I'm afraid for you, idiot!

523
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,157
Sorry.

524
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,700
How can I help you?

525
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,395
Feed me!

526
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:35,896
Turn around.

527
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,774
No. The sight of you is too pleasant.

528
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,470
Turn around or starve. It's your choice.

529
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,405
I love you.

530
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,594
Madame! Madame!

531
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:20,828
How did you get in?

532
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,065
I had to! Desgrez is here, with armed men!

533
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,369
- Go! Quickly!
- Come, come!

534
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,940
I can get you out safely. Quickly, quickly!

535
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,207
Follow me, quickly!

536
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,011
Guard all the exits! Search the garden!

537
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,756
- Madame, there's...
- Never mind!

538
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,058
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

539
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,494
Alone, and sleeping naked?

540
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,687
I have here a warrant for Prince Racoczi.

541
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,590
How low you have stooped!

542
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,056
I'm acting on the King's orders.

543
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:17,752
What a master!

544
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,294
One does not judge the King!

545
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:22,762
Get dressed and come with me.

546
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,397
You are under arrest.

547
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:32,032
My trust in you knew no bounds.

548
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:36,737
I brooked no restrictions on your freedom.

549
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,337
And you behaved like a...

550
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,941
Sire, do not say the word
you are burning to utter.

551
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,815
It is unworthy of you.

552
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,889
- I shall break you!
- I'm not afraid.

553
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,515
You should be! I'm capable of the worst.

554
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,560
Why did you hide the fugitive?

555
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,356
His crime was saving me.

556
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,158
- Your lover...
- I am free!

557
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,927
- You are not!
- Because you want me?

558
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:01,002
Desist from speaking to me
like a common person!

559
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:04,502
Call me Sire and Your Majesty,
like everyone.

560
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,433
Have you forgotten the proper way
to address one's King?

561
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:12,445
Plessis-Belliere's reign
only lasted as long as the roses.

562
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,015
Both so sweet-smelling!

563
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,148
Whereas you are like a carp.

564
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,955
You live a long time
but end up covered in moss.

565
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,749
Beware! I am able to control my wrath,

566
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:27,653
but in this instance I have just cause.

567
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,092
I am not cut out
for the hard job of royal mistress.

568
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,431
Such scathing words!

569
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,540
It broke Mademoiselle of Valliere.

570
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:42,511
And I don't have
Madame of Montespan's thick skin.

571
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,248
I beg you, Sire. Stay faithful to her.

572
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,017
And tempt me no more.

573
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,157
You are tempted, then?

574
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,086
What woman would not be?

575
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,324
His Majesty the King!

576
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:13,340
Those desirous of seeing
Le Notre's gardens,

577
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:17,342
in the company of our friend
the Marechale of Plessis-Belliere,

578
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,838
follow us.

579
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,883
Friend!

580
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,193
Don't take the King from me!

581
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,399
Such is not my intention.

582
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,201
I love him!

583
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,899
Love is not unknown to me.

584
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,267
Leave the Court!

585
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,602
The King would not permit it.

586
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,606
Play for me.

587
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,555
Your move, Athenais.

588
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,217
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

589
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:19,097
It is time to leave, if you wish
to be in Saint-Germain before nightfall.

590
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,127
You are right, my friend.

591
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:24,004
I shall join you later.

592
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,143
Come, Athenais!

593
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,307
As first lady of the Queen's household,

594
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,782
see that she reaches Saint-Germain safely.

595
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:39,715
No, Madame! No anger, no ire, no bleating!

596
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:44,882
Please.

597
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,921
So, have you ruined me?

598
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,364
The Marquise has enriched
the French Crown by 1,000 pistoles!

599
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,366
That must be rewarded.

600
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:00,240
Bring a stool
for Madame of Plessis-Belliere.

601
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,621
What do you think of this champagne?

602
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,290
One could soon get used to it, Sire.

603
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:23,590
If a select number of people
were to sleep at Versailles tonight,

604
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,293
would you join them?

605
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,630
I adore Versailles, Sire.

606
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,697
And the King?

607
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,268
But, Sire, without the King,
there would be no Versailles.

608
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,409
Saint-Fal, there you are!

609
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,927
For the Marquis of Vardes.

610
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,394
For the Marquise of Plessis-Belliere.

611
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:59,394
A great privilege! The King is spoiling you.

612
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,937
And he is corrupting you!

613
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,099
Such a mordant wit!

614
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,582
- Who is it?
- It is I.

615
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:26,452
Enter.

616
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:41,034
A word of advice.
Put your dress back on and go home.

617
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,779
The King desired my presence.

618
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,008
It is that desire which worries me.

619
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:52,176
There is a new fashion from Italy
which has reached the Court.

620
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:56,414
It consists of putting poison
in the soup of the husband,

621
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,322
the lover, the rival,

622
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,189
or the mistress.

623
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,063
Everything is poisoned.

624
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:08,259
Drinks, sorbets, but also clothes, gloves,

625
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,931
handkerchiefs, nightgowns.

626
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,597
Who would want to kill me?

627
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,506
Only the stupid or the ugly
have no one to envy them.

628
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:24,683
I was in the kitchen when
tonight's meal was being prepared.

629
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:30,657
There was a sorbet for each guest.
As it is my job to be curious,

630
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,993
I inadvertently knocked over your sorbet.

631
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,534
The dog ate it and died in five minutes.

632
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,097
It would have taken you two days.

633
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:49,173
- So, will you leave now?
- No.

634
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:23,803
Who is it?

635
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,280
Bontemps, Madame.

636
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,481
Please forgive this nocturnal intrusion,

637
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:34,252
but His Majesty wishes
to see Your Ladyship.

638
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,957
A moment, please.

639
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,945
- You still love the Hungarian?
- No, Sire.

640
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,585
By agreeing to sleep here,

641
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,015
you agreed to spend the night with me.

642
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:22,392
So what is it?

643
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,797
Joffrey of Peyrac, my husband,

644
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,036
whom you had burnt at the stake
after a mockery of a trial.

645
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,501
I had no choice.

646
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,772
There can be no honorable motive
for murdering an innocent man.

647
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,142
To me, a man counts for little.

648
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,411
The King consumed him.

649
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,653
I became King when I was five.

650
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,450
When Mazarin died,
my power was uncertain.

651
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,456
A poor country,

652
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,757
with neither army nor navy. Nothing!

653
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,126
Except for a nobility
with La Fronde on their minds.

654
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,367
I had to win or die!

655
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,901
Peyrac was richer than I,

656
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,307
forming a state within the state.

657
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,108
I had to bring him down.

658
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,976
I would do it all again.

659
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,950
If I had to sacrifice a member
of my family for my realm,

660
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:16,745
I would do so.

661
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,814
You are all alone, Sire.

662
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,315
I am the King.

663
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,991
You took Peyrac's honor and fortune.

664
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,392
Did you have to take his life, too?

665
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,058
He did not die at the stake.

666
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,630
- What?
- It's true.

667
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,035
It wasn't your husband's body,

668
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,310
but that of another condemned man.

669
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,718
Before being taken to the stake
he was led into the inn,

670
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,195
on the pretext of taking a last drink.

671
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,828
A final pleasure
offered to the condemned man.

672
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,201
The swap was done,

673
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,804
and Peyrac was taken
through tunnels to the Seine.

674
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,241
Trustworthy soldiers

675
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,209
put him on board a boat,

676
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,686
headed downstream, out of Paris.

677
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,916
I gave Peyrac back his life,

678
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,993
but not his freedom.

679
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,819
When he realized
he was being taken into captivity,

680
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:39,094
he took advantage
of a momentary lack of attention

681
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,101
to attempt to flee.

682
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,413
Joffrey, alive! He is free!

683
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,309
No.

684
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,944
The strong currents carried him away.

685
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,391
His body was found
and identified the next day.

686
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,590
I don't believe you.

687
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,457
The report, alas, left no doubt.

688
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,395
Joffrey would not have escaped
the stake, just to drown.

689
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:18,699
You are strange.

690
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,738
Disloyal to the living,
but faithful to a shade.

691
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:24,874
I'm sure he's alive.

692
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,508
A pipedream, Madame.

693
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:29,943
He is no more.

694
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,379
But I did not kill him.

695
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,688
Sire, this has shaken me.

696
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,387
Allow me to return to Paris.

697
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,888
At this time?

698
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:45,496
There is no special time for hoping.

699
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,097
You lied about that shirt!

700
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,299
I did not.

701
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,933
Joffrey did not burn.

702
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,166
But I saw...

703
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,405
I know! The flames blackened his head

704
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,308
and consumed his whole body.

705
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,077
- It's the truth.
- You're lying!

706
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,476
He was not burnt, the King told me.

707
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,255
But at the stake?

708
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,450
Someone else, as you well knew!

709
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:12,953
No, Madame.

710
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:17,355
The King spirited him away.
Then he came here to change.

711
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,162
Tell me you saw him!

712
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,099
No, Madame.

713
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,000
Wasn't the shirt I bought
off the executioner his?

714
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,675
Where is he?

715
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,608
The King told you he was alive?

716
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:33,972
No.

717
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,313
Then he is dead, Madame.

718
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,988
If you knew any different,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

719
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,790
Of course, Madame.

720
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:42,404
It can't be!

721
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:01,718
Therese!

722
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,238
Madame is home? I thought that...

723
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,278
Undo me.

724
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,524
Hand me my nightgown.

725
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,232
Are you asleep?

726
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,068
Are you ill?

727
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:52,004
My nightgown!

728
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,209
Take it!

729
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:06,818
Speak!

730
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,152
Speak!

731
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,091
Have mercy, Madame!

732
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,370
Will you speak?

733
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,738
- Speak!
- It hurts!

734
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,104
On whose orders were you acting?

735
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,839
Mademoiselle Desoeillet's!

736
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:26,503
Whose?

737
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,613
Mademoiselle Desoeillet's!

738
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,281
What's going on?

739
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,515
- The nightgown?
- Yes.

740
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,592
Don't touch a thing. She's dying.

741
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,128
Do something!

742
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,868
There's nothing to do.

743
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,262
It's a Maltese poison
for which there is no antidote.

744
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,068
I'll use this one.

745
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,634
Madame of Montespan is in there!

746
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,209
We'll share.

747
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,035
Careful with my hair!

748
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,007
You!

749
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,917
- What's that on your thigh?
- A beauty spot.

750
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,482
On the thigh?

751
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:45,718
It is a natural one. The King adores it!

752
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:48,285
He cannot like such a blemish.

753
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:49,689
You're a bitch!

754
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,631
And you are an angel!

755
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,321
Your hand, Madame.

756
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,994
Who is that triton, Sire?

757
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:27,391
- That madman Vardes.
- He'll be killed, Sire!

758
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,470
He's as solid as an oak.

759
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,107
Running water is home

760
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,841
to the bubonic plague!

761
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,416
You see death everywhere.

762
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,513
Because it is everywhere, Sire.

763
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,717
They'll drown!

764
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,520
Save them! Help them!

765
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,293
Never do that again.

766
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,058
Help!

767
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:05,406
Mademoiselle Desoeillet is drowning.

768
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,074
Go on, then, Vardes!

769
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,346
Do you know her?

770
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:20,012
She can't be anyone important.

771
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,616
- Who does she work for?
- No idea.

772
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:26,023
There are thousands
of minor ladies-in-waiting.

773
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,287
Follow her, watch what she does,
and report back to me.

774
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,961
As you wish, Marquise of the Angels.

775
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:55,415
Here's five pistoles.
Take me to the Barriere du Roule.

776
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,992
Jean Pourri.

777
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:45,931
He who sold children
in the Cour des Miracles.

778
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:50,393
- A newborn baby? What for?
- Nothing very pleasant.

779
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,699
The local rogues say it's the devil's house.

780
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:58,241
And the devil in question is a woman.
Voisin is her name.

781
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,241
She's in league

782
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,778
with a fellow with a burnt face.

783
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:06,013
Did they poison my nightgown?

784
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,313
Who could say?

785
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:12,324
All I know is that Desoeillet
came out again with Jean Pourri,

786
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:16,194
Voisin said, "Tomorrow, at midnight."

787
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,637
Midnight is in five hours.

788
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:47,888
Do you know her?

789
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,331
Impossible to say. Let's go.

790
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:59,498
Voisin, it is time.

791
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,400
The devil is with us!

792
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:20,587
Satan, brute force of evil, be with us.

793
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:27,385
Lucifer, superior spirit of evil, be with us.

794
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,463
Repeat after me.

795
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:40,764
In the name of Asmodeus,
archangel of crime,

796
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,541
prince of the damned.

797
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:50,716
I demand the friendship
of the King and Dauphin.

798
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,483
May this friendship never end.

799
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,289
May the Queen be sterile.

800
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:04,797
Madame of Montespan!

801
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,931
May my rivals perish!

802
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,982
May this sacrifice please you,

803
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:30,216
O Prince of Darkness!

804
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:36,819
No!

805
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,532
Catch them! Kill them!

806
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:46,867
Quick, don't let them escape!

807
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:54,442
Saved!

808
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,699
So, what do you say?

809
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,932
I have no power at Versailles.

810
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:20,007
And Madame of Montespan
is the King's mistress.

811
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:23,204
- We must wait.
- Wait until I'm murdered?

812
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:25,909
The King would listen.

813
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,242
Were it possible,
I would have told him before now.

814
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:32,049
So you knew all about Voisin?

815
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,345
Of course.

816
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,355
The Court is France.

817
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:37,219
Without evidence,

818
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:39,417
the King cannot act.

819
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,361
Must I remind you
that they are killing infants?

820
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:49,592
Perhaps, by letting a few die,
thousands more are saved.

821
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:52,230
I shall inform him about the poison

822
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,400
when the time is right,
and everyone shall know.

823
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:59,675
In the meantime, I beg you, leave Court.

824
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,772
Never! I am a woman,

825
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:05,077
and the life of even a single child
means everything to me.

826
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:06,777
I shall talk to the King.

827
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:08,682
Just one second.

828
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:12,787
Do that, and you will
never again see your husband,

829
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,429
Joffrey of Peyrac.

830
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:19,498
What is this blackmail?
What is this odious lie?

831
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,230
It is the truth.

832
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:25,105
Joffrey is dead.

833
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,766
He is alive.

834
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:29,906
I didn't want it to be known

835
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,011
by the King's future mistress,

836
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,374
but I saw no other way
of diverting you from your folly.

837
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:42,115
- I don't believe you.
- You shall.

838
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:44,982
Come.

839
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:56,461
I found the architect who built
your husband's residence.

840
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,465
The land formerly belonged
to the Grand Master of the Templars.

841
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,846
This well has an exit dating
from the time of Philip the Fair.

842
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:33,834
It comes out
into the Cemetery of the Innocents.

843
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:47,885
I discovered this all by myself.

844
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,063
Whose seal is this?

845
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,805
Peyrac's.

846
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,242
Do you recognize these bags?

847
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:15,248
They're Joffrey's.
He kept his gold in them.

848
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:20,751
There! This is tangible proof
that your husband

849
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:25,387
did not drown in the Seine
near Gassincourt.

850
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:09,633
I learnt all this
by means of a long investigation.

851
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:13,230
Nursed back to health by abbey monks,

852
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:18,441
Joffrey of Peyrac
made his way back to Paris.

853
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:27,048
Hunted and destitute, he had nothing left.

854
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:30,716
He went to the Cemetery of the Innocents,

855
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:35,152
made his way in
through the secret entrance,

856
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:39,732
and came here for his gold.

857
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:45,202
For with gold one can wage war,
one can hire accomplices,

858
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:47,869
one can buy freedom.

859
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:10,520
Joffrey! He's alive and free!

860
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:14,362
How delightful to see you happy!

861
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:15,491
Where is he?

862
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,231
I lost trace of him at a port in Midi.

863
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:21,971
Midi? I shall go and look for him.

864
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,075
I shall find him!

865
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:28,006
I am sure you will. And I am delighted.

866
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,280
My carriage, immediately!

867
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,611
Lisette, my trunks!

868
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:33,853
I leave this hour!

869
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,423
I beg you to wait until the morning.

870
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,355
The roads are not safe at night.

871
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:41,493
Tomorrow, then. Just to please you.

872
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:42,857
Where is Monsieur Savary?

873
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:44,964
He just rushed out, Madame.

874
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:48,401
I'll make that old liar pay!

875
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:53,771
Angelique of Plessis-Belliere.

876
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:55,406
I knew her at once.

877
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:57,100
The dwarf was devoted to her.

878
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,872
- If she speaks to the King...
- Disgrace!

879
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,614
But torture for you.

880
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,244
Then you'll be burnt for witchcraft.

881
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,517
We must be rid of her. Tonight.

882
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:10,250
Yes, but no poison this time.

883
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,551
I want decisive action.

884
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:19,054
An old method,
but one that's tried and trusted.

885
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:10,157
Wanted to kill her?

886
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:52,901
Joffrey!

887
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:58,440
Joffrey, my love!

888
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:58,602
Speak to me!

889
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:05,903
Why?

890
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:10,446
But why?

891
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:30,430
Why?

892
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,585
It was him, I saw him.

893
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,355
Perhaps he has changed.

894
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:55,485
The Count of Peyrac you loved
died at the stake.

895
01:38:56,397 --> 01:38:58,922
He could have lost his rank and fortune

896
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,265
but remained himself.

897
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:03,661
Perhaps.

898
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:07,601
But in the meantime
you married Plessis-Belliere.

899
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:12,405
I thought he was dead.

900
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:15,641
He had died, and I was but a woman.

901
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:21,014
He loved no ordinary woman,
but Angelique!

902
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,023
He loves me no more?

903
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,224
He thinks you have no future together.

904
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:31,029
So many years spent apart.

905
01:39:31,665 --> 01:39:32,962
We have the present.

906
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:36,631
When in love, you can fit
a lifetime into one night.

907
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:42,372
My men are guarding your doors.
The King's orders.

908
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:45,301
But you have the tunnel.

909
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:49,038
It's locked. Still, it doesn't matter now.

910
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:51,815
Locked doors can be forced,

911
01:39:51,919 --> 01:39:54,683
so that pure air may circulate
through the temple.

912
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:57,855
Not my words. Solomon's.

913
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:11,133
Did Peyrac set you up here?

914
01:40:11,438 --> 01:40:13,963
- In a way.
- And in another?

915
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:16,302
I swore to keep my silence.

916
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,545
How did you get in?

917
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:20,044
By the tunnel.

918
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:21,738
It's locked.

919
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,976
The Count of Peyrac gave me the key.

920
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:26,080
This, too.

921
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:37,789
My love.

922
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:40,689
I came to watch you sleep,

923
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:44,169
to see you without your seeing me.

924
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:47,971
Fate was cruel

925
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,700
to let us see each other.

926
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:55,270
The reason I fled without speaking

927
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:59,953
was because one word
would have awakened so many things

928
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,452
which should be left alone.

929
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,016
Your life is in the open.
Mine, henceforth, in the shadows.

930
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:10,992
I can offer you nothing now.

931
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:13,258
Forget me.

932
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:16,894
Soon, perhaps, you will find a new destiny.

933
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:18,800
Do not refuse it, I beg you.

934
01:41:19,807 --> 01:41:21,775
Stay alive for us, for our children.

935
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:25,872
I take with me a piece of eternity,

936
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:29,645
your smile as you slept.

937
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,366
Be reasonable, Madame.

938
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:54,069
Reasonable?
I've never been reasonable.

939
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:57,206
I shall go to Midi and find him.

940
01:41:57,311 --> 01:42:01,247
We shall both go to Midi.
Or, rather, all three of us.

941
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:03,281
- Three?
- The naphtha!

942
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:07,976
You old madman!
Find us a light carriage and four.

943
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:09,453
Let us fly!
