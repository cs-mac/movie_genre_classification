1
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,796
I'II tell them we're here.

2
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,501
Oh, hello.

3
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,511
You're the new boy here, aren't you?

4
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,776
I think your room is right next to mine.
Let me help you with the bag.

5
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,830
You touched me!

6
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,961
You fool! You touched me!

7
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,125
You want to kill me?

8
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:24,137
You fool! You want to kill me?

9
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,314
You want to kill me.

10
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,398
Ooh, he touched me.

11
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:31,490
David, David, stop it at once.

12
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,913
Pull yourself together immediately.

13
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:34,746
A touch can kill.

14
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:37,965
You know that isn't true.
Now, control yourself.

15
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,756
A touch can kill!

16
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:42,347
Dr. Swinford's secretary is coming.
We're going to wait in his office.

17
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,269
Touch can kill.

18
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:46,478
Would you follow me, please?

19
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,662
Please sit down.

20
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,366
- Still 12:17.
- What?

21
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,423
It wasn't working the last time
we were here either.

22
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:17,347
What's the point of having a clock
which won't work?

23
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,439
He probably has a wristwatch.

24
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:21,776
- A Mickey Mouse wristwatch.
- Hello.

25
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:24,862
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it isn't important.

26
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:27,955
The important thing
is to get David settled.

27
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:31,005
I'II take him right up to his room
so he can unpack.

28
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:34,225
- Would you like to say goodbye now?
- I want to go up to his room with him.

29
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,479
I'm sorry. Visitors aren't allowed
in the rooms.

30
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,691
But surely I can see it?

31
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,696
The rooms belong to the students.

32
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:46,877
Goodbye, Mother.

33
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:52,055
Goodbye, darling.
Write often, won't you?

34
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:54,269
I'II miss you terribly.

35
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:00,445
I'II be right back.

36
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,641
Here we are, Mrs. Ferris.
This is David Clemens.

37
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,932
Hello, David.

38
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,076
Mrs. Ferris is our housekeeper.
Anything you want, just ask her.

39
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:17,995
See you in a little while.

40
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,509
Have you thought of anything else
since our talk a week ago,

41
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,548
anything about the nightmares, perhaps?

42
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,309
Nightmares?

43
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:29,648
Yes, I believe it was Mr. Clemens
who mentioned them.

44
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,607
They began when he was three
or four years old.

45
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:32,822
Oh, stomach aches.

46
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,708
His father would take him out,
buy him candy bars.

47
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,170
Those two would eat anything.

48
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:40,257
I had two little boys on my hands, really.

49
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:46,477
You do understand that neither his father
nor I ever hit or slapped him. Never.

50
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,534
This... This notion of his
about being touched,

51
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:51,778
it wasn't anything we did.

52
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,079
Hey! New guy in.

53
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,211
I want to see!

54
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,589
What's his name?

55
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,155
Hey, come on, let's go see him.
Where is he?

56
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,160
Hey, let's see the new kid.

57
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,379
Who is it?

58
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,214
It's Dr. Swinford.

59
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,741
I want a lock installed
in my door immediately.

60
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:43,991
No one will come in without your permission.

61
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,869
How do I know that?

62
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,831
That's one of our rules.

63
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:51,178
Things look in pretty good shape here.

64
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,140
Could we talk for awhile?

65
00:06:56,486 --> 00:07:00,442
Dr. Swinford,
I submitted to extensive testing

66
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:03,543
and other nonsense
for two full days last week.

67
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,838
I'm here, I'll go along with the routine,

68
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,672
with the indignities.

69
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:10,762
But frankly, I don't care
for any more interviewing.

70
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:13,017
It's not interviewing.
It's just talking things over

71
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:15,028
so that perhaps I can help you.

72
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:17,318
After all,
that's what we're both here for, David.

73
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,080
All right.

74
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:22,171
Then let's say if I feel like talking to you,

75
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:23,296
I'II talk to you.

76
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:27,757
I'm available.

77
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:36,118
Dinner's not until 6:00.

78
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,244
You can go outdoors if you like.

79
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,349
I thought I told you, I loathe athletics.

80
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:46,560
Go for a walk.

81
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,352
A walk?

82
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,573
You may leave after classes if you want to,

83
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:53,614
just so long as you let me know
when you're going out.

84
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,752
What time is it now?

85
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,833
3:55.

86
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,219
May I see your watch?

87
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:08,569
Mediocre. Do you have any others?

88
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:14,580
I have a wristwatch.
Right now it's not working.

89
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,925
The clock in your office
isn't working either.

90
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,932
No. I haven't had time to have it fixed.

91
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,894
You'll have time now, won't you?

92
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,160
The time you'll save by not talking to me.

93
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:32,208
See you later, David.

94
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,295
Cow.

95
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,592
- Lisa...
- Cow, cow, cow.

96
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:33,150
Big black cow, big fat sow

97
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,198
- and how, how!
- Lisa?

98
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:45,592
Cow, cow, cow.

99
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:48,731
Would you like to look
at some pictures, Lisa?

100
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,743
So they sat,

101
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:59,082
so they sat,

102
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,178
and so they sat.

103
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,312
Big fat cow,

104
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:09,526
big black sow,

105
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,540
and how and how and how.

106
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:26,147
Well, where is he, the new inmate?

107
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,162
Maybe somebody warned him
about the food in this joint.

108
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,249
He has a terrible temper.

109
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:33,706
Why? What's the matter with him?

110
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,594
He must be exceptional, like the rest of us.

111
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,469
What does that mean?

112
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,640
You've been here a year and you don't know?

113
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:44,825
I hear that the new boy is tall and blonde,
my type.

114
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:48,912
You just touch him and he turns on you.

115
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:53,423
Hey, Kate, you can touch me anytime.

116
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:58,309
Is that all you will think about,
even when you're eating?

117
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:02,743
Maureen, I don't like celery soup
so I'm not going to eat it.

118
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,998
- Is that all right, Maureen?
- That's all right.

119
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,297
There he is.

120
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,146
Yeah!

121
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,581
Hello, David.

122
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,549
I'm Maureen. You're going to be at my table.

123
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,964
Would you like to come and meet everyone?

124
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:41,246
This is David Clemens who arrived today.

125
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:43,627
David, this is Sandra.

126
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:45,467
How do you do?

127
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,598
- And Carlos.
- Hiya.

128
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:48,885
Josette,

129
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,062
- and Simon...
- We've already met.

130
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:56,117
...and Kate.
- Hello.

131
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,752
Man, you classy dresser.

132
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,843
You're gonna be the best-dressed guy
in this school.

133
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,635
The rest are such slobs.

134
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:40,969
Do you play chess?

135
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,024
Will you play with me after dinner?

136
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:49,414
Oh, don't forget, after dinner
we have a meeting to discuss clothes.

137
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:53,299
Hey, what club are you gonna vote for?

138
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:56,547
I despise clubs.

139
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,896
Would you like to join our bowling team?

140
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,815
I despise bowling.

141
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,159
Oh, come on, man.

142
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:12,382
It's good exercise.

143
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,520
Exercise is for idiots!

144
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:28,760
Fine, David. That's very, very good.

145
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,855
- Who is it?
- It's Alan.

146
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:13,695
- What do you want?
- May I come in?

147
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:15,868
No, I'm busy.

148
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:19,081
Okay, I'll try some other time.

149
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:28,183
Hop, skip, jump.
I'm not a lump, I'm not a lump.

150
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:32,451
Hop, skip, jump.
I'm not a lump, I'm not a lump.

151
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,829
No, you're not a lump. You're a girl, Lisa.

152
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,970
I'm not a lump and I like to jump.

153
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:43,054
I'm not a lump and I like to jump.

154
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,104
I'm not a lump and I like to jump.

155
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:48,323
You're not a lump. You're not a lump.

156
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,370
You're a girl, Lisa.

157
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:55,378
I'm not a lump, I'm not a lump,
I'm not a lump, I'm not a lump...

158
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:40,656
All right.

159
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,504
You're Muriel.

160
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:50,967
Would you like to play a game, Muriel?

161
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,555
What would you like to do?

162
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,950
No, we can't go outside now.

163
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:18,114
It's nearly dinnertime.

164
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,382
Would you like to look out the window?

165
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,275
It's "with" not "wit." With.

166
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:40,527
Here, I'II show you.

167
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,616
Come on.

168
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,625
This is the way you spell "with."

169
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:52,177
W, I, T, H.

170
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,020
"With."

171
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,458
Why don't you comb your hair?

172
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,884
It looks fine in the morning
but right now it looks terrible.

173
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:10,802
Wait.

174
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,905
I'II play with you.

175
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,113
What would you like to play?

176
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:09,485
No, no, Lisa.

177
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,619
You mustn't write on the wall.

178
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:18,508
Give me the crayon, Lisa.

179
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,728
I'm sorry, Lisa.

180
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:26,281
I'm going to have to take the crayon
away from you.

181
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,506
John, John, be gone, be gone.

182
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,463
Enough of this stuffy stuff!

183
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:36,602
Are you angry with me, Lisa?

184
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:40,395
Angry, angry, wangry, wangry, angry.

185
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,738
Are you angry because I took your crayon?

186
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,800
You foo, you foo, it's you, it's you!

187
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:53,010
Foo, foo, foo, foo, foo!

188
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,364
John is a louse!

189
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:06,507
A big fat louse on a little gray mouse!

190
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:10,842
May I have a word with you?

191
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:12,893
Sure, David.

192
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:17,233
I've been studying your patient
and I've come to several conclusions.

193
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:19,158
I'd like to hear them.

194
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:22,543
Based on the fact that I've read
a great many books in your field.

195
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:24,463
Go on.

196
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,475
My diagnosis is adolescent schizophrenia,

197
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,729
undoubtedly of a chronic variety.

198
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,025
Do you follow me?

199
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,065
Yes, I do.

200
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,037
Well, then I shall continue.

201
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:42,051
Lisa has a very difficult time
with authoritarian figures.

202
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:44,510
It is extremely important

203
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,312
that you adopt an attitude
of permissiveness with her.

204
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:51,532
Therefore, you shouldn't have
taken away her crayon

205
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,660
even though she marked the wall.

206
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:56,993
John, John, come away, today, today.

207
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,837
I'd like to talk to you
some more about this, David.

208
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,044
I'II see you later.

209
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,140
You touched me? Why did you do that?

210
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:05,228
Why did you do that, you big fat fool?

211
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:06,390
I'm sorry, I forgot.

212
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:08,486
Why did you... You want to see me dead!

213
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:11,365
You want to see me dead, don't you?
Don't you?

214
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:12,614
I made a mistake, David.

215
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,748
You...

216
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:18,713
You coarse, clumsy, stupid fool!

217
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:22,061
You hate me.

218
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:25,024
Oh, he hates me.

219
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,392
Hi, come on in.

220
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,692
Why is it every time I stop here
to tell you I'm going out,

221
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,612
you ask me to come in?

222
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:53,982
Where are you off to?

223
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:55,662
A walk.

224
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:57,156
I feel like a walk myself.

225
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:00,252
You mind if I join you?

226
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:07,182
I was told you made a friend.

227
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,481
Friend?

228
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:10,776
Olga says you were talking to Lisa.

229
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:14,827
I talk to her merely
because her case interests me.

230
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:17,002
I see.

231
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:23,846
My ability to relate,
or any other psychiatric term you might use,

232
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:25,276
simply does not apply to me.

233
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,447
What do you find so funny?

234
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,495
I take particular pains not to use
psychiatric terms

235
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,459
yet you accuse me of doing it.

236
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,840
Well, all the others did.

237
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:40,852
All the idiot psychiatrists
my mother dragged me to.

238
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:48,035
Frankly, you experts devote too much time
to nonsense like dreams.

239
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,117
Do you dream often?

240
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:54,261
I had my clock-execution dream last night.

241
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,648
Well, we've had our little walk.

242
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:01,811
You satisfied?

243
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:04,990
I'd like to hear about your dream.

244
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,752
I thought you would.

245
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,921
The dream is always the same.

246
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,224
I've had it many times,
only the victim changes.

247
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:19,563
There's a huge clock with a huge hand,

248
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,778
the edge of which is very sharp,
like a razor.

249
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,708
There are holes in the face of the clock
with heads sticking through.

250
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,805
I'm pulling on the clock hand
with all my strength.

251
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,138
I pull the blade closer and closer.

252
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,897
It touches the victim's neck, cuts through,

253
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,317
I continue to pull the blade around the clock

254
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,166
until all the heads are cut off.

255
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,798
My victims are executed 12 times.

256
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:48,806
That's all.

257
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,687
Who are the victims?

258
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,152
John was the victim last night.

259
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:00,953
Who knows? Maybe tonight it will be you.

260
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,399
Hello, kiddo. So alone.

261
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:31,700
Hello.

262
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:39,797
Kiddo?

263
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:43,816
Kiddo, hello.

264
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:50,243
Me, the same. Lisa, the name.

265
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:56,635
Me, the same. Lisa, the name.

266
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,642
Me, the same.

267
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:04,020
David, the name.

268
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:10,296
Look at me. What do you see?
What do you see?

269
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:15,424
Lisa, I see,

270
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,354
staring at me.

271
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,531
Don't touch.

272
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:24,863
Don't touch.

273
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,762
All else will do, but please no such.

274
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:34,345
- Foolish talking, foolish squawking.
- Don't touch.

275
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,314
No such.

276
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:46,591
No such, no touch.

277
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,345
You're welcome.

278
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,891
Hi. Come on in.

279
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:20,253
Well, you've won the battle.

280
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:22,382
I'm in your office.

281
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:28,268
I didn't know we were having a battle.

282
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:31,360
- Want to sit down?
- No, I'm not staying.

283
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:35,790
I merely came to find out
if you've analyzed my dream.

284
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:39,043
No, I couldn't do that
without talking with you.

285
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:41,137
Typical psychiatrist's dodge!

286
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:43,888
You don't like psychiatrists much?

287
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:46,979
They think they have all the answers.

288
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:50,200
That's one thing I'm sure I haven't got.

289
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,577
I've interviewed a few of your colleagues.

290
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,710
Of course they thought
they were interviewing me.

291
00:27:57,681 --> 00:28:00,686
- I'd like to hear about them.
- Yes, I'm sure you would.

292
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:05,908
I'm here to find out what you thought
about my dream.

293
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,905
What did you think about it?

294
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:09,375
Don't play Dr. Freud,

295
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:12,414
answering one question by asking another.

296
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:18,395
Go ahead, say it.

297
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:21,857
The dream proves I'm crazy.

298
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:23,989
No, it doesn't.

299
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,121
I presume that comes
under the heading of "reassurance."

300
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,208
Give the kid comfort and support.

301
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:35,385
I think I'm crazy.

302
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:48,922
Aren't you going to tell me anything
about my dream?

303
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:53,929
You sounded angry,
cutting off John's head that way.

304
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:58,361
A brilliant analysis.

305
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,574
You're terribly afraid of death, aren't you?

306
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:03,459
Aren't you?

307
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:04,705
Now who's playing Freud?

308
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:16,949
Go on.

309
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,464
It shows in your dream in two ways.

310
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,685
First, you're killing your enemies,
which will make you feel safer.

311
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:33,570
And second, you're pulling on the blade

312
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,949
so that you control life and death.

313
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:38,995
I wish you'd stay.

314
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:43,010
I know you do, Doctor.

315
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,283
David! David!

316
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:22,568
Look at me.

317
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,899
Who do you see? Who do you see?

318
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:27,990
Lisa I see, looking at me.

319
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:33,085
David, David, here we are.

320
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,343
Come away, far, far.

321
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:40,355
Not now, not today,

322
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:42,649
I say...

323
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,578
Some other day.

324
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,717
I say...

325
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,892
Lisa, why must we rhyme?

326
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,066
It's so hard and it takes so much time.

327
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:00,657
Funny David, can't you see?

328
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:03,498
Rhyming stops her, she then can't be.

329
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:06,417
That's why you rhyme!

330
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:08,880
You don't have to be Muriel when you rhyme!

331
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,730
Lisa! Come back!

332
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,231
Come back, I'll rhyme.

333
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:17,993
I'II rhyme, this time.

334
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:21,245
Rhyme, time, slime, rhyme!

335
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:01,765
Don't touch me.

336
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,199
Don't touch me.

337
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:14,583
Be careful,

338
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:16,796
don't touch me!

339
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,861
Lisa, Muriel, I warn you!

340
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,991
Don't touch me.

341
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:26,713
Been here long?

342
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:31,974
You haven't had your clock fixed.

343
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:33,058
Not yet.

344
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:40,202
Have you got your wristwatch
with you today?

345
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:41,334
Uh-huh.

346
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,295
It's probably a piece of clumsy junk.

347
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,433
How come you don't have a watch?

348
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:50,609
There isn't one in existence I'd want to own.

349
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,566
They're all grossly inaccurate.

350
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:58,745
Have you ever thought of the possibility
of a radio-controlled clock?

351
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:01,214
A radio alarm clock?

352
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:03,257
No, no, no, I mean one that...

353
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,488
This must be strictly confidential.

354
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,413
Everything we say is between us.

355
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,266
I plan to construct a masterpiece.

356
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,240
A combination of utterly precise instruments
put together in a perfect pattern.

357
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,414
My idea is this.

358
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,595
Everyone would wear a clock receiver

359
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:40,563
which would be tuned in
to a central electronic device.

360
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:45,107
Through this device they would
constantly be kept aware

361
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:46,949
of the exact time.

362
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,242
If they were interested.

363
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:54,303
It's an ingenious idea,

364
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:58,345
but I don't think many people are interested
in constantly having the exact time.

365
00:34:58,483 --> 00:35:00,312
- I am.
- Why?

366
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:06,869
Time goes on and on, we can't stop it!
It never stops!

367
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,964
Second by second, minute by minute,

368
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:12,262
it's cutting off our heads!

369
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:15,060
- Like your dream?
- No. Yes!

370
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:22,239
It starts the minute we're born
and just keeps on going.

371
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:24,535
There's nothing we can do about it.

372
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,847
You're gonna die, Alan.

373
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,812
Do you know you're going to die?

374
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,057
Yes, I know.

375
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:38,275
Aren't you afraid?

376
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,122
Sure, sometimes. We all are.

377
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,595
If we could only stop time we could be safe.

378
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,944
We can't stop time, David.
All we can do is use it.

379
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,782
It's not only time that brings on death.

380
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,122
It's a lot of other things, too.

381
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,046
Not if we're careful!

382
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,130
Careful?

383
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:05,052
Yes, nobody get near me.

384
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:07,430
Not let anyone near me,
not let anyone touch me.

385
00:36:09,278 --> 00:36:10,774
Not anyone let hurt me.

386
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:14,739
I think you mean hurt inside you,

387
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,833
in your heart, in your guts,
not where you bleed.

388
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:19,759
Where you feel.

389
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,215
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

390
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:25,935
Other people can make you feel pain,

391
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,485
can make you suffer, turn on you,
laugh at you...

392
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:32,243
No! I will not let them.

393
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:35,458
I will not let anyone touch me.

394
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,603
We can't add to the time allotted to us,

395
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:44,017
we can't even add a second to it.

396
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,991
All we can do is be alive in it.

397
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,243
Alive! Not numb inside.

398
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,424
We take a chance when we open up
and love another person.

399
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,169
What's wrong, Lisa?
Everyone's waiting for you.

400
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:13,256
She'd better make up her mind right now
or we'll miss the train.

401
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:16,223
We'll see all the Christmas decorations.
We're going to all the big stores.

402
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:18,356
Will you hold my hand
the whole time, Maureen?

403
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,238
I get nervous in crowds.

404
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:21,694
Don't you want to go, Lisa?

405
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:23,703
No, no.

406
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,548
Snow and ice, ice and snow. No! No!

407
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:30,715
Remember, we looked out the window?
There's no snow today.

408
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,016
Foolish talking, foolish squawking.

409
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:36,944
David, stay. We'II play, we'll play.

410
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:40,235
I can't stay.

411
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:42,370
But I'll walk while we talk.

412
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:46,419
No squawk talk, no talk squawk.

413
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,937
We'll walk, we'll walk.

414
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:56,108
Walk us two?

415
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,994
Me and you.

416
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:02,414
You and me, me and you,

417
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:05,262
walk us two.

418
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:16,035
If you just sit here,
we'll go buy your tickets.

419
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,675
- You shouldn't smoke.
- Why not?

420
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,934
'Cause it makes you look too tough.

421
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:46,267
I am tough.

422
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,328
Do you want to make something out of it?

423
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,116
- Hmm?
- Certainly not.

424
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,597
Who's that girl?

425
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,815
Whoever she is, she's very rude.

426
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:06,778
Holly golly, golly holly.

427
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:08,871
Golly holly, holly golly.

428
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:12,090
She's nuts. Must be from that school.

429
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:15,096
Golly holly, holly golly.

430
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:16,387
Beat it, damn it!

431
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,559
What the hell do you think you're doing?

432
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,358
- You want a punch in the jaw?
- Don't touch me.

433
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:24,530
Excuse her, please.
She was admiring your family.

434
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:27,913
- She's not normal.
- Lf you're normal, who wants to be normal?

435
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:29,002
Come on, David.

436
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:36,435
Come on. Let's go.
We'll wait for the train outside.

437
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,723
Bunch of screwballs! Spoiling the town!

438
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,282
Bunch of screwballs spoiling the town.

439
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:23,252
Bunch of screwballs spoiling the town.

440
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,518
Bunch of screwballs spoiling the town.

441
00:40:27,189 --> 00:40:28,471
A bunch of screwballs...

442
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:31,691
A bunch of screwballs
spoiling the town!

443
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:34,907
A bunch of screwballs spoiling the town!

444
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,838
A bunch of screwballs spoiling the town!

445
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:42,881
- A bunch of screwballs spoiling the town!
- A bunch of screwballs spoiling the town!

446
00:41:09,123 --> 00:41:10,405
I'm going out for a walk.

447
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,566
I presume you've noticed me
playing chess with Simon?

448
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,744
He's not much competition.

449
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,206
Do you know something?

450
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:35,051
Lisa gets irritated every time
she sees me with Simon.

451
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:37,513
I think she's jealous.

452
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:42,447
Maybe.

453
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,659
Perhaps I'm getting through to

454
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,841
her feelings, to use your word.

455
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:54,178
Quite possibly.

456
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:06,623
Where did you get this?

457
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:12,064
In Rome, a long time ago.

458
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:16,901
Corny stuff you keep around here.

459
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:30,349
Sometimes Lisa acts so silly,
all that jumping around and rhyming.

460
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:40,120
She has no choice.

461
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,224
Sickness makes people do things
they don't want to do.

462
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:46,020
If they get better,

463
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,153
then they're free to do as they please.
They have a choice.

464
00:42:50,282 --> 00:42:52,324
Compulsive versus non-compulsive?

465
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:55,831
Why use technical terms?

466
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:57,829
Poaching on your territory?

467
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:01,968
Civilians not allowed
to utter the sacred words?

468
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:04,136
You sound awful angry.

469
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:08,986
If "they" get better then they will
be allowed to do as "they" please!

470
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:11,446
What is this "they" routine,
when you mean me?

471
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,588
That's right, me.
I'm a real compulsive nut, aren't I?

472
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:25,900
Let's stick together, shall we?

473
00:43:26,828 --> 00:43:28,241
Let's be each other's friend.

474
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:34,550
I play the piano. Will you listen to me play?

475
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,340
I don't like music.

476
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:37,637
Oh.

477
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:43,534
Game, game,

478
00:43:44,537 --> 00:43:46,034
boy, poy.

479
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:52,931
Chess, mess,

480
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:55,351
chess, mess.

481
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:00,322
I can't stand her.

482
00:44:01,578 --> 00:44:03,289
She can't help it.

483
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:05,750
She's a very sick girl.

484
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,828
Hello, kiddo.

485
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,333
Kiddo, hello.

486
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:48,604
David, David, look at me.

487
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,528
Who do you see? Who do you see?

488
00:45:00,135 --> 00:45:02,012
Say to me what you see.

489
00:45:04,062 --> 00:45:06,104
I see a girl,

490
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:11,451
who looks like a pearl.

491
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,625
A pearl of a girl.

492
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:31,248
John! John!

493
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:36,211
John, I'm a girl, a girl, a pearl of a girl!

494
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:37,942
Hiya!

495
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,294
Who you waiting for?

496
00:46:41,337 --> 00:46:43,047
My son.

497
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,464
Are you a mother?

498
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:47,506
You look more like a sister.

499
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,645
I am Mrs. Clemens.

500
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:53,487
David "Hands Off' Clemens!

501
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,825
No kidding!

502
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:02,219
I think you're just about the cutest mother
I ever seen around here.

503
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:06,389
My God, how did David get
such a sexy mother?

504
00:47:07,316 --> 00:47:10,440
Why don't you just go...
Go talk to someone else?

505
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,329
Oh, look at the broads in this place.

506
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,618
Why would I talk to them?

507
00:47:16,672 --> 00:47:19,879
Old hens, all zipped up in their girdles.

508
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:24,180
- Will you go away?
- Oh, please, don't say that.

509
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:26,183
I'm so Ionely.

510
00:47:27,113 --> 00:47:30,202
- No one ever come to see me.
- Oh?

511
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:32,621
See, my mother, she works so hard.

512
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:37,339
- All night, even.
- Oh.

513
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,804
She a very hard worker, and very tiring.

514
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:44,647
- What does your mother do?
- She's a hooker.

515
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:47,072
You know, a hustler.

516
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,329
She walks up the streets
and she sees a guy and she...

517
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:52,168
Never mind. I don't want to hear it.

518
00:47:54,387 --> 00:47:56,383
Darling, I thought you would never come!

519
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:57,514
Hello, Mother.

520
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:00,353
What took you so long? Come and sit down.

521
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:12,216
You look pale. You've been eating enough?

522
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:16,180
You never write anymore.

523
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:18,225
Where's Father?

524
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,190
Chicago, business meeting.

525
00:48:20,241 --> 00:48:22,616
- Did you get the pajamas I sent?
- Yes, thank you.

526
00:48:23,457 --> 00:48:26,498
I don't want thanks.
Just a line to let me know they got here,

527
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:28,543
that's only good manners.

528
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:34,767
A boy I see, who looks like me.

529
00:48:35,277 --> 00:48:37,071
I see me, Lisa.

530
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:39,448
Muriel? Muriel.

531
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:47,764
Poor child. What's wrong with her?

532
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:49,765
Schizophrenic.

533
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,025
You know, crazy.

534
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:57,907
Doesn't it upset you to be around
children like that?

535
00:48:57,956 --> 00:49:00,082
Why should it? I'm crazy, too.

536
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:03,381
Don't say that. You have some problems...

537
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:06,433
I've got bats in my belfry,
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

538
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:10,313
How are you getting along
with Dr. Swinford?

539
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:11,525
Alan's okay.

540
00:49:11,572 --> 00:49:13,901
You call him Alan? Not very respectful.

541
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:17,993
He doesn't care about
all that respectful crap.

542
00:49:18,046 --> 00:49:20,042
David, your language!

543
00:49:24,103 --> 00:49:26,264
What's a boy like that doing in this school?

544
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,226
He's crazy, too.

545
00:49:28,405 --> 00:49:30,281
I mean, it's so expensive.

546
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:33,747
A welfare agency put him in here
after he knocked up 13 girls.

547
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:37,926
That's what he says.

548
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,888
In my opinion, he has delusions of grandeur.

549
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,061
Tell me all about school.

550
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,150
Nothing to tell.

551
00:49:46,197 --> 00:49:48,157
Are you getting good grades?

552
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:50,114
I told you, they don't grade you here.

553
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:53,336
But how do you know
if you're at the top of your class?

554
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,587
It doesn't matter.

555
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:56,507
Of course it matters.

556
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:58,549
Why?

557
00:50:01,526 --> 00:50:03,818
- There's that bastard, John.
- David!

558
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:16,098
David, aren't you making any friends?
I'm sure there are some nice boys here.

559
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:18,479
What do you mean by nice?

560
00:50:19,235 --> 00:50:21,444
A milksop who has good manners?

561
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,862
David, you never used
to talk to me like that.

562
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,885
What makes you think
that I ever really talked to you at all?

563
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:41,284
When people talk,
it means they say what they really feel.

564
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:46,341
All you ever do is toss words around.

565
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,675
- What do you wanna do this afternoon?
- Nothing.

566
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:53,941
Well, I came all the way out here,
two hours in the traffic,

567
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:56,069
just to take you somewhere.

568
00:50:58,997 --> 00:51:01,123
You're not being very grateful.

569
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:05,130
Come on, we'll do whatever you wanna do.

570
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:06,591
What a hypocrite you are!

571
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,761
You know damn well
we'll do what you want to do!

572
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:11,890
We always have!

573
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,268
- Where did you get these?
- I bought them.

574
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,570
- For yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

575
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:38,543
"When all at once I saw a crowd

576
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:41,720
"A host of golden daffodils"

577
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:48,147
It was in our English book.

578
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,491
Well, what did you want to talk to me about?

579
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:03,894
Your parents are insisting
on taking you out of the school.

580
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,020
You mean they...

581
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:09,240
It was my mother, wasn't it?

582
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,001
I spoke to your father, also. He agrees.

583
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:14,257
My father's a marshmallow.

584
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:17,303
Inside, where you're always talking about.

585
00:52:20,443 --> 00:52:24,612
The other day when your mother was here,
did anything special happen?

586
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:26,821
No.

587
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:32,294
Well, she's just not used
to having her sweet little boy

588
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:34,385
talk back or have an idea of his own.

589
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,391
I think she must've found me
under a cabbage.

590
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,617
I can't imagine her.

591
00:52:45,586 --> 00:52:47,629
It was a rotten afternoon.

592
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:51,965
Next time I'II just have to cover up more.

593
00:52:54,065 --> 00:52:56,940
It's what I've been doing all my life.

594
00:52:57,991 --> 00:53:00,070
It's no solution, is it?

595
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,494
No, it isn't.

596
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:04,329
Parents don't like you when you're sick.

597
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:06,592
If you start to get well...

598
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:09,764
Better?

599
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,810
They don't like you, either.

600
00:53:11,899 --> 00:53:14,774
It takes time for a family
to adjust to changes.

601
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:17,739
Well, it's almost the end of the term.

602
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:21,119
I think I ought to stay till then.

603
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:26,258
I think you ought to stay
a good deal longer than that.

604
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:31,566
Your father's coming
to take you home today.

605
00:53:33,827 --> 00:53:34,908
Today?

606
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:38,871
But you're not going to let them
take me away?

607
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:40,129
I should've told you long before this

608
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:42,005
but I hoped I could make them
change their minds.

609
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:45,019
- I said you're not going to let them.
- You're their son.

610
00:53:45,939 --> 00:53:48,018
I have no legal way of stopping them.

611
00:53:48,445 --> 00:53:49,478
Sure.

612
00:53:50,534 --> 00:53:52,613
I come, I go.

613
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:56,503
What the hell do you care?

614
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,671
I care.

615
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:01,802
Well, another little scramble-brained
bastard will come in tomorrow

616
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:03,937
so you won't lose a penny.

617
00:54:04,025 --> 00:54:07,196
Do you think I like you
because I'm being paid to?

618
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:09,405
Oh, well,
I'm finally getting out of this looney bin.

619
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,040
God, how I hate this place. I just loathe it.

620
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:14,123
Your parents are doing this
against my advice.

621
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:16,335
Oh, I'm grateful to my parents!

622
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:20,391
Because they have the sense to realize
their mistakes, which is more than you have.

623
00:54:20,439 --> 00:54:21,686
What mistakes?

624
00:54:21,817 --> 00:54:24,573
Alan Swinford, headshrinker.

625
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:29,244
Do you know something?
You'd do a lot better delivering laundry.

626
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:33,253
It would give you a feeling of being of use
instead of

627
00:54:34,222 --> 00:54:36,348
interfering in people's lives.

628
00:54:36,436 --> 00:54:38,146
How have I interfered?

629
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:43,692
By the asinine idiotic questions
you're always asking!

630
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,828
Why do you keep asking these questions?

631
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:52,175
Why can't you stop, you...
Why can't you stop?

632
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,406
It's all right about the clock.
It can be fixed.

633
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:03,492
Will you please cut out
that understanding stuff?

634
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:05,378
What do I have to do?

635
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:08,546
Smash every damn thing in this office
before you'II fight back?

636
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,685
You mean fight back against your parents?
I did.

637
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:13,642
Believe me, I did.

638
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:15,153
Perhaps they'II reconsider
and change their minds.

639
00:55:15,738 --> 00:55:18,067
If they do, I hope you'll come back.

640
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:23,371
Don't hold your breath.

641
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:35,779
Stuart, carve another piece
of roast beef for David.

642
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:38,120
He's hardly touched
the piece he has now.

643
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:40,127
David, you've got to eat.

644
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:43,008
I told you I'm not hungry.

645
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:47,223
But I planned this whole dinner
just for you, all your favorites.

646
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:50,485
You love biscuits. I made them myself.

647
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:53,652
Grace, put a biscuit on
David's plate, please.

648
00:55:55,668 --> 00:55:57,877
Darling, try the biscuit while it's hot.

649
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:22,725
I spoke to the headmaster
at West Hill Academy.

650
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:25,940
They have openings in both
the junior and senior classes for next fall.

651
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,863
They want you to take some exams
so they'll know where you belong.

652
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,208
I am not going to West Hill Academy.

653
00:56:33,508 --> 00:56:35,420
Of course you are. Don't be silly.

654
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:38,263
Would you rather go
to a public high school?

655
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:41,483
What kind of college preparation
can he get in a public school?

656
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:42,817
It prepared me.

657
00:56:42,906 --> 00:56:44,901
Oh, whoever heard of the college
you went to?

658
00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:47,952
I want David to go to an Ivy League school.

659
00:56:48,712 --> 00:56:51,836
So you can tell everybody
that your son is going to Princeton?

660
00:56:51,886 --> 00:56:54,012
Why shouldn't my son have the best?

661
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:55,258
I never did.

662
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,435
No decent clothes.
Couldn't even invite anybody into my house.

663
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:01,572
Old wicker furniture in the living room.

664
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,542
- You invited me in.
- Oh, you...

665
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:13,016
My family didn't count socially,

666
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:16,233
but your mother was kind enough
to marry me anyway.

667
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:22,078
Well, I've brought you
a long ways away from wicker furniture!

668
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:29,470
Lovely manners your father has.

669
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:33,604
It's terrible for me when you're not here.

670
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:35,030
Your father's so...

671
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:37,910
He's no companion.

672
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,211
Will you shut up about my father?

673
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:44,258
- David...
- Just shut up!

674
00:57:51,654 --> 00:57:54,909
Remember I told you?
David went home to his own house.

675
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:01,167
That's right, he went with a man.

676
00:58:01,762 --> 00:58:03,258
He went home with his father.

677
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,226
This is another way of spelling his name.

678
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,157
The way he spells it, remember?

679
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:12,528
This is his last name.

680
00:58:15,754 --> 00:58:17,464
Clemens.

681
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,931
Can you print your last name?

682
00:58:23,982 --> 00:58:25,063
Brandt.

683
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:32,115
B, R, A, N, D, T.

684
00:58:32,502 --> 00:58:35,342
Brandt. Now try it.

685
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,877
David, you can't just stay here
in your room all the time.

686
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:12,135
Not eating, not talking to anybody.

687
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:15,183
You've got to get out and do things.

688
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:19,444
Listen, I've got a wonderful idea.

689
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:23,535
You and I and your mother
drive to California this summer,

690
00:59:25,672 --> 00:59:28,630
take a look at the countryside. Good idea?

691
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,912
They say it's a great big beautiful country.

692
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:57,030
When I was your age I never went anywhere.
My father just didn't give a damn about me.

693
00:59:57,122 --> 00:59:58,999
He just didn't care.

694
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:03,170
Frankly, he wasn't the greatest guy
in the world.

695
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:12,782
When you were born,
that made me a father and I was so proud.

696
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:19,583
The nurse held you up

697
01:00:19,802 --> 01:00:21,928
and your eyes looked so new.

698
01:00:28,322 --> 01:00:30,282
I wanted to make the world over

699
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:33,243
so those eyes could never see
anything that...

700
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:36,459
So that nothing ever could scare you.

701
01:00:37,386 --> 01:00:39,595
Or disappoint you.

702
01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:57,637
What is it you're so scared of, David?

703
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:02,520
When did it first start?

704
01:01:09,755 --> 01:01:12,166
If it's something I did, I'm sorry.

705
01:01:27,506 --> 01:01:30,796
Do you remember when you were little
all the toys you had in here?

706
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:33,895
The cars and trucks and stuffed animals.

707
01:01:37,154 --> 01:01:41,371
David, do you remember
a fireman's helmet that I bought for you?

708
01:01:52,858 --> 01:01:56,696
When you were little, you know,
you thought I was just about it.

709
01:02:14,953 --> 01:02:17,828
Listen, if I take off next week,

710
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:21,843
would you like to go somewhere with me?
Just the two of us.

711
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:27,477
Drive up to Vermont.
Maybe even go camping?

712
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,500
You don't have to answer me now, but

713
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,712
I sure would love it.

714
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:43,771
I mean, just the two of us, you know.

715
01:02:54,548 --> 01:02:56,544
Well, think about it, huh?

716
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:57,631
Why, David, hello. Come on in.

717
01:04:58,554 --> 01:05:01,762
- I have to see Alan immediately.
- Okay, I'II get him.

718
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:21,477
Hello, David. Come on in.

719
01:05:25,745 --> 01:05:27,870
I left home.

720
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,836
My parents don't know.

721
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:34,091
I'II have to call them. You understand why.

722
01:05:35,017 --> 01:05:36,299
I won't go home.

723
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:39,393
I won't go home.

724
01:05:41,324 --> 01:05:42,606
That's all right.

725
01:05:45,584 --> 01:05:48,672
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
I just came here.

726
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,046
I'm glad.

727
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,454
Hello, kiddo.

728
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:10,364
Kiddo, hello.

729
01:07:16,678 --> 01:07:18,756
David. David, look at me.

730
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:24,560
What do you see? What do you see?

731
01:07:24,989 --> 01:07:27,780
I see a girl who looks like a pearl.

732
01:07:28,122 --> 01:07:30,034
A pearl of a girl.

733
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:37,516
I'm a girl. A girl, a pearl of a girl.

734
01:07:40,735 --> 01:07:44,691
So I just packed my bags
and left in the middle of the night.

735
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,830
I walked to the station.

736
01:07:47,961 --> 01:07:51,881
And there was this woman sitting there.

737
01:07:52,806 --> 01:07:54,053
Colored woman.

738
01:07:54,268 --> 01:07:57,189
She had this boy with her. It was her son.

739
01:07:58,194 --> 01:08:01,449
And they were just sitting there
waiting for the train.

740
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:08,462
She had her arm around him, and, uh...

741
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:12,886
They were so peaceful.

742
01:08:13,898 --> 01:08:18,198
She really liked that boy, I could tell,
because of the way she held him.

743
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:23,460
And I pretended that I was her son, too.

744
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:28,509
I just felt like being her son.

745
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,520
Strange, isn't it?

746
01:08:33,988 --> 01:08:36,744
I don't think it's strange at all.

747
01:08:39,919 --> 01:08:43,174
I spoke to your parents on the phone.
We talked for a long time.

748
01:08:44,096 --> 01:08:47,434
It's all right.
They've agreed to let you stay.

749
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:52,652
I hate my parents.

750
01:08:54,537 --> 01:08:57,543
We can hate and love people
at the same time.

751
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:02,092
- I don't see how.
- You will.

752
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:09,021
When you get to know your parents better
you'll understand that they had parents, too.

753
01:09:09,072 --> 01:09:12,243
Strains and pressures, fears, failures.

754
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:19,593
My father has a lot of money.

755
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,636
He's a success,

756
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:24,892
but it's not a success inside.

757
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:30,038
Tell me, what happened at home?

758
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,412
It's depressing.

759
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:40,477
I guess it's funny, too.

760
01:09:41,483 --> 01:09:42,648
Both maybe.

761
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:45,951
We were having dinner...

762
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:21,536
I prefer sculpture
that challenges your intellect, don't you?

763
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,502
No, not necessarily.

764
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,592
Such an unoriginal subject.

765
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,554
I don't mind.

766
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:34,942
I don't mind, either.

767
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:39,116
I rather like it.

768
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:43,039
I rather like it, too.

769
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,210
Lisa, come down.

770
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:17,137
Lisa?

771
01:12:25,377 --> 01:12:27,752
Look, Mommy! Look at that girl!

772
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:29,751
Lisa, come down.

773
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:30,837
Young lady.

774
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:34,941
- Young lady, come down from there at once!
- No, no. Please, please, let me.

775
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,945
I'm sorry, I should've watched her.

776
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:39,237
Come on, Lisa.

777
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:43,123
It's time to go back to the school
and see John. John's waiting for us.

778
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:47,256
Come on, give me your hand.
That's it, give me your hand.

779
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:51,520
We'II come back
and visit some other day. Yes.

780
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,935
Now, come on, I've got you.
Put your foot down.

781
01:12:54,823 --> 01:12:56,652
Come on, sweetie.

782
01:12:56,953 --> 01:13:00,160
That's it. I've got you. All right?

783
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:03,336
Now, let's go see John.

784
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:29,315
- Did you get these in the backyard?
- Mmm-hmm.

785
01:13:30,283 --> 01:13:33,323
Maybe I'll put some in my room. Only...

786
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:35,624
Only what?

787
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:39,801
The kids. They think that...

788
01:13:42,688 --> 01:13:44,933
Have you ever been to a freak show?

789
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:49,200
At a circus?
Couple of times when I was a kid.

790
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:53,375
I went once when I was about eight.

791
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:56,458
Tell me about it.

792
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:03,688
There was this person, George-Georgina,
half man, half woman.

793
01:14:07,664 --> 01:14:08,864
Half of its...

794
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:16,013
Its/his face had a beard on it,
the other half was smooth.

795
01:14:17,438 --> 01:14:21,310
And it had a breast on one side, too.

796
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:26,869
And I got so scared,
I yelled and I ran right out of the tent.

797
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:32,806
I remember lots of times my mother
used to tell people

798
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:35,017
how George-Georgina scared me.

799
01:14:36,316 --> 01:14:38,193
They used to laugh.

800
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:41,241
But it wasn't funny to you.

801
01:14:41,454 --> 01:14:44,625
Well, I was just a little kid.
Wouldn't bother me now.

802
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:52,599
I noticed you got the clock
in your office fixed.

803
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:53,763
Mmm-hmm.

804
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,108
Maybe it was a good idea
I smashed the glass.

805
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:02,123
Gave you the push you needed
to get it fixed.

806
01:15:02,212 --> 01:15:03,459
I guess it did.

807
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:09,263
I'm gonna put those flowers in my room,
I don't care what the kids think.

808
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:11,349
Doesn't really matter, does it?

809
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:16,870
No. The important thing is
what I think of myself.

810
01:15:24,056 --> 01:15:27,346
- Here's one we could use.
- That's France, stupid.

811
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,193
The point of the party is Paris.
A night in Paris.

812
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:35,321
May I remind you
that Paris is the capital of France.

813
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,869
- Hey, we've got enough.
- Come on, let's go hang them up.

814
01:16:01,688 --> 01:16:05,608
So warm, so nice, no snow, no ice.

815
01:16:06,951 --> 01:16:11,286
Warm and nice, no snow, no ice.

816
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:16,129
David, David, here you are.

817
01:16:17,225 --> 01:16:19,221
Come away far, oh, far.

818
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:25,657
Someday we'II go away.

819
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:32,051
Someday to the clean white sand.

820
01:16:34,016 --> 01:16:35,048
And...

821
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:38,431
And, uh...

822
01:16:44,248 --> 01:16:45,413
Lisa.

823
01:16:48,425 --> 01:16:49,838
It's hard to rhyme.

824
01:16:53,897 --> 01:16:56,771
Let me talk to you plain and straight.

825
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:02,279
Please trust me.

826
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:12,895
This time you rhyme.

827
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:17,653
You rhyme this time.

828
01:17:19,959 --> 01:17:21,159
It's hard.

829
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:26,425
I can't. I really can't.

830
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:30,639
Don't go away!

831
01:17:57,382 --> 01:18:00,590
David, David, you look nice.

832
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:06,066
Not like snow, not like ice.

833
01:18:07,114 --> 01:18:08,990
You didn't go away.

834
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,995
You trust me.

835
01:18:15,217 --> 01:18:16,594
You really trust me.

836
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:45,616
The other day
I wanted to ask you something.

837
01:18:47,753 --> 01:18:49,000
And I just couldn't.

838
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:52,672
When you're ready, you will.

839
01:18:54,937 --> 01:18:57,978
- I think I could now.
- What?

840
01:19:01,328 --> 01:19:03,204
Well, it's about...

841
01:19:05,504 --> 01:19:08,712
Do you think that maybe someday
if I work very hard

842
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,722
that I could get into medical school?

843
01:19:14,025 --> 01:19:15,105
Maybe.

844
01:19:20,206 --> 01:19:23,045
I haven't made up my mind about a specialty.

845
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:29,226
I thought maybe
I could be a psychiatrist, like you.

846
01:19:33,655 --> 01:19:34,736
Maybe.

847
01:19:52,576 --> 01:19:55,534
You know a lot more than you let on,
don't you?

848
01:19:57,755 --> 01:20:01,758
The clock has a big hand

849
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:03,847
and

850
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,810
a small hand.

851
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:13,243
That's right. It's the same word, hands.

852
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,590
What do you want?

853
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:21,760
Do you want me to tell your fortune?

854
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:28,902
I wonder what your fortune is.

855
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:36,471
There's supposed to be a line for happiness

856
01:20:37,475 --> 01:20:40,480
and a line for love.

857
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:42,733
I don't believe in palmistry.

858
01:20:46,622 --> 01:20:48,783
Of course, anything's possible.

859
01:20:49,838 --> 01:20:53,176
You do have a very long happiness line.

860
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:03,694
Can't stand it! Ears can't take it!

861
01:21:05,751 --> 01:21:09,505
Do you really hate music? Good music?

862
01:21:11,557 --> 01:21:13,802
Let me play a Bach prelude for you.

863
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:16,188
Please.

864
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,372
All right, let's leave.

865
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:32,605
It's very good.

866
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,691
Sign your name to it,
so they'II know it's yours.

867
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:38,912
No, no. I mean sign your name on the poster.

868
01:22:16,463 --> 01:22:18,375
That's right.

869
01:22:20,514 --> 01:22:23,722
Muriel and Lisa are you.

870
01:22:26,863 --> 01:22:31,246
You are Lisa and Muriel.

871
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:20,148
Now look who's here.

872
01:23:21,076 --> 01:23:24,200
Does that kid have to follow you
everywhere you go?

873
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,412
She's okay, she won't bother us.

874
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:32,762
Now, you've got be quiet and pay attention.

875
01:23:38,242 --> 01:23:40,238
Go on, finish the piece.

876
01:24:15,749 --> 01:24:19,669
You stop that! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

877
01:24:19,759 --> 01:24:23,845
Now look what you've done!
Go on, get out of here! Leave us alone!

878
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:30,065
David, navid, lavid, savid, tavid, David!

879
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:08,784
París, it's where I'd like to be

880
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:21,526
Chérie, chéríe, chérie

881
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:26,752
When we are in Paris

882
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:31,713
We'll kíss, we'II dance, we'II ooh la la la

883
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:34,093
We'll ooh la la la...

884
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,671
Maureen. Maureen.

885
01:25:53,818 --> 01:25:55,612
Have you seen Lisa?

886
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:57,817
- No, I thought she was with you.
- No.

887
01:25:57,994 --> 01:26:00,869
Maybe she's in the art room.
I'II take a look.

888
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:20,751
I told her to keep quiet.
She got mad and she ran out of the room.

889
01:26:20,799 --> 01:26:23,044
- How long ago?
- Maybe half an hour.

890
01:26:23,096 --> 01:26:26,268
Nowhere. Been to every room, the attic.
She's not in the building.

891
01:26:26,312 --> 01:26:29,353
She can't have gotten far.
We'll cover the neighborhood.

892
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:32,569
- Someone's sure to have seen her.
- I'd better get Ben and Donald.

893
01:26:32,619 --> 01:26:35,458
- I'll come, too. I wanna help look for her.
- Okay.

894
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:55,099
Go to bed, David. It's almost morning.

895
01:28:06,386 --> 01:28:08,512
The minute I hear from John,

896
01:28:08,558 --> 01:28:12,513
the minute I hear that they've found her,
I'II come up and tell you.

897
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:16,779
She might've wandered for miles.
Somebody might've picked her up.

898
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:22,205
God, I hope nobody picked her up.

899
01:28:24,972 --> 01:28:27,264
The conductor said she rode into town.

900
01:28:28,147 --> 01:28:30,356
By his description,
it could've been anyone.

901
01:28:30,444 --> 01:28:32,190
No, it was Lisa.

902
01:28:34,328 --> 01:28:35,528
You know...

903
01:28:38,505 --> 01:28:39,882
You run away,

904
01:28:40,677 --> 01:28:44,133
you don'tjust run away from something,
you run to something.

905
01:28:45,856 --> 01:28:50,109
I know because I did that
the night I came here. I came back.

906
01:28:58,428 --> 01:28:59,627
The museum.

907
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:03,929
The statue, remember?
I told you what she did.

908
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:08,072
- How could she find her way up there?
- She might have.

909
01:29:09,997 --> 01:29:11,993
It's better than sitting here.

910
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:14,289
Get yourjacket.
I'II get the car up.

911
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,753
Lisa?

912
01:29:54,729 --> 01:29:55,762
Lisa?

913
01:29:57,946 --> 01:29:58,978
Lisa!

914
01:30:11,603 --> 01:30:12,684
David.

915
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:18,152
You were nice to Simon

916
01:30:21,126 --> 01:30:25,130
and you were mean to me.

917
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:27,463
I'm sorry.

918
01:30:35,452 --> 01:30:36,617
Lisa,

919
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:39,038
you didn't rhyme

920
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:41,798
and you're not Muriel.

921
01:30:45,059 --> 01:30:46,258
You're you.

922
01:30:48,233 --> 01:30:51,322
Lisa, Muriel,

923
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:54,278
the same.

924
01:30:56,503 --> 01:30:57,619
I'm me.

925
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,379
Let's go back to school now.

926
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:25,606
Take my hand.

927
01:31:32,005 --> 01:31:33,917
Lisa, take my hand.
