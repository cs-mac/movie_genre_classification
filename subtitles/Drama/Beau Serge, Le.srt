1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:01,568
35 millons...

2
00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:02,622
...of francs.

3
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,783
Just for "The Doll of Wax".

4
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:07,629
Are you not happy?

5
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:10,585
Another singer?

6
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,959
She even doesn't know how to kiss.

7
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:30,619
She has to learn...

8
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:33,255
that the mouth in it's function...

9
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:35,573
...is the main sexual organ.

10
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,039
Her skin is pale...

11
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:43,700
her hips are as cold as the winter...

12
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,813
her pelvis doesn't move at all.

13
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,676
But that is not the case.

14
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:52,899
When we grew accustomed one to another...

15
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,658
...she started to play with

16
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:57,757
the clips in her hair.

17
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,628
It is a pity,
in the morning I realized...

18
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,017
that so much vine had got me down.

19
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,737
Will she return, who knows?

20
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,656
What are you doing?

21
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:21,267
Pardon?

22
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:24,384
This is where we live,
not a brothel.

23
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,200
You are not letting us neither sleep...

24
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,809
...nor work,

25
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:31,110
I am working.

26
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,476
You're laughing at me?

27
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:35,038
I can hear everything but the music!

28
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,607
Listening behind the door?

29
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:39,335
I just want silence.

30
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:44,139
- Sometimes life presents us
unpleasant surprises.

31
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:45,158
What?

32
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,499
Serge?

33
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,004
I trust you my dog, mister.

34
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:25,051
My prince.

35
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,014
Excuse us.

36
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,989
Have you red the history of Jesse James?

37
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:56,367
How he lived and died?

38
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:01,299
You want more?

39
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:05,801
Okay, listen to the story of...

40
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,001
Bonnie and Clyde

41
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,673
Wait...

42
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,518
Bad? Let's try different.

43
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,393
I'll start the sentences
and you finish them.

44
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:26,658
...and, Clyde had a bride

45
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:29,762
She's a beauty. Her name is...

46
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,652
Bonnie

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,178
They formed a gang...

48
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:35,929
Barrow

49
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:39,488
- Their names...
- Bonnie Parker and James Barrow

50
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:40,506
Clyde!

51
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:41,621
Oh!

52
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,212
Bonnie Parker
and Clyde Barrow

53
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:46,849
I do not sing very well.

54
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:48,962
- But yes.
- Of course not.

55
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:52,162
With other authors is better.

56
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,050
You are embarrassing me.

57
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,135
That is very good.

58
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,476
You are joking.

59
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,864
The first time I saw you
I almost died of fright.

60
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,863
A joke?

61
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,342
First time we met you already
started to flirt with me.

62
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:08,175
No, it wasn't now.

63
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,807
It was 10 years ago...

64
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,798
I was a piano player in a movie.
You already was...

65
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:17,775
a big star.

66
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,051
You don't remember it.

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,364
Yes!

68
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,900
It was in "Do you want to dance with me".

69
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:23,883
Ah.

70
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:25,919
See, I remember.

71
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:28,732
You already frightened me.

72
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:31,599
I'm scaring or embarrassing you?

73
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,981
You looked fragile.

74
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,884
That scares you? - Yes.

75
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,177
I do not want to disappoint you...

76
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,885
or pain you in any manner.

77
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,290
I can't sing when you are nearby.

78
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:48,200
Neither do I.

79
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:52,342
I listen to my voice and I don't like it.

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,426
Cancel it.
I'm busy.

81
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:00,733
- Brigitte, you'll be back soon?
- Yes.

82
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:06,793
Hallo?

83
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:10,251
Say you can't.
Not now.

84
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,873
That annoyance.

85
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,918
You shouldn't give your number to my agents.

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,258
Behave yourself.

87
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,437
Hallo?

88
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,642
Yes, Serge is here.

89
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,970
I adore him.

90
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,847
Yes, I love him very much.

91
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,404
I'll pass him the phone?

92
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:54,700
No?

93
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,368
Okay.

94
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,029
Want to talk to him?

95
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:01,745
I'll pass him the phone.

96
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:03,863
Your dad.

97
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:05,968
I wanted to talk to you.

98
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,324
- Hallo?
Dad?

99
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:14,057
- Mom didn't believe me
you're with Brigitte Bardot!

100
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,732
Love you.

101
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:17,889
Me too.

102
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,740
Why don't you introduce us?

103
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:20,892
Are you ashamed of us?

104
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:24,783
Dad, I'll call you later.

105
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,815
What a laughter.

106
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:34,609
Brigitte Bardot, Bardot...

107
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,710
Let us go out.

108
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,443
Have you seduced a star!

109
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:50,623
You are my star, Love.

110
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,792
My Brigitte Bardot.

111
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:57,488
Oh my love.

112
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:01,695
Go to the piano and write me
the most beautiful lovesong.

113
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:06,430
Say once more "Oh, my love"

114
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:10,499
My love.

115
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,343
No.

116
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,490
Say "Oh, my love"

117
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,327
Stronger!

118
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:56,047
I wanted to leave you asleep.

119
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,143
I don't want to sleep.

120
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,578
Do you have croissants?

121
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,703
No but I have 3 songs.

122
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,559
One about motorbikes.

123
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:49,698
I don't like bikes.

124
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:52,720
A pity, you may look well on one.

125
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,436
Then...

126
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,837
a song about love?

127
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,003
I do not know.

128
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:03,447
You like "Barbarella"?

129
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,701
She's a...

130
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,655
comic hero.

131
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,836
Is that how you see me?

132
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:26,658
C'mon baby to my comic

133
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:29,974
let's talk in bubbles,
and make noises like...

134
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:39,080
Pass out swings and uppercuts.

135
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,372
Make...

136
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,769
Then some BOUM, or HUMF
and even a SHEBAM

137
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:05,629
Let's enter the buildings

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,821
make WHIM while flying, then KLING

139
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:48,523
Don't be scared, take a CHRAK!

140
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,423
I'm here - CRASH

141
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,802
And to guard you - TCHLACK!

142
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,400
Close your eyes

143
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:58,524
Hold me...

144
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,939
And the third song?

145
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,520
Say you're mine.

146
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,689
I am very much with you.

147
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:23,555
This is my first love song.

148
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,888
Listen. - Yes?

149
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,240
We have to record it in secret.

150
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:31,641
Is it obscene?

151
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:51,569
Don't come in now.

152
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,759
Brigitte Bardot is talking to Lucien.

153
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,054
Why here?

154
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,570
Why here?

155
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:05,194
There are photos with Lucien.

156
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:08,612
He wrote a song and her husband is mad.

157
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:09,900
He forbade her to sing.

158
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:11,884
Beware of married women?

159
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,841
Shut up!

160
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:34,717
Hello.

161
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,458
Hello, Mr.

162
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:37,954
Hello, Mrs.

163
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:41,173
Excuse me for the trouble.
- It's okay.

164
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:44,137
It's okay?
May I offer a glass of water?

165
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:46,437
- I have to go.
- No.

166
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:47,953
- Something to eat?
- Yes.

167
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:48,796
No thank you.

168
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,270
This song is very beautiful?

169
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,593
Nobody before sung about love like this.

170
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,235
Ah!

171
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,636
- What are you thinking?
- About what?

172
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:19,833
- About the house.
- I'll buy it.

173
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:21,001
You'll live alone?

174
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,010
I'm not alone. I have friends.

175
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:26,115
- Calle de Verneuil.
Doesn't Greco live there?

176
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:27,433
Yes, it is a good place.

177
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:30,838
Don't you want to spend Christmas here?
Will you come.

178
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,856
I'll make a party with many friends.

179
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,844
Well, as you wish.

180
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:16,083
No.

181
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:17,701
I'm not interested in this girl.

182
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:21,078
You promised me Marisa Berenson...

183
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,878
But she's a charmer.

184
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:27,727
After a relationship with Bardot...

185
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:29,118
do you think I would see her?

186
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,284
We know about Bardot!

187
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:33,769
Go back to your table.

188
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,194
Well, if it is for the film...

189
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,344
I can behave...

190
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,086
accordingly.

191
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:51,015
I did not know that dinner was over.

192
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,949
I thought you got bored with me.

193
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:57,027
It is not a reason to leave me like...

194
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:58,562
Like a child?

195
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,824
Boring, dumb, stupid.

196
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:03,174
Is that how you see me?

197
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:04,621
Of course not.

198
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:06,897
Ms Bourguignon, is very tired.

199
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,769
How did you call me?

200
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:10,762
It is not your name?

201
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,276
Bourguignon, it is a kind of a roast.

202
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:15,049
I don't know your name.

203
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:16,897
I know that you don't want
to make a film with me.

204
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,350
If the producer didn't con you...

205
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,341
...you wouldn't have come.

206
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,537
Enough!
- No, wait.

207
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:29,258
Look? This is beautiful.

208
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,039
You said that I have the legs of a child...

209
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:39,183
and a dress of a baby...

210
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,478
This looks good to you?
- No.

211
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:44,413
You look beautiful when you cry.

212
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,860
You look lost.

213
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,686
You look at me and talk about someone else?

214
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,305
Yes, I have a husband. Also a fool.

215
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,817
I know foolish husbands.

216
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,371
Your legs are beautiful.

217
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:01,140
And your dress is beautiful,
well, I don't know...

218
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,933
if it helps in this cold.

219
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:09,807
You're just saying it
that I stop crying.

220
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,803
I saved your life.

221
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,673
I'm always on the edge.

222
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:37,955
What do you mean?

223
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,188
I am always close to the death.

224
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,941
My cradle stands beside my coffin.

225
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,677
Stop those inflated sentences.

226
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:52,637
Don't you understand them?

227
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,666
They are beautiful.

228
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:58,144
You tell them to many girls.

229
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:05,251
I'a wounded animal not knowing
how to enchant you.

230
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:08,849
You have to speak more slowly
for me to understand you.

231
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:14,075
Told you I could lose...

232
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,647
an intention to kiss you.

233
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,077
A pity

234
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:23,028
Because I have one.

235
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,208
Serge, may I look?

236
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:06,117
No, not yet ready.

237
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,295
Let me see.

238
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,900
No going well.
I'll jump in a river.

239
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:17,783
Serge!

240
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:20,654
Like your countrywoman
Ofelia in "Hamlet".

241
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,714
You're beautiful.

242
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:26,244
You're beautiful.

243
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,968
I'm very, very happy!

244
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,477
That is a tragedy.
I don't know how to draw any more.

245
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,949
Could you stop playing with a gun...

246
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,939
...while we are going on the sand.

247
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:57,453
It could go off in a slightest pit.

248
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:59,875
Is it loaded?
- Obviously.

249
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,677
You have any intentions to use it?

250
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:03,874
Possibly.

251
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,269
If Alain Delon touches my bride...

252
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:09,050
I'll kill them and then shoot myself.
Reasonable enough?

253
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,008
Yes.

254
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:11,215
Sure.

255
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:14,739
And now what?

256
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:17,525
We are stuck in the sand.

257
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,361
Do something, shit.

258
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:21,407
Serge!

259
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:26,999
What a beautiful car.

260
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,405
Lincoln Continental.

261
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:30,681
The same as Alain Delon has.

262
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:32,869
It is good to have a big car.

263
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,040
We could take Kate's things.

264
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,876
You finished the shooting?

265
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:39,634
We could go by car...

266
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:42,086
I had my scenes.

267
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:44,600
Could somebody be with Kate.

268
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:46,738
Can you guard her?
- What?

269
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,760
No, stay with me.

270
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:49,761
I don't have time.

271
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:52,241
It is important.
A film with Alain Delon!

272
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,000
And what we are doing now?

273
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:15,493
You know...

274
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,697
I came here since I was a kid.

275
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,337
Before switching on gas...

276
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:29,585
she thinks about her canary.

277
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,476
Before saying bye to life

278
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:38,477
once and for all

279
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:45,786
she takes the cage

280
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,979
goes to the balcony

281
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:54,884
and the cold wind of the winter

282
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:57,123
embraces her.

283
00:22:57,424 --> 00:23:00,109
It causes chills

284
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:02,546
It looks bad to me.

285
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:04,312
Of course not.

286
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:07,022
You have a superb fragility.

287
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:08,451
Excuse...

288
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,417
I didn't speak about the song.

289
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:13,252
It was about your clothes.

290
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:17,061
I don't like it.
- But...

291
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:20,604
Perhaps you could give it
a more neglected look.

292
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:23,018
Open your shirt.

293
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,217
Let the hair grow a bit...

294
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,492
and a bit of beard.

295
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,065
You're upset?

296
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:38,720
You are not going to teach
elegance to a roasted meat.

297
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,782
Let's return to the song.

298
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:49,078
Meanwhile in London

299
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:52,994
The night slowly descends

300
00:23:55,749 --> 00:24:01,051
upon the table with a sleeping girl

301
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:09,936
You can read scribbled in pencil

302
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,745
These few words:
"Canary.

303
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:22,155
...is on the balcony".

304
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,106
No, you don't have to go.

305
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:28,279
Not yet.

306
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:30,276
And this

307
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:31,164
Okay.

308
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:32,952
This is your new "Nana".

309
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:35,312
This is a surprise for you.

310
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:38,002
Nana is your name?

311
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:05,508
You know what you're doing?

312
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,378
Excuse me?

313
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:11,986
You wanted like Pygmalion...

314
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,192
take a girl and sculpt to your desires?

315
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,848
You're doing exact opposite.

316
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:21,025
Your English girl says:
"You should dress like this...

317
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:23,797
..."comb like that"...

318
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:26,804
and you obey like a fool.

319
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,647
A fool that has chosen his master.

320
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,835
Get lost, I don't need you any more.

321
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:31,923
Quickly!

322
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,257
You prefer her to me?
Are you okay?

323
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:37,738
Yes, exactly.

324
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:42,718
And don't come back no more.

325
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:47,007
What do you say?

326
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,607
I like my new image.

327
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:51,782
I see...

328
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:03,567
Ah!

329
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:08,098
Are there news from London?

330
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,433
Still raining?

331
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:11,861
Sit down.

332
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,693
Listen to this.

333
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:36,603
I love you

334
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:39,280
I love you, yes, I love you

335
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:43,081
Neither do I.

336
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:46,797
Oh, my love

337
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,521
Like a wave

338
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:54,366
undecided

339
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,813
I'm coming and turning back...

340
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:06,182
between your hips.

341
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:12,160
I'm coming and turning back...

342
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:14,611
between your legs.

343
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:19,208
And then I stop.

344
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:21,094
I love you

345
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,565
I love you, yes, I love you

346
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:26,262
If we publish that...

347
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:28,854
we are going to the prison.

348
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:32,296
Me like producer, you like an author.

349
00:28:32,592 --> 00:28:35,891
I can take a risk but not for one song.

350
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:37,902
So, I propose...

351
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:41,543
take your umbrella, return to London...

352
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:45,214
...and bring me ten songs like that.

353
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:47,882
This will come out first.

354
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:52,718
It would be a scandal.

355
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,320
Perhaps it will be.

356
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:58,161
Enormous scandal.

357
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,655
Honey, now...

358
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:12,774
I would like to move on
to something serious.

359
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,078
You started to work on your record?

360
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:17,506
The symphonic one you told about?

361
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:21,482
I am marrying a British girl.

362
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,447
She's beautiful.

363
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,337
She's not bad.

364
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:29,757
Looks like me?

365
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,488
Not a bit.

366
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:38,661
Serge?

367
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:40,651
You know...

368
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,121
we'll have a baby.

369
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:56,685
It is okay with me.

370
00:30:57,837 --> 00:31:00,419
Completely.

371
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,686
Right now.

372
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,839
What's your name?

373
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:10,013
Melody.

374
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:12,195
Melody Nelson.

375
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,001
It is good that you could call us.

376
00:31:29,302 --> 00:31:31,042
To what hospital?

377
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,385
American.

378
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:38,738
What is this awful thing?

379
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:42,118
I have my own from Hermes.

380
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:43,723
We don't have time.

381
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:46,679
A cream coloured blanket of Hermes.

382
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,806
Bring it quickly.

383
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,297
Let's put him on the trolley.

384
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:55,652
I don't want to lie down.

385
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,510
If I go in lying down
I won't come out.

386
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,700
I'm responsible,
I want to deliver you intact.

387
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:04,310
Come on.

388
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:07,186
I want to go out on foot.

389
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:08,896
I'm the one who's paying.

390
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,003
You're an idiot!

391
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,324
Dear...

392
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:37,660
You're scared?

393
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,329
They told me it's benign.

394
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:45,702
You have to smoke less,
and stop fooling around.

395
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:48,641
- And the press?
- It is a secret.

396
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:52,486
Then what's good to fell ill?
Give me a phone.

397
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:57,729
France Soir, please.

398
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,685
I have news:
Gainsbourg had an infarct.

399
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:03,132
Almost died.

400
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,775
Now it is better.
He's preparing a disc, rather dirty.

401
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,403
Is it better?

402
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,523
Bring me my cigarettes.

403
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:14,171
No.

404
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:30,569
I told you I don't want
to see you any more.

405
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:35,579
Let's smoke a pipe of peace.

406
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:50,689
Let's get out of here.

407
00:33:50,977 --> 00:33:52,319
Pack your bags.

408
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:53,510
I can't.

409
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,441
They want to take a picture
of me in my deathbed.

410
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,320
Oh!

411
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:00,486
You didn't tell me that.

412
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,766
I wouldn't like to miss it.

413
00:34:04,023 --> 00:34:07,288
The martyrdom of Saint Sebastian.

414
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,301
Camera flashes like arrows.

415
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:14,857
How do you intend to recover?

416
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,129
I would like to increase...

417
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,737
the amount of alcohol...

418
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:23,817
and cigarettes I consume.

419
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:38,160
Mister Sun

420
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,643
because I don't admire him enough

421
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,987
Denies me his fire,
but I spit on his fire

422
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:48,371
because I have a date with you.

423
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:51,808
The light I prefer

424
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:55,290
comes from your jealous eyes.

425
00:34:55,575 --> 00:34:58,282
The other things don't worry me

426
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:02,002
because I have a date with you.

427
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:05,500
Mister landlord

428
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:09,084
because I left all broken

429
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:11,892
threw me out of his house,
but I spit on his house

430
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:15,615
because I have a date with you.

431
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:19,311
Because I have a date with you.

432
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:27,222
I have a date with you.

433
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,558
Serge...

434
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,338
We are in a hurry.

435
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,426
You'll be late to the stage.

436
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:43,804
You want to be crushed?

437
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,254
Don't you?

438
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:46,973
I'll wait for a taxi, shit!

439
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:51,860
Hi beauties.

440
00:36:52,158 --> 00:36:53,978
What do you do here on the ground?

441
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,921
I have a concert in 30 minutes.

442
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:59,695
I don't know how to get there.

443
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,821
I sold my Rolls Royce.
I have left only the cap of the radiator.

444
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:21,993
Don't touch me!

445
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:55,519
Paint your lips really bright

446
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:58,529
Grease your hair

447
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:02,966
Let's dance a...
- Nazi rock, nazi...

448
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,488
Dance the...

449
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:08,904
Nazi rock, nazi...

450
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:11,373
Let's dance the...

451
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:14,811
Nazi rock, nazi...

452
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:29,312
Lucien.

453
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:32,764
Even the girls don't cry
so much for this dog.

454
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:36,283
You didn't cry so much for your father.

455
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:44,095
Take yourself in hands!

456
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,079
Look at me.

457
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:50,492
Comb your hair.

458
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:56,210
Do you want that little
Charlotte see you like that?

459
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:59,144
They are used to how I look.

460
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:02,046
Why don't you operate your ears?

461
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:05,855
Right...

462
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:14,196
Eh Gainsbarre, you look like us,
like a cabbage head.

463
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:19,344
I am a cabbage head.

464
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:22,471
Half man, half vegetable.

465
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,098
What did you do?

466
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:08,053
Now I see more clearly.

467
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:25,041
Why are you still up?

468
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:27,663
And you?

469
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:35,529
Put down the things in their places...

470
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,423
and go to bed. Shit!

471
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:41,891
Next time play in your room.

472
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:43,159
This is mine.

473
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:45,780
Your things are scary and horrible!

474
00:41:46,118 --> 00:41:50,259
You are scared of professor Flipus?

475
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:52,501
Don't be scared, it is made of paper.

476
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,293
Why Flipus?

477
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:58,290
- Reminds my brother.
It makes me flip over.

478
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:00,913
You don't have a brother.

479
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:13,369
- Before I was born
my mother had another child.

480
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,774
But he didn't live long.

481
00:42:16,082 --> 00:42:18,630
All my life I feel him watching

482
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:20,419
from his grave...

483
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,381
Is he watching us too?

484
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:25,112
Because of him
I can't go to bathroom at night.

485
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:27,244
That's why she pisses on the carpet!

486
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,107
- Eh!
- That's not true.

487
00:42:29,628 --> 00:42:31,414
That's okay, Sparrow.

488
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,035
And you...

489
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,968
You're an informer.

490
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:37,166
Yes...

491
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:46,895
You hear something?

492
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:48,157
Eh?

493
00:42:50,383 --> 00:42:52,044
What are you doing?

494
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:55,164
Flipus is ill,
we are operating him.

495
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:57,113
What does he have?

496
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:59,196
- Something serious.
He's dead.

497
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:08,571
No. He's lost.

498
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:11,007
We have to releave him from suffering.

499
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:22,740
But...

500
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:24,721
You're a complete idiot.

501
00:43:25,818 --> 00:43:28,036
Calm down, Sparrow.

502
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,207
Kate, Charlotte...

503
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:31,536
Let's go.

504
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:35,362
- No...
- And not a word!

505
00:44:11,664 --> 00:44:13,962
Easy.

506
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:16,854
Mister, you're an artist?

507
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:18,534
His famous?

508
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,088
He's Picasso?

509
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:22,192
No, guys.

510
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:24,836
I'm a French singer.

511
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:27,442
I write songs.

512
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:28,610
Songs in French.

513
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:31,371
I love you, I you neither.

514
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:33,809
I wrote it.

515
00:44:34,153 --> 00:44:35,893
I know Brigitte Bardot.

516
00:44:36,188 --> 00:44:37,689
I... I...

517
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:40,562
I fucked her.

518
00:44:43,028 --> 00:44:45,246
I know "Marsellaise".

519
00:44:52,571 --> 00:44:55,028
- I wrote that too.
- Are you...

520
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:55,921
...that famous?

521
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:57,140
Yes.

522
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,370
Why do you look so angry?

523
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:42,359
They ask what will you sing.

524
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:45,795
I can't explain sexual songs.

525
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:48,150
Why? Don't they fuck?

526
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,121
For them reggae is not a fun...

527
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:52,056
It is holy music.

528
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:54,358
Yes.

529
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:57,170
Say that we shall sing Marsellaise.

530
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:00,300
What?

531
00:46:04,777 --> 00:46:05,675
Ok...

532
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:10,051
It is...

533
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:11,857
a French battle song.

534
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:14,440
One, two, three...

535
00:46:40,946 --> 00:46:44,131
Come, children of the Fatherland,

536
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:47,601
The day of glory has arrived!

537
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,458
Against us about the tyranny,

538
00:46:51,757 --> 00:46:54,305
The bloody banner is raised,

539
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:57,938
To arms, citizens, and so on.

540
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,080
Do you hear into the countrysides,

541
00:47:11,377 --> 00:47:14,437
of those ferocious soldiers wailing?

542
00:47:14,747 --> 00:47:17,727
They're coming right into your arms

543
00:47:18,017 --> 00:47:21,555
To cut off the throats your sons and wives!

544
00:47:21,854 --> 00:47:24,800
To arms, citizens, and so on.

545
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:38,052
Sacred love of the Fatherland,

546
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:41,363
Lead, support our avenging arms

547
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:44,256
Liberty, cherished Liberty,

548
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:48,320
Fight with thy defenders!

549
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:51,117
To arms, citizens, and so on.

550
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,878
We shall follow their way

551
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:08,654
When our elders are no longer there,

552
00:48:08,934 --> 00:48:11,073
There we shall find their dust

553
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:15,942
And the trace of their virtues.

554
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:19,108
To arms, citizens, and so on.

555
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:54,796
Bastard!

556
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,139
They'll kill you!

557
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,634
Fucking, Gainsbourg!
You're dead!

558
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:04,364
La Marsellaise...

559
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,367
Let's go!

560
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:34,871
My Jamaicans...

561
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:37,019
this is not their problem.

562
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:39,187
They come from Kingston.

563
00:49:39,992 --> 00:49:43,689
They are scared of police.

564
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:47,247
And the bomb threats...

565
00:49:50,002 --> 00:49:50,900
...in their hotels.

566
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:53,544
I'm not giving up!

567
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:57,660
I returned to "La Marsellaise"
the original meaning.

568
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:02,110
I'm asking you to sing with me.

569
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:04,681
Come, children...

570
00:50:04,983 --> 00:50:07,201
...of the Fatherland.

571
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:11,091
The day of glory has arrived!

572
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,335
Against us about the tyranny,

573
00:50:15,627 --> 00:50:19,085
The bloody banner is raised,

574
00:50:19,398 --> 00:50:22,856
The bloody banner is raised.

575
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:27,150
Do you hear into the countrysides,

576
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:31,546
of those ferocious soldiers wailing?

577
00:50:31,844 --> 00:50:35,382
They're coming right into your arms

578
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:39,662
To cut off the throats your sons and wives!

579
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:43,251
To arms, citizens,

580
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:46,934
Form your battalions,

581
00:50:47,226 --> 00:50:51,287
Let's march, let's march!

582
00:50:51,597 --> 00:50:54,737
So one impured blood

583
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:58,730
Waters our furrows!

584
00:51:04,443 --> 00:51:06,741
Form our battalions!

585
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:11,358
Let's march, let's march!

586
00:51:11,683 --> 00:51:14,311
So one impured blood

587
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:17,212
Waters our furrows!

588
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:27,815
- Recording a parody of
La Marsellaise...

589
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,638
...Gainsbourg, without any doubt,
figured out a good business.

590
00:51:31,937 --> 00:51:34,314
Looking in the mirror,

591
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,508
...Gainsbourg wants to create
a society with his own face.

592
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:41,511
Dripping eyes, beard's growth...

593
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:44,395
...of 3 days, hanging lips.

594
00:51:45,484 --> 00:51:48,226
When I look at Serge Gainsbourg...

595
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,227
I'm feeling myself an ecologist...

596
00:51:51,523 --> 00:51:53,821
...fighting the pollution of his
personality and creations...

597
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:56,310
...that smell of exhaust pipe.

598
00:51:57,296 --> 00:52:00,322
The most delicate aspect of
this odious chaos...

599
00:52:00,632 --> 00:52:02,577
...is antisemitism.

600
00:52:02,868 --> 00:52:05,086
If there are propagators...

601
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:07,508
...there are also...

602
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:09,513
...provocateurs.

603
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:13,379
Serge Gainsbourg is
provoking the antisemitism

604
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,456
for his own financial gain.

605
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:38,001
Jane left.

606
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:42,990
Little Charlotte lives with her mom,

607
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:48,044
but my mother is in heaven.

608
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:50,139
And my dad...

609
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,298
Will still be proud of me?

610
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:56,884
- Gainsbarre!
I saw you in "puppets".

611
00:53:09,101 --> 00:53:12,241
Jane because I'm too crazy.

612
00:53:29,621 --> 00:53:33,239
First I shall with my mative tongue...

613
00:53:33,558 --> 00:53:36,982
reveal your thoughts

614
00:53:38,597 --> 00:53:41,054
but already you are

615
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:45,030
floating in the tides of the seas

616
00:53:47,939 --> 00:53:51,477
- Miss! Mr. Gainsbourg
wants to invite you to a drink.

617
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:56,091
This old fool?

618
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:06,868
- I think about you like
about target,

619
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,616
divided in four parts,
my beauty...

620
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:12,782
The old idiot came himself.

621
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:21,730
I warn you - I'm completely mad.

622
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,905
Need a dad?

623
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:25,962
I want to be saved.

624
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:32,497
That's how life is.

625
00:54:37,355 --> 00:54:39,494
Please stop.

626
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:40,291
Stay!

627
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,049
You'll go...

628
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:47,501
...when I tell you.

629
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:53,910
You comply with my estetical needs.

630
00:54:54,706 --> 00:54:56,731
Your diaphanous beauty...

631
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:59,863
...and the despair of your tragic figure.

632
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:08,099
You understand what I'm talking about?

633
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:09,774
That you want to sleep with me?

634
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:13,625
Perhaps.

635
00:55:16,762 --> 00:55:19,265
But I say it in more poetic way.

636
00:55:24,636 --> 00:55:26,058
By what I see...

637
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,522
you're so drunk
that you can't harem me.

638
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:31,108
So...

639
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:37,709
in a horizontal plane,
could anyone complain about me.

640
00:55:38,717 --> 00:55:41,299
- I'd like it better
if you'll be my daddy.

641
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:51,172
- This manuscript is written
and signed by Rouget de I'Isle.

642
00:55:51,463 --> 00:55:55,604
And dated on August 7, 1793
in Choisy Le Roy.

643
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:59,539
We are auctioning this manuscript
of Marsellaise qualified by...

644
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:01,658
...I'Isle as an "old silly poem".

645
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,967
The starting price is
40000 francs.

646
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:08,655
- 50000.
- 53000.

647
00:56:08,947 --> 00:56:12,007
- 55000.
- 100000.

648
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:12,863
115000.

649
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:14,573
- 120000.
- 125000.

650
00:56:14,853 --> 00:56:16,753
- 130000.
- 135000.

651
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:18,569
Nobody else?

652
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:21,041
Sold for 135000 francs.

653
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:29,933
It is rather costly.

654
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:32,603
Almost ruined me.

655
00:56:43,281 --> 00:56:45,101
I thought it will be a girl.

656
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:57,555
Looks like mother,
that is better.

657
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:02,638
Do we call him like dad.

658
00:57:03,435 --> 00:57:04,299
King Serge?

659
00:57:04,903 --> 00:57:06,370
No, Lucien the Second.

660
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:08,810
Called to reign like dad.

661
00:57:09,507 --> 00:57:11,964
And don't forget Navarre.

662
00:57:12,544 --> 00:57:15,559
The sun shines seldom

663
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:17,668
and the happiness is rare.

664
00:57:19,017 --> 00:57:23,033
And the love is wandering
all through the life.

665
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:27,886
The sun shines seldom

666
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,923
and the happiness is rare

667
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:35,996
but everything changes
when embraced by the tune.

668
00:57:37,002 --> 00:57:39,368
The walls of...

669
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:44,199
the maze are opened

670
00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:47,398
...to infinity

671
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:02,687
The sun shines seldom

672
00:58:02,961 --> 00:58:05,327
and the happiness is rare

673
00:58:05,664 --> 00:58:11,182
but everything changes
when embraced by the tune.

674
00:58:46,671 --> 00:58:50,516
I love Gainsbourg too much
to return him to life.

675
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:59,503
I prefer his inventions to the truth.
