1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello? Dad?

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,400
What? Leukemia?!

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
I understand.

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,700
Lili!

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,280
Lili!

6
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,330
Doctor, what exactly is her condition?

7
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,770
I can handle the results.

8
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,530
If it's really leukemia,

9
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,430
how many years do I have?

10
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,220
Every sickness is different,

11
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,230
but generally the chance of surviving 5 years is 10%.

12
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,100
So that means

13
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,820
I have 5 years, at most.

14
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,120
No!

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,200
Lili, don't worry. It's alright.

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,220
Yes, Lili. Take care of yourself, be more optimistic.

17
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,150
When your mother fell ill,

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,610
didn't they keep saying there was a low chance it could be cured?

19
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,880
But hasn't she been doing well?

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,100
There are medical advances everyday.

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,000
My mom won't be able to handle it when she hears I'm sick.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,220
Don't worry about your mom. I'll take care of her.

23
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,630
You need to take good care of yourself.

24
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,480
Take it easy. Don't worry.

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,470
No matter how hard it might be,

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,240
I'll do whatever it takes

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,100
to help you through this crisis.

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,330
The cause of cancer is extremely complex.

29
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,700
But, based on your situation,

30
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,800
it's probably hereditary.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,620
Uncle Liu, when you married my mom

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,170
did you know about this?

33
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,620
She and I may become a large burden on you.

34
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,310
A life-long burden.

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm more than happy

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,290
to look after you two.

37
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,640
I'd be happy.

38
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,170
Coming!

39
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,110
Coming!

40
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,790
How come you three all come back together?

41
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,470
I have something in the oven.

42
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,030
Mom!

43
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,270
Lili, what's wrong?

44
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,880
- Aunt Li-<br>- Don't.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,090
It's all Qianren's fault.

46
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,770
Qianren's company started an initiative to find errors,

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,310
He scolded Lili harshly in front of everybody.

48
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,590
Of course Lili feels wronged.

49
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,460
I asked what happened downstairs just now.

50
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,520
I, I told him off, too.

51
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,770
Lili. Is it necessary to cry like this?

52
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,190
What really happened?

53
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,050
Sorry, Aunt Li. I was definitely in a bad mood today.

54
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,030
Once this came up, I couldn't control my temper.

55
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,590
I upset Lili today.

56
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,080
Don't worry. I'll look after her in the future.

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll never upset her again.

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
Such a silly child.

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,050
Wasn't it just criticism on your work?

60
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,260
What's the big deal?

61
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,150
Qianren is stern so you'll do better in the future.

62
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,270
Alright, alright. Don't cry.

63
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,810
If you keep crying, I will scold you.

64
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,880
Aunt Li, don't scold Lili.

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,550
Let her cry to her heart's content today.

66
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,250
Tomorrow is a new day.

67
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,760
- Lili.<br>- Mom.

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,010
We haven't spoken in awhile.

69
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,570
Let's sleep together today, ok?

70
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,180
Of course, tonight

71
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,580
mom will sleep with you.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,020
The soup will all boil off soon.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,660
Mom, I'll help you.

74
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,000
You have to help Lili keep her illness a secret.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,300
Especially from her mom.

76
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,570
Dad, when you got married to Aunt Li,

77
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,330
you didn't worry her illness might relapse?

78
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,340
If I say I wasn't, I'd be lying.

79
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,850
But being with her everyday

80
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,490
makes me happy. That's most important.

81
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,610
But, you knew all along about Lili's hereditary history.

82
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,840
You don't mind one bit?

83
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,910
Lili is Aunt Li's daughter.

84
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,770
I love her like I love you. Why would I mind?

85
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,120
When you love someone, you love everything about them.

86
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,940
Qianren, wait until the day you sincerely fall in love.

87
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,550
You'll experience the same feeling.

88
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,230
Dad, I want to discuss something with you.

89
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,580
I want to take care of Lili.

90
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,710
As more than siblings.

91
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,570
I want to take care of her for the rest of my life.

92
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,270
If you sincerely and truly mean that,

93
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,280
I support you.

94
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,970
Thank you, dad.

95
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,390
Mom.

96
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,740
It's been a long time since I slept under the same blanket as you.

97
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,500
I miss the time when I would make my way into your covers everyday.

98
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,460
You're so old and still acting spoiled.

99
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,790
Mom.

100
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,700
Do you remember right after dad died

101
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,410
every night you would sit by my bed

102
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,420
and lull me to sleep?

103
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,400
Sometimes, when you thought I was asleep,

104
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,610
you would break down and secretly cry.

105
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,020
How did you make it through then?

106
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,520
When your dad passed,

107
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,090
I felt like the sky would collapse.

108
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,810
When your father was alive, I couldn't even cook.

109
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,360
Let alone change a light bulb or fix the water heater.

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,790
Many times, I thought

111
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,830
about leaving with your father.

112
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,910
But looking at you, I absolutely couldn't leave you.

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,750
I could only carry on making you food, washing your clothes,

114
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,450
watch you laugh, watch you cry.

115
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,230
And life went on like that.

116
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,920
Sometimes, I think that old saying makes a lot of sense.

117
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,050
Between husband and wife, the first one to leave

118
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,650
suffers less.

119
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,470
And the one left behind, every day, every month,

120
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,020
lives in suffering.

121
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,540
I'll be with you a lifetime, we'll never be apart.

122
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,440
Whether we go to heaven or hell,

123
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,900
I will always be with you.

124
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,250
If I make him watch me

125
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,930
slowly walking towards death, what will

126
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,210
Pei Shangxuan's life become?

127
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,590
Anyway, luckily,

128
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,690
I met Uncle Liu.

129
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,910
Unlce Liu is a good person.

130
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes. During the most difficult time of my life,

131
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,440
meeting your Uncle Liu

132
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,330
used all my life's luck.

133
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,130
But I'm most grateful for the change in Qianren.

134
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,360
When I got sick this time, he not only found a specialist

135
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,000
but brought me medicine. While doing so many nice things,

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,400
he never brought it up once.

137
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,230
He's really a good kid.

138
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,440
Lili, in the future you have to repay

139
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,980
Uncle Liu and Brother Qianran.

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,950
Li Jun was just here.

141
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,190
She dropped those off and left

142
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,250
not long ago.

143
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,230
Jun

144
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,220
Hello? Jun. You came by.

145
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,580
I returned all the stuff you gave me.

146
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,000
Since we're over, there's no need to keep them.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,960
I've returned them to you, cut things off cleanly.

148
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,170
I won't take back the things I gave you.

149
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,670
Keep them as souvenirs.

150
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,050
If you really don't want them,

151
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,540
throw them away.

152
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,000
Why don't you throw them out yourself?

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,510
Also, throw out that necklace I gave you.

154
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:42,640

156
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,040
Where did you go, young man?

157
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,310
I thought that you went missing, I almost

158
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,350
cancelled all your afternoon appointments.

159
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,720
Da Wei, those advertisements have lost their meaning.

160
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,240
I've decided to go to Korea and experience some more.

161
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,930
Really? That's great!

162
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,480
Could you please immediately prepare the plane tickets and the contract,

163
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,440
before I regret this.

164
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,720
I'll go do it now!

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,370
<i> I shall wear the "Golden Hoop" (used in the novel "Journey to the West" to keep the Monkey King under control)</i>

169
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,240
<i>so that I'll think about my girlfriend everywhere and at any time.</i>

170
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,700
<i>At least you know.</i>

171
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,050
<i>This is the string pulling the kite.</i>

172
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,280
<i>When you see it, you'll think of its owner.</i>

173
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,500
<i>-Let me put it on for you.<br>-Okay.</i>

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,730
<i>I'm done.</i>

175
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,260
Everything has ended. Good bye.

176
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,870
I worked so hard to get here

177
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,950
I never thought, before accomplishing anything,

178
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,620
I have to leave.

179
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,030
Lili, your newest design plan received great customer reviews.

180
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,570
First, recover.

181
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,360
The future is full of possibilities.

182
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
You don't need to console me.

183
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,540
I know my situation.

184
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,200
I've already contacted the best hospital in Beijing.

185
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,420
They're researching a new form of treatment.

186
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,740
If you can't recover,

187
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,980
they might at least extend your life

188
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,050
until the medicine is more advanced.

189
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,380
You can turn this around.

190
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,880
Why are you wasting your energy on someone who's going to die?

191
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,250
I just want to leave quietly.

192
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,430
Those pointless hopes can only bring me and my loved ones

193
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,980
even more suffering.

194
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,020
I don't want you to die.

195
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,340
We're a family.

196
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,950
Not just me, your mom and my dad.

197
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,970
Especially your mom.

198
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,970
Do you plan to keep hiding the truth from her?

199
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,700
Then one day, we suddenly tell her you're gone.

200
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,170
Tell her there was a chance you could have survived.

201
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,290
But you didn't tell her.

202
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,800
Wait until the parent sends off the child.

203
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,610
Do you think she will accept it?

204
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,630
You think she won't suffer this way?

205
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,650
Aunt Li is a great woman.

206
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,910
She's already suffered too much in this life.

207
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,680
Her only source of strength to continue is you.

208
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,640
So, Lili, if you aren't a selfish girl

209
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,090
put in your best effort.

210
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,270
For this family,

211
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,310
for you mom. You must strive to live.

212
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,630
Help me set up going to Beijing.

213
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,360
And, before deciding on surgery,

214
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,040
besides you and Uncle Liu,

215
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,610
I don't want anyone else to know.

216
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,000
Including him?

217
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,930
Lili, why did you suddenly quit? We can't bear to see you go.

218
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,840
Yeah, you're the best out of all the new people. Keep it up!

219
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,470
Lili, you're the best. Good luck.

220
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,090
Lili, we have faith in you. Good luck!

221
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,640
Good luck.

222
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,940
Thank you for looking after me.

223
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,610
No problem.

224
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,160
Yichen, today is my last day at Aochuang. I want-

225
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,470
Sister Li, I was looking forward to working with you.

226
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,350
I never thought you'd be leaving. It's too sudden, too unbearable.

227
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,270
No matter if what you said is true or fake,

228
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,160
the past is the past.

229
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,540
There's no need to be angry at someone you'll never see again.

230
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,900
It's meaningless.

231
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,640
Lili, you're really leaving.

232
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,260
Because I'm transferring for work

233
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,230
I might have to move to another city.

234
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,410
This room...

235
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,630
Why don't you find another girl to room with?

236
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,440
I don't want to.

237
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,870
This place will always be reserved for my best friend, Lili.

238
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,800
That day you came home drunk scared me.

239
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,870
Are you and Daniel really going to leave it like this?

240
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,280
It's nothing I can't bear.

241
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,130
Jun,

242
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,250
You're the most thick-skinned girl I've met ever in my life.

243
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,970
I hope you make full use of this talent

244
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,910
to quickly forget that bad guy, Daniel.

245
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,460
As long as you're on my side,

246
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,830
even if I'm faced with greater difficulties, I can immediately respawn with full health.

247
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,090
Boys come and go, best friends are forever.

248
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,560
You're the best.

249
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,120
Oh yeah. If you're going away for work,

250
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,540
what will Pei Shangxuan do?

251
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,100
Long distance makes cheating more likely. You have to be careful.

252
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,750
I know.

253
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,860
Lili, are you here?

254
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,850
Speak of the devil.

255
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,460
Are you there, Lili?

256
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,420
LIli.

257
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,900
Where did you run off to? Did you know if I hadn't found you, I was going to the police station?

258
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,850
I'm fine, I was just too busy with work.

259
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,960
Is there something wrong?

260
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,240
Your face is so pale. Are you alright?

261
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,850
I'm great. I told you before

262
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,690
about the company sending people to Beijing.

263
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:18,080
They've decided that they want me to go.

264
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,300
What's your decision?

265
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,470
I think it's a good opportunity.

266
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,850
I can come into contact with resources of top industrial insiders.

267
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,560
I don't want to give this up.

268
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,500
But, if I go, it'll probably be for a long time.

269
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,200
My future work and even my whole life

270
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,320
might all move to Beijing.

271
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,840
I've thought about it,

272
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,210
it's not fair to you.

273
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,780
- So...<br>- Silly girl.

274
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,300
What are you thinking? Leaving such a handsome boyfriend all alone in Shanghai,

275
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,360
and going by yourself to Beijing,

276
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,570
Aren't you afraid that someone else will take this opportunity and take your place?

277
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm afraid that you're going to have to suffer in an unfamiliar environment.

278
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,660
Don't think too much, I'll go with you.

279
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,730
No, you just started your business,

280
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,780
all of your resources are here.

281
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,300
If you go to Beijing,

282
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,170
you'll have to start over again.

283
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,570
Don't forget, if it wasn't for you,

284
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,140
I would still be working at the bar right now.

285
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,570
You pulled me out of the mire and gave me a life full of hope.

286
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,540
So no matter where you go,

287
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,660
wherever you go is my next destination.

288
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,670
You've already done enough for me.

289
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,100
You should think more about yourself.

290
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,780
Your world is so big, it doesn't just have me in it.

291
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,050
What if one day...I were to leave this world before you...

292
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,220
Then that would be my last day in this world.

293
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,110
Without you, what's the point for me living by myself?

294
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,720
How about going to be with you.

295
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,330
If not, I'll be a living like a zombie.

296
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,910
You musn't.

297
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,990
I forbid you from having such silly thoughts!

298
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,070
No matter what happens, you have to continue to live well.

299
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,540
Otherwise, how could I leave this world in peace?

300
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,480
Li Li, what's wrong?

301
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,370
You're talking so strangely, as if we were to part and never meet again.

302
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,940
Are you sure you are okay?

303
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,410
It's probably because I'm about to go to Beijing.

304
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,570
Farewells always make one feel hurt.

305
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,420
Look at yourself.

306
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,200
Then when are you leaving for Beijing?

307
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,170
After I take care of some matters for the company, I'll go find you.

308
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,540
The date isn't set yet.

309
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,000
Northern winters aren't like Southern winters. Even if winter is over, it still won't warm up as quickly.

310
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,570
When the time comes, tell me in advance, I'll help you--

311
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,400
Don't you worry about these things, the company will take care of it.

312
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,580
But you

313
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,250
When I' not around

314
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,850
you have to take care of yourself.

315
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,570
This is my biggest wish.

316
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,940
Idiot.

317
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,700
Aren't we going to see each other very soon?

318
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,780
Li Li

319
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,500
Eat by yourself. Such good dishes, why don't you eat more?

320
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,190
Li Li, are you okay? You don't look too well.

321
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,010
Look at you, white as a sheet of paper

322
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,320
Are you okay?

323
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,470
I'm okay.

324
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,550
I'm just worried about company things.

325
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,640
Really?

326
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,930
Auntie Li,

327
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,300
the company wanted to send some capable workers off to Beijing.

328
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,550
Li Li was chosen because CEO Lao admired her.

329
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,170
Leaving home to another place for work is a big thing.

330
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,290
She's probably feeling indecisive about that.

331
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,620
Going so far as Beijing.

332
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,230
When you want to come back home on New Year's day or other festivals, you'll run into increased passenger transportation.

333
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,750
Then the days when we mother and daughter can see each other will decrease even more.

334
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,320
Mei Qing, look at yourself.

335
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,190
Li Li just graduated not long ago and already got recognized in a leading position.

336
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,550
You should be happy for her, right?

337
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,120
As parents, don't we want the best for our children?

338
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,040
You're men, how can you understand the feelings of mother and daughter?

339
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,270
Ever since Li Li moved out,

340
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,100
I always look forward to her coming home every weekend to eat.

341
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,560
But now she's going so far away,

342
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,980
I won't even have a chance to wish such a thing anymore.

343
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,080
Listen to what you are saying,

344
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,780
Beijing, Beijing isn't that far. It's not overseas.

345
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,700
If you miss Li Li that much, we can...we can move to Beijing.

346
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,450
That's right, Aunty Li.

347
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,390
And this time I've also been assigned to Beijing.

348
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,980
If you and Dad want to go, then we can all go as a family.

349
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,560
Living there is also very convenient and there are lot of places that are worth to visit.

350
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,350
Like the Bird's Nest (Beijing 2008 Olympic stadium), the Water Cube (National Aquatics Center), the Great Wall or the Forbidden City. You two can go to all these places.

351
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,370
Mom, I will miss you.

352
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,230
But I have to go.

353
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,660
Enough,

354
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,720
just accept it, okay?

355
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,090
You guys are so in tune (working together), I can't object even if I want to.

356
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,260
Then you go. Our family will go together.

357
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,160
Okay.

358
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,930
Let's go as a family.

359
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,010
Come, eat.

360
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,290
You also eat some prawns.

361
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:19,370
♫<i> Do you still remember the images left on the window after the rain? </i>♫

362
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:26,110
♫<i> The diary entries are all about us two. </i>♫

368

♫<i> It might be because I don’t know how to express myself. </i>♫

375

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,190

♫<i> looking for your direction in life while carrying dreams. </i>♫

378
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,460
Li Li, Li Li Are you home? Li Li

379
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,020
Li Li

380
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,820
Auntie, can I ask you

381
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,080
where is the family on the second floor?

382
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,150
Oh, you're talking about the Liu family?

383
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,270
They moved out.

384
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,250
Heard that their children found work out of town.

385
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,110
The parents followed to retire.

386
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,920
Ey, then do you have their contact information?

387
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,130
Oh this child.

388
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,130
How can I have their contact information?

389
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:56,010
<i>Sorry, the number you dialed has turned off their phone. Please call again later. </i>

390
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,060
Where have you gone?

391
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,910
Here, drink it while it's hot.

392
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,030
I don't want to drink.

393
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,260
You have to eat something for your body to get better.

394
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,820
The tour I booked for Aunty Li at most only has half a month left.

395
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,760
If you mother sees you ill after coming here,

396
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,520
then I can only tell her the truth.

397
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,160
Stop telling me more,

398
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,210
I'll Drink.

399
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,220
Here.

400
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,760
Here, I'll go with you to the bathroom.

401
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,940
You go.

402
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,040
Go out.

403
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,530
It's really boring staying in hospital, isn't it?

404
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,100
Do you want me to bring you some books?

405
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,770
Then you rest for a bit. I'll bring you some water.

406
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,560
Cover yourself well.

407
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,510
Birds.

408
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,970
What did you say?

409
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,930
Will you get me some paper and pen?

410
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,710
Okay.

411
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:54,060
♫<i> It must have been hard for you to make this decision, too. </i>♫

412

413
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,960
♫<i> You probably understand me. </i>♫

414
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,420

415

♫<i> So many promises can’t be fulfilled together, </i>♫

416
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:24,100
♫<i> but a promise needs to be taken seriously by one person. </i>♫

420
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,390
<i>Li Li, when you left, I looked for you like crazy.</i>

421
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,870
<i>I looked in every corner where our memories are hidden.</i>

422
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,640
<i>I finally believed that I lost my Li Li.</i>

423
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,640
<i>Did you know?</i>

424
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,140
<i>"None Off the Field" got another seven teams today.</i>

425
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,770
<i>-I'm working hard to make them better.</i>

426
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:02,170
<i>But next year, can we go see the migratory birds together?</i>

427
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:13,040
<i>I want to become a free bird in my next life.</i>

428
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,120
<i>Not being confined by any bonds. Even if I'll die far away.</i>

429
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:24,310
<i>The feathers that I leave will also prove that I have been to this world.</i>

430
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,960
Li Li, you didn't listen to me again. Why are you out here painting when it's this cold out?

431
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
Hurry and put this over yourself. What happens if you get cold?

432
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,980
I'm about to be bored to death just sitting in the hospital room all day.

433
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,040
I wanted to finish painting this today because it was sunny out.

434
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:52,320
I heard that there's a migratory birds painting exhibition recently. Maybe you can go and try.

435
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,380
To contribute? I don't really understand.

436
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,260
As long as you're interested, I'll prepare it for you.

437
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:07,420
Thank you, Qian Ren. These years, you've taken care of me too well.

438
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,980
I'm about to slowly become an idiot at living life.

439
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,790
I'm sorry for bothering you for so long.

440
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,080
Don't say such ridiculous things. I promised Auntie Li to take care of you my entire life when she was sick.

441
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,220
You and Uncle Liu have treated us more than well.

442
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:37,780
You don't have to take that promise too seriously.

443
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:44,180
To anyone, my situation right now is a burden.

444
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,420
You're wrong, Li Li.

445
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:52,120
It's my life's biggest accomplishment to make you smile everyday.

446
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,480
I want to stay by your side forever.

447
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:06,280
Li Li, can you agree to that promise today?

448
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,800
Let's discuss that after we take care of Mom's business. Okay?

449
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,920
Okay.

450
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,100
<i>Li Li,</i>

451
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:17,940
<i>stop crying. With you guys beside me, I can leave peacefully.</i>

452
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:26,480
<i>The only thing I regret is not being able to witness your marriage.</i>

453
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,880
Mei Jing, We're finally back after 6 years.

454
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:41,680
On the way here, all that I saw were skyscrapers. A lot of old buildings were destroyed.

455
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,640
But thankfully,

456
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,500
our house is still here.

457
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:54,660
Mom. Uncle Liu, Qian Ren, and I have moved back.

458
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:00,280
I kept imagining you after moving back.

459
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:07,180
Every time I go back, there will be the food you made. You liked to sometimes chatter with me interminably.

460
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:14,540
But now, I... I want to hear more of your whining.

461
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:23,060
Li Li, Auntie Li told us to never shed a tear for her.

462
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:29,110
Plus, your condition now can't handle stressful things.

463
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:39,970
It's all thanks to you and Uncle Liu that we were able to prevent my mother from knowing.

464
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,940
If not, she wouldn't have left peacefully.

465
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,280
We're one family, don't talk as if we were two.

466
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:03,090
Auntie Li, don't worry. I will take care of Li Li for my entire life.

467
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:13,560
Qian Ren, you have to remember that you're saying this in front of Auntie Li.

468
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:25,660
Li Li, with Qian Ren taking care of you, your mom and I can both be at ease.

469
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,780
-Hello, Mr. Pei.<br>-Hello.

470
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:08,120
Thank you for supporting this migratory birds themed painting . I sincerely express our heartfelt gratitude as the representative of the wetland protection association.

471
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:14,280
No problem, I, myself, am also a fan of observing birds.These contributions don't count towards anything.

472
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:20,360
All of the paintings here are related to birds, but only this painting has a feather signifying a bird.

473
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,380
I'm interested in the artist. Would it be possible for you to set up a meeting?

474
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,340
This artist signed a contract with us to keep their identity anonymous when giving us this painting.

475
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,740
We can not give you any information on the artist.

476
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,380
Am I not allowed to know even her age and gender?

477
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,340
I'm sorry about that.

478
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,060
But she did say that there was a chance of her coming here to the gallery.

479
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,380
-You two may be able to meet by coincidence.<br>-Thank you.

480
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,790
Thank you.

481
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,720
Li Li, don't move. Let me do it. Sit.

482
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,120
Cleaning up isn't tiring. I'm fine.

483
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,200
Just sit there and watch me tidy up.

484
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:27,070
Oh right, have you decided if you wanted to open your own business or take over the position as CEO yet?

485
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:31,180
Opening up my own design company takes too much of my time and focus.

486
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,900
I'll just use my time to take care of you and Dad.

487
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,120
But it's every designer's dream to open up their own company.

488
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,000
You don't have to give it up for me.

489
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,940
Li Li, don't think foolishly.

490
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,360
Aochuang is a great platform. Furthermore, Director Zhang wants me to stay.

491
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,780
Why would I go out and risk it when I have such a good opportunity?

492
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,160
-Do you really think that way?<br>-Yeah.

493
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,300
Right, I have something to discuss with you.

494
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:16,020
The painting exhibition in which you helped me to contribute is opening today. I want to go and have a look.

495
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,760
Uncle Liu always opposed me going to places with a lot of people.

496
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,280
But this is my first time going to a gallery. I really want to go.

497
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,800
Then let's convince Dad to meet up with his old friends and I'll take you out secretly.

498
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,780
But you have to promise me that we'll come back as soon as you see it.

499
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,880
Okay.

500
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Hello. It's me.

501
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:32,940
Yes. I'll ask Secretary Jiang to send you the files on the most recent idea.

502
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,960
Remember to check your inbox.

503
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,840
Yes. Yes.

504
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:48,860
Right, the speed with which our company is bringing out the concept should be considered as fast.

505
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,300
Yes. I also told Secretary Jiang to add in

506
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,600
some problems that we met. When you read it,

507
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,200
<i>let's discuss how to solve it. Is that fine?</i>

508
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,340
I'm going the day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow.

509
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,600
If you don't have anything planned the day after tomorrow, we can meet up and discuss it.

510
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,020
Okay. Bye.

511
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,940
The pieces here are really high quality.

512
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:29,650
No matter whether the technique of composition or the apply of colors,

513
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,220
the artists' hard work are visible.

514
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,080
The works this time are all done very carefully.

515
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,860
-Let's check the other side out.<br>-Let's go.

516
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,360
Mr. Pei, I'm sorry. We're already closing.

517
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,860
Thank you.

518
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:29,360
<i>Fifteen Years of Waiting for Migratory Birds Preview</i>

519
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:35,480
<i>Marrow and joint aches appeared. The patient's condition is getting worse.</i>

520
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,260
<i>She's back.</i>

521
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,060
<i>Oh my god. Li Li, where have you gone for these past 7 years?</i>

522
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,280
<i>Pei Shang Xuan is still single even after 7 years.</i>

523
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,120
<i>You see, isn't he faithful?</i>

524
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,060
<i>Hello, Lee Jun? I still need you to help me with one more thing.</i>
