1
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,372
Oh, God, it's too
damn cold out here.

2
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,570
Hey, Francis.

3
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,873
Hey, Pee Wee.

4
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,709
Get back in town?

5
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,649
Yeah. Have you seen
Helen around?

6
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:14,950
No, I haven't seen her
in a couple of days.

7
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,285
Well, I'll catch up
with her.

8
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,188
Hey, bum.

9
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,588
Hey.

10
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:53,592
You're looking good.

11
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:55,958
Where'd you get
them shoes?

12
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:58,657
The hospital.

13
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,401
I got the...

14
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:05,529
I got the whole outfit
up at the hospital.

15
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,563
Oh.

16
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,841
Doc says I got cancer.

17
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,279
First thing I ever got.

18
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:18,682
Cancer?
No shit.

19
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:21,414
He says, "You're gonna
die in six months. "

20
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:23,888
I said, "Well,

21
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,289
I'm gonna wine myself
to death. "

22
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,294
He said, "Man,

23
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:31,024
it don't make no difference
whether you wine or you dine.

24
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,589
You're going. "

25
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,601
Shit.

26
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:36,897
Well, Grandma...

27
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,007
Too bad.

28
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,476
Got a jug?

29
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,480
I got a dollar.

30
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,482
Nurse Hopper...

31
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,040
Nurse Hopper
gave a dollar.

32
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,712
You're in business.

33
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,744
Want to work
with me today,

34
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,519
get some money?

35
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,152
I had some last night
but I blew it.

36
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:04,163
Get us a jug,
a place to flop.

37
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,131
Could be cold tonight.

38
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,633
Work where?

39
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:12,100
Up at the cemetery,
shoveling dirt.

40
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:15,073
A fella told me
they was hiring.

41
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,599
Do they pay you money

42
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:20,135
or do they give you a free grave
when you croak?

43
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,980
If it ain't money,
forget it.

44
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,918
I ain't shoveling out
my own goddamn grave.

45
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,549
Little streams
of alcohol

46
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:35,288
Come a-trickling down
the rocks...

47
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,388
I knew that guy Grogan
when I was a kid.

48
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:43,198
He used to own all the electricity
in this town.

49
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,500
Well, he ain't got
much of it now.

50
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:48,871
Don't bet on it.
Them kind of guys

51
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,739
never give up
on a good thing.

52
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:12,064
Say, Franny...

53
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
you looking for anybody
special up there?

54
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:21,270
Might be.

55
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,146
You want to be buried
under a stone like that?

56
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,947
I never knew no bum
buried under a gravestone.

57
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,855
I don't need me
no stone.

58
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,118
This soldier is gonna
have to die alone.

59
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,559
If you die first
I'll send out the invites.

60
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,960
Hey, Gerald.

61
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,994
How are you doing, kid?

62
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,343
Kind of nice up here.

63
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,579
Pretty across the creek.

64
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,657
I don't know
if you know it or not,

65
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,661
but you're up here

66
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:26,153
with the rest
of the family.

67
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:29,862
Your grandfather's
just four graves down.

68
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,630
Oh, Jesus God.

69
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,514
I'm sorry, boy.

70
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,954
It wasn't
because I was drunk

71
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,650
that I dropped you.

72
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,289
All's I had
was four beers

73
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,889
after I come home
from work.

74
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,565
You slipped out
of that diaper

75
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:08,665
and your mother...

76
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,508
"Sweet Jesus!"...

77
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:18,946
crouched down
and snatched you up.

78
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,155
And I didn't touch you

79
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,350
because of the way
you looked.

80
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,463
Your brother...
Billy comes in and says,

81
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,993
"Why is Gerald
so crooked?"

82
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,941
Jesus Christ,
I remember everything.

83
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,451
I remember everything.

84
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,192
I even remember

85
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,286
the red and yellow squares
on the linoleum...

86
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,595
when you fell.

87
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,435
Hey, Franny.

88
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:23,142
Hey, Franny,

89
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:25,275
the truck's here
to take us back down.

90
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:41,222
Yeah.

91
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:54,108
You know somebody
that's buried up there?

92
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,671
Yeah, a little kid.

93
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,683
A little kid?

94
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,116
What did he do,
die young?

95
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:03,054
Pretty young, yeah.

96
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,058
Damn.
What happened?

97
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,186
He fell.

98
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,219
Fell where?

99
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:14,822
On the floor.

100
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,301
Fell on the floor?

101
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:21,898
Well, I fall on the floor
about twice a day.

102
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:25,138
I ain't dead yet.

103
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:28,636
That's what you think.

104
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,052
Well, where are we
headed now?

105
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:44,961
What do you care
where we're headed?

106
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:47,295
Got an appointment?

107
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,301
No.

108
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,963
You got tickets
to the opera?

109
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,130
No.

110
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,640
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Go ahead, sweetheart.

111
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,842
I just like to know
where I'm headed, that's all.

112
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,246
You ain't known where you've been headed
for 20 years.

113
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:05,546
You got a point there.

114
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:08,748
Go by the mission and see if anybody
knows where Helen is.

115
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:11,052
What is Helen's name?

116
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,717
Helen.

117
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:15,124
No, what's her
other name?

118
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,493
She's only got one name.

119
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:22,163
You don't want to tell me,
that's all right.

120
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,635
Damn right
it's all right.

121
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,245
You gonna eat over
at the mission tonight?

122
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,582
That preacher puts out
a pretty good spread.

123
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,215
I had a bowl of soup
over there yesterday

124
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,817
'cause I was starving,
but, God, it was sour.

125
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,885
Them old bums
are just hungry.

126
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:52,363
They don't believe
in nothing.

127
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,526
I used to live
around here

128
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,800
when I was married...

129
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,807
that house
right there.

130
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:05,572
Oh, yeah?

131
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,603
When was the last time
you were here?

132
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,809
22 years ago.

133
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,047
Who lives there now?

134
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:16,987
Some people
I used to know.

135
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,864
Still got the diamond.

136
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:28,526
I used to play there
when I was a kid.

137
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:32,469
I had a pretty good
throwing arm.

138
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:33,995
What year was that?

139
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:38,338
I don't know, 1901.

140
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:41,141
Yeah, I was
five years old.

141
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,011
How old are you now,
eight?

142
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:49,415
We had a trolley strike
that year.

143
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,719
- Hey, wait up.
- Hey, come on.

144
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:55,193
Hey, you old grumpy,
give us some candy.

145
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,195
Hey, give us
some candy.

146
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,925
Scabs.
Come on, you scabs.

147
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,627
Lousy scabs.

148
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:25,249
You see
what's up ahead?

149
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,259
I don't want
to hit anybody.

150
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:28,851
Keep the speed.

151
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,645
Scabs! Scabs!

152
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,077
You don't belong here.
Go on home.

153
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,814
Scabs off that car!

154
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,821
Get that scab
off that car!

155
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,624
- He's got no right to run it.
- Yeah!

156
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:06,324
You get off the tracks.

157
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,662
You take this car
back to the barns.

158
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,833
You won't
get through here!

159
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,215
They busted his head.

160
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,425
At the ready!

161
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,169
Fire!

162
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,625
I think you killed him,
Francis.

163
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:11,653
You'd better run.

164
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,467
Why did you kill me?

165
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:54,371
I didn't mean
to kill you.

166
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,898
Was that why you threw that stone
that broke open my skull?

167
00:19:57,943 --> 00:20:01,174
My brains float out
and I die.

168
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:04,876
Scabs get
what they ask for.

169
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,011
Then you feel
no remorse.

170
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,221
You dirty bastards,

171
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,590
taking our jobs,

172
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,925
keeping us
from feeding our families.

173
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,759
Odd logic
coming from a man

174
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:20,697
who abandoned
his own family.

175
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,293
You haven't been home
in 22 years.

176
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,312
I dropped my baby son.

177
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,871
He died.

178
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,214
I couldn't face that.

179
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:45,085
A coward... he'll run.

180
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:48,389
You have no arguments
to justify what you did.

181
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,827
I got arguments!
I got arguments!

182
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:55,097
What do you got
arguments about?

183
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:58,900
I ain't gonna sit here and argue
with some goddamn dead scab, see?

184
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,098
See?

185
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,168
Why don't you please
sit down?

186
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,617
I ain't no dead scab.

187
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:20,853
Well, you look like one.

188
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,098
Blessed be the name

189
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,532
Blessed be
the name

190
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:32,059
Blessed be the name

191
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,072
Of the Lord

192
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:41,569
He breaks the power
of canceled sin

193
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:47,416
He sets
the prisoner free

194
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:53,517
His blood can make
the foulest clean

195
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,051
His blood
availed for me...

196
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,327
Never mind the blood.
Just pass the soup.

197
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,834
Blessed be the name

198
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:05,428
Blessed be
the name

199
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,405
Blessed be the name

200
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,135
Of the Lord

201
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:12,939
Blessed be the name

202
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,776
Blessed be
the name

203
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,612
Blessed be the name

204
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:21,848
Of the Lord.

205
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,497
Now I'd like to ask all you lost
and hopeless men,

206
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:34,499
who will give you
a ride

207
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,865
on the turnpike
to salvation?

208
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,462
Jesus will.

209
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:42,133
Jesus delivers.

210
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:45,337
Is there a man here
who wants a different life?

211
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,107
God says,
"Come unto Me. "

212
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:51,014
Take Him at His word.
Come down front now

213
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,280
and kneel
and be saved.

214
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,463
All right then.

215
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,131
Mmm.

216
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:15,697
- Amen, brothers.
- Amen.

217
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:18,539
Wake up, bum.
The soup's on.

218
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,941
Hey, Pee Wee,
Helen still didn't come in?

219
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,350
No, and I've been
here all day.

220
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,644
Glad to see you
staying straight, Franny.

221
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,045
I believe that I've got
a job for you.

222
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:59,482
I worked today
up at the cemetery.

223
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:00,849
Splendid.

224
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,320
Well, shoveling dirt
ain't all that splendid.

225
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:06,051
Well, maybe this one's
a better one.

226
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,491
It's old man Rosskam,
the rag picker.

227
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:09,892
He needs a helper.

228
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:11,896
If you're serious about
staying off the hooch

229
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,955
he might put together
a decent pay.

230
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,967
Well, I'm gonna
talk to him.

231
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,992
- I appreciate it.
- Fine.

232
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:20,004
I'll tell you what else
I'd appreciate

233
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,165
is a pair of socks
if you could spare 'em.

234
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,835
The ones I got's
all rotted out.

235
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:36,282
Hey, God damn it,
where'd you grow up, in a barn?

236
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,812
Close the door.
It's cold in here.

237
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,333
Where have you
been hiding?

238
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:57,899
Oh, a fat lot you care
where anybody is or isn't.

239
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:00,207
I could have been dead in the street
three times over.

240
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,110
You wouldn't have known
a thing about it.

241
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,548
How the hell could I, with you walking away
like a goddamn crazy woman?

242
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,484
Oh, who wouldn't be
crazy around you?

243
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,384
Spending every penny we get
and drinking whisky.

244
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,389
- Stop that screaming.
- God, Francis,

245
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,017
you're bad enough on wine,
but on whisky...

246
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:17,722
oh, you're a devil.

247
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:20,254
I got six bucks.

248
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,700
Yeah?

249
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,408
Where did you get it?

250
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:32,706
Working all the damn day
out at the cemetery,

251
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:35,076
shoveling graves.

252
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:38,911
Wonderful.

253
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,317
Wonderful.
Splendid.

254
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:43,719
Hmm?

255
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:46,553
And you're sober.

256
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,117
And you're eating.

257
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,129
Yeah, and I ain't
drinking tonight either.

258
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:53,597
Oh, that's so lovely.

259
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,863
I'm very proud
of my good boy.

260
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,699
Try these on for size.
They're good and warm.

261
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,368
Just what I needed.

262
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,707
I thank you for them,
Chester.

263
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,212
It's fine
you're off the drink.

264
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,511
You've got a strong look
about you today.

265
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:13,109
Oh, just a false face
for Halloween.

266
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:15,915
Don't run
yourself down.

267
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,856
How are you, little lady?
I see you're doing well.

268
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,860
I'm perfectly
delightful.

269
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,293
Good.

270
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:25,296
He says I'm doing well.
I'm doing just fine

271
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,195
and I don't need any Methodists
telling me...

272
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,826
Don't fight him.
He'll just take the socks away.

273
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,802
Oh, Franny, with $6

274
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:34,931
we could rent a room and get our suitcase
and phonograph back, huh?

275
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:38,807
Hey, you see who's
in town, Francis?

276
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,369
Oscar Reo.

277
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,779
Oscar Reo that used
to sing on the radio?

278
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,476
That's the fellow.

279
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:47,917
He blew the big time
on booze, but he dried out

280
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,921
and tends bar now
at the Gilded Cage.

281
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:52,788
Ooh, I was in love
with his voice, you know.

282
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:54,883
I wrote him fan letters.

283
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,952
Well, we threw a drunk with him
down in New York,

284
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:58,929
didn't we, Pee?
Two, three days, wasn't it?

285
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,898
The most musical drunk
I ever seen.

286
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,798
Yeah.

287
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:12,803
Okay, folks,

288
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,278
time to close up.

289
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:19,450
Francis,

290
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:22,078
where do you plan to sleep tonight,
do you know?

291
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,088
The weeds.

292
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:26,886
Where did you sleep
last night,

293
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,449
Finny's car?

294
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,461
No, not in Finny's car.

295
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,896
I will absolutely not
stay in that car another night.

296
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,891
I was at Jack's.

297
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:39,961
I thought you didn't like
Jack no more,

298
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:42,064
and Clara neither.

299
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,304
They're not
my favorite people,

300
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:47,505
but they gave me a bed
when I needed one.

301
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:20,402
Look at this.

302
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,428
Is she dead?

303
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:40,090
Hey, Sandra,

304
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,100
it's me, Rudy.

305
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,102
Are you dead
or just drunk?

306
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:47,529
She's just drunk.

307
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,077
She can't hold it
no more.

308
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,272
She's a goddamn
Eskimo.

309
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:56,780
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

310
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,306
Whether she's an Eskimo
or whether she ain't,

311
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:01,546
she'll freeze
out here.

312
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,578
Then dogs will come along
and eat her ass up.

313
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,185
Is she a bum
or just plain drunk?

314
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,195
She's been a bum
all her life.

315
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:14,357
Oh, nobody has been a bum
all their life.

316
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,368
She had to be something else
before she was a bum.

317
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,633
Well, she was a whore,
you know, in Alaska.

318
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:23,197
What about
before that?

319
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,869
Well, I don't know.

320
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:28,903
I guess maybe she was
just a little kid.

321
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:34,082
Well, that's something.

322
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,212
A little kid's something.
It ain't a bum.

323
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:39,223
It ain't a whore.
Come on.

324
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:42,021
Let's get her up.

325
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:45,187
Yeah yeah yeah.

326
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,993
You're gonna freeze
to death tonight.

327
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:50,024
I slept outside
last night.

328
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,536
It was cold.

329
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,971
I'm gonna get you
a bowl of hot soup

330
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,372
and you won't
freeze up so fast.

331
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:58,671
Who are you?

332
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,837
Just a bum.
But I can get you some soup.

333
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,278
Get me a drink.

334
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:05,408
No, I don't have money
for that.

335
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,851
Ooh, she can't
come in here.

336
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:10,650
Chester won't let her.

337
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,749
What are we supposed
to do with her, let her freeze?

338
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,657
You know him.

339
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,329
All right, God damn it.

340
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:24,768
Get her a bowl
of hot soup

341
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:26,794
and a blanket.

342
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:34,968
Franny, the ambulance
this morning wouldn't take her anymore

343
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,311
when she was
bleeding to death.

344
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,841
Slit her throat.
Maybe they'll take her.

345
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:42,513
She doesn't want
an ambulance.

346
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,522
She just wants
to sleep it all away.

347
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,524
I'll bet she doesn't
even feel cold.

348
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,526
She's a cake of ice.

349
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,326
Just 'cause you're drunk
don't mean you don't feel cold.

350
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:55,197
Here's soup.

351
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:57,201
Soup.

352
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,567
- You got soup.
- Got soup, yeah.

353
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:02,095
Here, have it.

354
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,401
See? She don't
even want it.

355
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:12,178
She wants it.
She's just pissed it ain't wine.

356
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:16,347
She told me she wanted
to be a nurse up in Alaska.

357
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:19,289
- A doctor.
- She wanted to be a doctor.

358
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:21,292
No.

359
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:25,387
A doctor wanted me
to be a nurse.

360
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,661
You didn't want that?

361
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,430
I did,

362
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,801
but he died.

363
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:37,069
Ah, love.

364
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,076
Love.

365
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:56,654
I can't look at her
no more.

366
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:05,770
Watch yourself there.

367
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:07,965
Hold your horses there.
We're walking here.

368
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:11,806
We're walking here.

369
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,437
But what I dreamed

370
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:19,781
Of thee

371
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,878
I love you

372
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,389
As I never

373
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:30,520
Loved before

374
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:33,531
When first I met you

375
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:39,299
On the village green

376
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:41,703
Come to me

377
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,972
For my dream of love

378
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:50,471
Is all

379
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,847
I love you

380
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:55,785
As I loved you

381
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,417
When you were sweet

382
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:07,227
When you were
sweet

383
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:16,833
16.

384
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:21,608
Wonderful.

385
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:25,946
Oh, that's just won...

386
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,952
- God bless your voice.
- Yeah.

387
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,284
Why thank you, miss.
Can I get you a drink?

388
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:31,880
That beer looks
a tad light.

389
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:34,255
- You said you wouldn't drink.
- I said wine.

390
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,487
Thank you so much.

391
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:39,929
I think I know
you two Turks.

392
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:42,558
Well, you'll be
thinking right,

393
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,034
except you wasn't sporting that
pussy-tickler

394
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,766
last time I seen you.

395
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:51,105
You guys got me drunk
in New York.

396
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:53,110
And vice versa.

397
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:55,112
Francis Phelan,
Oscar.

398
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:57,114
- And this here is Rudy the Kraut.
- Francis.

399
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:59,116
He's okay
but he's nuts.

400
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,118
My kind of fella.

401
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:03,780
- Pee Wee Packer. Good to see you.
- Pee Wee.

402
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:05,915
- Introduce me.
- And this here is Helen Archer.

403
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:09,324
She hangs out with me.
I'll be goddamned if I know why.

404
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,030
Have one of those
yourself, Oscar.

405
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:19,161
No, I don't drink
anymore.

406
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:21,434
- Me neither.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

407
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,441
Well, I haven't managed
to turn it off yet.

408
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:26,103
I'm gonna wait
till I retire.

409
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:29,671
- Still getting rich.
- You're a sport.

410
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:31,682
Can't tell you from
those swells over there.

411
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:34,207
A flower.
Thank you.

412
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:38,313
Swells and bums...
ain't no difference.

413
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:42,588
Except that swells
want to look like swells

414
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,754
and bums want
to look like bums.

415
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:48,596
- Am I right?
- You're a smart fellow.

416
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:52,228
That was such a wonderful
song you just sang.

417
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,433
I remember when you
sang that on the radio.

418
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,805
Oh, I used to sing
that song myself.

419
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,208
A singer?
Where was that?

420
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:04,147
Oh, everywhere...
concerts,

421
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,241
and then I sang
every night on the air.

422
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:09,412
- You should do us a tune.
- Yeah.

423
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:12,287
No, I couldn't,
the way I look.

424
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,951
You look as good
as anybody in here.

425
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:17,291
- Oh, stop it.
- Come on, huh?

426
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:19,956
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

427
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:23,331
Now if you're gonna
get up there and sing,

428
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:26,337
you're gonna have to
put on the dog a little.

429
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,566
Oh, Francis.
He'd get a little money

430
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:30,574
and the first thing
he'd do would be

431
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:32,633
to buy me roses.
Wouldn't you, Fran?

432
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,703
- Sure would.
- Yeah, we were lovebirds then.

433
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:38,875
We had
a beautiful apartment

434
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,885
up on Hamilton Street
there.

435
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,319
Goddamn dead men,

436
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:45,686
traveling around
together...

437
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,621
wearing flowers.

438
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:55,394
- Yeah.
- When was that?

439
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,333
I don't remember
you living anyplace that long.

440
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:59,097
Oh, sure.

441
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,867
'35. We was here six weeks
or something like that.

442
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:03,874
No, it was more.

443
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,705
Months. We were here
almost a year.

444
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,734
Well, Helen would know.

445
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,646
- I can't call one day different from the next.
- Francis wouldn't stop drinking

446
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,582
and then we couldn't
pay the rent, you see,

447
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,881
so we had to give up
my old Steinway piano

448
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,944
and the Havilland china,

449
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:18,956
the very best
you could buy.

450
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,355
When you buy,
buy the best.

451
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:21,915
My father
taught me that.

452
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,394
Why don't you
sing us a tune, Helen?

453
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:26,158
- No.
- Sing us a tune.

454
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,062
- No no.
- Yeah yeah, come on.

455
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,158
- Sing us a tune.
- Well...

456
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:32,169
Just a little one, huh?

457
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:35,036
- Yeah.
- Come on, Helen.

458
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:37,541
- Come on.
- Oh, well...

459
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:42,612
Listen, does your friend know
"He's Me Pal"?

460
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,137
He knows everything.

461
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:45,706
Huh?
Yeah.

462
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,945
Well, people used to like
the way I sang that.

463
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,032
A real old-time trouper
will now sing us a song...

464
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,036
the lovely Miss...

465
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,061
Helen Archer.

466
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,574
...Helen Archer.

467
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:19,879
I would like to sing this
for my man Francis.

468
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,881
I know a lad

469
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,551
And when I feel bad

470
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:32,029
He scares
all my troubles away

471
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,031
When he's your friend

472
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:36,761
He's yours
till the end

473
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:41,636
No matter
what others may say

474
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,641
He don't tell me

475
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:46,007
How I ought to be

476
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:50,447
He likes me
just as I am

477
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:53,143
And when I feel blue

478
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,846
He's the one
I go to

479
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:58,515
'Cause his heart
is as big

480
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:03,118
As a ham

481
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:06,892
He's me pal,
he's me pal

482
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:10,560
There ain't nobody else
I can see

483
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:13,867
I know he's dead tough,
but his love is no bluff

484
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:17,238
He'd share his last dollar
with me

485
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:20,608
I'd rather have him
and his 15 a week

486
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:24,513
Than be some old
millionaire's gal

487
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,349
He's the best ever was
and I loves him because

488
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:32,755
He's me pal,
he's me pal...

489
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:54,076
My pal is poor

490
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:56,910
But I am dead sure

491
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:58,916
He's better than
most millionaires...

492
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,612
Am I right?

493
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,985
I'm satisfied

494
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,388
When he's by my side

495
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:10,884
The joys and the sorrow
we share

496
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:14,193
I'd give my arm

497
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:16,700
To keep him from harm

498
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:21,797
He'd do the same thing
for me

499
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,966
He'll always be there

500
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:27,500
Stormy weather or fair

501
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,513
That's the reason

502
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:34,382
I likes him,
you see

503
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:39,288
He's me pal,
he's me pal

504
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:42,952
There ain't nobody else
I can see

505
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:46,259
I know he's dead tough,
but his love is no bluff

506
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,857
He'd share his last dollar
with me...

507
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,333
Wouldn't ya?

508
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:54,600
I'd rather be his
with his 15 a week

509
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,598
Than be some old
millionaire's gal

510
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:01,305
He's the best

511
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,813
And I loves him

512
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:06,976
He's me pal

513
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:17,053
He's me pal.

514
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:35,010
By God, Helen,
that's as good as it gets.

515
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:38,072
You were born
to be a star.

516
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:41,017
Oh, you think so,
honey?

517
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:43,418
He's the best
ever was

518
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:46,946
And I loves him
because

519
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,721
He's me pal

520
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:57,224
He's me pal.

521
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:19,623
Nice tune.

522
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:21,682
Thanks.

523
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,917
Mighty nice,
old gal.

524
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:50,011
Not bad at all.

525
00:41:50,054 --> 00:41:52,545
Have a glass on me.

526
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,757
It's a nice night,
isn't it, Fran?

527
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:02,425
Oh, yeah, nice.

528
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,525
Yeah.

529
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:12,499
Hey!

530
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:14,511
Get out!

531
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,843
Damn it,
get out of there!

532
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:20,044
Those animals
are always here.

533
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,278
Damn them.

534
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,379
Jesus Christ.

535
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:27,755
The worms crawl in,
the worms crawl out

536
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,522
They crawl all over
your nose and mouth

537
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,529
They eat the puss
between your toes...

538
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:34,531
Get away from me.

539
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,966
I got the money!

540
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:45,434
He got my money.
He got my money. Oh!

541
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,444
Little bastards!

542
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,446
Oh, gee.

543
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,880
- What's wrong with you?
- $15.

544
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,646
They got away.

545
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,915
$15!
$15, Francis.

546
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:59,445
Forget about the money.

547
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,618
We'll get more money
tomorrow.

548
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,788
- Oh, Jeez.
- Don't worry about the money.

549
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,195
$15, Francis.

550
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,789
Where'd you get $15?

551
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,630
$15 that Billy gave me
to get you out of jail.

552
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,295
God damn you, woman,
and your sneaky ways!

553
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,600
Hey! Hey!

554
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,234
Sandra's dead.

555
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:36,520
I'll bet
she prayed to die.

556
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,587
Her life wasn't
human anymore.

557
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:43,327
I want to go to church
in the morning.

558
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,460
Good.

559
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:47,471
What am I gonna
do with you now?

560
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:50,303
Hey, you can
stay here.

561
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:53,037
The beds are full but you can sleep
on a bench.

562
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:55,978
- I'd rather not.
- Sounds good to me, Pee.

563
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:58,345
Listen, we can go up to Jack's.
He told me I could come back.

564
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:00,612
- He said that?
- Yeah, "Come back anytime," he said.

565
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:03,142
Well, let's shag then.

566
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:09,214
You'll take care
of Sandra, Pee Wee?

567
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,525
- Yeah.
- What was her last name?

568
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:16,124
Never heard it.

569
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,135
It don't matter now.

570
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,660
Never did.

571
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,372
Rudy.

572
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,050
I went to Gerald's
grave today.

573
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,061
Gerald's?

574
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:46,495
You did?

575
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,658
That was the first time,
wasn't it?

576
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,928
Right.

577
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:57,338
Yeah, you've been thinking
about him these days. I know.

578
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:02,039
I never stopped
thinking about him.

579
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,742
I went to his grave
and talked to him.

580
00:45:05,783 --> 00:45:07,751
You talked to him, huh?

581
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:10,879
How did you talk to him?

582
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:12,889
I stood there
and talked to the grass.

583
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:17,194
Boy, I'm getting
nutsier than Rudy.

584
00:45:17,228 --> 00:45:20,664
Oh, you're not nutsy,
Francis.

585
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:23,360
You're back
in this town.

586
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:27,497
No, that ain't it.

587
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,870
Something Billy said...

588
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,901
I never told you that.

589
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:41,277
He says

590
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,879
Annie never
told anybody

591
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:48,449
about me
dropping the kid.

592
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:52,053
She never told who,
the police?

593
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:55,088
Nobody,

594
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:58,067
not Billy, not Peggy...

595
00:45:58,102 --> 00:46:00,502
nobody in the family.

596
00:46:00,538 --> 00:46:02,904
Ain't that something?

597
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,932
I can't believe
a woman

598
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:09,309
going through
all that stuff

599
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,314
and not telling
nobody.

600
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:13,782
Oh, you got these people
on your mind lately.

601
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:17,481
Maybe you ought
to go see them.

602
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:20,615
That wouldn't help nothing.

603
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:23,183
Get it
out of your system.

604
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,665
Dead sons of bitches...

605
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:46,178
being friendly.

606
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:03,690
What ails you now?

607
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:06,259
Everything ails me.

608
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:11,999
Oh, come on. At least you got
to sing a song.

609
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:14,533
Yeah, I did.
I sang.

610
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:17,877
I sang while Sandra
was dying over there.

611
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,144
Oh, come on, she was gonna die anyway.
Her time was up.

612
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:25,587
Oh, well,
I don't believe that.

613
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,591
I believe you die

614
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,957
when you can't
stand it anymore.

615
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:31,962
Take as much as you can,

616
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:34,123
then you...

617
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:38,397
you die when you can.

618
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:45,635
Well, that's as good a saying
as there is...

619
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,644
die when you can.

620
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:50,146
Yeah, well, I'm glad

621
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:52,649
that we agree
on something for once.

622
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:57,143
We get along all right...

623
00:47:57,188 --> 00:48:00,680
not a penny,
with no place to flop.

624
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:03,158
- We're on the bum.
- No, that's for sure.

625
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:06,527
Come on, let's get over
to Jack's

626
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,896
before he turns
the lights out on us.

627
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:22,377
Hey, Jack.

628
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:24,847
We've come by
to see you.

629
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:28,147
What's the chances
of a bum getting a drink?

630
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:40,488
Oh, it's cold for October.
They're calling for snow.

631
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,725
Feel my hands.

632
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,357
This is my home.

633
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,800
I ain't about
to feel your hands,

634
00:48:45,836 --> 00:48:48,168
your head either.

635
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,538
I don't see
any snow.

636
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:55,204
I had a bowl of soup at 6:00

637
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:57,214
but it disappeared.

638
00:48:57,248 --> 00:48:59,216
I gotta get
something to eat.

639
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,582
I don't care whether
you eat or not.

640
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,587
How about a soda pop,
Helen?

641
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:06,089
What?
Sure, Jack.

642
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:08,091
What kind of soda?

643
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:15,623
Come here.

644
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:20,433
You feel any better,
Clara?

645
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,564
No.

646
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:26,098
What's wrong
with your shoe?

647
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,170
I have a piece
of twine in it.

648
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:33,377
I got a shoelace
but I didn't put it in yet.

649
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:36,284
Then put it in.

650
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:42,225
Well, it's a new sweater
or something.

651
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:46,025
- Do you know where it is?
- Don't ask me.

652
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:48,998
Find it
and put it in.

653
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:52,002
I'm reneging.

654
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,469
You're what?

655
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:56,598
I'm reneging.
I don't like to do that.

656
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:01,044
Can I ask you
a question?

657
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:03,273
No.

658
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:06,841
She said no.
What do you mean, no?

659
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:10,183
What's he gonna ask?
Find out what's he gonna ask.

660
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,722
How's everything
been going?

661
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:26,931
I always thought you were
an intelligent man, Franny.

662
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:30,667
But you can't be,
the way you drink.

663
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:36,136
- You could be a charming man.
- That's right.

664
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,876
You could have $20 in your pocket
at all times.

665
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,611
Yeah, I told him that.

666
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:43,711
If I had $20
I'd spend it all on her.

667
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:44,982
Oh, sure.

668
00:50:45,022 --> 00:50:48,253
I don't want her
sleeping down in the weeds.

669
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:51,693
The weeds?
I never have gone that far down.

670
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:54,197
- It's not that far to go.
- Oh, pfft.

671
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:56,597
You slept in Finny's car
last night.

672
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:59,796
No, it was two nights ago
and that was the last time.

673
00:50:59,837 --> 00:51:03,102
If it comes to that again I will simply
get in touch with my people.

674
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,199
My people are very high class.

675
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,403
You really ought

676
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:10,436
to get in touch
with them, deary.

677
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:17,554
You ought to get
straight, Franny.

678
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:19,579
They need
men like you.

679
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:27,026
You can get yourself
a Victrola like that one.

680
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:30,522
Eh? Eh?

681
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,400
I had all that shit.

682
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:44,306
If you don't shape up
you'll die.

683
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:49,842
Maybe you're right,
Jack.

684
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:55,984
May I use
your bathroom?

685
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:58,756
Help yourself.

686
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:50,971
Remember that tune,
hotshot?

687
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:53,244
Poor little lamb

688
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:56,275
Now his fleece
has gone cold

689
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,019
Wakes up
in the morning alone

690
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:05,427
Poor little lamb
knows what's coming

691
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:09,228
Life is an empty cup

692
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:13,669
So let's go on a bummer
this summer...

693
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:18,231
Hold it right there!

694
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:24,041
Stop, damn it.

695
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,374
Get 'em!

696
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:33,216
Come on!

697
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,587
Help.

698
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:40,256
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

699
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,060
Come on.

700
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:51,998
You got him.

701
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:03,317
Who was the guy
that didn't make it?

702
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:06,754
Some Guinea horse thief.

703
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,088
What are they chasing
you for, buddy?

704
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:15,391
I forgot to shine
my shoes this morning.

705
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:25,837
So let's go on a bummer
this summer

706
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:31,246
Where we won't have
to be afraid

707
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:34,114
Where the world
will be

708
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:37,712
On a hummer, boys

709
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:40,348
And we'll laugh

710
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:44,087
And we'll drink
lemonade.

711
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,832
Lemonade.

712
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:52,426
Lemonade.

713
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:54,460
I used to sell it
out at the ballpark

714
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:55,801
when I was a kid.

715
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,069
That's when
I first started

716
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:01,635
hanging out with those
older fellows,

717
00:55:01,678 --> 00:55:05,239
playing ball.

718
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:08,251
Windy Evans used to play
in his jockstrap

719
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:10,651
and catch flies
behind his back...

720
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:15,118
a great ballplayer.

721
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:20,194
Hey, where did you get
them shoes?

722
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,027
I found them.

723
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:28,237
God damn it,
them's nice shoes.

724
00:55:28,271 --> 00:55:30,899
That's why I wear 'em.

725
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:09,540
I'm gonna cut off
your goddamn feet.

726
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,378
Well,

727
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,380
I'm real sorry

728
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:46,780
that I hurt your head
so bad.

729
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:50,617
But I had good reasons

730
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:53,316
'cause, you know,

731
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:56,018
I almost lost
a finger.

732
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:00,029
I couldn't do
anything right-handed

733
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:02,588
for a long time.

734
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:09,370
But I don't
hold grudges

735
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:11,465
for more
than five years.

736
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,538
See ya.

737
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:20,778
Thanks for
what you did.

738
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,287
Francis,

739
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:27,051
are you all right in there?
Who are you talking to?

740
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,449
Huh?

741
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:32,462
Yeah.

742
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:35,624
It broke.

743
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:37,997
Who are you
talking to?

744
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:44,171
Just thinking about
some of them old bums

745
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:47,506
that froze.

746
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:50,240
Foxy Phil Tooker...

747
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,748
the little guy froze

748
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:55,513
all scrunched up
with a red icicle

749
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:57,782
coming out of his nose.

750
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:59,413
Yeah.

751
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:02,118
Didn't even bother
to straighten him out.

752
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,556
Just buried him
in a half a coffin.

753
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,928
Yeah.

754
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,866
Hey, bum,

755
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,336
how about a bum
getting a drink?

756
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:16,737
I ain't no bum.

757
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:20,368
I know you ain't,
God damn it.

758
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,537
You're a good man...

759
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:26,946
a working man.

760
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:29,577
I knew
a fellow once

761
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:32,349
looked a lot
like Francis.

762
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:36,450
Oh, I had
the hots for him.

763
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:38,120
I'll bet you did.

764
00:58:38,161 --> 00:58:40,721
Clara never lacked
for boyfriends.

765
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:44,731
She's pretty sick.

766
00:58:44,768 --> 00:58:46,793
That's why
you can't stay.

767
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:55,375
I'm gonna tell you
something...

768
00:58:55,412 --> 00:58:57,846
I always thought
a lot of Clara.

769
00:58:57,881 --> 00:58:59,178
You're drunk, Francis.

770
00:58:59,216 --> 00:59:01,514
You just stay drunk
for the rest of your life.

771
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:03,348
I'm really
leaving you now.

772
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:06,321
What am I gonna do
with this woman?

773
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:08,324
Oh, it's late.

774
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:10,918
Yeah, people.

775
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:13,361
Gotta hit the hay.

776
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,037
Fix me a sandwich...

777
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:26,304
to go.

778
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:27,640
No!

779
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:29,872
You forget
when you were hungry

780
00:59:29,913 --> 00:59:31,881
you came to my place
begging for food.

781
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:35,009
- I never begged!
- He only asked you for a sandwich.

782
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:37,849
- Women.
- I'll go and make him a sandwich.

783
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:40,254
Jeez, Fran.

784
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:43,418
Sharp cheese...
you like sharp cheese?

785
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,758
It's my favorite.

786
01:00:01,912 --> 01:00:04,278
Good night, pal.

787
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:06,714
Best of luck.

788
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:12,953
See you around.

789
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:18,491
Toodle-oo.

790
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:23,499
Now where in the hell
are you gonna sleep?

791
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:25,592
I wouldn't stay there
if they gave me mink pillows

792
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:27,603
and silk sheets.
That's right.

793
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:30,197
I remember her
when she was whoring

794
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,504
and always broke.

795
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,510
I had to speak my mind,
that's all.

796
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:37,104
Yeah, well, it didn't
accomplish anything.

797
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:39,581
Here, have a piece
of sandwich.

798
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,846
I don't want that.
It'll choke me.

799
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:44,547
It won't choke you.
You'll be glad for it.

800
01:00:44,587 --> 01:00:46,248
I'm not a phony.

801
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:48,985
- I'm not a phony either.
- Oh, you're not, eh?

802
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,993
Hey, I'll kill you...
what I'm gonna do!

803
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,154
I'm gonna knock you
across the goddamn street.

804
01:00:53,196 --> 01:00:54,993
Now be a goddamn woman.

805
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:56,999
That's why you can't find
nowhere to flop.

806
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:00,670
I asked for a sandwich.
Did I get it?

807
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:04,435
Yeah, you're stupendous
and colossal.

808
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:07,136
Don't you squint
your eyes at me

809
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:10,544
or I'll knock you across
a goddamn automobile.

810
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,105
You've been a pain in the ass
for nine years!

811
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:17,619
Jack told me
that I could stay,

812
01:01:17,654 --> 01:01:20,452
but you can't because you're a pain
in the ass!

813
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:22,287
They don't want you.

814
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:23,622
Now I'm gonna eat
that sandwich.

815
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,185
Go head, eat it.

816
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:28,629
And I'm gonna be thankful

817
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:31,327
for everything.

818
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:33,563
Well, you're
a perfect saint.

819
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:39,171
Jesus wept.

820
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:41,177
You are a woman
for abuse.

821
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:42,838
I won't eat it.
It's rat food.

822
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:45,541
I'm gonna kill you.

823
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:48,050
Don't drive me insane.
Be a goddamn woman

824
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,881
and go and find a bed
somewhere.

825
01:01:49,919 --> 01:01:52,217
Get off, Fran!
I'm gonna call my brother.

826
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,950
Good.

827
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,981
Why don't you
call him twice

828
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:58,586
so he can hang up
on you again, huh?

829
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:00,528
And where are you gonna
get a nickel for the call?

830
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:02,531
That's my business.
God, Francis,

831
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:04,533
you were all right till you started
on the wine.

832
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,127
Wine wine wine.

833
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:16,976
Now we're gonna get
some cardboard

834
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:19,345
and we're gonna go down
to that old building.

835
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:21,816
No, I'm going
down below.

836
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:24,342
Who are you kidding?

837
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:26,912
You got nowheres to go.

838
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:29,584
You want to get knocked
over the head, huh?

839
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:31,526
It wouldn't be the worst
that ever happened to me.

840
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:35,895
Are you gonna
hit me now?

841
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:38,423
I'm not gonna hit you.

842
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,561
Shh.

843
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,699
I love you, soul mate.

844
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,355
Now don't go
walking away from me.

845
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,358
You'd be lost
in the world.

846
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,417
Yeah yeah yeah.

847
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,735
- Are you awful cold?
- Yeah.

848
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:16,227
I couldn't stay outside
tonight, Francis.

849
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:18,297
I would die.

850
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:25,338
Here.

851
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:06,311
Finny, you got visitors.

852
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,483
Who the hell is it?

853
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,117
It's Francis.

854
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,152
Move over.
Make room for Helen.

855
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:16,461
I'll get you a jug
for this, buddy.

856
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,057
Yeah, sure.

857
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:20,661
- Don't be afraid.
- No, it's not that.

858
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:25,606
She knows.
She's been here before.

859
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,610
I'll see you here in the AM

860
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:29,737
or I'll meet you
up at the mission.

861
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:31,974
Why don't you
just get in too?

862
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:37,250
There's no legroom.

863
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:41,380
Keep the faith.

864
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,562
Now I lay me down
to sleep,

865
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:57,573
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

866
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:59,700
If I die
before I wake

867
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:02,973
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

868
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:24,054
Oh, ow ow.

869
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:27,085
Don't touch me here, Finny.
It hurts too much.

870
01:08:15,772 --> 01:08:18,400
Sands of the desert,
salt of the sea.

871
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:25,638
Oh, forgive me.

872
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:28,172
Forgive me
for I have sinned.

873
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:30,185
If you must
call them sins,

874
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:32,744
you know,
I call them decisions.

875
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:37,783
I'm not a drunk
and I'm not a whore.

876
01:08:37,827 --> 01:08:40,125
And I never let a man
use me for money.

877
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:43,496
You know, I went Dutch
lots of times and I...

878
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,797
well, I would let them
buy the drinks,

879
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,803
but that's because
it's a man's place

880
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:49,862
to buy the drinks.

881
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:53,469
But I never

882
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:56,034
ever betrayed anybody.

883
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:00,907
And that's
what counts with me.

884
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:06,255
Of course

885
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:09,656
I know
living with Francis

886
01:09:09,692 --> 01:09:11,785
was sinful
in the eyes of some people

887
01:09:11,828 --> 01:09:13,796
and I took a certain
amount of liberty

888
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,798
with the Commandments

889
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:18,892
of the Church.

890
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:23,772
But nobody's gonna
compel me ever...

891
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:26,331
I couldn't declare to anybody,
not even you, St. Joseph,

892
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,969
that loving Francis
was sinful.

893
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,246
Because it was
probably...

894
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:43,149
the greatest thing

895
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:46,025
in my life.

896
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:51,590
That's...

897
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:58,898
that's all.

898
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:15,923
Thank you, St. Joseph.

899
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,983
Oh, thank you.

900
01:10:19,562 --> 01:10:22,326
Oh, thank you.

901
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:51,618
Preacher said you was looking
for a strong back.

902
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:54,323
Could be.

903
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,891
And you've got one
maybe?

904
01:11:02,738 --> 01:11:04,729
Pick up that barrel.

905
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:20,617
You pick up
stuff like this yourself?

906
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:22,681
Do you?

907
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:35,428
I do a lifetime
of lifting.

908
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:37,769
I pay you $7

909
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:41,038
and work till dark.

910
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:44,535
Back work ought to be
$8, $9.

911
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,311
Families eat
for a whole week on $7.

912
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:52,454
$7.50.

913
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:55,355
$7.

914
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,256
All right, what the hell
is the difference?

915
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:58,760
Get up the wagon.

916
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:00,819
In Albany, Dr. Benjamin Boss,

917
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:03,559
director of Dudley Observatory,
a noted astronomer,

918
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:06,090
said he did believe
life exists on Mars

919
01:12:06,135 --> 01:12:09,536
but that he could not imagine
Martian spaceships reaching the Earth.

920
01:12:09,572 --> 01:12:12,439
Orson Welles, the director
of the radio program

921
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:14,443
that paralyzed
the nation in fear

922
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:16,570
said he regretted
the terror he'd created

923
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:19,979
and that the whole thing
seems like a dream.

924
01:12:20,016 --> 01:12:23,179
Now back to
the Swingtime Hour.

925
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:25,585
Yours for the second half
of our morning program...

926
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:28,317
this sparkling
little ditty.

927
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:06,017
Here,

928
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:08,587
would you like
the rest of this toast?

929
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,168
It's good toast,

930
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:15,432
but I can't eat
a thing now.

931
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:17,837
A friend wanted to give me
a cheese sandwich last night...

932
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:19,864
not a chance.

933
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:30,408
Come on, get up.

934
01:13:39,495 --> 01:13:41,986
So how do you like it?

935
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:44,022
Like what?

936
01:13:44,066 --> 01:13:47,160
Sex business,
woman stuff.

937
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:51,798
I don't think about it
that much anymore.

938
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:54,708
To tell you the truth,
I'm over the hill.

939
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:58,942
Over the hill?
How old are you, 62?

940
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,846
Not that old.

941
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:04,614
7 1 here.
I don't go over no hills.

942
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:07,247
Four, five times
a night

943
01:14:07,289 --> 01:14:09,280
I get it
with the old woman

944
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:11,725
and in the daylight
I go house to house,

945
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:15,026
I get offers.

946
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:17,032
I never went
house to house.

947
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:20,126
Listen, half my life
I go house to house

948
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:23,935
and I know how it is.
You get offers.

949
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:27,033
Boy oh boy,
you get offers.

950
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:29,772
Dregs!

951
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:33,908
Dregs!

952
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:44,756
I'm sorry.

953
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:49,288
My dear, you may stay
as long as you read.

954
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:51,765
We don't allow sleeping.

955
01:14:51,801 --> 01:14:54,668
I wasn't sleeping.

956
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:57,103
I was waiting
for the fire

957
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:59,630
to die there.

958
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,965
Helen.

959
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:30,335
Helen Archer.

960
01:15:30,372 --> 01:15:32,363
Yes.

961
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:35,434
Nora, Helen.

962
01:15:38,013 --> 01:15:39,981
Nora Lawlor.

963
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:42,245
I haven't seen you
in 20 years.

964
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,315
Nora.
Of course.

965
01:15:48,357 --> 01:15:51,690
Well, how are you?

966
01:15:51,727 --> 01:15:55,356
I used to hear you
on the radio,

967
01:15:55,397 --> 01:15:57,763
but the I lost track.
What have you been doing?

968
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:01,031
Well, I went
on concert tour

969
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,628
as a pianist.

970
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:07,772
And then I was abroad
for years...

971
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,300
Oh.

972
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:12,314
...living in Paris
and Vienna and everywhere.

973
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:14,612
How exciting.
What an exciting life.

974
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,982
I envy you, Helen,
I really do.

975
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:19,544
I never go anywhere.

976
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:23,919
Are you staying with your brother
while you're here?

977
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:28,055
Well, I suppose.
We're very close.

978
01:16:28,097 --> 01:16:31,692
I saw him in church
only last week.

979
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:34,567
- In church?
- Mm-hmm.

980
01:16:34,603 --> 01:16:36,571
Imagine that.

981
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:39,301
I go past his home
all the time.

982
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:40,968
- It's so...
- Hypocrite.

983
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,035
What's he doing in church
after what he did to me?

984
01:16:43,078 --> 01:16:44,238
What?

985
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,248
Well, you know,
he and my mother...

986
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:48,250
- they stole all the money my father left me.
- No.

987
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:49,911
- Oh, yes.
- Shh!

988
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:52,011
- For 15 years, you see, they hid the will.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

989
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:54,386
- 11 of those years I knew...
- I'm sorry, but you have to leave.

990
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:56,220
Don't feel sorry for me.
I always knew.

991
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:58,419
- You're making much too much noise.
- I wanted to be free

992
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,826
even if I had
to suffer for it.

993
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:03,491
Oh, I got even. I left her with
the peacock there.

994
01:17:03,532 --> 01:17:07,559
Thieves they were.
Thieves.

995
01:17:07,603 --> 01:17:09,969
Thieves.

996
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,372
They were thieves.

997
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:15,877
Thieves.

998
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:22,706
Thieves they were,
thieves.

999
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,449
Common thieves.
Thieves.

1000
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:32,517
On account of the will,
you know,

1001
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:34,529
she just laughed at me.

1002
01:17:34,563 --> 01:17:37,532
That's right.

1003
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:39,534
Well, after I left
your loving son

1004
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:41,536
took care of you,
didn't he, Mother?

1005
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,471
Mm-hmm, the poorhouse...
that's where the peacock put you.

1006
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:47,339
And where did your
plumage go then, Mother?

1007
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:48,843
You old cripple,

1008
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,845
where did your plumage
go then, huh?

1009
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,847
Where did your plu...?

1010
01:17:57,353 --> 01:18:00,083
Dregs!

1011
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:03,250
Dregs!

1012
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:08,520
Dregs!

1013
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:12,966
Dregs!

1014
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,707
Yoo-hoo!
Dregs man!

1015
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:30,819
Whoa.
Whoa.

1016
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:33,549
On the back porch...
papers,

1017
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:36,251
a washtub
and some old clothes.

1018
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:54,405
I don't want to go in.
I know her.

1019
01:18:54,443 --> 01:18:56,570
So what's that?

1020
01:18:56,612 --> 01:19:01,379
Mrs. Dillon.
I was born on this street.

1021
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:04,045
I don't want people I know
seeing me looking like a bum.

1022
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:06,384
But you are a bum.

1023
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,390
You and me know that,
but they don't.

1024
01:19:08,424 --> 01:19:10,858
I'll carry anything you want
next time we stop.

1025
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:15,057
Sensitive bum.

1026
01:19:15,097 --> 01:19:18,294
Sensitive bum
I got working for me.

1027
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:09,406
Miss Dougherty,
are you all right?

1028
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:13,148
I'm going downtown,
Francis.

1029
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,156
Shouldn't you
put on some clothes?

1030
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,181
Clothes?

1031
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:54,093
Do you think
I'm crazy, Francis?

1032
01:20:54,129 --> 01:20:56,529
Not exactly, ma'am.

1033
01:20:59,001 --> 01:21:02,232
To whom have you
mentioned my spell?

1034
01:21:02,271 --> 01:21:03,704
No one, ma'am.

1035
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:06,230
No one?

1036
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:08,835
May I ask why?

1037
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:12,313
Well, people
with no clothes

1038
01:21:12,347 --> 01:21:14,110
ain't what you call
regular business, ma'am.

1039
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:16,617
Please don't
call me ma'am.

1040
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:19,712
Makes you sound
like a servant.

1041
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:21,723
Call me Katrina.

1042
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:26,259
I couldn't.
I couldn't get it out.

1043
01:21:26,295 --> 01:21:28,263
But it's my name.

1044
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:30,390
Say it.
Say Katrina.

1045
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,825
Katrina.

1046
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:36,997
So there.
You've gotten it out.

1047
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:47,144
You know,
a great poet once said

1048
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:50,640
that love enters
through the eyes.

1049
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:55,456
You must be very careful
not to see too much.

1050
01:21:57,593 --> 01:21:59,220
Have you ever seen
anyone faint?

1051
01:21:59,261 --> 01:22:01,821
Faint?
No.

1052
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:05,128
Then I shall faint
for you,

1053
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:07,601
dear Francis.

1054
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:19,446
You've done that
pretty good.

1055
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,454
You can get up now.

1056
01:22:33,895 --> 01:22:36,864
Hey, bum, come here.

1057
01:22:47,209 --> 01:22:49,234
I'm sorry.

1058
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,667
I'd like to buy this shirt from you.
Will you take two bits for it?

1059
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:17,331
Why does a bum need
a clean shirt?

1060
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:21,405
Clothes make the man,
they say.

1061
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:23,411
Tidy bum.

1062
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:26,972
Sensitive, tidy bum
I got on my wagon.

1063
01:23:27,015 --> 01:23:29,506
Pfft.

1064
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:06,016
You love music, don't you?

1065
01:24:06,054 --> 01:24:08,420
It's the greatest thing
there is in this life, you know.

1066
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:10,823
We ought to be willing
to die for our music.

1067
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:13,657
What does she mean,
Mommy?

1068
01:24:13,695 --> 01:24:16,994
She means it's nice to be able to play
the latest tunes, dear,

1069
01:24:17,032 --> 01:24:19,262
just like you're doing.

1070
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:57,427
Easy.
Whoa.

1071
01:26:05,674 --> 01:26:07,835
Get up.
Get up.

1072
01:26:16,117 --> 01:26:19,018
Dregs!

1073
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:23,582
Dregs!

1074
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:26,423
I think I'm gonna
get off up ahead.

1075
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:29,919
I'm gonna see some people I haven't seen
in a long time.

1076
01:26:29,965 --> 01:26:32,866
Of course I want
my pay now.

1077
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,165
You quit before dark?

1078
01:26:35,203 --> 01:26:39,003
I've worked seven hours,
must be, no lunch.

1079
01:26:40,842 --> 01:26:43,436
Take a dollar off
for that.

1080
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:45,446
That'd be fair.

1081
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,972
25 cents
for the shirt...

1082
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:52,214
$5.75.

1083
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:54,779
Half a day's work...
you get half pay.

1084
01:26:54,823 --> 01:26:56,814
$3.50.
I am the boss.

1085
01:26:56,858 --> 01:26:59,383
Yeah, you're the boss

1086
01:26:59,427 --> 01:27:01,691
and you're one strong
fellow too,

1087
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:03,789
but I know when
I'm getting skinned.

1088
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:05,663
This hand's
seen it all.

1089
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,498
Whoa.

1090
01:27:10,472 --> 01:27:14,875
Threats, eh?
Threats I don't like.

1091
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:18,471
$5.25,
that's all I pay.

1092
01:27:18,513 --> 01:27:21,573
$5.75 is fair.

1093
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:24,312
You gotta be fair
in this life.

1094
01:27:31,226 --> 01:27:36,721
$5.75.

1095
01:27:36,765 --> 01:27:39,199
A bum is a bum.

1096
01:27:41,369 --> 01:27:43,599
You I don't like.

1097
01:27:43,638 --> 01:27:48,541
Well, I sort of
liked you.

1098
01:27:48,577 --> 01:27:53,412
And I ain't half bad
once you get to know me.

1099
01:27:58,453 --> 01:28:00,546
Get up.

1100
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:15,795
Excuse me, lady,

1101
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:18,305
do you know where I can get
a nice little turkey?

1102
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,434
What did you say
to my wife?

1103
01:28:22,477 --> 01:28:25,469
I asked her where
I could get a turkey.

1104
01:28:25,513 --> 01:28:26,775
What for?

1105
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:29,147
Well,

1106
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,947
my duck died.

1107
01:28:32,988 --> 01:28:34,888
Just keep moving, bud.

1108
01:28:34,923 --> 01:28:36,982
Got you.

1109
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:41,862
Ain't seen you much.

1110
01:28:41,896 --> 01:28:43,864
Francis got a job.

1111
01:28:43,898 --> 01:28:47,390
It's possible we'll take
an apartment soon.

1112
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:49,903
- You're back in the chips.
- Oh, yeah.

1113
01:28:49,938 --> 01:28:51,633
Francis coming in
tonight?

1114
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:53,903
He might be
and he might not be.

1115
01:28:53,942 --> 01:28:55,910
It all depends
on his work

1116
01:28:55,944 --> 01:28:59,710
and how busy he might
or might not be.

1117
01:29:01,116 --> 01:29:03,676
I get it.

1118
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:13,995
Oh.

1119
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:16,930
Right on the bed there,
Donovan.

1120
01:29:39,521 --> 01:29:42,922
$6 for the bags
and $1 for the room.

1121
01:29:42,957 --> 01:29:44,083
Oh, yeah.

1122
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,093
Same room, same bed.

1123
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:49,619
I'm gonna pay you
for two days

1124
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:52,064
in case I don't
die tonight.

1125
01:29:54,736 --> 01:29:56,704
You want to eat something?
I'm making coffee.

1126
01:29:56,738 --> 01:29:58,729
No no, no coffee.

1127
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:01,298
Thank you, Donovan.

1128
01:30:57,766 --> 01:31:00,326
Yes?

1129
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:05,136
Howdy.

1130
01:31:08,977 --> 01:31:14,609
I brought you
a turkey.

1131
01:31:14,649 --> 01:31:16,344
A turkey?

1132
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:25,952
It's a 1 2 1/2 pounder.

1133
01:31:25,994 --> 01:31:28,929
Billy said to drop by
every Sunday

1134
01:31:28,963 --> 01:31:30,931
and I know
it ain't Sunday,

1135
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:35,197
but I...
I come by anyway.

1136
01:31:35,236 --> 01:31:38,569
Is that you, Fran?

1137
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,405
It ain't one of those
men from Mars.

1138
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:47,073
Oh my God.

1139
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:50,107
My God.
My God.

1140
01:31:50,151 --> 01:31:52,779
My God.

1141
01:31:52,821 --> 01:31:56,518
Hi, Annie.
How are you doing?

1142
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:59,991
You're looking good.

1143
01:32:00,995 --> 01:32:03,828
This is a surprise.

1144
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:12,302
Yeah.

1145
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,900
Here, take this critter.

1146
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:18,310
It's freezing me up.

1147
01:32:18,346 --> 01:32:21,747
You'll stay
while I fix it?

1148
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:23,774
Come in.

1149
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:27,452
Come on,
come in.

1150
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:35,621
Sit while I get it
in the oven.

1151
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:48,869
Danny can go
get cranberries.

1152
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:54,139
- Who's Danny?
- Peg's boy.

1153
01:32:56,117 --> 01:32:58,108
He's in
the fourth grade.

1154
01:32:58,152 --> 01:33:01,087
He's smart as a cracker.

1155
01:33:01,122 --> 01:33:05,252
Gerald would be 22.

1156
01:33:05,293 --> 01:33:07,284
I...

1157
01:33:08,496 --> 01:33:14,298
well, I saw his grave
yesterday.

1158
01:33:14,335 --> 01:33:19,034
I talked to him.

1159
01:33:19,073 --> 01:33:21,132
I told him
a lot of stuff.

1160
01:33:23,878 --> 01:33:26,073
I'll bet he was glad
to hear from you.

1161
01:33:26,114 --> 01:33:28,207
Maybe.
Maybe.

1162
01:33:33,254 --> 01:33:36,382
Tell me about Bill.
How's he doing?

1163
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:39,188
He's a gambler,

1164
01:33:39,227 --> 01:33:42,594
not a very good one.

1165
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:47,067
He told me that you
never told nobody

1166
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:50,434
about how I lost
my grip on Gerald.

1167
01:33:50,471 --> 01:33:53,998
Not till the other day.

1168
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:56,840
There's nothing to be gained by
talking about it.

1169
01:33:56,878 --> 01:33:59,403
It wasn't your fault

1170
01:33:59,447 --> 01:34:01,972
any more than it was
my fault.

1171
01:34:04,786 --> 01:34:07,949
There's no way that I can thank you
for that, Annie.

1172
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:11,049
- Oh, please.
- Thanks don't touch something like that.

1173
01:34:11,092 --> 01:34:13,253
Never mind that.

1174
01:34:15,763 --> 01:34:20,166
Tell me, what is it
made you come see us?

1175
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:23,902
Well, I'd like to say

1176
01:34:23,938 --> 01:34:27,032
that it was

1177
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,771
Billy invited me
to come by.

1178
01:34:29,811 --> 01:34:31,938
I never thought
I'd get invited.

1179
01:34:33,548 --> 01:34:35,345
Billy said
you had a wife.

1180
01:34:35,383 --> 01:34:38,352
No, not a wife.

1181
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:43,884
I only ever had
one wife.

1182
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:48,123
I only ever had
one husband.

1183
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:50,153
I only had one man.

1184
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:52,359
It's religion.

1185
01:34:54,669 --> 01:34:56,728
It wasn't
only religion.

1186
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:59,171
Hmm.

1187
01:34:59,207 --> 01:35:02,040
I never could
marry again.

1188
01:35:03,845 --> 01:35:06,075
But I did live
with Helen

1189
01:35:06,114 --> 01:35:09,140
nine years
on and off.

1190
01:35:09,183 --> 01:35:12,050
She nursed me when
I was sick as a pup.

1191
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:14,077
She's a damn good woman.

1192
01:35:14,122 --> 01:35:16,556
Where is she now?

1193
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:18,456
Downtown somewheres,
you know.

1194
01:35:18,493 --> 01:35:22,691
She's like a little kid.
She...

1195
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:25,062
she's gonna drop dead
in the street someday

1196
01:35:25,099 --> 01:35:29,297
if she keeps
wandering off like that.

1197
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,108
She needs you.

1198
01:35:36,878 --> 01:35:38,971
And what do you need,
Fran?

1199
01:35:40,081 --> 01:35:44,415
I think I need
a shoelace.

1200
01:38:14,135 --> 01:38:17,536
I'm so awful sorry,
Annie.

1201
01:38:25,446 --> 01:38:28,540
There's things to say,
you know.

1202
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:31,450
They're...

1203
01:38:31,485 --> 01:38:34,113
lousy things,

1204
01:38:34,155 --> 01:38:36,623
lousy lousy things.

1205
01:38:40,695 --> 01:38:44,222
I never stopped
loving you and the kids.

1206
01:38:44,265 --> 01:38:47,792
I know that don't entitle me
to nothing, you know.

1207
01:38:47,835 --> 01:38:50,827
I don't want nothing.

1208
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,032
I went my whole life

1209
01:38:56,077 --> 01:38:59,137
just remembering
things here...

1210
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:05,611
whatever was
on the table.

1211
01:39:05,653 --> 01:39:07,621
I want nothing,

1212
01:39:07,655 --> 01:39:10,123
just a cup of tea,

1213
01:39:10,157 --> 01:39:13,320
a sandwich.

1214
01:39:13,361 --> 01:39:17,263
You still make
that Irish breakfast tea?

1215
01:39:18,966 --> 01:39:20,991
Yeah.

1216
01:39:23,804 --> 01:39:27,103
Danny,

1217
01:39:27,141 --> 01:39:29,109
this is your grandfather.

1218
01:39:29,143 --> 01:39:32,271
He came to see us
and he's staying for dinner.

1219
01:39:34,215 --> 01:39:36,308
- Hi.
- Hello.

1220
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:38,375
You come from school?

1221
01:39:43,224 --> 01:39:45,192
Are you Grandpa Phelan
or Grandpa Quinn?

1222
01:39:45,226 --> 01:39:49,424
Phelan.
Francis Aloysius Phelan.

1223
01:39:49,463 --> 01:39:51,226
You're the Big Leaguer.

1224
01:39:51,265 --> 01:39:53,392
You played with
the Washington Senators.

1225
01:39:53,434 --> 01:39:58,269
Billy says you taught him
how to throw an inshoot.

1226
01:39:58,306 --> 01:40:00,331
Oh, he remembers that,
does he?

1227
01:40:00,374 --> 01:40:02,342
Will you teach me?

1228
01:40:02,376 --> 01:40:05,743
Yeah, sure. Get a baseball.
I'll show you.

1229
01:40:22,196 --> 01:40:24,858
Yeah,

1230
01:40:24,899 --> 01:40:28,960
you put your fingers

1231
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:32,268
across the seams
like that.

1232
01:40:34,308 --> 01:40:36,799
See?
And you snap...

1233
01:40:36,844 --> 01:40:39,938
snap your wrist.

1234
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:43,438
Like this.
That's right.

1235
01:40:43,484 --> 01:40:45,645
It'll do a nice little
jig for you.

1236
01:40:47,555 --> 01:40:49,523
Yeah.

1237
01:40:49,557 --> 01:40:51,525
Let's go out
and try it.

1238
01:40:51,559 --> 01:40:53,857
I'll get
another glove.

1239
01:40:53,894 --> 01:40:56,920
A glove?

1240
01:40:56,964 --> 01:40:58,932
Annie,

1241
01:40:58,966 --> 01:41:01,730
you wouldn't by a fluke

1242
01:41:01,769 --> 01:41:03,532
have my old glove around,
would you?

1243
01:41:03,571 --> 01:41:07,473
There's a whole trunk
of your things

1244
01:41:07,508 --> 01:41:09,476
up in the attic.

1245
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,205
Maybe you'd want
to have a look at them.

1246
01:41:11,245 --> 01:41:12,940
You saved my stuff?

1247
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:15,244
No point
throwing things away.

1248
01:41:15,282 --> 01:41:17,307
Get up, Billy.
Grandpa's here.

1249
01:41:18,886 --> 01:41:20,854
Hey, Bill.

1250
01:41:20,888 --> 01:41:22,651
How have you been
getting on?

1251
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:25,750
You made it.

1252
01:41:25,793 --> 01:41:29,058
I'd have bet
against it happening.

1253
01:41:29,096 --> 01:41:31,121
Well, you'd have lost.

1254
01:41:32,933 --> 01:41:34,901
I brought a turkey.

1255
01:41:34,935 --> 01:41:36,903
We're having it
for dinner.

1256
01:41:36,937 --> 01:41:38,905
You like turkey?

1257
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:41,430
Who the hell
don't like turkey?

1258
01:41:42,443 --> 01:41:44,411
Listen, you can use
my razor

1259
01:41:44,445 --> 01:41:46,413
in the bathroom
if you want to shave.

1260
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:48,938
Don't be telling people
what to do.

1261
01:42:12,173 --> 01:42:15,006
Brother,

1262
01:42:15,042 --> 01:42:18,205
most of my life
is in this picture.

1263
01:42:20,014 --> 01:42:24,280
Half the neighborhood
turned out for that ballgame.

1264
01:42:24,318 --> 01:42:26,343
There's your
great-grandfather,

1265
01:42:26,387 --> 01:42:28,787
old Iron Joe.

1266
01:42:28,823 --> 01:42:31,155
And that's me.

1267
01:42:31,192 --> 01:42:33,558
Handsome devil, eh?

1268
01:42:38,098 --> 01:42:40,396
Some people thought so.

1269
01:42:40,434 --> 01:42:41,958
Some didn't.

1270
01:42:49,243 --> 01:42:52,076
Here,

1271
01:42:52,112 --> 01:42:54,842
look at this
in the light

1272
01:42:54,882 --> 01:42:59,410
and you'll see
where Ty Cobb signed it...

1273
01:42:59,453 --> 01:43:02,149
1911, the year
he hit 420.

1274
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:06,493
He was a mean guy, Cobb,

1275
01:43:06,527 --> 01:43:09,121
come at me many times
with his spikes up.

1276
01:43:09,163 --> 01:43:11,688
But he was the best.

1277
01:43:11,732 --> 01:43:14,257
Better than Babe Ruth?

1278
01:43:14,301 --> 01:43:17,031
Better and tougher

1279
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:20,234
and meaner and faster.

1280
01:43:20,274 --> 01:43:22,868
Couldn't hit home runs
like Babe, though.

1281
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:25,401
Would you like to have
that ball?

1282
01:43:25,446 --> 01:43:28,677
Sure I would, sure.
Who wouldn't?

1283
01:43:28,716 --> 01:43:32,277
Then have it.
But you'd better look Cobb up.

1284
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:33,980
See?

1285
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:36,546
I remember this suit.

1286
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:38,956
You wore it for dress up.

1287
01:43:38,993 --> 01:43:40,961
I wonder if it'd still fit me.

1288
01:43:40,995 --> 01:43:43,987
I'll take it downstairs
and press it.

1289
01:43:44,031 --> 01:43:47,000
I'll carry the glove.

1290
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:51,569
All right.

1291
01:44:14,695 --> 01:44:17,823
That's Danny's room.

1292
01:44:17,865 --> 01:44:20,163
It's a nice, big room.

1293
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,431
It gets
the morning light.

1294
01:44:27,174 --> 01:44:29,608
It's nice.

1295
01:45:56,063 --> 01:46:00,261
And what if I did
drink too much wine?

1296
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:02,928
Whose business
is that anyway?

1297
01:46:21,088 --> 01:46:24,353
Who knows how much
I didn't drink, huh?

1298
01:47:04,331 --> 01:47:06,925
Do you have a place
to stay tonight?

1299
01:47:06,967 --> 01:47:09,299
Sure.

1300
01:47:09,336 --> 01:47:12,066
I always got
a place to stay.

1301
01:47:17,244 --> 01:47:19,735
Do you want
to come home permanent?

1302
01:47:25,486 --> 01:47:27,886
I thought about it.

1303
01:47:27,921 --> 01:47:30,389
I admit that.

1304
01:47:32,259 --> 01:47:35,023
But I see
it wouldn't work out.

1305
01:47:39,032 --> 01:47:41,830
Stranger things
have happened.

1306
01:47:45,205 --> 01:47:47,230
Name one.

1307
01:47:48,976 --> 01:47:52,002
You at the cemetery

1308
01:47:52,045 --> 01:47:54,536
talking to Gerald.

1309
01:47:54,581 --> 01:47:57,049
Nice out there
where he is.

1310
01:47:57,084 --> 01:48:00,019
There's a grave there
for you

1311
01:48:00,053 --> 01:48:02,851
right by that stone...

1312
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:05,586
one for me
and two for the children.

1313
01:48:05,626 --> 01:48:08,117
You bought me a grave
after I ran off?

1314
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:12,522
You're part of the family.

1315
01:48:16,236 --> 01:48:18,670
Uh, Peg...

1316
01:48:18,705 --> 01:48:22,698
well, she's
kind of bitter

1317
01:48:22,743 --> 01:48:24,973
about you
staying away.

1318
01:48:25,012 --> 01:48:29,039
I was too
for years,

1319
01:48:29,082 --> 01:48:31,482
but that's all
done with.

1320
01:48:33,086 --> 01:48:36,522
I don't want
no fight with Peg.

1321
01:48:39,426 --> 01:48:42,190
I can't say nothing
that means anything.

1322
01:48:42,229 --> 01:48:45,756
I know it's hard
what you're doing,

1323
01:48:45,799 --> 01:48:49,291
but it's something Danny will always
know about.

1324
01:48:49,336 --> 01:48:52,601
And Billy... he was
so glad to help you,

1325
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:54,937
but he'd never say it.

1326
01:48:54,975 --> 01:48:58,001
Yeah, he got a bum
out of jail.

1327
01:48:59,847 --> 01:49:02,247
You're so mean
to yourself.

1328
01:49:02,282 --> 01:49:05,513
Hell, I'm mean to everything
and everybody.

1329
01:49:30,844 --> 01:49:33,142
You goddamn spooks.

1330
01:49:35,682 --> 01:49:38,207
You ain't real.
You're dead.

1331
01:49:38,252 --> 01:49:40,311
Of if you ain't,
you ought to be.

1332
01:49:44,424 --> 01:49:46,392
I'd rather be dying
out in the weeds

1333
01:49:46,426 --> 01:49:49,088
than standing here
watching you pining away.

1334
01:49:51,231 --> 01:49:53,028
I'm the one that's living.

1335
01:49:53,066 --> 01:49:54,829
I'm the one that put you
on the map.

1336
01:49:54,868 --> 01:49:57,098
You don't know nothing
that I don't know.

1337
01:49:57,137 --> 01:49:58,570
See?

1338
01:50:02,542 --> 01:50:05,170
So get your asses gone.

1339
01:50:05,212 --> 01:50:08,181
I'm sick to death of looking at the bunch
of youse anyway.

1340
01:50:08,215 --> 01:50:11,116
Fran, Fran.

1341
01:50:13,787 --> 01:50:17,689
Annie,

1342
01:50:17,724 --> 01:50:21,251
I'd eat all the dirt
in this yard for you

1343
01:50:21,295 --> 01:50:23,263
and all the weeds

1344
01:50:23,297 --> 01:50:27,097
and all the dog bones too
if you asked me.

1345
01:50:27,134 --> 01:50:30,934
I think you probably
ate all that already.

1346
01:50:54,761 --> 01:50:57,127
How are you doing,
Margaret?

1347
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:03,035
I'm doing fine.

1348
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:05,834
No thanks to you.

1349
01:51:08,675 --> 01:51:10,472
Yep.

1350
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:13,240
Let's give the man a break, for chrissake.
He just got here.

1351
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:16,647
What break did he
ever give me

1352
01:51:16,683 --> 01:51:19,982
or you?

1353
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:23,319
You don't just pop up here one day
and all is forgiven.

1354
01:51:25,258 --> 01:51:28,125
I ain't expecting
to be forgiven.

1355
01:51:28,161 --> 01:51:30,823
I'm way past that.

1356
01:51:30,864 --> 01:51:32,832
Oh.

1357
01:51:32,866 --> 01:51:34,891
So why have you come back here
like a ghost

1358
01:51:34,935 --> 01:51:37,096
to force this scrawny
turkey on us?

1359
01:51:37,137 --> 01:51:39,071
That's 1 2 1/2 pounds.

1360
01:51:39,106 --> 01:51:41,904
Why did you come here,
is what I want to know.

1361
01:51:41,942 --> 01:51:45,105
This is a home
you didn't build.

1362
01:51:46,947 --> 01:51:49,643
I built you.

1363
01:51:51,184 --> 01:51:53,618
I built Bill...

1364
01:51:56,223 --> 01:51:57,622
helped to.

1365
01:51:57,657 --> 01:52:00,649
- I wish you never did.
- Shut up!

1366
01:52:00,694 --> 01:52:02,628
Rotten tongue
of yours...

1367
01:52:02,662 --> 01:52:04,630
shut it the hell up.

1368
01:52:06,266 --> 01:52:08,564
He only came
to visit.

1369
01:52:08,602 --> 01:52:10,570
That's all.

1370
01:52:10,604 --> 01:52:12,970
I asked if he wanted to stay
and he said no.

1371
01:52:13,006 --> 01:52:16,498
Oh.

1372
01:52:16,543 --> 01:52:20,502
Then it's all decided.

1373
01:52:20,547 --> 01:52:23,482
Nothing to decide.

1374
01:52:23,517 --> 01:52:27,078
Like your mother says,
I'll be going on.

1375
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,088
Mm, fine.
That's good.

1376
01:52:29,122 --> 01:52:31,750
That's it! You've got the feelings
of a goddamn rattlesnake.

1377
01:52:31,792 --> 01:52:33,760
Would you pardon me?

1378
01:52:33,794 --> 01:52:37,389
Pardon me for having
any feelings at all.

1379
01:52:52,312 --> 01:52:53,973
Tough lady.

1380
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:55,345
She'll calm down.

1381
01:52:58,985 --> 01:53:01,385
How about the boy?
Did he hear that?

1382
01:53:01,421 --> 01:53:06,290
No, he's out playing with the ball
and the glove that you gave him.

1383
01:53:06,326 --> 01:53:08,726
I gave him the ball,
not the glove.

1384
01:53:08,762 --> 01:53:11,287
The glove is yours.

1385
01:53:11,331 --> 01:53:15,529
It ain't much of a glove
compared to today, but...

1386
01:53:15,569 --> 01:53:17,537
You want to give it
to him... go ahead,

1387
01:53:17,571 --> 01:53:21,029
but I always thought,

1388
01:53:21,074 --> 01:53:23,941
"I want to give
that old glove to Bill

1389
01:53:23,977 --> 01:53:28,004
so's he could say he had something
from the Bigs around the house. "

1390
01:55:01,274 --> 01:55:06,302
That turkey smells nice.

1391
01:55:09,549 --> 01:55:11,881
I bought you
this plum pudding.

1392
01:55:11,918 --> 01:55:14,478
Mama said that you
liked it for dessert.

1393
01:55:14,521 --> 01:55:17,081
Thank you.

1394
01:55:17,123 --> 01:55:19,523
That's nice that she
remembered that.

1395
01:55:23,296 --> 01:55:27,926
I got a letter here

1396
01:55:27,968 --> 01:55:31,699
that come to me
up in Canada.

1397
01:55:33,607 --> 01:55:36,701
I was playing ball
with Toronto.

1398
01:55:36,743 --> 01:55:39,405
Maybe you'd all
like to hear it.

1399
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:45,976
"Dear Poppy,

1400
01:55:46,019 --> 01:55:48,419
I suppose
you never think

1401
01:55:48,455 --> 01:55:51,549
you have a daughter
waiting for a letter.

1402
01:55:51,591 --> 01:55:53,559
I was so mad

1403
01:55:53,593 --> 01:55:57,256
that I was gonna
join the circus.

1404
01:55:57,297 --> 01:56:01,734
I hope you have
good luck with the team.

1405
01:56:01,768 --> 01:56:06,205
Mama has 14 new little
chickens out

1406
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:09,572
and there's a Wild West
show coming.

1407
01:56:09,609 --> 01:56:14,376
Won't you come home
and see it?

1408
01:56:14,414 --> 01:56:18,145
Billy is just
going to bed

1409
01:56:18,184 --> 01:56:23,349
and Mama's watching me.

1410
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:28,521
Do not let me find you
with another girl

1411
01:56:28,561 --> 01:56:30,961
or I will
pull her hair.

1412
01:56:30,997 --> 01:56:34,091
Yours truly,

1413
01:56:34,134 --> 01:56:36,659
Peggy. "

1414
01:56:44,878 --> 01:56:46,846
You know, it's funny...

1415
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:49,815
I don't remember
writing that.

1416
01:56:49,849 --> 01:56:52,943
Well,

1417
01:56:52,986 --> 01:56:56,217
probably a lot
you don't remember

1418
01:56:56,256 --> 01:56:58,053
about them days,
you know.

1419
01:56:58,091 --> 01:57:00,889
You were only
nine years old.

1420
01:57:00,927 --> 01:57:03,418
Yeah.

1421
01:57:12,939 --> 01:57:18,206
I remember Toronto,
191 3.

1422
01:57:18,244 --> 01:57:20,678
We had one ump
named Bates.

1423
01:57:20,714 --> 01:57:24,411
The game was getting dark
and he won't call the game

1424
01:57:24,451 --> 01:57:26,419
because he's in
with the other club

1425
01:57:26,453 --> 01:57:28,421
and we're winning.

1426
01:57:28,455 --> 01:57:31,618
So Pudge Howard
who was catching for us

1427
01:57:31,658 --> 01:57:33,956
has a three-way confab
on the mound

1428
01:57:33,993 --> 01:57:36,154
with me and
High Pockets Wilson

1429
01:57:36,196 --> 01:57:38,391
who's pitching for us.

1430
01:57:38,431 --> 01:57:40,695
And Pudge squats down
behind the plate

1431
01:57:40,734 --> 01:57:43,862
and High Pockets lets go
with a blazer... boom!

1432
01:57:43,903 --> 01:57:47,100
right down
the pipe... pow!

1433
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:50,667
"Ball," says the ump.

1434
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:54,146
"Well, if that's a ball I'm gonna eat it,"
Pudge tells him.

1435
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:56,239
And the ump said,
"Well, then get eatin'."

1436
01:57:56,282 --> 01:57:59,979
Pudge takes the ball
and takes a bit out of it like this.

1437
01:58:00,019 --> 01:58:02,510
Of course
it ain't a ball at all.

1438
01:58:02,555 --> 01:58:06,150
It's a yellow apple like this that I give him
out on the mound.

1439
01:58:08,428 --> 01:58:11,693
Bates goes down in history
as Old Blindy Bates

1440
01:58:11,731 --> 01:58:15,292
that can't tell a baseball
from a yellow apple.

1441
01:58:15,335 --> 01:58:17,496
Great stuff happening
in them days.

1442
01:58:17,537 --> 01:58:20,165
Yeah.

1443
01:58:20,206 --> 01:58:23,733
Great stuff happening
all the time.

1444
01:58:34,454 --> 01:58:37,685
I do believe that turkey
should be ready.

1445
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,185
Hey.

1446
01:59:09,222 --> 01:59:10,951
Hey.

1447
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:14,786
Wake up, you crazy kraut.

1448
01:59:14,828 --> 01:59:18,355
That you, Franny?

1449
01:59:18,398 --> 01:59:21,731
No, it's Buffalo Bill.

1450
01:59:23,102 --> 01:59:24,967
I'm looking
for the Indians.

1451
01:59:25,004 --> 01:59:26,972
The Indians?

1452
01:59:29,008 --> 01:59:31,272
Oh, God.

1453
01:59:31,311 --> 01:59:36,044
You seen Helen?

1454
01:59:36,082 --> 01:59:39,210
No.

1455
01:59:39,252 --> 01:59:42,688
Where did you get
the new suit, Fran?

1456
01:59:44,657 --> 01:59:47,558
- Up a tree.
- Up a tree?

1457
01:59:47,594 --> 01:59:50,757
You don't tell me
nothing that's true, man.

1458
01:59:50,797 --> 01:59:53,698
Every lousy
goddamn thing

1459
01:59:53,733 --> 01:59:55,701
you can think of
is true.

1460
01:59:58,071 --> 02:00:00,039
Look at you...

1461
02:00:00,073 --> 02:00:03,042
a new suit.

1462
02:00:03,076 --> 02:00:05,601
Look at me...

1463
02:00:05,645 --> 02:00:08,045
I look like
a goddamn bum.

1464
02:00:09,249 --> 02:00:11,717
You are a bum.

1465
02:00:15,154 --> 02:00:17,816
You know why...

1466
02:00:17,857 --> 02:00:21,486
you know why people
call you a bum?

1467
02:00:21,528 --> 02:00:24,656
Because it makes them feel better
when they say it.

1468
02:00:27,233 --> 02:00:29,633
The truth can't hurt you.

1469
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:32,137
If you're a bum,
you're a bum.

1470
02:00:34,774 --> 02:00:37,140
Oh my God, Franny,

1471
02:00:37,176 --> 02:00:39,144
there must be a God

1472
02:00:39,178 --> 02:00:42,204
that protects
some bums.

1473
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,916
Look at me.

1474
02:00:45,952 --> 02:00:49,285
Franny,

1475
02:00:49,322 --> 02:00:51,722
I'm gonna
kill myself.

1476
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,128
You ain't
intelligent enough

1477
02:00:56,162 --> 02:00:58,187
to kill yourself.

1478
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:04,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

1479
02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:06,604
How are you doing, Andy?
The hotel open?

1480
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:09,403
Okay, Francis.
You strike it rich?

1481
02:01:09,442 --> 02:01:13,242
Oh, yeah.
Here,

1482
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:15,247
lubricate your soul.

1483
02:01:15,281 --> 02:01:17,044
All right.

1484
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:19,313
This here is Rudy the Cootie.

1485
02:01:19,352 --> 02:01:20,478
Rudy.

1486
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,818
He says he's gonna
kill himself.

1487
02:01:22,855 --> 02:01:25,380
I got me
a form of cancer.

1488
02:01:25,425 --> 02:01:27,086
Ain't nothing
wrong with you

1489
02:01:27,126 --> 02:01:30,323
a little work ain't
gonna cure, buddy.

1490
02:01:30,363 --> 02:01:33,764
Cops was in here tonight,
shining in their lights...

1491
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:35,427
didn't come in.

1492
02:01:35,468 --> 02:01:37,698
Cops want to do something...
they ought to fix

1493
02:01:37,737 --> 02:01:39,898
those goddamn houses
down there, eh?

1494
02:01:39,939 --> 02:01:43,067
I fell through the floor
last week,

1495
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:45,077
could have broke
my neck.

1496
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:46,408
Did you break it?

1497
02:01:46,446 --> 02:01:48,539
If I broke my neck

1498
02:01:48,581 --> 02:01:50,606
I'd be dead,
wouldn't I?

1499
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:53,346
Oh, and you're alive,
is that it?

1500
02:01:53,386 --> 02:01:54,580
You ain't dead?

1501
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:57,249
You wise guy.

1502
02:01:57,290 --> 02:02:00,384
Well, Charles Darwin...
he's dead,

1503
02:02:00,426 --> 02:02:03,020
master of botany,

1504
02:02:03,062 --> 02:02:05,724
died in 1936

1505
02:02:05,765 --> 02:02:08,598
and born
of two midwives.

1506
02:02:08,635 --> 02:02:10,967
What the fuck
is he talking about?

1507
02:02:11,004 --> 02:02:14,633
He ain't talking
about nothing.

1508
02:02:14,674 --> 02:02:17,575
He's just talking.

1509
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:20,670
Hey,

1510
02:02:20,713 --> 02:02:22,806
then give us a sip
of that hooch.

1511
02:02:22,849 --> 02:02:24,680
My leg
is killing me.

1512
02:02:32,659 --> 02:02:33,785
I got TB.

1513
02:02:33,826 --> 02:02:36,624
Wow, TB.

1514
02:02:37,897 --> 02:02:40,331
Jesus Christ.

1515
02:02:40,366 --> 02:02:43,301
I'm sorry for anybody
who got TB.

1516
02:02:43,336 --> 02:02:46,066
You know that
Sir Isaac Newton...

1517
02:02:46,105 --> 02:02:49,131
you know what he done
with that apple?

1518
02:02:49,175 --> 02:02:52,303
I know that.
He discovered gravity.

1519
02:02:52,345 --> 02:02:55,075
And you know
when that was?

1520
02:02:55,114 --> 02:02:57,582
1936.

1521
02:02:57,617 --> 02:03:00,484
- Oh, Christ.
- Born of two midwives.

1522
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:03,011
Driving me nuts
with all this jabber.

1523
02:03:03,056 --> 02:03:05,581
Hey,

1524
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:07,422
you giving orders
around here?

1525
02:03:12,465 --> 02:03:17,459
In the Big Rock
Candy Mountains

1526
02:03:17,503 --> 02:03:21,735
All the cops
have wooden legs

1527
02:03:21,774 --> 02:03:25,369
Bulldogs all have
rubber teeth

1528
02:03:25,411 --> 02:03:29,142
And the hens lay
soft-boiled eggs...

1529
02:03:29,182 --> 02:03:31,480
Oh, shut up,
you goddamn idiot.

1530
02:03:31,517 --> 02:03:33,508
Shut the fuck up!

1531
02:03:35,154 --> 02:03:37,850
God damn, you got me, buddy.
You got me.

1532
02:03:41,694 --> 02:03:43,662
I don't like it
when anybody

1533
02:03:43,696 --> 02:03:45,926
gets in an uproar.

1534
02:03:48,468 --> 02:03:51,096
Gotta be nice.

1535
02:03:51,137 --> 02:03:54,766
- Hey, you all right there?
- I'm all right, Franny.

1536
02:03:54,807 --> 02:03:58,470
- You like your spot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1537
02:03:58,511 --> 02:04:00,877
When I leave this earth,

1538
02:04:00,913 --> 02:04:04,440
I want it to be with a blessing
to everybody.

1539
02:04:04,484 --> 02:04:08,750
Mockingbirds will sing
when you die, Francis.

1540
02:04:15,995 --> 02:04:17,292
What's that?

1541
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:21,096
The guy over there behind this shed
has got a baby.

1542
02:04:21,134 --> 02:04:22,499
A baby?

1543
02:04:22,535 --> 02:04:25,026
Yeah.

1544
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:44,289
I had a little kid.

1545
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,928
He broke his neck
and died,

1546
02:04:49,962 --> 02:04:52,362
1 3 days old.

1547
02:04:57,737 --> 02:05:00,205
I'm the one
that dropped him...

1548
02:05:04,644 --> 02:05:07,112
22 years ago.

1549
02:05:09,715 --> 02:05:13,515
My wife never told a soul
that I did it.

1550
02:05:20,393 --> 02:05:25,296
22 years
she kept a secret,

1551
02:05:25,331 --> 02:05:27,299
protecting
a bum like me.

1552
02:05:27,333 --> 02:05:30,666
You can't figure women.

1553
02:05:30,703 --> 02:05:34,264
My old lady told me I was the only man
that ever touched her.

1554
02:05:34,307 --> 02:05:36,275
I came home one day

1555
02:05:36,309 --> 02:05:38,209
and she was banging
two guys at once.

1556
02:05:38,244 --> 02:05:42,010
I'm talking
about a real woman,

1557
02:05:42,048 --> 02:05:44,778
not some
trash-barrel whore.

1558
02:05:44,817 --> 02:05:48,844
My wife was
good-looking, though.

1559
02:05:48,888 --> 02:05:51,880
She had a terrific
personality.

1560
02:05:53,726 --> 02:05:57,127
Yeah,

1561
02:05:57,163 --> 02:05:59,688
all in her ass.

1562
02:06:01,367 --> 02:06:03,801
Screw you, guys.

1563
02:06:05,571 --> 02:06:08,005
I told you nothing.

1564
02:06:23,823 --> 02:06:26,314
Hey, Franny...

1565
02:06:28,928 --> 02:06:32,227
you know where
that Milky Way is?

1566
02:06:37,336 --> 02:06:40,066
It's right up
over there.

1567
02:06:42,108 --> 02:06:44,372
You know,

1568
02:06:44,410 --> 02:06:47,504
on the outskirts

1569
02:06:47,546 --> 02:06:50,379
I'm a restless person.

1570
02:06:52,485 --> 02:06:56,080
I'm a traveler, really.

1571
02:06:58,124 --> 02:07:02,788
On the Big Rock
Candy Mountain

1572
02:07:02,828 --> 02:07:07,288
You never change
your socks

1573
02:07:07,333 --> 02:07:11,429
Little streams
of alcohol

1574
02:07:11,470 --> 02:07:15,236
Come a-trickling
down the rocks

1575
02:07:15,274 --> 02:07:20,371
Oh, I'm bound to go

1576
02:07:20,413 --> 02:07:24,372
Where the wind
don't blow

1577
02:07:24,417 --> 02:07:28,615
On the Big Rock
Candy Mountain

1578
02:07:28,654 --> 02:07:31,555
On the Big Rock

1579
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:34,923
Candy Mountain

1580
02:07:34,961 --> 02:07:39,955
There's a land
that's fair and bright

1581
02:07:39,999 --> 02:07:43,799
Handouts grow
on bushes

1582
02:07:43,836 --> 02:07:49,672
And you sleep out
every night

1583
02:07:49,709 --> 02:07:54,612
Oh, I want to go

1584
02:07:54,647 --> 02:07:59,141
Where the wind
don't blow...

1585
02:08:18,337 --> 02:08:20,305
Get the hell out of here!

1586
02:08:25,544 --> 02:08:27,512
Raiders!
Raiders!

1587
02:08:27,546 --> 02:08:30,014
Raiders!
Get out!

1588
02:08:36,922 --> 02:08:38,890
Wake up, wake up.
Raiders!

1589
02:08:38,924 --> 02:08:41,222
Raiders! Raiders!
Raiders!

1590
02:08:42,294 --> 02:08:45,627
Bastards, get out
of this car!

1591
02:09:05,951 --> 02:09:07,714
You bum!

1592
02:09:15,127 --> 02:09:17,118
Move it, move it!

1593
02:10:04,143 --> 02:10:06,805
Oh, Jeez. Jesus.

1594
02:10:21,794 --> 02:10:23,785
There.

1595
02:10:29,268 --> 02:10:31,736
How are you
making it, pal?

1596
02:10:37,009 --> 02:10:39,477
Goodbye.

1597
02:10:57,530 --> 02:10:59,998
He's dead, sir.

1598
02:11:08,207 --> 02:11:10,539
What was his name?

1599
02:11:22,254 --> 02:11:25,382
Sir, sir,
what was his name?

1600
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:30,328
Rudy.

1601
02:11:30,362 --> 02:11:32,796
His name was Rudy.

1602
02:11:34,366 --> 02:11:35,765
Rudy what?

1603
02:11:40,606 --> 02:11:43,006
Rudy Newton.

1604
02:11:43,042 --> 02:11:46,944
He new where
the Milky Way was.

1605
02:11:46,979 --> 02:11:49,379
That's what he knew.

1606
02:12:19,979 --> 02:12:22,311
Hey, sweetie.

1607
02:12:49,742 --> 02:12:52,336
Hey.

1608
02:12:58,751 --> 02:13:01,083
Hey.

1609
02:13:54,039 --> 02:13:57,941
I have to run now, baby.

1610
02:13:59,845 --> 02:14:01,870
I...

1611
02:14:08,554 --> 02:14:11,079
Looks nice.

1612
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:18,527
You've found
all our stuff.

1613
02:14:20,499 --> 02:14:23,332
Looks nice.

1614
02:14:26,638 --> 02:14:29,072
Pretty.

1615
02:14:48,293 --> 02:14:51,285
Mighty pretty,

1616
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:54,561
old gal.

1617
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:57,194
Mighty pretty.

1618
02:15:02,541 --> 02:15:04,873
I'm gonna come back

1619
02:15:04,910 --> 02:15:07,344
sooner or later.

1620
02:15:13,952 --> 02:15:16,352
I'm gonna get you

1621
02:15:16,388 --> 02:15:19,152
that gravestone

1622
02:15:19,191 --> 02:15:21,523
that you always wanted.

1623
02:15:25,798 --> 02:15:28,460
You know what I want
to put on it?

1624
02:15:32,237 --> 02:15:36,230
"Helen Marie Archer,

1625
02:15:36,275 --> 02:15:39,403
a great soul. "

1626
02:16:43,041 --> 02:16:45,407
What do you need, Fran?

1627
02:16:59,358 --> 02:17:02,259
Oh, I ain't fussy.

1628
02:17:07,165 --> 02:17:09,895
A turkey sandwich
will do me just fine.

1629
02:17:31,156 --> 02:17:34,887
I always want that tea.

1630
02:18:25,377 --> 02:18:28,938
That's Danny's room.

1631
02:18:28,981 --> 02:18:31,677
It's a nice, big room.

1632
02:18:33,452 --> 02:18:35,818
It gets
the morning light.

1633
02:18:35,854 --> 02:18:37,822
It's nice.

1634
02:18:37,856 --> 02:18:41,257
The room's got
some space to it.

1635
02:18:41,293 --> 02:18:45,491
We could set up
an extra cot.

1636
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:49,398
It's a mighty nice room.

1637
02:18:49,434 --> 02:18:53,029
It's the morning light.
