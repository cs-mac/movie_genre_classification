1
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,630
General Red Dragon, nice to meet you.

2
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,190
The White Jade Goddess is our family treasure.

3
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,670
It was robbed from my grandfather's generation.

4
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,670
We always want to get it back.

5
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,590
That's why we become bandits.

6
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,300
In these years, we robbed tons of gold.

7
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,630
If you can get it back for us,

8
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,310
I am willing to give you
fifty thousand taels of gold.

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,150
However, since we came here,

10
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,620
we have been tailed by
the Imperial Gold Shield Constable.

11
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,150
If we don't kill them all,

12
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,670
our business will be disclosed.

13
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,030
They can never escape.

14
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,110
Friends, come out.

15
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,430
Jin Buer, you are notorious in central China.

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,140
Now you come to the border to trade
with the Silver Armor bandits.

17
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,150
Aren't you afraid of the law?

18
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,620
Sure I am.

19
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,670
But if you don't go back,

20
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,500
no one will know I have committed a crime, right?

21
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,150
You go back to report to Captain Iron first.

22
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,350
Okay.

23
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,590
To fix the bandits, get their chief first.

24
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,190
Go.

25
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,540
If the forehead is a bit wide,

26
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,590
the cheekbones are a bit thin,

27
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,190
and the nose is a bit tall,

28
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,750
that will be perfect.

29
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,590
I am most satisfied with the teeth.

30
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,590
Well, I can say that,
this is a perfect man in the world.

31
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,630
Hey, don't stay in the water too long.

32
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,150
It will hurt your kidneys.

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,190
Smart guy, pick the fish please.

34
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,830
Hey, you have got poor kidneys, haven't you?

35
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,070
I am so smart, but you want me
to pick the fish for you only.

36
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,750
Hey, we eat fish every meal.

37
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,790
Say if you can get a chicken next time,
it would be perfect.

38
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,180
Hey, I mean it.

39
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,550
How come you are so good at fishing?

40
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,430
To achieve the best kung-fu in the world,
speed is the key.

41
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,350
Who taught you so?

42
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,620
My grandpa taught me.

43
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,270
Do you believe in your grandpa?

44
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,110
He just loved buying the secret scrolls of kung-fu.

45
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,150
But he read without practicing,
why do you still trust him?

46
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,510
Of course. My grandpa also taught me one thing.

47
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,430
What is it?

48
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,660
The essence of kung-fu is speed.

49
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,030
The essence of love is sacrifice.

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,420
The essence of strategy is patience.

51
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,110
The essence of love is sacrifice?

52
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,190
If you want to leave a girl, you can say so,
if not, no one trusts you.

53
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,820
My grandpa is right.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,070
I agree with him too.

55
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,150
The essence of love is sacrifice,
it is absolutely right.

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,230
To sacrifice for the woman you love most,

57
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,310
it is the greatest love.

58
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,990
When did you come here?

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,270
I didn't even notice that.

60
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,510
You must be very good at kung-fu.

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,670
Maybe you are too poor at kung-fu.

62
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,830
Oh, you are poor in kung-fu.

63
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,430
So, you're even inferior to him.

64
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,270
So cool.

65
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,350
Who are you?

66
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,830
I am a wandering doctor.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,270
The sun is too hot, it's not wise to walk
a long way under it.

68
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,990
So I took a nap on the tree.

69
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,590
We are two cops of the local government.

70
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,030
My name is Chen Yungren, you can call me Brad.

71
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,790
This is Liu Jianmeng,
you can call him Young Master.

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,230
I see. Nice to meet you, sir.

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,350
You look like a rascal.

74
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,590
Don't commit crimes in this town.

75
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,670
If you are caught by me, you will be damn shit.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,710
I am only an innocent guy, don't mistake me, sir.

77
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,310
Stop bluffing. Let's go.

78
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,830
Don't play tricks.

79
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,430
Don't meet me again.

80
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,750
Court...

81
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,390
Court...

82
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,870
Please, two chicken legs for me.

83
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,670
Why don't you wash the clothes?

84
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,980
I have nothing to wear now.

85
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,230
Listen, if you don't wash the clothes tonight,

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,750
you cannot go to sleep.

87
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,390
How can they wear...

88
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,270
so many clothes in a day?

89
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,390
She took her family's clothes to us too.

90
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,110
Who made us wear these clothes?

91
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,830
Our colleagues patrolled outside,

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,110
but we have to work this dump shit.

93
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,990
Why?

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,630
It's because we are not constable.

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,270
We are junior cops on probation.

96
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,110
When can we become constable?

97
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,950
We can be promoted once every five years,
maybe twenty years.

98
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,790
So how can we become a Gold Shield Constable?

99
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,830
Wow, grade eight, so it takes forty years.

100
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,910
Because you're my buddy,
that's why I work with you.

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,670
My goal is to open a small shop.

102
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,070
Where I give woman plastic surgery
and cure men's impotence.

103
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,430
I can make a lot of money.

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,100
Forget curing impotence please.

105
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,680
Murder...

106
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,300
What happened?

107
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,390
Go to Mr. Zhang's home now...

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,310
Go check it out.

109
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,310
Go to Mr. Zhang's home now.

110
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,150
How dare you two order us?

111
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,430
To fix you scums, trash is more than enough.

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,510
What do you mean by scums?

113
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,150
Captain.

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,910
Murders happened at Mr. Zhang's home.

115
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,700
Got it, the constable will go check it.

116
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,870
You guys better go back to wash the clothes.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,910
Hey...

118
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,830
We can fight.

119
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,310
Why don't you let us go?

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,110
Try to beat me, come on.

121
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,310
No, we are colleagues, aren't we?

122
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,350
We are colleagues, right?

123
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,430
I just want to beat my colleague.

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,830
It's all right...

125
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,510
You junior cops, better behave yourselves.

126
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,950
Let's go check it out. Go.

127
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,910
Go...

128
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,350
If you didn't stop me, I would have killed him
with my Dragon's Fist.

129
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,750
Make it next time.

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,350
The killers are thorough.
They didn't even let a dog or chick alive.

131
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,310
Why didn't they spare a dog?

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,590
Wow...

133
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,940
It's still alive, isn't it?

134
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,670
Let go of me.

135
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,550
Let go of me, or I will kill you.

136
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,740
Hey, it hurts. Come and help me please.

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,710
Come and help me.

138
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,580
Help... I want to kill you.

139
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,670
What is it about?

140
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,990
What? What do you mean?

141
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,020
These people just covered their ears,
without any obvious wounds.

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,980
No...

143
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,510
The blood is found on the first layer of skin.

144
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,630
No cuts and not much bleeding.

145
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,670
It must be Acoustic Power.

146
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,990
I mean it.

147
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,870
I learnt that from Coroner Song's notes,
my grandpa's collection.

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,870
Who is Coroner Song?

149
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,670
He was a famous coroner in the Song Dynasty.

150
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,140
He broke many tough criminal cases.

151
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,630
Oh, you don't know about that.

152
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,380
You can choose not trusting me.

153
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,790
But I think they were killed by
Tang's hidden weapons named...

154
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,020
Killing Shower.

155
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,070
Wow, his back was badly wounded.

156
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,710
This guy was obviously badly kicked, his third...

157
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,870
seventh and twelfth vertebral were broken.

158
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,750
Stop bluffing please.

159
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,350
See that guy? He's stuck at the wall.

160
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,830
It's weird, he got no obvious wounds.

161
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,110
Maybe he got internal injury.

162
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,590
Not exactly, for those who got internal injury,

163
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,710
most of them would have bloody eyes.

164
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,030
The sword was so fast.

165
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,830
Did his mouth get hit by the sword?

166
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,950
Right, when he opened his mouth,

167
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,380
the killer stabbed into his mouth,
cut his trachea and pulled it out.

168
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,350
Before the blood came out, he closed his mouth.

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,070
In this world,

170
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,950
only three persons can do that.

171
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,390
He must have poisoned lips when he was alive.

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,150
If not, the killer wouldn't have aimed
at his mouth.

173
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,070
This is a very famous kung-fu master
hired by Mr. Zhang.

174
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,380
His name is Yuan Yong, nick-named Fast Sword.

175
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,070
He was among the top five swordsmen in the world.

176
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,950
But he didn't have a chance to pull his sword out.

177
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,310
The killer was even faster than him.

178
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,670
Guess what was put at this place?

179
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,990
I heard that Mr. Zhang has got a treasure.

180
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,590
It is the White Jade Goddess
which is as tall as a man.

181
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,910
It's a treasure, so the bandits came for that.

182
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,420
Hurry up...

183
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,660
Wait for me...

184
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,990
What's the matter?

185
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,430
The Gold Shield Constable are coming to our court.

186
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,070
The Gold Shield Constable?

187
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,270
Are you dreaming?

188
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,830
It's true, even Captain Iron is here.

189
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,100
Get lost.

190
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,830
Wait for me...

191
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,670
Give way, my turn please. Let me have a peep...

192
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,670
It's so nice to meet you.

193
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,190
Captain Iron is really so handsome.

194
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,150
What are you doing?

195
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,670
No wonder you have become the idols of the world.

196
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,190
Captain Iron hates bullshit.

197
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,510
We came here to investigate
the murders of Zhang's family.

198
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,150
We will check the crime scene later.

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,830
That place stinks.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,300
I suggest you not to go, but...

201
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,270
I have already asked someone to wash the place now.

202
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,510
I suggest you to visit there later
when it is cleaned up.

203
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,750
Brother.

204
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,670
I hate stupid fools most.

205
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,070
Who can take me there now?

206
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,070
I can.

207
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,580
Handsome guy. He is too handsome.

208
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,540
Stop cleaning...

209
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,860
Stop it.

210
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,790
All of you freeze.

211
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,020
Get out. All of you get out.

212
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,340
Get out now.

213
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,390
Captain Iron, don't worry.

214
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,990
About the causes of their death,

215
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,910
the places and the wounds,
I have marked everything.

216
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,710
Have you fixed it?

217
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,230
It's just finished.

218
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,110
Sir, this is the floor plan of the murder scene.

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,980
Thank you.

220
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,230
Hey, don't you consider asking us,

221
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,110
the two most handsome cops to join
the investigation team?

222
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,990
Hey, you don't even know who the best are.

223
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,950
The guy shares the same thoughts as mine.

224
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,990
There are five killers.

225
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,030
They use broadsword, sword, kick,
secret weapons and Eagle Claw's stance to kill.

226
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,110
For the two most powerful ones,
one uses sword and the other kicks to kill.

227
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,430
Why not let them follow us?

228
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,940
Maybe they can help.

229
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,310
In this little town,

230
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,550
there are two young men with such insights,

231
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,830
don't you feel strange that
they are just junior cops?

232
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,830
I always suspect them.

233
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,230
Look, he looks like a bandit.

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,870
The White Jade Goddess
is over a thousand catties in weight.

235
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,310
Only a big carriage of six wheels can carry it.

236
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,980
And it can't move fast.

237
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,070
Let's split and trace it, maybe we can catch it.

238
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,620
About these two guys, don't care about them.

239
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,270
Sir, just leave this place to me. I can handle it.

240
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,910
What are you laughing at?
Do you want me to beat you?

241
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,430
Your mom with no teeth makes me laugh.

242
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,030
Captain Iron said you two are suspicious.

243
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,670
You should not blame me.

244
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,260
You scum...

245
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,310
Hey, please stop beating me.

246
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,510
You have no evidence, how can you torture us
to make us confess?

247
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,190
You have gone too far, man.

248
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,870
Hey...

249
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,590
How long do you want to pull me?

250
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,230
Come on, confess fast,

251
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,070
torture less, understand?

252
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,270
Okay.

253
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,430
I am one of the gangsters.

254
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,150
So, what about me?

255
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,870
You are a long gangster.

256
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,340
Pal, we don't want to cheat.

257
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,430
We will reincarnate and become another hero
after eighteen years.

258
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,630
If you treat us to chicken leg and wine,

259
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,190
I will tell you the address and name
of all the gangsters.

260
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,230
I will tell you everything, what do you think?

261
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,750
Good, no problem.

262
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,710
Chen Dawen.

263
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,870
He lives in house number four of Kaifeng East Road.

264
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,030
Chen Erniu,

265
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,390
he lives in the first house of
No. 14 Baoding East Xiaohutong.

266
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,670
Chen Xiaogou, he has just moved out.

267
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,510
Why all the gangsters named Chen?

268
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,950
They are from Chen's family, all are fierce.

269
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,990
But I heard that there were only five killers.

270
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,750
The others watched.

271
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,060
You dragged me to death, man. Why did you confess?

272
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,980
If I didn't do so, would he let us go?

273
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,550
At least we can have chicken legs now.

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,950
So, what's next?

275
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,870
Move in.

276
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,270
Hey, why did you make us lock up in the same cell?

277
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,590
You all will have capital punishment tomorrow,
better make friends with them.

278
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,950
Capital punishment?

279
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,340
No matter we have chicken legs. Poor me.

280
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,230
I heard that, if a bachelor's head is chopped off,

281
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,950
his spirit would be fed by shit.

282
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,310
Hey, I caught a bandit for you.

283
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,390
Where is my reward?

284
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,950
Follow me, I will pay you the money.

285
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,300
Wow, this is a handsome guy.

286
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,590
Don't bother my sleep.

287
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,190
If you die, you will have a long sleep.

288
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,790
Why not have some chats?

289
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,860
Maybe we will be saved by some angels tomorrow.

290
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,990
We should always remain hopeful.

291
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,190
Can you stop spitting?

292
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,750
This will be on my neck.

293
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,710
Bastard, how can you spit on it?

294
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,190
It's disgusting.

295
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,430
Pal, you will be killed anyway.

296
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,550
Will you feel disgusting after death?

297
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,110
It's hard to say.

298
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,110
What if I can still feel it but can't voice out?

299
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,710
Okay, I will change for another one.

300
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,380
Of course, you think that you can do anything
you want with the sword?

301
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,380
Hey.

302
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,750
Once something happens,

303
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,060
you two just follow me.

304
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,190
Time is up.

305
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,060
Kill.

306
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,230
Oh no.

307
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,380
Someone came to save the criminals.

308
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,110
Poor shooting.

309
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,710
Oh, this is a lady.

310
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,940
He is really handsome.

311
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,510
Fight back now, pal.

312
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,390
To hell with you.

313
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,740
Don't let them go.

314
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,070
Go. Get lost.

315
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,870
Again...

316
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,830
Go...

317
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,220
You silly fool.

318
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,550
Run.

319
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,030
Go...go.

320
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,510
You two came to cheat for the reward?

321
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,550
What are you doing?

322
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,740
Why bother?

323
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,670
For young people, falling in love
at first sight is nothing strange.

324
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,670
Falling in love at first sight?

325
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,750
You bastard. You don't fall for me...

326
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,190
But fall for another guy?

327
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,070
Are you crazy?

328
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,870
She is a lady.

329
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,710
She is sissy and she has tits.

330
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,020
- Soft please.
- Sis.

331
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,510
Sis? But you don't have any.

332
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,260
Are you blind?

333
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,310
I have some special smell.

334
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,180
Once a man smells it,

335
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,430
he will fall for me with no reason.

336
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,550
You ugly scum, how can you treat me as a man?

337
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,910
Objection, I am not very handsome,
but I am handsome.

338
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,380
You can tell I have got camera face.

339
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,710
Your words are insulting.

340
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,390
Bitch.

341
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,950
Bastard, to hell with you. Go.

342
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,830
Don't go!

343
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,710
Don't go.

344
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,310
I won't go. No.

345
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,510
We are cops, now we want to arrest you.

346
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,030
Drop your weapons.

347
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,380
Aren't you two criminals?

348
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,390
We are framed, now we can redeem ourselves
by sending you two to jail.

349
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,740
To hell with you.

350
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,310
Your nose bleeds.

351
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,180
Did you beat me?

352
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,590
So what?

353
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,630
Better see which is faster, your fist or my sword?

354
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,070
I can't see it.

355
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,110
Okay, once again.

356
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,220
Mine is faster.

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,190
How dare you! I, Lady Fire Dragon,
won't let you go.

358
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,390
Lady Fire Dragon? So you are Lady Water Dragon?

359
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,020
You two are the notorious sisters,
you are under arrest now.

360
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,510
Freeze.

361
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,020
Hey, beat him now.

362
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,310
It will hurt.

363
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,790
You are fine.

364
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,790
Stop, no snake please.

365
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,510
You got the sword, I need a weapon too.

366
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,230
Drop the snake, let's fight without weapons.

367
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
Okay, one, two, three.

368
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,270
Why have I fallen for her at the first sight?

369
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,550
Isn't it so called love at first sight?

370
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,630
Why do I feel like soaking in warm water?

371
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,670
I feel so warm and comfortable.

372
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,950
Am I already in love?

373
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,310
No fighting, let's fly.

374
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,670
I will show you my flying stance.

375
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,350
When I was eight,

376
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,990
I jumped a bit and could achieve
the height you did.

377
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,820
Do you think you can fly high? Damn it.

378
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,510
Hey, have you kissed enough?

379
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,430
How were you framed?

380
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,580
We are framed.

381
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,220
The White Jade Goddess was robbed,
they took us one of the robbers.

382
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,030
Do you want fight back for your innocence?

383
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,550
Of course we want that.

384
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,910
Greet me God-mother, I'll tell you how.

385
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,350
God-mother, say it please.

386
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,750
Have you ever heard of Treasure Inn?

387
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,670
Treasure Inn?

388
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,710
This is a place for hunting treasure.

389
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,310
In every spring and autumn,

390
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,790
there will be auctions for treasures.

391
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,110
Go, let's go there to get the criminals.

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,630
Okay, why?

393
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,030
The White Jade Goddess is difficult to sell.

394
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,790
It's hard to sell in Central China.

395
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,940
If they want to sell it for big money,
they can only go to Treasure Inn.

396
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,830
That's right, at the mid-autumn festival,

397
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,830
all the buyers will be there for the auction.

398
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,550
Let's go.

399
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,070
Go...

400
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,070
Hey, freeze.

401
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,190
It's under conditions.

402
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,390
No more conditions please, we are a family now.

403
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,950
Stop flirting. Romance makes you lose your mind,
doesn't it?

404
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,030
If you want me to get the White Jade Goddess back,

405
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,760
you must help me rob
one hundred thousand taels of silver.

406
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,790
Come on, the reward of the wanted guys
is more than that.

407
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,070
You will get all the money.

408
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,550
Deal.

409
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,110
According to the young man,
there were five killers.

410
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,270
They killed a score of guards.

411
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,430
Some people got many wounds.

412
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,270
They must be shot by Tang's secret weapons,

413
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,150
the Killing Shower.

414
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,350
The killer must be Tang Ao,
nick-named King of Thousand Hands.

415
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,190
The three who were killed at this corner
got broken throats.

416
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,510
They must have been killed by Eagle Claw's Stance.

417
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,990
I think it was done by Yu Feng,
King of Eagle Claws.

418
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,110
These three seemed to be slashed many times.

419
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,750
But the wounds were not made by swords.

420
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,110
I wonder, isn't it done by Lady Fox
who uses Acoustic Power?

421
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,950
I am really curious that...

422
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,030
in this world, who can make...

423
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,190
so many powerful killers to work for him?

424
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,670
Only one guy can make it.

425
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,510
He is famous in the triad's world,
he is named the King of Jokers.

426
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,580
Jin Buer.

427
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,510
And the fifth one, he uses sword to kill.

428
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,350
Even if we can find these five killers,

429
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,750
we are not confident to win.

430
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,550
Captain, we have got information.

431
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,110
Speak up.

432
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,950
There is a weird carriage,
the wheels dig deep in the sand.

433
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,910
It proves that something inside is heavy.

434
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,670
There is a man in it, he dresses like a merchant.

435
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,060
Jin Buer.

436
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,750
Take a rest here, I'll check it out.

437
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,140
Let me go with you.

438
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,430
Do you worry that I am no match against Jin?

439
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,630
No, but I...

440
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,790
If he is alone,

441
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,310
it's the best chance to knock them out one by one.

442
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,510
Luckily we found a worn down temple here.

443
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,190
Is it wet?

444
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,070
- It's okay.
- Oh, it's all wet.

445
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,150
Okay...

446
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,390
- One, two, three...
- What are you counting?

447
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,990
I am counting the number of bastards found here.

448
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,340
What did you say?

449
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,990
You dragged us to the entrance of hell,
why are you pretending?

450
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,310
We have no time to do such nonsense.

451
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,270
Cut the crap, let's fight. Come on.

452
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,860
Stop fighting.

453
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,350
Confucius said, violence cannot solve problems.

454
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,150
You have great flying stance.

455
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,550
I haven't noticed you at all.

456
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,670
No...

457
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,710
I climbed up here for a nap before you came.

458
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,950
I took a long sleep until just now.

459
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,950
Oh, I know you.

460
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,190
You are the guy we met near the stream.

461
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,270
Hey, do you have a ladder?

462
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,590
Yes.

463
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,710
Oh my God.

464
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,270
Oh, my waist.

465
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,350
May I know your name?

466
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,750
My name is Wen Wenqie, I am a doctor.

467
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,710
Hey, who is sick?

468
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,750
You're sick.

469
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,350
What a trouble to meet you.

470
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,990
Uncle, has the rain stopped?

471
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,670
We are now in a temple.

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,030
Sirs, we are singers.

473
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,590
We will leave once the rain stops.

474
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,430
I think this lady is blind, isn't she?

475
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,030
Yes, she was blind since birth,
but she plays very good lute.

476
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,550
Do you want to hear a song?

477
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,430
It's a long night,
it's nice to have some entertainment.

478
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,630
What a luck to meet you guys.

479
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,230
This song has a sad name.

480
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,270
It's called Sadness Everywhere.

481
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,830
Acoustic Power.

482
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,430
Cover your ears, not to hear it.

483
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,710
Hey, it's blocked.

484
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,590
I can't stop it.

485
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,790
Again.

486
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,750
What are you doing?

487
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,900
I am trying to expel it with my inner stance.

488
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,580
Why are you always after me?

489
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,270
But there are some people over there too.

490
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,390
I've been long waiting.

491
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,510
Lady, people should be merciful.

492
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,630
If you kill him, his parents will be so sad.

493
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,630
And his wife and children will be sad too.

494
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,910
Drop the lute and repent please.

495
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,910
You can stand my Acoustic Power, you are something.

496
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,270
Don't mistake me, I just can't hear well.

497
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,150
I won't listen to something bad.

498
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,550
All right, another song for you.

499
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,110
This is what a man should do.

500
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,750
Help me beat him, go now.

501
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,310
Leaning on the rail,
rage and loathing bristling under the cap.

502
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,340
The rain stops, I look up to the sky.

503
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,190
My sighs cannot tell my rage and emotion.

504
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,670
My fame of thirty years becomes dust and dirt.

505
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,190
Eight thousand miles of journey,
only with cloud and moon as companions.

506
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,790
Never wait and waste your time,
or else you will regret it.

507
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,710
Wow, master, please try to hold him.

508
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,500
Wow, I almost regret it for my life.

509
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,030
The national humiliation of the Jingkang
event was not revenged yet.

510
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,150
When can we regain our land?

511
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,950
Move the chariots to attack
and conquer the Helan Mountain.

512
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,990
We want to eat the enemy's meat
and drink their blood.

513
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,830
Let's rebuild our home...

514
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,550
and...

515
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,750
gain...

516
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,150
victory...

517
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,390
You're something.

518
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,190
But you are actually a lascivious scholar.

519
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,070
It's not decent to look and say and listen.

520
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,110
Stop.

521
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,630
You know I am a decent gentleman.

522
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,630
Thank you for your help.

523
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,350
May I know your name?

524
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,550
I am Wen Wenqie, I am just an ordinary doctor.

525
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,230
But you fight well.

526
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,630
So what? I can't even get my dream come true.

527
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,630
What is your dream?

528
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,670
Linglong, Yue Linglong.

529
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,390
The lady-boss of the Treasure Inn?

530
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,630
Who is she?

531
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,110
I heard that this lady has soft bones.

532
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,620
Her dance can excite every man.

533
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,550
For those men who watch her dance,

534
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,430
they will uncontrollable fall in love with her.

535
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,980
Are you kidding?

536
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,910
Then you look down upon Linglong.

537
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,670
Even a word from her...

538
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,030
can soften me...

539
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,990
Her words can make me feel like a dumb-bell.

540
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,510
If this is the case, I must go meet her.

541
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,150
Linglong is my everything.

542
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,990
So at mid-autumn festival,

543
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,350
you will go to Treasure Inn to meet her?

544
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,540
Sure.

545
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,220
Thank you boss, we are leaving.

546
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,520
The guys in the carriage, listen up,
we suspect that...

547
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,350
this carriage is related to a crime
happened in White Horse Town.

548
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,670
Please come out to meet our officer.

549
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,980
We want a statement from you.

550
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,270
Sir...

551
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,310
Sir, please don't get angry.

552
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,990
I think you prefer punishment to politeness.

553
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,110
Be careful.

554
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,940
Sir.

555
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,390
Why don't we go after them?

556
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,620
It's useless.

557
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,870
They want to shift our attention
and move the White Jade Goddess away.

558
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,990
Their destination is only one.

559
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,510
Treasure Inn?

560
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,180
Where are they?

561
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,790
We were attacked by Lady Fox,
Tang Ao and King of Eagle Claws.

562
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,220
Many buddies were killed.

563
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,670
Without their help,

564
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,550
I would have been killed too.

565
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,020
Are they the kids we saw in the White Horse Town?

566
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,310
Captain Iron,

567
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,550
we are willing to help.

568
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,670
Why did you tail me?

569
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,550
I suspected your identity when I first saw you.

570
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,110
How come a small potato at the court
could be that good at Kung fu?

571
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,950
How can you deny for being Jin's fellow?

572
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,580
But I think you're a triad.

573
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,150
How can you prove you are a constable?

574
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,750
Don't let me see you again.

575
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,430
I won't spare you when I see you again.

576
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,430
I mean he would punch you.

577
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,510
Hey, what should we do now?

578
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,590
Let's go to Treasure Inn.

579
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,510
Why should we go?

580
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,230
Why not?

581
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,750
If we get the killers, he would lose face.

582
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,070
Hey, hero, you'll have companions on the way now.

583
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,430
Companions can teach me new things, I like that.

584
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,910
The moon in the desert is so pretty.

585
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,670
I really want to stay here for the rest of my life.

586
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,110
Wow, this moon is really like...

587
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,740
Mr. Poet, what do you think it's like?

588
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,270
It's like a round and big ass.

589
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,510
What? You ruined the romance of the night.

590
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,870
Sky, with my wine, may I ask how many times
this bright moon appears?

591
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,830
I don't know what year this year is.

592
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,110
You are in the mood, aren't you?

593
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,430
Romance is inside your heart, no one can ruin it.

594
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,660
Why are you so happy?

595
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,510
It's because I can see Linglong tomorrow.

596
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,310
If I show up, she will take you as a scum.

597
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
You haven't loved a woman whole-heartedly.

598
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,820
It doesn't matter what she is thinking.

599
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,550
You only need to know you love her, that's all.

600
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,910
This is so called unrequited love.

601
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,500
Yeah, if she is happy, I will be happy.

602
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,270
If she is unhappy, I will be unhappy.

603
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,190
Yue Linglong is really lucky.

604
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,990
She has a civilized kung-fu master
loving her so much.

605
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,150
Maybe he is not alone.

606
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
If you haven't met me first,

607
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,790
but if you met her first,

608
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,110
sure you will fall for her at first sight.

609
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,180
No way, this guy will kill me for sure.

610
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,300
Of course not. A rare kind like Linglong,

611
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,390
sure other men will also fall for her.

612
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,390
If more people appreciate her beauty
and her goodness,

613
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,580
I will be more than happy.

614
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,070
You sound like a pimp.

615
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,190
Let's go for a walk.

616
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,990
Don't leave the fire,
there will be many wolves at night.

617
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,190
If you meet them, you will be bitten to death.

618
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,500
I am scared.

619
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,220
What a good day.

620
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,030
We will reach the Treasure Inn half day later.

621
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,190
Got it?

622
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,190
We will not be tanned soon.

623
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,070
"Treasure Inn"

624
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,230
Hu Wa.

625
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,750
Mr. Wen, want some goat liver soup?

626
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,790
They look fierce, do they want to fight?

627
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,630
I don't think they are civilized guys.

628
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,840
You look tough, if I were them,
I wouldn't dare to beat you.

629
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,710
No, I am kind.

630
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,940
No one will beat me.

631
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,670
I haven't seen such an ugly guy before.

632
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,390
He is talking about you.

633
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,110
He is talking about you.

634
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,960
I hate people messing with my hair.

635
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,670
Beat him.

636
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,390
Can you give me one more room?

637
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,910
Mr. Wen, on the 14th and 15th of August,

638
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,710
there will be Treasure Auction at the inn.

639
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,750
The rooms are all booked.

640
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,350
I just can't spare another one for you.

641
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,430
Well, let's set a camp out there.

642
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,070
Yesterday we could sleep out.

643
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,950
But there are many snakes outside this place.

644
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,790
No fire can keep them away.

645
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,830
If you sleep out, you will die.

646
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,510
So? What is it about?

647
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,310
I have one more room which can be spared for you.

648
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,030
If you don't mind, you can take that.

649
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,710
Thank you.

650
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,020
Enjoy it.

651
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,340
Rooms should be spare for officers.

652
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,710
Captain Iron is right.

653
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,350
This room is mine.

654
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,070
You don't have the keys.

655
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,910
How can you say that's yours?

656
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,790
Kid, where did you learn your kung-fu?

657
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,100
My grandpa taught me.

658
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,630
May I know his name?

659
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,510
He is a man of no name.

660
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,430
He just taught me...

661
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,710
the essence of kung-fu is speed.

662
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,230
Okay.

663
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,750
Let me watch your speed.

664
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,630
You two are really great.

665
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,670
I am willing to spare one more room for you
to settle the argument.

666
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,630
Captain Iron, please stay.

667
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,270
Linglong.

668
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,350
Here you are.

669
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,670
She is nothing special.

670
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,870
But if you marry her,
you will die two or three years earlier.

671
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,870
What if you marry me?

672
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,990
Marry you?

673
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,260
I prefer death.

674
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,630
Lady boss?

675
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,910
You the lady boss who trades goods with the triads?

676
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,100
I am only a woman.

677
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,820
Those businessmen just give me a chance
to make a living.

678
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,060
Let me tell you frankly.

679
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,150
I am here to get the bandits...

680
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,590
and the stolen booty.

681
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,270
If you want to stop me, you'll be put to jail too.

682
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,670
Since Captain Iron wants to execute law with force,

683
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,790
I will not bother you all.

684
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,990
At that time, let's see how we act accordingly.

685
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,550
Mr. Jin, Captain Iron is here for you.

686
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,230
You'd better handle it with care.

687
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,550
Thank you for your care.

688
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,350
Linglong.

689
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,190
Your stance is special.

690
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,870
I don't fight with stance, I fight with sense.

691
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,150
No stance is the best stance,
you're really something.

692
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,630
Hu Wa, bring me the wine.

693
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,940
Yes, Sis Linglong.

694
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,150
Sis Linglong.

695
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,030
I always want to drink with kung-fu masters.

696
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,670
Here is my toast.

697
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,340
Hey, I haven't seen you drink before.

698
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,910
Yes, I haven't drunk any wine before.

699
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,710
I didn't put any drugs in it.

700
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,070
You're a kind of drugs indeed.

701
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,550
But I am not sure...

702
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,660
how strong it is.

703
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,750
Thank you for your trouble today,
take an early rest now.

704
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,390
Hey.

705
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,110
You shouldn't drink if you don't know how.

706
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,630
You are captivated by the big tits.

707
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,830
What do you mean?

708
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,430
I mean she's got big tits but no brain.

709
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,180
No, big tits...

710
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,230
can stimulate my brain.

711
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,190
That's right.

712
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,420
The sky is so red.

713
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,980
The sun has already set.

714
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,630
If red sky appears in a desert,

715
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,110
the old people will tell you a storm is coming.

716
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,100
How big the storm can be?

717
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,110
It can take a whole camel team away.

718
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,910
Nothing will be left.

719
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,270
Five tough kung-fu masters suddenly appeared.

720
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,660
Who are they?

721
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,270
Who cares. Anyway,

722
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,310
no one will leave this place alive.

723
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,510
When Silver Armor Army is here, all will die.

724
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,150
Every kung-fu master will sure die...

725
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,110
whenever they encounter such a strong army.

726
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,350
Pay attention to the lady boss...

727
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,870
and that doctor who plays the fool.

728
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,030
They are tough to handle.

729
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,550
Why don't you sleep?

730
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,430
I can't sleep.

731
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,590
Me too.

732
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,030
Do you want to have two lovers at the same time?

733
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,350
Beware this will become a tragedy.

734
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,590
Hey.

735
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,150
Why did you disguise as Linglong?

736
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,430
I didn't disguise, you just lost your mind.

737
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,710
I am too happy to be invited to your room.

738
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,100
What else can make you happier?

739
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,350
I dare not ask for more.

740
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,350
I am already satisfied with what I am having now.

741
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,510
We have been friends for three years.

742
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,870
You came here for a drink and then...

743
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,310
Left at the mid-autumn festival.

744
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,670
You didn't come here for trade or for revenge.

745
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,180
What do you come here for?

746
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,750
What do you mean?

747
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,550
You know...

748
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,280
many scums came here.

749
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,070
They even want to bully me.

750
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,350
But all were knocked out by me.

751
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,750
I know.

752
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,670
But you know, I helped you to dispatch many scums.

753
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,150
How about you?

754
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,030
What do you want from me?

755
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,670
Nothing...

756
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,310
I hate liars.

757
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,580
Better be honest.

758
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,030
I don't lie, I am honest.

759
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,550
Speak up.

760
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,220
Linglong, I...

761
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,230
I am a scholar, sorry that it's hard to tell, I...

762
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,270
Do you think I dare not kill you?

763
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,190
Linglong, if you point the sword at me like this,

764
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,790
I can easily escape like this.

765
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,950
So, if you put the sword like this, this can kill.

766
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,420
Are you from the court?

767
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,670
No.

768
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,270
So, who are you?

769
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,750
I am...

770
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,900
What?

771
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,300
I am a man who loves you.

772
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,260
I know I am no match for you.

773
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,910
But if I can stay like this forever,

774
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,710
just let me think of you from afar,
I will be most satisfied.

775
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,950
You can have many women.

776
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,430
No, in my mind, no woman is as good as you.

777
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,710
When I saw you three years ago,
I told myself that...

778
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,790
I was too lucky.

779
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,910
Finally I could have a woman...

780
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,830
whom I can care for the rest of my life.

781
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,270
Since then, I swear to myself,

782
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,030
I want to protect you my whole life,
I won't let anyone hurt you.

783
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,070
All right, you come to protect me.

784
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,110
I am scared. I'm worried that
if I told you the truth,

785
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,590
you would never talk to me.

786
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,990
He is so cute.

787
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,910
Linglong, although you are pretty,

788
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,110
time flies and it can ruin your pretty face.

789
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,830
In these years, I read many books.

790
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,990
Finally I found out an anti-aging method...

791
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,510
which can also help you to lift your face.

792
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,060
What is it?

793
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,510
There are many acupuncture points along the cheeks.

794
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,150
If you hold your fist and punch lightly like this,

795
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,710
massage for fifteen minutes everyday,

796
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,670
sure it will bring you magnificent effect.

797
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,790
Like this.

798
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,710
- Like this?
- Yes.

799
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,830
Nonsense. Who will believe in you?

800
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,030
Have you heard enough?

801
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,990
- Let me teach them a lesson.
- Forget it.

802
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,950
Brad.

803
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,150
What's up?

804
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,950
Do you recognize this carriage?

805
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,030
Nope.

806
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,350
It is the same as the one we saw at the tea kiosk,
it must be Jin's carriage.

807
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,390
So what?

808
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,580
Go check it out.

809
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,990
If the White Jade Goddess is inside, let's move.

810
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,550
It's late, and it's dangerous outside.

811
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,750
There are wolves and snakes outside.

812
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,070
But you are a tough guy, what are you afraid of?

813
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,110
But there are not many handsome guys now.

814
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,390
God won't let me die like this.

815
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,630
To hell with you.

816
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,270
Hey, let's go.

817
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,380
It's late and cold, better stay inside.

818
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,670
We just want to cool off out there, don't panic.

819
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,030
Don't stick to the door please.

820
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,870
Linglong said no, that's an order.

821
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,820
Do you want to beat me?

822
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,230
Let's go.

823
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,630
Gentlemen.

824
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,870
Take my advice, Jin Buer is a tough guy,
better leave him alone.

825
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,750
Let Captain Iron handle him.

826
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,670
Sometimes you want the investigation,
sometimes you want the bird.

827
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,060
I am not sure what you want.

828
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,310
Let's wait for the auction then.

829
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,550
Auction? You wolf.

830
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,390
Look. A flirting heart makes you aim badly.

831
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,230
I am driven mad by that bitch.
She flirts with my man.

832
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,430
She is just a bitch.

833
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,390
Hey, this is man.

834
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,950
They fall in love so easily.

835
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,950
As I think, the man that you are falling for,

836
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,630
he is just a playboy.

837
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,960
My man is better, he is rather honest.

838
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,830
Sis, what should I do?

839
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,390
I don't know.

840
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,630
But for me, I would rather be pro-active.

841
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,670
I will act first, when everything is settled,

842
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,190
I will then marry him at once.

843
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,390
I don't want to do that.

844
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,660
So I will leave you alone then.

845
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,790
You are of two minds.

846
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,950
Better go to hell.

847
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,790
I am not.

848
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,310
No? But you want to go out, why don't you go out?

849
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,070
You like this one and that one too.

850
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,950
Hey, I saw your guilty conscience.

851
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,590
If not, how could I escape?

852
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,630
I tell you, you can't woo a bird like this.

853
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,070
Why are you dressed like this?

854
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,070
Do you like that?

855
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,860
You have a good figure.

856
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,110
You are open and straight forward, I like that.

857
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,340
What do you want? Tell me.

858
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,910
I think you know it pretty well.

859
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,910
But a man and a woman stay alone,
the woman will lose at last.

860
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,550
Be frank, you know why I am here?

861
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,430
I came here for your beauty.

862
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,670
It's useless even if you cry for help.

863
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,550
Better listen to me.

864
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,830
Let me ask you, when you saw the lady boss,

865
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,310
why did you act like you are possessed?

866
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,430
We are just friends.

867
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,710
Friends...

868
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,220
This is the standard answer of men.

869
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,500
We are just friends.

870
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,390
We haven't touched hands, right?

871
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,270
Nothing happened.

872
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,590
Nothing?

873
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,150
Now this is friendship.

874
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,380
But soon, it will become more than friendship.

875
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,820
Now you haven't touched her hand.

876
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,560
Soon, you will touch her whole body.

877
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,790
Let me ask you, who is prettier? She or me?

878
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,720
What a dignified question.
Of course my answer is you.

879
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,230
If not, you would cut my balls off.

880
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,550
So, do you want her or me?

881
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,580
I want you of course.

882
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,110
If not, you would kill me.

883
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,510
So you are putting me off.

884
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,390
It hurts.

885
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,750
But I am afraid of being pregnant.

886
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,710
Don't worry, no such coincidence.

887
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,590
What if it happens?

888
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,270
Don't worry, I'll be responsible for that.

889
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,550
You will feed the baby.

890
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,870
But I will do all the housework, right?

891
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,030
What is that in your mouth?

892
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,350
What?

893
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,230
This is from the notorious rapist Ren Yingxiao.

894
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,310
To make it simple, this is aphrodisiac.

895
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,190
Oh no.

896
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,550
Do you have any more? One more please.

897
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,870
All for you.

898
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,270
Come on, it works now.

899
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,710
Come on.

900
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,220
Here I am.

901
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,070
Oh, you bastard.

902
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,790
You made me fall.

903
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,630
Why are you so anxious?

904
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,310
Oh my God. May God bless you.

905
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,030
I am going to ask for help.

906
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,590
But I don't know what to do next.

907
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,750
Don't bite me.

908
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,070
Buddies, I came from Sichuan.

909
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,510
My meat is hot.

910
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,310
I don't care.

911
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,990
- Your sis fell outside the window.
- I don't care.

912
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,710
- There are many snakes outside.
- I don't care.

913
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,910
Stop.

914
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,830
I won't fall for that bitch.

915
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,350
Save your sis now.

916
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,190
I have to save my sis now.

917
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,070
Sis, don't panic, we are here to save you.

918
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,070
Hurry up. Where are you?

919
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,150
We will get some sulfur,
the snakes will be scared away.

920
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,660
No need.

921
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,910
Get someone to help me walk.

922
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,590
I have numb hands and legs, I just can't walk.

923
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,270
Can you hear me?

924
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,830
- Get someone to help her walk.
- Get someone to help her walk.

925
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,310
Get someone to help her walk.

926
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,780
So, let's get one to help.

927
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,070
Okay. Okay.

928
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,230
Why did you push me out?

929
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,710
I heard you saying "Get me to help".

930
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,910
Hubby, thank you for saving me.

931
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,630
No hubby, call me Brad.

932
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,270
Hey, the snakes seem to be unfriendly.

933
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,950
Yes, why don't you cover me?

934
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,100
How?

935
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,750
Let's distract their attention.

936
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,300
How?

937
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,790
You'd better scare them.

938
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,780
Come on, don't be that silly.

939
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,340
Hey, it works.

940
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,630
What should we do?

941
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,150
Don't come over.

942
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,580
You bitch.

943
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,500
Your hand.

944
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,070
Catch it.

945
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,670
Thank you.

946
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,430
Let's see who is seriously injured.

947
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,790
Who is seriously injured?

948
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,820
This guy is seriously hurt.

949
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,710
Let's cure him first.

950
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,990
Oh, it's me.

951
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,430
My ass was bitten.

952
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,430
You are his best friends.
Who is going to suck the venom out of him?

953
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,500
Don't look at me.

954
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,190
Hey, you are his friend, better help him.

955
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,590
Have you slept with him?

956
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,590
Not yet.

957
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,070
Have you forgotten that I am a doctor?

958
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,350
Here comes the professional.

959
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,580
Doctor, come and suck.

960
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,630
But I can use the needle.

961
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,550
That's great.

962
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,960
What a long one. Where do you want to stick it?

963
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,750
You don't want to know that.

964
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,310
Be careful.

965
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,630
Are those people laughing at me?

966
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,150
Nope.

967
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,420
Are you okay?

968
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,590
What are you laughing at?

969
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,310
- What are you laughing at?
- No laughing.

970
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,790
What's up?

971
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,790
Captain wants to talk to you.

972
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,870
Sir, here they are.

973
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,430
Guys, come and take a look.

974
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,750
We wanted to check this carriage last night.

975
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,630
Do you think no one is around the carriage?

976
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,750
The three masked guys guard
that carriage the whole night.

977
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,990
Around the carriage,
it is surrounded with hairy threads.

978
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,510
They all link to traps with arrows.

979
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,430
If you get close,

980
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,830
you'll be shot like a hedgehog.

981
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,270
Why do you want to see me?

982
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,310
I have got a letter by the pigeon.

983
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,870
It proves that you two are innocent.

984
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,550
You guys are not Jin's fellows.

985
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,350
"Young Master and Brad are innocent."

986
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,620
"Those girls are bandits, no threats.
Wen's identity is unknown, no record."

987
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,510
These are the facts.

988
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,710
I heard that you dream for being
a Gold Shield Constable.

989
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,540
If you are willing to,

990
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,830
I can make you a grade one constable.

991
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,940
I will arrest Jin Buer.

992
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,990
I will take your place and become the captain.

993
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,070
What an ambitious man.

994
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,820
I like that.

995
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,310
If you catch Jin Buer,

996
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,190
I will let you take my place...

997
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,500
as the captain.

998
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,180
How about us?

999
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,190
If I get them, the award will go to them.

1000
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,580
Sure.

1001
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,030
A big storm will come,
it may come between one and three o'clock.

1002
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,340
After the auction,

1003
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,950
we need to exterminate all our enemies.

1004
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,510
Then we stay in the inn.

1005
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,870
We won't let Red Dragon and his gang comes in.

1006
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,150
Once the storm arrives, they will all die.

1007
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,630
At the same time, Zhu will take my medal
to Shanhaiguan for more soldiers.

1008
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,230
Isn't it too dangerous to go out now?

1009
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,230
If you all understand,
we will stick to our own post.

1010
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,870
Sir, just count on me, I will make it.

1011
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,910
Sir, there is quicksand around.

1012
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,790
It's dangerous to walk around.

1013
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,350
You'd better stay inside the inn.

1014
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,070
Ride.

1015
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,670
Bastard.

1016
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,750
I told you, there is quicksand around.

1017
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,070
Enjoy.

1018
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,190
Mr. Tudor, how are you?

1019
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,190
It's scary.

1020
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,710
I haven't met such horrible tornado before.

1021
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,310
What? You met a tornado?

1022
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,030
This is really horrible.

1023
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,980
Luckily we found that early and escaped.

1024
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,870
I witnessed a team of merchants
who failed to escape.

1025
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,950
They were swallowed together with the camels.

1026
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,870
I don't know where they are.

1027
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,640
If the tornado comes here,

1028
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,630
can this house stand?

1029
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,830
Don't worry.

1030
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,300
This inn was built with steel piles.

1031
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,670
Each was deeply fixed five meters underground.

1032
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,590
For the wood on top,

1033
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,550
each was fixed tightly by twelve copper nails.

1034
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,950
It can withstand big storm and tornado.

1035
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,100
Hey,

1036
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,630
when will the auction start?

1037
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,070
Yes. When to start?

1038
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,590
Same as last year, it will start at 9 pm.

1039
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,550
- Hu Wa, Lanlan.
- Yes.

1040
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,230
Please send them all good wine.

1041
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,590
One pot each, on the house.

1042
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,830
Bravo. Thank you.

1043
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,190
Hey, let's go down and move.

1044
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,270
Just these scums. I can handle it.

1045
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,630
You count one two three, then I will fix them all.

1046
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,940
Can you make it?

1047
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,270
One, two, three...

1048
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,750
Go to hell.

1049
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,550
I will beat you later.

1050
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,550
I want to drink some water.

1051
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,630
Save your breath.

1052
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,390
One hundred, one hundred and one...

1053
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,790
How come such super masters
are kept in the basement?

1054
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,830
You should never judge people from their looks.

1055
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,030
They were four Copper Men from the Shaolin Temple.

1056
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,870
They have tough body,
no swords or weapons can hurt them.

1057
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,980
Since they broke the temple rules
and were expelled, Linglong let them stay.

1058
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,620
Linglong knows someone would mess up the auction.

1059
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,110
She wants me to guard here.

1060
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,070
I can't imagine that it's you two.

1061
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,430
Hey, since we are friends,
you'd better leave us alone.

1062
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,350
But I must keep my promise.

1063
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,950
Guys, better leave now.

1064
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,510
So, I am so sorry.

1065
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,980
Save it. You are no match for him.

1066
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,670
Hey, what is he responsible for?

1067
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,110
We are helping our friends too.

1068
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,750
We can't leave like that. Go.

1069
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,390
It hurts.

1070
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,990
I stabbed the acupuncture points...

1071
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,030
which are good to your health.

1072
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,310
Don't worry, it's of no harm.

1073
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,990
Hey, you can't beat him, what should we do?

1074
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,030
I can't make it, I think I must commit suicide.

1075
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,510
No.

1076
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,790
It's sweet.

1077
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,390
How come a man has milk?

1078
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,390
Oh no.

1079
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,790
Of course.

1080
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,150
This is my special drug named "Game over".

1081
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,590
It is specially made to fix
those kind-hearted fools.

1082
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,070
Fall down.

1083
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,430
Come on, drink more. Good wine.

1084
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,150
I don't mean it.

1085
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,790
Serve you right. I feel dizzy.

1086
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,420
Stand still...

1087
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,360
Come on. Good wine.

1088
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,030
Dear friends, the treasure auction now begins.

1089
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,590
You can bring your treasure to the stage now.

1090
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,980
This is Longquan Sword,
it is the most powerful sword in the world.

1091
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,870
The price is thirty thousand taels of silver.

1092
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,790
Why does it cost so much? Longquan Sword?

1093
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,990
This is the treasure awarded
to the general by the emperor.

1094
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,790
Jade and silk cloak.

1095
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,510
It can protect the wearer from fire and weapons,

1096
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,070
costs eighty thousand taels of silver.

1097
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,950
Eighty thousand taels of silver? Does it worth?

1098
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,150
This is Snowy Lotus from Tienshan.

1099
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,670
It is the best medicine of the world,
it cures all kinds of poison.

1100
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,070
The price is one hundred thousand taels of silver.

1101
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,950
Get down now.

1102
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,900
All are trash.

1103
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,870
The most valuable treasure is with Jin Buer.

1104
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,630
Jin Buer?

1105
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,190
Jin, tell me how much the White Jade Goddess costs.

1106
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,950
I, Tong Tianpeng, the King of Gold can afford it.

1107
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:27,950
Master Tong,

1108
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,870
we all know that your Gold Mountain Bank
is rich in cash.

1109
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,790
But it is already sold.

1110
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,390
Who is the buyer?

1111
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,740
Red Dragon.

1112
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,340
At what price?

1113
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,390
A price that you can't afford.

1114
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,830
My bank is as rich as the court.

1115
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,230
I can afford any price you claim, I...

1116
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,790
Master.

1117
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,510
Master, what's up?

1118
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,060
Are you all right?

1119
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,140
What's the matter?

1120
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,020
Lady boss, what do you mean?

1121
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,830
Bull shit.

1122
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,550
I am always a fair person.

1123
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,190
Tell me, who is messing up here?

1124
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,150
It's me.

1125
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,790
It's you?

1126
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,710
The court wants to arrest Jin Buer,
no one should bother.

1127
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,870
Are you from the court?

1128
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,070
That's right.

1129
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,780
He is the Gold Shield Constable.

1130
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,510
For those who don't want to be involved,
step aside.

1131
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,380
Captain Iron from the court wants
to arrest Jin and his gang.

1132
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,630
Captain Iron, why do you want to arrest me?

1133
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,150
You have to prove it.

1134
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,510
From the White Jade Goddess in your carriage.

1135
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,950
White Jade Goddess inside my carriage? Who saw it?

1136
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,550
Cut the crap.

1137
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,830
Get him.

1138
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,430
They are fakes.

1139
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:09,870
Acoustic Power.

1140
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,150
Everyone out.

1141
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,990
Run. Everybody run.

1142
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,150
Jin, how dare you mess up my auction?

1143
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,230
I want to kill you.

1144
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,860
You...

1145
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,070
Be careful.

1146
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,430
Captain Iron, are you crazy?

1147
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,670
Let her go.

1148
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,710
The sword in the broadsword is
as fast as lightening.

1149
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,710
You are the one who killed Yuan Yong.

1150
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,190
Your grandpa taught you good stuffs.

1151
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,630
But he didn't teach you one thing.

1152
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,510
That is defending yourself from your enemies.

1153
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,550
I can't imagine that you have become a thief.

1154
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,790
I have been an honest officer...

1155
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,430
in the past 30 years.

1156
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,590
Except one thousand two hundred taels of silver
a year from the court,

1157
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,190
what else have I got?

1158
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,620
But enemies all over the world.

1159
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,110
My parents, my wife and son
were all killed by my enemies.

1160
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,110
If I go on working as a chief,

1161
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,060
I will be killed by my enemy one day.

1162
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,080
As an option, I chose to earn some money
and go into seclusion.

1163
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,390
You can't escape.

1164
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,870
Yes, no one can escape tonight.

1165
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,020
Except us.

1166
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,910
I will burn this place down.

1167
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,430
Only bones and ashes will be left.

1168
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,350
The court will take me die at work.

1169
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,710
Maybe they will grant me an honor.

1170
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,980
Yu Linglong is hurt, your girl is in my hands.

1171
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,910
Do you think you can beat us five?

1172
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,430
Count me in too.

1173
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,110
I think you are dying.

1174
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,830
Do you want us to send you to hell now?

1175
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,070
We can have meaningful death.

1176
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,430
If I can die for Linglong,
it's the most meaningful death.

1177
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,870
You still have mood to say nonsense.
It's a matter of death, man.

1178
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,270
Okay, I'll send you guys to hell now.

1179
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,430
Go.

1180
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,390
Killing Shower.

1181
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:51,830
Danger.

1182
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,590
Hu Wa.

1183
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,100
Sis Ling-long.

1184
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,830
Killing Shower

1185
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,910
Killing...

1186
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,870
Damn your shower.

1187
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,630
Dare you go after them?

1188
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,300
Forget about them.

1189
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,830
Hey, your hubby left you alone.

1190
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,070
Why not marry me?

1191
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,790
Let her go.

1192
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,190
I can be a bandit.

1193
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,100
But I won't allow my fellows to be rapists.

1194
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,820
You can kill her.

1195
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,870
But you can't ruin her honour.

1196
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,430
Forget it, we are family.

1197
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,590
Hey, your situation is critical.

1198
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,750
I was attacked by Tang Ao's poisonous weapons.

1199
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,910
I took the antidotes already.

1200
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,070
But I will become blind in two weeks time.

1201
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,430
How about Yu Linglong?

1202
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,980
I checked her wounds with hands.

1203
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,750
Luckily she is protected by her air stance.

1204
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,750
It saved her from serious wound.

1205
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,270
The wound isn't deep, her organs are not hurt.

1206
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,390
But she bleeds a lot, I must stitch her up.

1207
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,870
And then acupuncture for twelve main points.

1208
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,430
It is to stimulate her self-treatment power,
then she will be fine.

1209
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,390
Who is going to stitch her up?

1210
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,710
You.

1211
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,500
I know nothing about that.

1212
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,270
You operate it by following my instructions.

1213
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,710
How can I make it?

1214
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,390
Come on, you are a man.

1215
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,790
To cure Linglong, you have to touch her.

1216
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,910
In that case,
she cannot marry another man in future.

1217
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,790
So I must find her a man she likes.

1218
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,710
I know she likes you.

1219
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,070
Do you want her to die like this?

1220
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,110
Hey. Okay, stop.

1221
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,150
Don't let my sister know this.

1222
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:47,740
Have you figured out anything? Dawn is coming.

1223
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,550
When the Silver Armor Army comes,

1224
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,910
we will have no time.

1225
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,710
Save my sister.

1226
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,580
I am thinking.

1227
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,790
Grandpa taught me that...

1228
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,270
the essence of strategy is patience.

1229
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,870
If we can't be patient, we will fail.

1230
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,030
Captain Iron, everything is ready.

1231
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,590
This is your share.

1232
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,630
Red Dragon will come soon.

1233
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,910
I hope he can come before the heavy storm.

1234
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,670
After the delivery,
we can split the fifty thousand taels of gold.

1235
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,830
Then, we will go our own ways and never meet again.

1236
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,100
Hey, how about the other treasures?

1237
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,870
The lotus, the cloak and the Longquan Sword,
have you found them?

1238
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,950
I search every inch of the inn
but failed to find them.

1239
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,070
Search again.

1240
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,420
Yes sir.

1241
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,820
Yes.

1242
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,510
People said Jin and Captain Iron
are powerful kung-fu masters.

1243
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,270
Together with Lady Fox,
King of Eagle Claws and Tang Ao.

1244
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,590
About us, only Wen and I are better in kung-fu.

1245
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,230
Linglong is hurt, and you two,

1246
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,870
you know nothing but flirting.

1247
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,350
I know what you are thinking now.

1248
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,030
Grade A against grade B.

1249
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,230
Grade B against grade C.

1250
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,910
Grade C against grade A.

1251
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,430
Who is grade C?

1252
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,870
We will be killed.

1253
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,430
Stop pretending.

1254
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,190
Show up if you're a powerful kung-fu master.

1255
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,750
Here comes the powerful kung-fu master.

1256
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,390
Kill them.

1257
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,230
Beat them.

1258
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,110
Do you want to fetch the sword?

1259
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,870
I noticed that your legs are not
that strong last time.

1260
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,310
But you can have no escape this time.

1261
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,710
No weapons can hurt you?

1262
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,380
Isn't it tough?

1263
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,110
It's weird. Why aren't you dead?

1264
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,630
I am alive to kill you.

1265
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,310
Little lute?

1266
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,100
Lady, repent and go straight.

1267
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,390
May the Buddha have mercy on you. Rest in peace.

1268
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,670
You distract their attention.

1269
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,950
Hey, let's call it a day. Let's go.

1270
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,590
Longquan Sword?

1271
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,590
Of course I would pick any good stuff
by any chance.

1272
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,030
Two against two, it's a fair game.

1273
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,310
Okay, I'll send you to meet your grandpa.

1274
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,390
The cloak can be an underwear.

1275
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,070
Killing Shower.

1276
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,590
For the rest, tailor an underwear for me please.

1277
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,830
I want to make it a dress.

1278
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,230
It's okay.

1279
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,980
Your grandpa is right.

1280
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,430
Speed is the essence of kung-fu.

1281
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,580
But my sword is faster than you.

1282
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,390
I forgot to tell you,

1283
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,870
when I worked in the kitchen,

1284
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,830
I played knife ten times faster than you.

1285
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,030
I shouldn't lie.

1286
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,590
I ate the Snowy Lotus four hours before.

1287
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,870
My eyes were cured. Sorry for lying.

1288
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,270
Don't move.

1289
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,670
Hey.

1290
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,870
I stabbed your acupunctures,
you can't have big movements.

1291
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,590
Hubby.

1292
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,670
Hubby.

1293
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,430
Are you alright?

1294
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,560
- Hey, what should we do?
- Yeah.

1295
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:34,870
The door is breaking.

1296
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,590
Let's defend to the last, when the tornado comes,

1297
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,070
they will be dead meat.

1298
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,950
Let's hide in the basement, okay?

1299
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,990
But after the tornado leaves,
when they set fire to the basement,

1300
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,630
we will be burnt to death.

1301
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,390
Do you have another good idea?

1302
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,310
There are three points on the roof.

1303
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,670
If the three of us go up and explode the roof,

1304
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,710
the tornado will bring everything away.

1305
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,590
But the three will die too.

1306
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,230
There are three chains on the poles.

1307
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,750
If we tie ourselves with the chains,

1308
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,710
we will have a chance.

1309
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:02,940
I will go with you.

1310
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:03,950
Take the explosives with you.

1311
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:04,950
Okay.

1312
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,710
I will go with you too.

1313
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,030
No, it's dangerous.

1314
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,550
Brad, take care of her for me.

1315
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:11,790
I will be responsible for that.

1316
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,270
Close the door.

1317
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:50,000
No. Let us in.

1318
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,780
Help. Let us in.

1319
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:27,830
White Jade Goddess, finally I've found you.

1320
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,900
General, some people are above.

1321
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,990
There are three people.

1322
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,710
Go to hell with this White Jade Goddess,
Red Dragon.

1323
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:43,910
Fire.

1324
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,980
Kill them.

1325
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,620
Don't panic.

1326
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,830
I am scared.

1327
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,230
But you don't need to kill me.

1328
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,950
Linglong, hold it tight.

1329
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,710
Linglong.

1330
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,190
Linglong.

1331
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,270
Hubby.

1332
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,870
What grandpa taught me...

1333
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,390
- How are you?
- I experienced all in my life.

1334
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,710
Sacrifice is the essence of love.
Are you all right?

1335
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,990
Wen sacrificed his life for love.

1336
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,660
He won.

1337
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,990
I sacrificed a woman who is like a dream.

1338
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,910
But I won a real one in my arms.

1339
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,910
At a result, I am the winner.

1340
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,870
Brad's dream came true too.

1341
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,030
He has a shop to offer women plastic surgery

1342
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,550
and cure man's impotence.

1343
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,270
The business is wonderful.

1344
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,430
He has a lot of children now
because he cures his own impotence.

1345
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,190
And Lady Fire Dragon becomes his model.

1346
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,230
Hey, Is the food ready?

1347
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,660
You spent a few hours preparing food.

1348
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,300
The kids are hungry and the baby should be fed too.

1349
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,630
You'd better feed the baby first.

1350
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,710
Are you kidding me?

1351
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,750
It has sucked for few hours, can you see that?

1352
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,350
My tit swells.

1353
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,420
Fish is coming, hit.

1354
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,910
Oh, I am sorry.

1355
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,910
So you can see that, a woman with small tits.

1356
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,390
- They are not wise either.
- I am so sorry.
