[whoosh of gate opening] 

2
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:17,949
[distant hisses and creaks]

3
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,700
[gasps and groans]

4
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:36,251
[yelps]

5
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,522
All right, get out of the way,
get out of the way!

6
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:43,792
Come here, come here.

7
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,394
[bodies and boxes
tumble and crash]

8
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:48,797
Come on, come on, come on!

9
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,767
This is Scott,
slow down the evac!

10
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:53,635
We are coming in too hot!

11
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:56,304
Colonel, come in!

12
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,906
My god, where are we?

13
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:03,778
[shouts of pain and confusion]

14
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,813
Get them off the gate!

15
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:06,814
Look out!

16
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,150
Where are we?

17
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,418
Why didn't we come
through to earth?

18
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,820
There was no time to explain!

19
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,921
Off to the side!

20
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,021
What's going on?

21
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,556
[clamor and panic,
cries of pain]

22
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:22,828
This is Scott, come in!

23
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,330
Colonel,
come in!

24
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,866
I need a medic!

25
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:28,901
Over here!

26
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,804
Can you move
your fingers?

27
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:34,272
I think
my arm's broken.

28
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:36,108
Okay, just hold
your arm there,

29
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,876
And we'll put it
in a sling, okay?

30
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,649
Ah!

31
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:01,400
[clamour slows,
voices echo dreamily]

32
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:04,437
[echoing]:
Keep calm, keep calm.

33
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,981
[real-time speed resumes,
soldiers grunt from impact]

34
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Clear this area,

35
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:21,887
There could still be
more incoming!

36
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,334
Oof!

37
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,140
[coughing]

38
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:47,342
Are you okay?

39
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,410
Yeah.

40
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:51,312
Oh, god.
Move...

41
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:52,347
Move...

42
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:55,183
Where the hell are we?

43
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,122
Greer...

44
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:02,190
Where's colonel young?

45
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,225
He was right behind me.

46
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:12,166
[gas jets hiss and fume]

47
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,369
[crowd screams in panic]

48
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,672
Move, move, move.

49
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,741
Quiet!

50
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:21,809
Stay calm!

51
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,810
Excuse me...

52
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,211
Keep it down!

53
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:25,480
Move, move, move, move.

54
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:29,684
Colonel...

55
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:31,986
Colonel?

56
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,988
Don't move.

57
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:34,989
Where... Where are we?

58
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,991
I don't know, sir.

59
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,326
Are you...
Sir...

60
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:42,230
You're in charge, all right?

61
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,266
You're...

62
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:50,438
Sir...

63
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:56,210
Tj!

64
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,146
I'm coming!

65
00:05:58,147 --> 00:05:59,881
Clear the crowd, people,
coming through!

66
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,182
Let's go, move,
move, move!

67
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:04,552
[clamor and shouting]

68
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:06,020
Is he okay?

69
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,356
I don't know.

70
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:12,894
Wallace!

71
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,231
What is this place?

72
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,633
Look, I-I just did
what rush told me to--

73
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:18,901
Where is he?

74
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:19,635
I don't know,
he went through ahead of me.

75
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:22,004
Rush! Rush!

76
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:23,172
Eli, help me find him.

77
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,140
[stammering]
well, I--

78
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,675
[engines whine to life]

79
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,811
[people shout in confusion]

80
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,215
[engines drone and surge,
then fade]

81
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:36,252
What in the hell
was that?

82
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't know.

83
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,556
Sergeant...

84
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,157
I need you to get
these people settled,

85
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,293
And you find out
who and what we've got.

86
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:46,696
Nobody leaves
this room.

87
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,700
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,337
Eli!

89
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:54,805
Now!

90
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,080
The Core of the planet
is the power source.

91
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,348
You have to channel it
into the weapon

92
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,349
To destroy the enemy ship.

93
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,550
<i>Can't do it, dude.</i>

94
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,685
Uh, doin' it.

95
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,153
<i>It's one of those
programmer's jokes,</i>

96
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,554
<i>A problem that
can't be solved.</i>

97
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:12,822
<i>- Already solved it.
- No, you didn't.</i>

98
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,657
Just shut up!

99
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,826
And watch this...

100
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,833
What the hell!

101
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:24,867
<i>What happened?</i>

102
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:25,902
Noth--

103
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,303
Nothing happened.

104
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,905
I'm back at the beginning
of the level.

105
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,806
<i>- You're so full of yourself.
 - No. No, no, no.</i>

106
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:31,841
It worked.
The firing Code locked in.

107
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,243
<i>Whatever.</i>

108
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,215
That was extremely
unsatisfying.

109
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:55,330
Eli Wallace?

110
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:59,634
Actually, uh,
eli's not here right now...

111
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:01,769
[stammers]

112
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,906
Okay, okay, whatever you guys
think that I did,

113
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,607
I swear, you've got
the wrong guy.

114
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,476
Do I look like someone
who would be standing here

115
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:10,244
If I didn't already know
everything there is to know

116
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,345
About you?

117
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,747
Yeah, not really.

118
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,049
Right.

119
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,951
Who are you?

120
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,820
Dr. Nicholas rush.

121
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,854
May we come in?

122
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:22,390
Why?

123
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:26,094
You've spent a great
deal of time recently

124
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,396
Playing an online
fantasy game

125
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,431
Called "prometheus."

126
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:31,634
Big brother's
got nothing better to do?

127
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,436
Last night,

128
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,472
You solved
the dakara weapons puzzle.

129
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:40,476
Yeah, a month of my life
went into that.

130
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,411
You know what happens
when you solve that thing?

131
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:43,612
Nothing.

132
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:44,746
We're here.

133
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:47,816
That happened.

134
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,284
To complete that
particular puzzle,

135
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,885
You had to solve
a millennia-old

136
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:52,153
Mathematical proof

137
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:53,888
Written in
another life,

138
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:54,989
For that,

139
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,591
You've won
something of a prize.

140
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,260
Well, whatever it is,

141
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:01,228
I'll take
the cash equivalent.

142
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,596
There isn't one.

143
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:05,499
It's a non-disclosure
agreement.

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,434
Non-disclosure?

145
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:08,835
So you guys really embedded

146
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,670
A top secret problem into a game

147
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:14,207
Hoping someone like me
would solve it?

148
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,641
Yup.

149
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,743
So, what do you need
me for now?

150
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:19,345
I assure you,

151
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,914
It'll be worth your while
to sign it.

152
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,516
And if I don't?

153
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,518
We'll beam you
up to our spaceship.

154
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,320
[laughs]

155
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,025
Right.

156
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,627
Uh, I-I think I want my lawyer
to look over it first--

157
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,163
And by "lawyer,"

158
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:40,264
I assume you mean "mother."

159
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:41,999
So we'll just agree then

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,134
That I will call you.

161
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,244
[whoosh]

162
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,322
What the...

163
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:16,196
Welcome aboard
the Hammond, eli.

164
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,464
Yes, that is the planet earth,

165
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:19,332
And yes,
you are on a spaceship.

166
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,801
We need
your help, eli.

167
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:23,469
To be honest,

168
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,471
I don't know how long
it's going to take.

169
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:27,506
I should call my mom, uh...

170
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:28,940
Tell her where I am.

171
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,608
That's probably
not going to work up here.

172
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:33,744
Right.

173
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,111
You can speak to her
on the way.

174
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:37,580
There's a cover story
you'll have to follow.

175
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:39,048
I'm sorry, um...

176
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,549
On the way to...

177
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,683
To another planet

178
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,485
21 light years from here.

179
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,820
I can't go. I...

180
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,955
I have things that--

181
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:49,757
We know about
your mother's condition.

182
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,726
Well, you just know everything,
don't you?

183
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,395
We also know
you are currently unemployed,

184
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:58,231
And that your mother's
medical coverage is...

185
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:01,067
An ongoing issue.

186
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:03,302
We'll see
she gets

187
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:04,904
The best available care
while you're gone.

188
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:08,506
And if I don't sign, what,
you going to erase my memory?

189
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:09,774
[chuckles]

190
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:12,310
Something like that.

191
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,849
Can I get some pants?

192
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,917
I...

193
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,695
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson,</i>

194
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,798
<i>And behind me is a stargate.</i>

195
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,100
<i>It was originally built
millennia ago</i>

196
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,768
<i>By an alien race
  who we call "the ancients."</i>

197
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,136
<i>Over the next few hours,
  we'll be touching on</i>

198
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:40,503
<i>Some of the things
  you need to know...</i>

199
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:41,671
<i>...There are 39 symbols</i>

200
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,606
<i>Representing
  star constellations</i>

201
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,841
<i>As seen from earth...</i>

202
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:48,043
<i>...When a connection is made
between two stargates,</i>

203
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:51,146
<i>An unstable energy vortex
  emerges from the gate--</i>

204
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:52,514
Whoa!

205
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:53,848
<i>...And settles into
  the event horizon</i>

206
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,883
<i>Or "puddle"
  as we like to call it...</i>

207
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:58,652
<i>Later, it was discovered
  that using an eighth symbol</i>

208
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,687
<i>Would actually
dial another galaxy...</i>

209
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,789
<i>...In hundred of thousands
of light years</i>

210
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,590
<i>Via an interstellar wormhole...</i>

211
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,058
<i>...It is believed</i>

212
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,559
<i>An unprecedented
amount of power is required...</i>

213
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,794
[lecture starts to blur,
and Jackson's voice overlaps]

214
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,696
<i>...Mysterious ninth chevron...</i>

215
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:11,464
<i>The first six symbols...</i>

216
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,600
<i>...Establish on a planet
  discovered two years ago...</i>

217
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,768
<i>The entire purpose
of the project</i>

218
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,003
<i>Is to hopefully one day
dial the nine chevron address</i>

219
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,339
<i>Found in the ancient database.</i>

220
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,874
<i>Hi! I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson.</i>

221
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,076
Now, you've heard the term
"hyperspace" for years...

222
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,578
Where are you?

223
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:28,879
<i>It's top secret.</i>

224
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,414
Eli!

225
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,315
I'm serious, ma. I can't say
anything more than that.

226
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,883
<i>I don't understand.</i>

227
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,284
Why could you not at least
tell me you were leaving?

228
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:36,785
I'm sorry,

229
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:38,320
But did you get
the letter from--

230
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,088
<i>Yeah, the air force,
I got it.</i>

231
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:42,189
Are you in a plane now?

232
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,825
You sound like
you're in an airplane.

233
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,226
Uh, no,
it's nothing like that.

234
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:49,162
I want you to know that
they're going to look after you.

235
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:51,063
You didn't have to do this.

236
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:54,200
This is good.

237
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,269
Really, it's the kind of thing
I always dreamed of.

238
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:07,845
Hi.

239
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,180
You mind?

240
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,415
No, go ahead.

241
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,050
Thank you.

242
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,622
First time on
a spaceship, too?

243
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:20,623
Me?

244
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:22,592
I've been on lots of, uh...

245
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,094
Various...

246
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:27,963
Eli Wallace.

247
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,398
I know.

248
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,466
You've heard of me?

249
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,500
I have.

250
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,969
Wow, that almost never happens.

251
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,803
And you are?

252
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,038
Chloe.

253
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,173
I work for Alan Armstrong.

254
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:41,576
Senator of California.

255
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,077
Oh, yeah, yeah.

256
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,512
I have heard of California.

257
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:46,080
[laughs]

258
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,415
My last job was
in the burger and fries field.

259
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,584
How'd you line that up?

260
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:53,053
I was a political science major
at harvard, so...

261
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:55,122
Mm, I hear it's a good school.

262
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,389
For a while there, I was at--

263
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,557
Mit.

264
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:58,625
I know.

265
00:13:58,626 --> 00:13:59,992
Really?

266
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:01,627
What else
have they told you about me?

267
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:15,740
What?

268
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,775
Uh, I've seen
this writing before.

269
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:19,610
In the game?

270
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:21,946
Yeah.

271
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:25,483

We're on a ship?

275
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:40,063
The Design
is clearly ancient,

276
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:44,033
In the truest
sense of the word.

277
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,736
Launched hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

278
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:47,937
Dr. Rush?

279
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,672
Faster than light,

280
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,307
Yet not through
hyperspace.

281
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,408
What are you doing?

282
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,676
Who knows how far
it's travelled.

283
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:55,877
Dr. Rush...

284
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,912
We've got
a lot of wounded.

285
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,814
We need to get home.

Go ahead.

289
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:19,832
We've got a problem.

290
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,633
One of the air vents
just shut down in here.

291
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:23,935
Copy that.

292
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,970
Yeah, the air's
getting pretty thin

293
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,138
In here, too.

294
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,073
What does that mean?

295
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:32,477
That the life-support system
is failing.

296
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,813
We should probably do
something about that.

297
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,053
Well, it's always
just one more year.

298

It's a command.

Where?

300
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,225
It's a lot safer
than other places I've been.

You've put
your time in, Everett.

When this tour's over,
I promise--

Never mind, don't bother.

I am not choosing
my job over you.

00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:44,741
Holy...

336
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,079
Senator...

337
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,447
It is my honor to welcome you
to icarus base.

338
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:51,948
Colonel.

339
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,717
This is
my executive assistant, Chloe.

340
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:54,851
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

341
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:56,786
The pleasure's mine.

342
00:17:56,787 --> 00:18:00,257
She's also my daughter.

343
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:01,725
You must be the...

344
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:04,128
Contest winner, yeah.

345
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:05,696
That is a big gun.

346
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:06,697
Rail gun.

347
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:08,700
500 rounds
per minute.

348
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,369
This is lieutenant Scott.

349
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,637
He's been assigned to you,
Mr. Wallace.

350
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:14,205
Shall we go inside?

351
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,312
Unbelievable.

352
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:22,714
Yeah, it is.

353
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,749
It's weird how fast

354
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,551
You can start to take
something like this for granted.

355
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,290
So, if a stargate
can instantly transport you

356
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,658
To another planet,

357
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,161
Why did we fly here
on a spaceship?

358
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,295
Something to do with

359
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:38,697
How this one's
tied into the planet for power.

360
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:41,067
Apparently, it's been modified
to only dial out

361
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:44,704
Because incoming wormholes
are too dangerous.

362
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,739
You're the genius.

363
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,107
You can probably
tell me better.

364
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,343
All I did was solve a puzzle
in a video game.

365
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,144
You figured out something

366
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:53,979
Doctor rush has been trying
to figure out for months,

367
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,015
Which, by the way,

368
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,484
A lot of people
were glad to see.

369
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,486
And, of course,
you know colonel Telford.

370
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:02,821
Ready for this,
colonel?

371
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,790
You just give the word, sir.

372
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,792
Oh, I gave it
quite a while ago, colonel.

373
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:07,893
I'm just here to see

374
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,794
How my $1.6 billion
is being spent.

375
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:11,162
[chuckling]

376
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:12,564
Very good...

377
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:13,732
Thank you, everyone.

378
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,536
Dismissed.

379
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,874
Now, as you know,
up until now,

380
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,743
We have been unable to channel

381
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,879
The precise
amount of power necessary

382
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,348
To unlock the stargate's
ninth and final chevron.

383
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:30,649
However,

384
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,985
Thanks to some ingenuity
from young Mr. Wallace here,

385
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:34,520
That problem has
finally been solved.

386
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,356
We've heard
that before.

387
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:38,958
This time we're sure.

388
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,960
That's what
I figured out?

389
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:41,961
I embedded

390
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,963
The mathematical problem
we had to solve

391
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,064
Into the game.

392
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:46,532
I then engineered your solution

393
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:50,202
Into a practical,
workable application.

394
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:52,371
What say
we get on with it?

395
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:53,405
Absolutely.

396
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:54,540
Sergeant Riley...

397
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,143
Chevron one encoded.

398
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:01,445
Sir...

399
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:05,115
[gate creaks and clanks
as it dials]

400
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:07,918
We're dialing now?

401
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,953
A test, to see
if we can make a connection--

402
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,121
Chevron one
locked.

403
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:12,523
If we do,

404
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:13,891
We'll send an automated
reconnaissance drone through.

405
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,158
We'll see
what's on the other side.

406
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,860
Chevron two
locked.

407
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,961
And then
they'll go?

408
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,062
No, first,
we close down again,

409
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:20,931
Assess the data we receive,

410
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,165
And then perhaps
send the away team.

411
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,233
If it works.

412
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:26,803
Chevron four
locked...

413
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:28,772
Until then, they're just
interested observers like us.

414
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,408
Chevron five
locked.

415
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:33,076
Chevron six encoded.

416
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:36,513
Chevron six locked.

417
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:39,649
Chevron seven encoded.

418
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,751
[clanking]

419
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:41,785
Chevron seven locked.

420
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:42,819
[beeping]

421
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,321
Chevron eight
encoded.

422
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,125
Chevron eight locked.

423
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,794
Chevron nine encoded.

424
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,229
[electricity sparking]

425
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,903
W-what's going on?

426
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:00,605
I don't know,
we never got this far before.

427
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:02,006
[banging and clanging
from machinery]

428
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:02,874
Chevron nine...

429
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,178
Chevron nine...

430
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,881
Will not lock.

431
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,623
We matched the power
requirements down to the emu.

432
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:18,757
It must work.

433
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:19,891
Power levels in
the gate capacitors

434
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,026
Are going
into the red.

435
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:22,694
Shut it down.

436
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,396
No, wait, wait, wait...

437
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:25,230
We're reading fluctuations
in the output from the Core--

438
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:26,298
Shut it down now.

439
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,133
[power winds down]

440
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:44,382
It should have worked.

441
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,184
Well, it didn't,

442
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:48,086
And drawing power
from the planet's Core is--

443
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,354
Dangerous,
yes, we're all aware of that--

444
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,422
Regardless of
what's been spent

445
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:51,623
Or what's at stake,

446
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:52,991
My first priority

447
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:54,759
Is to ensure the safety
of the people on this base.

448
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:00,065
Of course.

449
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,232
Of course...

450
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,735
Eli...

451
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,304
We'd best run through
your equations again.

452
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:08,405
You'll excuse me.

453
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,043
You are not seriously
putting this on me?

454
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,382
Not my fault.

455
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:28,103
People, you have to
calm down.

456
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:29,538
Seriously,

457
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:32,241
You have to calm down...

[applause from crowd]

460
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,245
Yeah,
we got power!

461
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,214
Can I have
everybody's attention, please?

462
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,782
[clamor continues unabated.

463
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,584
All right, please listen!

464
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:44,921
Hey, listen up!

465
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,090
What is going on?

466
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:50,294
We're on an ancient spaceship.

467
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:52,429
What?

468
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,564
That's all I've got.

469
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:54,665
Now, what
that means is--

470
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,966
It means we need to use
the stargate

471
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,301
To get us all back home.

472
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:59,303
That is definitely on the list
of things to do, sir,

473
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:00,504
But I think right now--

474
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:01,339
You can consider that
an order--

475
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,707
We are working on it, sir.

476
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,142
Hey, I need to
speak to the person

477
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:05,309
Responsible for this.

478
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,377
Where is Dr. Rush?

479
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:07,478
Just shut up
for a second, will you?

480
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:09,247
How dare you talk to me--

481
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:10,481

482
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:12,383

484

00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,422
Sit down.

Look, I'm sorry.

00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:25,097
I'm just trying to
explain the situation.

490
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:27,266
We are on a ship,

491
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,936
But we have no idea where we are
in relation to earth.

492
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:32,805
Now, with respect, sir,

493
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:33,973
The reason you might be having

494
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:36,575
A hard time
breathing right now,

495
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:37,677
Is because the ship's
life-support system

496
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:40,546
Is not functioning properly.

497

[murmurs of panic
ripple through crowd]

498

is working on that right now.

00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,023
Okay, good,
you two are with me.

503
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,425
But these consoles
just came on.

504
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:52,826
No. Nobody touch
anything yet.

505
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:55,329
Dr. Rush needs your help.

506
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,565
Everybody else...

507
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,667
Just stay calm, stay put.

508
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:00,668
Please.

509
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:01,669
Stay put?

510
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,737
Wait, what
do you mean,

511
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:05,307
You're just going
like that?

512
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:08,744
There has to be a mistake
in here somewhere.

513
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:11,413
Seriously, who uses
a whiteboard anymore?

514
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:14,082
You have computers,
like, everywhere around here.

515
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,584
Power flow
was in the target range.

516
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:17,786
Why wouldn't
the address connect?

517
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:18,920
Wrong address?

518
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:20,155
There is only one,

519
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:22,190
Found in the ancient database
on atlantis.

520
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,759
With no other instructions.

521
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,860
No, but that's not the issue.

522
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:25,861
It has to be your proof.

523
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:26,929
My proof works.

524
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,331
You know how I know
that it does?

525
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:31,200
Because you said so.

526
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:32,802
Gentlemen,
how's it coming?

527
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,670
[scoffs] whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

528

- Wait! Save, save, save!

529
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,276
- I can't--
- Mr. Wallace, I would like you

530
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,444
To join me for dinner
in the officer's mess.

531
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,812
Thank you!
I'm starving--

532
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,880
We're quite close to
a breakthrough, actually.

533
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,815
I'd like eli
to keep working.

534
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,117
Well, we've been here
for six months.

535
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,318
It can wait a few more hours.

536
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,122
Thank you.

537
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,156
You're welcome.

538
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,600
So, uh, colonel,

539
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,134
You really have
no idea

540
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,904
Where this ninth-chevron
stargate address

541
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,272
Is going to send you?

542
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,940
No idea at all.

543
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,043
Hmm.

544
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,278
But the ancients built
the stargate with nine chevrons.

545
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,613
It's got to go somewhere.

...We've also known
for some time

549
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,017
That the only way to
unlock the ninth chevron

550
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,285
Was to solve
the power issues.

551
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,286
Well, if anyone's
going to solve it,

552
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,354
I think eli will.

553
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,356
Yes, that's right.

554
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,892
It's true...

Dr. Rush...

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:08,636
Dr. Rush!

559
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,544
I would like
to propose a toast.

560
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,212
Oh, no, that's
really not necessary.

561
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:20,915
- Not to you.
- Oh.

562
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,416
When the proposal
for this project

563
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,851
First crossed my desk,

564
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:25,019
I did not want
to approve it.

565
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
Oh, my god...

566
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:27,688
It seemed clear
to me at the time

567
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:28,922
That there were enough

568
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:30,090
Terrestrial
matters of importance

569
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,592
That needed
that kind of money.

570
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,127
Now, being
a proud father

571
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:34,595
Of a beautiful
young woman is one thing.

572
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:37,798
Having that young woman exceed

573
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,967
Every possible
expectation

574
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,135
Is quite another.

[opera plays on stereo]

It was my daughter, Chloe,

577
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:30,118
Who reminded me that
there was no greater endeavor

578
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,320
Than seeking an understanding
of who we are

579
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:32,587
And the mysteries
of the universe

580
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:33,955
In which we all exist.

581

[whispering]:
Not in those exact words.

582
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:37,760
It was also her idea

583
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,528
To embed the ancient
proof in a medium

584
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,797
That would give us access
to brilliant young minds

585
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:42,798
That we would have otherwise
overlooked.

586
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,032
And so,

This is not a drill.

To go with lieutenant Scott.

What's going on
in here?

603
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:26,708
The life-support system
is on,

604
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,444
But for some reason,
it's not working properly.

609
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:40,555
That what you're doing
is going to overload it--

610

- Eli, please!
- Is that what it says or not?

611
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:43,725
You only think you know
what it says in this screen

612
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:45,026
Because I embedded

<i>A full squadron of gliders
and a troop transport.</i>

And then you and I
and everyone else

Well, I suppose
that would have been too simple.

Apparently, that did nothing.

Does colonel young
know about this?

He knows.

670
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:16,943
Two weeks ago, you told me

671
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:19,479
That this was the best
experience of your life.

672

have happened.

too afraid to admit

00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:27,489
What I really want.

676
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:31,861
Well, you didn't tell me
you had even applied.

677

There's nothing else going on.

678
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:34,364
You know I'd tell you.

With what?

689
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:24,354
The ninth chevron.

What? We need to get
the hell out of here!

Look, it took us two years
to find this site.

692

The properties are unique.

Y-you mean the planet,
it-it's going to explode?

00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:38,868
Yes.

Okay, okay, okay,
um, um...

- We can't assume that--
- I said "if."

702
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:45,574
Then if it works,

703
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:46,976
Then it's not
a power supply issue,

704
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,177
It's the gate address.

705
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:49,411
We've known the first
eight symbols for years.

706
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:51,413
The ninth has to be
the point of origin.

we're not on the planet

Yes, yes--

It's too dangerous
to dial earth.

00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:21,859
As much of the expedition
supplies as they can.

833
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,660
Why?

834
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,329
'cause you're not going
to earth.

835
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,763
Rush dialed the ninth chevron.

836
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:27,865
Go.

837
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:29,967
Go!

838
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,174
[explosions rumble louder,
closer]

839
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,315
Once I'm through,

840
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:46,784
Follow one at a time
on a three-count!

841
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:05,404
Okay, people.

842
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:08,006
Make way.

843
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,019
You good?
Okay, let's go.

844
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:25,556
If you can hear me,

845
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:26,757
Stand back!

846
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,063
Okay, get down.

847
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:37,067
Fire in the hole!

848
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:39,102
[explosion rocks,
Chloe yelps]

849
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:45,174
Dad?

850
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,577
Dad?

851
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:50,479
Put your weight
on me...

852
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,981
Keep calm, everybody.

853
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,551
I got you.

854
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:56,652
Please...

855
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:06,795
[explosion shatters
and Sparks]

856
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:08,797
Everybody, stay calm!
Don't push!

857
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:17,172
Oh!

858
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,142
[gulps and holds his breath]

859
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:22,410
Dad!

860
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:24,712
Ah!

861
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,247
Careful, careful...

862
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:28,215
You're okay, sir.

863
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:29,250
Are you okay?

864
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,251
I'm the last one.

865
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:31,552
I'm all right.

866
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:33,488
Greer, go.
I'm right behind you.

867
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:38,459
Hammond, this is young,
come in.

868
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,127
Hammond, this is young.

869
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,295
Come in.

870
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,998
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on, people.

871
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,133
Let's do it,
let's do it.

872
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:08,221
Sir!

873
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:09,422
Go!

874
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:48,728
Sir...

875
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:50,998
We've got colonel Carter.

876
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,268
On screen.

877
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:56,737
<i>General,
we barely got away.</i>

878
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,472
<i>The planet was destroyed.</i>

879
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:00,942
We managed to beam most
of our people off the surface

880
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:02,643
Before jumping to hyperspace.

881
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:03,811
<i>We also believe</i>

882
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,780
<i>That the enemy forces
were destroyed.</i>

883
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,348
<i>Any word
  on how they gained intel</i>

884
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:09,751
<i>On our base?</i>

885
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:11,552
<i>No.
What about casualties?</i>

886
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:13,221
12.

887
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:15,323
80-plus m.I.A.

888
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,524
The Bunker-shielding technology

889
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:19,728
Prevented us from beaming out
anyone inside.

890
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,563
How many people made it
through the gate to earth?

891
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:22,965
None.

892
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:24,500
<i>None?</i>

893
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,368
<i>Our sensors indicated
  that the stargate was active</i>

894
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:29,171
<i>For a full six minutes
before the Core went critical.</i>

895
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,606
Well, they didn't come
through here.

896
00:42:30,607 --> 00:42:32,642
<i>Then where'd they go?</i>

897
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:42,352
Okay, listen up!

898
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:44,354
Everybody who is able,

899
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:48,024
We are going to search this ship
top to bottom.

900
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,026
Teams of three.

901
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,796
Weapons?

902
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,299
23, including
handguns.

903
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,633
One per group?

904
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:57,635
Yeah.

905
00:42:58,937 --> 00:43:02,306
Flashlights, radios--
only when necessary.

906
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:05,309
Once those batteries are dead,
they are dead.

907
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,678
Regular check-ins with Dr. Rush
in the control room

908
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:08,879
Every 10 minutes,

909
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,914
And keep in mind,

910
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,482
As far as we know,

911
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:13,050
This bucket is really
freakin' old,

912
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:16,587
And there may be areas of damage
where life-support is unstable,

913
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:17,922
And, look, be smart, okay?

914
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:19,257
Don't touch anything

915
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:21,893
That looks like
it might be dangerous.

916
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:23,328
How are we
supposed to know

917
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:24,796
What's dangerous?

918
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:25,931
Becker, right?

919
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:27,332
Yes, sir.
I work in the mess.

920
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,134
I mean, I did.

921
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:32,371
Well, don't touch, just look.

922
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:34,907
You're, uh...
You're James, right?

923
00:43:34,908 --> 00:43:37,577
Yes, lieutenant.

924
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:39,880
You and Riley are with me.

925
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:42,749
Subtle, man,

926
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,117
Subtle...

927
00:43:44,118 --> 00:43:45,152
[Scott]: If it's
okay with you, sir,

928
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:46,153
It might be best,

929
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:47,320
Given your obvious skills,

930
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,588
If you could hang back here,

931
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:50,090
Help keep the rest
of these people calm.

932
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:51,691
Don't patronize me, son.

933
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:55,195
No, sir.

934
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:13,682
I'm a part of it.

935
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:15,684
Colonel,
I'm in.

936
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,047
Are you all right?

937
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:28,816
I'm solid, lieutenant.

938
00:45:28,817 --> 00:45:31,418
I'm trained for this.

939
00:45:31,419 --> 00:45:33,187
Look, I-I
didn't mean to--

940
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,556
Look, not now.

941
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,265
<i>Rush, this is Scott,
  come in.</i>

942
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,002
<i>Rush, this is Scott, come in.</i>

943
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,804
Hello.

944
00:45:50,805 --> 00:45:51,939
<i>This is eli.</i>

945
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,040
Where's rush?

946
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,375
Uh, bathroom, if he found it.

947
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:58,578
Uh, I'm at what looks like
a bulkhead door.

948
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:00,513
It won't open.

949
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:03,715
<i>I was hoping rush
  could open it from there.</i>

950
00:46:03,716 --> 00:46:04,883
Should I find him?

951
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:07,953
No.

952
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:14,660
Here, give me a hand.

953
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,561
What happened to being smart?

954
00:46:16,562 --> 00:46:17,662
This could be
the engine room

955
00:46:17,663 --> 00:46:18,997
For all we know.

956
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:20,365
We got to at least
open a few doors.

957
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,367
Do we?

958
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:23,868
Do we really?

959
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:31,041
<i>Hang on.</i>

960
00:46:32,444 --> 00:46:33,944
No, keep doing
what you're doing.

961
00:46:35,113 --> 00:46:36,313
<i>I think I found
where you are.</i>

962
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:38,615
The door is flashing red.

963
00:46:38,616 --> 00:46:39,950
<i>Can you open it
  from there?</i>

964
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:42,519
Red is usually bad,
isn't it?

965
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,188
<i>Maybe it means
the door is stuck.</i>

966
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:45,722
<i>Just try it.</i>

967
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:48,525
Okay.

968
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:49,693
You should probably step back.

969
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,736
[air whooshing out]

970
00:46:59,737 --> 00:47:01,004
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not good!

971
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:02,305
Not good, more red, uh...

972
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:08,044
Close it!

973
00:47:08,045 --> 00:47:09,746
<i>- Close it now!
 - I'm trying!</i>

974
00:47:18,956 --> 00:47:21,190
Yeah, okay, we established
why that hatch was closed.

975
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:22,525
<i>Yeah.</i>

976
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:24,393
A lot of others are closed
for the same reason.

977
00:47:24,394 --> 00:47:26,796
We're only occupying a fraction
of the ship right now.

978
00:47:26,797 --> 00:47:28,464
<i>It goes on forever,</i>

979
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:29,832
<i>But if there are
  damaged areas of the ship</i>

980
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:30,966
<i>That aren't sealed,</i>

981
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:33,736
That could be our problem.

982
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:34,837
Oh, hey, good timing.

983
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:37,006
We just found--
hey...

984
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:38,007
Really?

985
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:39,475
This is Dr. Rush.

986
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:41,877
<i>Meet me in the gateroom
  immediately.</i>

987
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:44,079
Everyone.

988
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,549
[murmurs ripple through crowd]

989
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,054
What's going on?

990
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:53,689
In this case

991
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:59,294
Are five ancient
communication stones.

992
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:00,896
They work over vast distances

993
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:02,064
In real time.

994
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:03,966
We can talk to
the people on earth.

995
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,334
Yes.

996
00:48:05,335 --> 00:48:06,669
[murmurs of excitement]

997
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,803
You physically
take control

998
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,438
Of an individual
at the other end.

00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:11,440
I brought these with us

1000
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:13,241
In the event
we ended up somewhere

1001
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:15,210
Out of range
of normal communication.

1002
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:16,244
So let's use them.

1003
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:17,379
[murmurs of assent]

1004
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,481
I already have.

1005
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:21,450
[murmurs of surprise]

1006
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:23,085
Are they
sending help?

1007
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:24,553
No.

1008
00:48:24,554 --> 00:48:25,888
Why? Why are they not
sending help?

1009
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:26,955
The only means
of dialing this gate

1010
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:29,658
From our galaxy

1011
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:30,793
Was destroyed in the attack.

1012
00:48:30,794 --> 00:48:32,995
We're cut off.

1013
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:35,230
I want to use one of
those stones now.

1014
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:36,965
I have spoken with
general o'Neill--

1015
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:38,467
I am a United States senator!

1016
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:39,868
I've explained
our situation clearly.

1017
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:43,038
In light of my knowledge
and experience,

1018
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:44,740
He has placed me in charge.

1019
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:46,508
He did what?

1020
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:49,211
[loud murmurs of outrage]

1021
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:51,080
I have faith in our ability

1022
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:53,215
To repair the ship,

1023
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:54,417
And to work together,

1024
00:48:54,418 --> 00:48:56,418
But if we're
to survive this,

1025
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:58,754
We need leadership

1026
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:00,522
And a clear
chain of command.

1027
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:03,526
We only have a few
hours of air left.

1028
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,027
I want to speak to
the general myself.

1029
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,695
- Senator, please.
- Give it to him!

Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Tj?

1035
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:16,540
Excuse me, excuse me.
Okay...

1036
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:17,674
Okay, he's still breathing.

1037
00:49:19,077 --> 00:49:20,711
Oh, my god!

1038
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:21,913
I saw him
taking some pills?

1039
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:23,014
Warfarin,
for his heart.

1040
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:24,315
Blood-thinners are
the last thing he needs

1041
00:49:24,316 --> 00:49:26,084
If he's bleeding internally.
Um...

1042
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:27,653
Please do something!

1043
00:49:27,654 --> 00:49:29,321
Look, I told you,
I'm just a medic--

1044
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:30,823
Everyone, please,

1045
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:33,159
There's no need for us all
to congregate in the one place.

1046
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,127
Ms. Johansen,

1047
00:49:34,128 --> 00:49:36,663
Please find
adequate accommodation

1048
00:49:36,664 --> 00:49:38,465
For the injured,
and everyone else--

1049
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:40,701
No, I don't recognize
your authority, Dr. Rush--

1050
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:43,638
We have found quarters nearby
much more comfortable--

1051
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,173
As an ioa representative,
I think you need to--

1052
00:49:45,174 --> 00:49:46,675
Please go there, and stay there

1053
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:48,611
Until you're asked to do
something useful.

1054
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:50,714
Something useful?

1055
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:53,050
We do not want to settle in!

1056
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,718
We want to get back!

1057
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:55,753
Right?

1058
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:56,988
[shouts of agreement]

1059
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,456
We should be working
on getting home.

1060
00:49:58,457 --> 00:49:59,758
Exactly.

1061
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:01,727
I'm not sure
if that's even possible.

1062
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:02,962
What?
You haven't even tried!

1063
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:04,697
Maybe you should
actually do something

1064
00:50:04,698 --> 00:50:06,799
Instead of standing around
talking about being in charge.

1065
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,967
If that's even true.

1066
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:09,302
Everybody!

1067
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:12,539
Everyone, calm down!

1068
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,442
Now, the fact is,

1069
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:18,380
Colonel young put me in charge,

1070
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:20,116
And I expect

1071
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,185
All sg personnel
to follow my orders!

1072
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,287
As for the rest of you,

1073
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:27,291
You get out of line,
we will lock you down.

1074
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:32,831
Now, Dr. Rush

1075
00:50:32,832 --> 00:50:35,835
Is right
about a couple things.

1076
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:37,837
First off,
we all have to work together...

1077
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:41,608
And second of all,
we don't all have to stay here,

1078
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:44,578
So let's...
Let's move out.

1079
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:48,449
Come on, move.
It's okay.

1080
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,486
[murmurs of agreement]

1081

[sighs heavily]

1082
00:50:55,091 --> 00:50:57,460
I think we need you...

1083
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:00,196
So I've got your back
for now,

1084
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:01,598
But if I were you,

1085
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,901
I would find some way
to dial that gate back to earth.

1086
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:21,876
I've got some
testing equipment

1087
00:51:21,877 --> 00:51:23,177
Over here.

1088
00:51:23,178 --> 00:51:24,379
Looks broken.

1089
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,481
We'll get back to that.

1090
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,983
What about
all these ancient crates?

1091
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:28,885
If it's not ours,
don't touch it.

1092
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,021
Did no one think
of labeling anything?

1093
00:51:31,022 --> 00:51:33,558
Every case
has a bar Code.

1094
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:36,494
All right, anyone find
a bar Code reader?

1095
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:38,629
Guess that got left behind
along with the food and water.

1096
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,631
Uh-uh, we got food.

1097
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:41,132
Yeah, protein bars,

1098
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:42,767
And this powdered stuff.

1099
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:44,469
Look, everybody.

1100
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,603
Seeds? Volker,
you've got to be kidding.

1101
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:47,605
I got a case
of blank paper.

1102
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:48,940
Maybe we should start
a suggestion box.

1103
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,609
What are you staring at?

1104

You were in detention.

Yeah.

1106

For good reason.

want him to do,

1108

Leave me there?

Of course not.

I was just wondering
what to do about it now.

That's not up to you.

No, no, no.

it's thousands of years old,

00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,624
To check out the damaged
areas of the ship.

1161
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,526
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1162
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:54,928
That's good.
Where's it going now?

1163
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:56,430
Oh, I don't know,
it's just doing its thing,

1164
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:58,432
But there's lots more of 'em.

1165
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:04,205
[chuckles]

1166
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,278
Yeah, it's cool.

1167
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:12,147
Yeah!

1168
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:14,615
Do you want one?

1169
00:55:14,616 --> 00:55:17,485
It's not
a gumball machine, eli.

1170
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:19,053
Okay.

1171
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:21,288
Okay!

1172
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:23,758
Okay, so you figured out
where they keep the kinos,

1173
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:25,960
What else have you
figured out?

1174
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:34,702
Give me a break, man.

1175
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:36,570
This is my
second spaceship,

1176
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:37,938
And my first
was yesterday.

1177
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:39,540
I know.

1178
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,941
Icarus was my first
sgc assignment

1179
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,976
After training.

1180
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:44,111
I haven't
been at this

1181
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:46,313
Much longer
than you have.

1182
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:47,481
Huh...

1183
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:49,249
Did they beam you
out of your house?

1184
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,251
No, you
got me there.

1185
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:53,086
Got any food
on you?

1186
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,121
No.

1187
00:55:54,122 --> 00:55:55,155
Tylenol?

1188
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:56,256
Headache?

1189
00:55:56,257 --> 00:55:57,591
Yeah.

1190
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:59,492
Me too.

1191
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:02,462
Neuroproaxia is
a temporary paralysis

1192
00:56:02,463 --> 00:56:04,030
That can follow
a concussive injury.

1193
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,431
You don't know?

1194
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:06,532
You'd need an mri

1195
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:09,135
And a qualified doctor
who knows how to read it

1196
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,937
To know for sure
if there's spinal damage.

1197
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,505
We don't have either.

1198
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:15,007
Hopefully, it's just
the nerves in shock.

1199
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:17,843
Best I can do is insist
that you remain still.

1200
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:20,779
Your tour was over
two weeks ago.

1201
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,848
You should be
in some classroom

1202
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:24,282
In san Diego.

1203
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:27,052
Seattle.

1204
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:29,855
That's where my scholarship was.

1205
00:56:31,757 --> 00:56:33,091
I'm sorry.

1206
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:35,460
That part's not your fault.

1207
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,063
Tell rush I want to see him.

1208
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,698
Yes, sir.

1209
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:47,338
What's that?

1210
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,039
Flying camera ball.

1211
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,808
I'm calling it
a kino--

1212
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:53,143
Don't ask.

1213
00:56:56,782 --> 00:56:58,716
That's marvellous.

1214
00:56:58,717 --> 00:56:59,817
It comes
with a remote.

1215
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:02,086
I thought we could
use it to look around.

1216
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:06,824
What do you have?

1217
00:57:06,825 --> 00:57:09,994
Uh, well, it's not
so good, really.

1218
00:57:09,995 --> 00:57:12,764
These processing nodes
are scrubbers,

1219
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:14,933
Responsible for
cleaning co2 from the air.

1220
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,200
Here, here, and here.

1221
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:18,069
It's indicating
malfunctioned.

1222
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,203
Others are failing.

1223
00:57:20,873 --> 00:57:22,907
Greer, this is Scott.

1224
00:57:22,908 --> 00:57:24,041
I'm heading for the gateroom.

1225
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:25,209
Meet me there.

1226
00:57:26,912 --> 00:57:28,045
Look, I'm just saying

1227
00:57:28,046 --> 00:57:29,513
That she better
stay out of my face.

1228
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:31,882
I'll remind her of your
personal space issues

1229
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:34,785
Next chance I get.

1230
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,422
Dr. Rush?

1231
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:38,823
Colonel young wants
to see you right away.

1232
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:41,226
There should be a kind of grate
covering the node.

1236
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:04,615
A problem.

1237
00:58:04,616 --> 00:58:07,552
We see a very big problem.

1238
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,261
What happened?

1239
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:21,564
You collapsed.

1240
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,933
We brought you here.

1241
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,101
What's going on?

1242
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,669
I'm not sure.

1243
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,137
I've been here with you.

1244
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,672
You need to know
what's happening, Chloe.

1245
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,241
This is important.

1246
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,009
Dad, I was worried about you.

1247
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:35,878
Okay.

1248
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,713
And I'm scared.

1249
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,183
One step at a time, Honey.

1250
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,520
One step
at a time.

1251

[winces]

1252
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,190
My pills...

1253
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,992
No, daddy, you can't take
any more of those.

1254
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,993
Your ribs are badly bruised.

1255
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,728
You will bleed
internally.

1256
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:55,129
If I don't take those pills,

1257
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,598
A bruise is going to be
the least of my problems.

1258
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,599
I know.

1259
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,836
Don't worry about me.

1260
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:03,670
Go. Find out what's going on
out there.

1261
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,172
No, I want to be here with you.

1262
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:06,239
And I want you here,

1263
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,541
But right now,
I want to know what's going on

1264
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:10,476
Just a little bit more.

1265
00:59:13,214 --> 00:59:15,214
I'll be here when you get back.

1266
00:59:15,215 --> 00:59:16,582
Okay.

1267
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:17,716
Okay.

1268
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:30,795
What's going on?

1269
00:59:30,796 --> 00:59:32,130
I don't know, man.
The air filter's full of crap.

1270
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:33,464
Come on,

1271
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:34,498
They want us to keep looking.

1272
00:59:34,499 --> 00:59:35,499
Let's go.

1273
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,802
All right, okay.

1274
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:40,037

Everyone's heart rates
are elevated,

1277
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:46,775
People are reporting

1278
00:59:46,776 --> 00:59:48,510
What?

1279
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:49,878
The used-up residue

1280
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:51,446
Of whatever magic compound
the ancients used

1281
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:52,914
To scrub co2
from the air.

1282
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:55,350
So now we have
two big problems

1283
00:59:55,351 --> 00:59:56,351
Relating to
the life-support.

1284
00:59:56,352 --> 00:59:57,351
Our first priority
must be

1285
00:59:57,352 --> 00:59:59,287
To seal off any
of the leaks.

1286
00:59:59,288 --> 01:00:01,655
If we can manage that,

1287
01:00:01,656 --> 01:00:03,924
Then we can maybe
buy ourselves a day or so

1288
01:00:03,925 --> 01:00:06,259
Before the build-up of co2
kills us.

1289
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:09,195
As it stands,
how much time do we have?

1290
01:00:09,196 --> 01:00:11,264
I don't know.

1291
01:00:11,265 --> 01:00:12,532
Couple of hours
at most.

01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,003
Some medical-grade soda lime

1295
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:19,104
In the supply manifest?

1296
01:00:19,105 --> 01:00:20,572
It never made it.

1297
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:23,342
That's a pity.

1298
01:00:27,013 --> 01:00:29,214
Well...

1299
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:31,483
In a ship this old...

1300
01:00:31,484 --> 01:00:35,053
There's bound to be systems
past their designed life.

1301
01:00:35,054 --> 01:00:36,287
Okay, let's say
we find the leaks.

1302
01:00:36,288 --> 01:00:37,622
Can you fix this?

1303
01:00:37,623 --> 01:00:41,225
I doubt this stuff
can be cooked off.

1304
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:43,995
Perhaps if there were stores
of this substance

1305
01:00:43,996 --> 01:00:45,663
In a clean form,

1306
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:47,465
Or something else capable
of co2 sequestration,

1307
01:00:47,466 --> 01:00:49,967
Calcium carbonate,
lithium hydroxide,

1308
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:51,769
Then yes, "if."

1309
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,938
Okay, well,
that's not going to matter

1310
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:56,373
Because you're going to get
the gate dialed back to earth

an issue, rush, right?

a shuttle.

docking sleeves.

We're all going to die.

1323
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:53,261
Shut up, Franklin.

1324
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:54,996
I'm just saying what
everyone's got to be thinking.

1325
01:01:54,997 --> 01:01:56,832
I said, shut up,

1326
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:58,867
Or else
you're going to be first.

1327
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:03,138
This the door?

1328
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:05,374
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1329
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,376
<i>Can you close it?</i>

1330
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,747
It won't close.

1331
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,285
We can't close it
from here, either.

1332
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:19,153
There's something wrong
with the mechanism.

1333
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:35,770
I think I found the leak.

1334
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:40,075
There's another door
on the back of the shuttle,

1335
01:02:40,076 --> 01:02:41,844
But there's no control.

1336
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:44,747
Then maybe we can
close it off locally.

1337
01:02:48,418 --> 01:02:50,286
The shield keeping
the air inside

1338
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:52,689
Is obviously not
100% effective.

1339
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:54,357
It probably wasn't designed
to compensate

1340
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:57,361
For the amount of damage
the ship has sustained.

1341
01:02:57,362 --> 01:02:59,930
Is there a way
of boosting it?

1342
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:01,499
At least in the areas
we need it?

1343
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,202
We haven't
found a way yet.

1344
01:03:04,203 --> 01:03:05,771
It seems to be operating
at maximum capability.

1345
01:03:05,772 --> 01:03:09,174
[door hisses closed]

1346
01:03:09,175 --> 01:03:10,676
[coughing
and struggling to breathe]

1347
01:03:10,677 --> 01:03:12,011
Open the door!

1348
01:03:16,517 --> 01:03:21,255
Well, that's
not good.

1349
01:03:29,698 --> 01:03:31,666
That's very good, sir,
a very good sign.

1350
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,069
I don't have time for this,
do I?

1351
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,437
Two problems.

1352
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:37,206
We're venting atmosphere
from a damaged shuttle,

1353
01:03:37,207 --> 01:03:38,974
And even if we could
seal it off,

1354
01:03:38,975 --> 01:03:40,709
The life-support system
in this ship

1355
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,079
Is past its expiration date.

1356
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,515
We'll build up co2
to lethal levels within a day.

1357
01:03:45,516 --> 01:03:47,384
Well, that explains
the headache.

1358
01:03:47,385 --> 01:03:49,519
You already had one.

1359
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,488
They'll find a way,
that's what these people do.

1360
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:52,523
Well, most of
these people

1361
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:53,991
Aren't even
supposed to be here.

1362
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:56,393
How did the ship get damaged?

1363
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:57,761
We don't know.

1364
01:03:57,762 --> 01:03:59,029
It certainly looks like
it's been through a battle,

1365
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,664
At least the parts
we can access.

1366
01:04:00,665 --> 01:04:02,766
We're still cut off
from most of the ship.

1367
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:04,268
It's huge.

1368
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:06,003
They tried jamming something
into the shuttle doorway

1369
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:07,338
To keep it open long enough

1370
01:04:07,339 --> 01:04:08,539
To let the person inside
get out...

1371
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,009
But it just opens again.

1372
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,510
Some sort of
safety mechanism.

1373
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:13,678
Like an elevator.

1374
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:15,113
Rush says he can't override it.

1375
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:17,415
How long do we have right now?

1376
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,717
As it stands...

1377
01:04:18,718 --> 01:04:20,419
Rush says
if we don't get it closed...

1378
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,154
....We've got just over an hour.

1379
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,967
Bad air's
better than no air.

1380
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:40,674
Guess a day's
better than an hour.

1381
01:04:40,675 --> 01:04:42,375
Someone's
got to go in there

1382
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:46,012
And close this door.

1383
01:04:51,905 --> 01:04:53,205
My head is pounding.

1384
01:04:53,206 --> 01:04:56,508
Heartbeat has accelerated.

1385
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:59,077
It's getting harder
and harder to breathe,

1386
01:04:59,078 --> 01:05:02,915
As our very lives
are being vented out into space.

1387
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,116
That is going to
get old very fast.

1388
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:05,050
This needs
to be documented.

1389
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,918
No one's
going to see that.

1390
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:07,919
How do you know?

1391
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:12,491
We made it here.

1392
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,460
Someone else could, too.

1393
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:19,000
If we die,

1394
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,403
Maybe this can help them
to find out what happened to us.

1395
01:05:21,404 --> 01:05:22,737
Yeah, well,
we're not dead yet.

1396
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,180
[quietly]: I'm starting to have
slightly blurred vision--

1397
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:31,381
- Eli!
- What?!

1398
01:05:35,387 --> 01:05:36,854
So how are we
going to decide who?

1399
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:38,923
I assume we're not
going to get any volunteers.

1400
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,895
What's another day
going to buy us?

1401
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:45,163
Time...

1402
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:46,398
To find a way
to survive.

1403
01:05:47,433 --> 01:05:48,567
May I see the list?

1404
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:53,973
I marked the names
of anyone injured.

1405
01:05:54,975 --> 01:05:56,275
Right.

1406
01:05:56,276 --> 01:05:58,979
We have to find out
peoples' skills,

1407
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,514
Background, experience--

1408
01:06:00,515 --> 01:06:03,517
Doesn't take any special skills
to die from asphyxiation!

1409
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:05,686
Look, what I'm saying is,

1410
01:06:05,687 --> 01:06:07,121
It shouldn't be someone

1411
01:06:07,122 --> 01:06:08,556
With potentially
valuable knowledge,

1412
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:11,860
Or abilities we might need
to help us survive beyond this.

1413
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:12,961
Are you really
suggesting what I think--

1414
01:06:12,962 --> 01:06:14,530
Doc, half the people
on this ship

1415
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,232
Already want to kill you.

1416
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:18,034
I don't care.

1417
01:06:18,035 --> 01:06:19,869
You can't ask someone
to sacrifice themselves,

1418
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,204
Period!

1419
01:06:21,205 --> 01:06:24,508
Politicians ask
military personnel

1420
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:26,410
To sacrifice themselves
for the good of others

1421
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,012
All the time.

1422
01:06:28,013 --> 01:06:30,482
If someone doesn't go in
there and close that door,

1423
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:32,785
We're all going to die.

1424
01:06:32,786 --> 01:06:35,521
Period.

1425
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:47,234
Franklin
is still working

1426
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:49,570
At the airlock controls locally,

1427
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,773
But it doesn't look good, sir.

1428
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,807
Camile's explaining
the situation

1429
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:53,808
To everyone else on board.

1430
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,178
I'll do it.

1431
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,479
Sir?

1432
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,814
This isn't the kind of thing

1433
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:01,250
I can ask somebody else
to volunteer for.

1434
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:02,551
If we're going to
make it past this,

1435
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,386
We're going to
need you, sir.

1436
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,654
I don't know about that.

1437
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,189
You're doing a pretty good job
without me, lieutenant.

1438
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,058
Yeah?
Well, look at the mess we're in.

1439
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,093
If that's not proof
that we need you, then--

1440
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:11,762
Look, I'm not sure
anyone should do it.

1441
01:07:11,763 --> 01:07:14,331
I don't want someone
sacrificing themselves for me.

1442
01:07:14,332 --> 01:07:15,599
I say we figure this out
together

1443
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
While we still
have time,

1444
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:18,269
Or we all die trying.

1445
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:19,537
I want you to both
listen to me.

1446
01:07:19,538 --> 01:07:22,040
It needs to be done,
and I'm doing it.

1447
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:25,277
Look, sir,
you can barely stand.

1448
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:26,545
Help me.

1449
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:27,746
Look, the paralysis
is temporary,

1450
01:07:27,747 --> 01:07:29,014
You know that now.
You will recover--

1451
01:07:29,015 --> 01:07:29,848
Lieutenant,
I need your help.

1452
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:30,850
No, sir.

1453
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,351
I gave you an order.

1454
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:33,653
I know.

1455
01:07:33,654 --> 01:07:34,821
You can have me court-martialled
when we get home,

1456
01:07:34,822 --> 01:07:37,223
But I am not going to
help you kill yourself.

1457
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:42,930
My father's not in his room.

1458
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:44,598
We'll find him.

1459
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:46,267
He does not leave this room.

1460
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:48,770
He can't have gotten far.

1461
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:50,538
I told him
what was going on.

1462
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:52,207
Greer, this is Scott,
come in.

1463
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:54,943
Greer...

1464
01:07:54,944 --> 01:07:56,412
Greer, do you read?

1465
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:57,646
Senator Armstrong is missing.

1466
01:07:57,647 --> 01:07:59,749
<i>He may be headed your way.</i>

1467
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,850
He's here.

1468
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,289
He's got a gun.

1469
01:08:06,892 --> 01:08:09,427
I don't want to shoot you.

1470
01:08:09,428 --> 01:08:11,963
I don't think
you want to shoot me.

1471
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:14,232
Get out of the way.

1472
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:15,968
Just give me
a little more time.

1473
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:17,803
Let me try
and fix this.

1474
01:08:17,804 --> 01:08:20,139
I don't have much.

1475
01:08:34,324 --> 01:08:35,624
<i>[eli]: Guys, I'm not seeing
  any change,</i>

1476
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:36,892
<i>Whatever you just tried,</i>

1477
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:38,561
It's not working!

1478
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:40,530
The problem's obviously
mechanical.

1479
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:46,070
You can't fix it.

1480
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,344
Tell me what to do.

1481
01:09:01,154 --> 01:09:02,689
Dad, no, wait!

1482
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:15,235
Dad, no!

1483
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:16,435
No!

1484
01:09:16,436 --> 01:09:18,471
No! No...

1485
01:09:18,472 --> 01:09:21,407
[heavily muffled pleading]

1486
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:22,575
Open the door!

1487
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:24,810
Open the door, please!

1488
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,078
I can't!

1489
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,548
[crying]: Please
open the door...

1490
01:09:29,549 --> 01:09:31,316
He was dead
on his feet.

1491
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:32,751
Dad, no!

1492
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:37,422
[crying]: Please
open the door...

1493
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,392
[sobbing]: No...

1494
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:41,760
Eli!

1495
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,595
<i>Not him!</i>

1496
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,497
There's nothing
I can do for him here.

1497
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:47,266
<i>Help him!</i>

1498
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:48,834
<i>Open the door, please!</i>

1499
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:03,416
[sobbing uncontrollably]

1500
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:04,884
No!

1501
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:07,520
[crying]: No...

1502
01:10:09,756 --> 01:10:11,424
No...

1503
01:10:11,425 --> 01:10:13,459
[sobbing]

1504
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:23,270
He can't leave me...

1505
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,637
Chloe...

1506
01:10:40,274 --> 01:10:41,807
Chloe!

1507
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:44,343
Well, at least
he bought us a day.

1508
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:52,552
[shouting in rage]

1509
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:58,324
You!
You did this!

1510
01:10:58,325 --> 01:10:59,826
You killed him!

1511
01:10:59,827 --> 01:11:01,527
You've killed all of us!

1512
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:03,396
Chloe, stop!
Little help here...

1513
01:11:03,397 --> 01:11:04,564
Hey, hey, relax.

1514
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,599
Hey, hey, Chloe...

1515
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,733
Just get away from me!

1516
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:09,969
All of you!

1517
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:14,006
M-miss Armstrong...

1518
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,942
You're in shock.

1519
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:18,644
Believe me, I understand.

1520
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:20,346
Everyone
deals with tragedy

1521
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:22,014
In different ways.

1522
01:11:22,015 --> 01:11:24,083
You're looking for
someone to blame.

1523
01:11:24,084 --> 01:11:25,017
I'm not looking.

1524
01:11:25,018 --> 01:11:26,552
Hey...

1525
01:11:26,553 --> 01:11:29,355
I'm sorry about your father.

1526
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:32,758
I truly am.

1527
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:35,494
He was a good man,

1528
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:38,030
And he certainly
wouldn't have been my choice,

1529
01:11:38,031 --> 01:11:40,567
But you must realize,

1530
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:44,037
None of this was my fault.

1531
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:47,073
I didn't create the situation
that forced us here.

1532
01:11:48,743 --> 01:11:51,511
There was
no other way.

1533
01:12:00,321 --> 01:12:03,323
[crying]

1534
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:12,799
Miss Armstrong...

1535
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,670
I know you don't
want to hear this just now,

1536
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:18,538
But...

1537
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:19,873
But this ship...

1538
01:12:21,376 --> 01:12:25,346
This ship could be
the most important discovery

1539
01:12:25,347 --> 01:12:26,847
Mankind has made

1540
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,182
Since the stargate
itself.

1541
01:12:28,183 --> 01:12:31,386
You know the icarus project

1542
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:34,455
Was something
your father truly believed in,

1543
01:12:34,456 --> 01:12:36,724
Enough to risk
his career

1544
01:12:36,725 --> 01:12:39,126
To support.

1545
01:12:39,127 --> 01:12:41,328
What difference does it make
if we all die?

1546
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:47,801
A number of people died
during the attack on the base.

1547
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:50,037
Some of them I knew very well.

1548
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,208
I'm sure some had
more value than others.

1549
01:12:55,677 --> 01:12:56,977
As human beings,

1550
01:12:56,978 --> 01:13:01,148
All of them were invaluable.

1551
01:13:03,985 --> 01:13:06,554
Look, my point is,

1552
01:13:06,555 --> 01:13:09,190
I promise you,

1553
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:11,092
I will do
everything I can

1554
01:13:11,093 --> 01:13:14,896
To make sure no one
gave their life in vain.

1555
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:17,165
No one.

1556
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,941
Please give me a chance.

1557
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:53,835
Colonel...

1558
01:13:55,872 --> 01:13:59,175
We've lost
senator Armstrong.

1559
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:00,443
Oh, my god.

1560
01:14:00,444 --> 01:14:01,711
He's bought us
some time.

1561
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:03,346
To do what?

1562
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:04,848
We're working on it.

1563
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:07,317
First up is trying to
dial the gate back home.

1564
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,419
Should you even be
on your feet?

1565
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,420
No.

1566
01:14:10,421 --> 01:14:11,855
Well, I am on my feet,
and right now

1567
01:14:11,856 --> 01:14:12,856
We're trying
to get home.

1568
01:14:12,857 --> 01:14:13,957
Camile,
I need your help.

1569
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,792
You know these people.

1570
01:14:15,793 --> 01:14:18,261
I need you
to spread the word.

1571
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:20,463
Try to keep things
as positive as you can.

1572
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:21,798
I can do that.

1573
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:23,833
Good.

1574
01:14:41,884 --> 01:14:44,486
I can't believe
my dad is gone.

1575
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:49,925
I watched him die,

1576
01:14:49,926 --> 01:14:52,060
And I still
just can't accept it.

1577
01:14:58,034 --> 01:14:59,501
Tell me about him.

1578
01:15:01,237 --> 01:15:02,404
Why?

1579
01:15:02,405 --> 01:15:05,406
Man died so I could live.

1580
01:15:05,407 --> 01:15:09,243
I'd like to know
a little more about him.

1581
01:15:11,713 --> 01:15:15,750
No matter
how tired he was,

1582
01:15:15,751 --> 01:15:18,986
Or how long he'd worked,

1583
01:15:18,987 --> 01:15:23,191
Or what was going on
in his life,

1584
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:28,329
He always had time
to listen to me.

1585
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,464
I'd go on and on.

1586
01:15:30,465 --> 01:15:33,935
He never preached.

1587
01:15:33,936 --> 01:15:37,338
He never told me what to do,

1588
01:15:37,339 --> 01:15:40,508
Even though sometimes
I wished he would.

1589
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:46,981
He would just listen,

1590
01:15:46,982 --> 01:15:49,884
And then he would tell me
that he loved me.

1591
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,188
The best part

1592
01:15:54,189 --> 01:15:56,557
Was if I'd had
a fight with my mom.

1593
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:57,925
He never took sides.

1594
01:15:57,926 --> 01:15:59,861
[chuckles softly]

1595
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:02,797
Oh, god.

1596
01:16:02,798 --> 01:16:04,132
My mom...

1597
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:11,406
He was her whole life.

1598
01:16:11,407 --> 01:16:13,908
She probably thinks
we're both dead.

1599
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:15,009
All I know

1600
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:18,012
Is that he wanted you to go on.

1601
01:16:20,148 --> 01:16:23,016
I know.

1602
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,356
I got to get back
to the search.

1603
01:16:29,357 --> 01:16:30,523
You going to be okay?

1604
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:33,560
I don't know.

1605
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:38,865
Fair enough.

1606
01:16:58,419 --> 01:17:00,220
What?

1607
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:03,823
What are you
doing?

1608
01:17:03,824 --> 01:17:09,328
I... Just
watched a man die.

1609
01:17:09,329 --> 01:17:11,163
Okay?

1610
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:20,372
Don't you even care?

1611
01:17:23,243 --> 01:17:26,211
Of course I do,

1612
01:17:26,212 --> 01:17:28,681
And I'm also trying learn
as much as I can,

1613
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:29,949
As quickly as I can.

1614
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,117
That is,

1615
01:17:31,118 --> 01:17:32,151
In addition to running

1616
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:34,821
Nine separate searches
in the database

1617
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:38,024
In the hope of solving
our life-support issues.

1618
01:17:45,064 --> 01:17:49,468
Right.

1619
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:51,236
Found anything?

1620
01:17:53,573 --> 01:17:54,940
Destiny.

1621
01:17:57,443 --> 01:17:59,811
As in ours?

1622
01:17:59,812 --> 01:18:02,747
The name of the ship.

1623
01:18:02,748 --> 01:18:06,651
Translated from ancient.

1624
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:09,387
I've also learned
that they were never here.

1625
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:12,524
I thought
this was an ancient ship.

1626
01:18:12,525 --> 01:18:13,726
It is,

1627
01:18:13,727 --> 01:18:16,662
But they sent it out unmanned,

1628
01:18:16,663 --> 01:18:19,565
Planning to use
the gate to get here

1629
01:18:19,566 --> 01:18:23,069
When it was far enough out
into the universe,

1630
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,204
But they probably
learned to ascend

1631
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:27,407
Before that time.

1632
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:29,843
Learned to what?

1633
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:31,678
Ascension.

1634
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,146
It's a process

1635
01:18:33,147 --> 01:18:36,517
Whereby consciousness
converts to energy

1636
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:39,219
That no longer requires
physical form.

1637
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:42,055
That wasn't
in the video.

1638
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:44,691
Well, there's
more than one video.

1639
01:18:46,694 --> 01:18:49,496
We should get back to work.

1640
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:56,002
Sorry.

1641
01:19:06,647 --> 01:19:08,681
Sir, I think I got it.

1642
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:10,783
It wasn't even
that hard to find.

1643
01:19:10,784 --> 01:19:12,618
It's right here
in the dialing program.

1644
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:14,319
You're sure?

1645
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,221
Yes, it's
an eight-symbol address.

1646
01:19:16,222 --> 01:19:18,390
You mean you can
dial this thing back to earth?

1647
01:19:18,391 --> 01:19:19,858
There's no point
of origin indicated,

1648
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:21,827
But still, there's only
36 symbols on this gate.

1649
01:19:21,828 --> 01:19:23,028
I'm assuming
the ninth symbol represents

1650
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:25,163
Some x-factor
distance equation.

1651
01:19:25,164 --> 01:19:27,232
Well, I don't care.
Start dialing.

1652
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:29,134
Sir, don't we want to bring
Dr. Rush in on this?

1653
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:31,403
Well, you said this wasn't
that hard to find?

1654
01:19:31,404 --> 01:19:32,404
No.

1655
01:19:32,405 --> 01:19:33,672
Well, then he probably
already knows

1656
01:19:33,673 --> 01:19:35,874
And didn't tell us.

1657
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,809
[alert starts to beep]

1658
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,977
Oh, no, no, no, no...

1659
01:19:38,978 --> 01:19:40,445
What?

1660
01:19:40,446 --> 01:19:42,514
Someone's dialing the gate.

1661
01:19:56,062 --> 01:19:57,095
Colonel young...

1662
01:19:57,096 --> 01:19:58,964
You're up.

1663
01:19:58,965 --> 01:20:00,833
Nice to see you, too, rush.

1664
01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:02,267
I did order you to report to me.

1665
01:20:02,268 --> 01:20:04,469
What are you
doing?

1666
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:05,704
We're trying to dial earth.

1667
01:20:05,705 --> 01:20:07,640
That would be
a mistake.

1668
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:08,941
Riley thinks he's found
the address for home.

1669
01:20:08,942 --> 01:20:10,109
His understanding
of ancient

1670
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,177
Is marginal at best.

1671
01:20:11,178 --> 01:20:12,545
With respect,
doctor,

1672
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,847
I know enough to recognize
a reference to earth.

1673
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,981
He says the address

1674
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:17,717
Wasn't that hard
to find, rush.

1675
01:20:17,718 --> 01:20:19,151
No, no, this is a complete
waste of power we may need.

1676
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:21,420
We have
the address back,

1677
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:22,722
All we need is
the right point of origin.

1678
01:20:22,723 --> 01:20:24,557
And we've got 36 tries.

1679
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:26,792
We barely have enough power
to operate the Main systems.

1680
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:28,294
This ship

1681
01:20:28,295 --> 01:20:30,964
Simply doesn't have
the capability to dial earth.

1682
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:32,732
You see, that's news to me.

1683
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:33,766
He didn't
tell me that either.

1684
01:20:33,767 --> 01:20:34,967
Well, I've only
just learned myself,

1685
01:20:34,968 --> 01:20:35,768
And you know
what I've been doing.

1686
01:20:35,769 --> 01:20:37,370
Even if
it doesn't work,

1687
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:40,173
The people aboard this ship
need to see us at least try.

1688
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:42,542
So, what, you're going to drain
what little power we have

1689
01:20:42,543 --> 01:20:43,776
For the sake of morale?

1690
01:20:43,777 --> 01:20:45,011
How ridiculous.

1691
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:47,280
[ships groans and clanks]

1692
01:20:50,717 --> 01:20:52,284
What was that?

1693
01:20:55,622 --> 01:20:57,423
Anyone near
the observation deck?

1694
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:06,465
Colonel...

1695
01:21:06,466 --> 01:21:08,401
It looks like
we've dropped out of ftl.

1696
01:21:08,402 --> 01:21:10,737
Because we were
draining power?

1697
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:11,738
No, no.

1698
01:21:12,907 --> 01:21:14,875
If I'm right,

1699
01:21:14,876 --> 01:21:16,843
The gate should begin to dial
any moment.

1700
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:26,920
How did you know that?

1701
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:29,088
The ship detected
a stargate

1702
01:21:29,089 --> 01:21:31,257
On a planet within range
that may have what need.

1703
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:33,626
What?

1704
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:34,627
How the hell

1705
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:37,063
Are there even
stargates out here?

1706
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:40,032
The ancients sent out
a number of unmanned ships

1707
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:41,300
Ahead of this one.

1708
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:43,269
They're programmed
to gather data,

1709
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,437
Resources,

1710
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:46,973
To manufacture
stargates,

1711
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:48,407
And deposit them
in habitable worlds.

1712
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:50,676
Any relevant information
is relayed back here

1713
01:21:50,677 --> 01:21:51,844
To help
plot the course.

1714
01:21:51,845 --> 01:21:53,813
You're telling me

1715
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:55,348
That this ship knows
we're in trouble?

1716
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:57,183
Yes, because I told it we were.

1717
01:21:57,184 --> 01:21:58,551
Essentially,

1718
01:21:58,552 --> 01:22:01,353
We're flying on auto-pilot.

1719
01:22:01,354 --> 01:22:02,688
This ship may have stopped

1720
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:03,622
When it was within range
of a stargate

1721
01:22:03,623 --> 01:22:04,790
Regardless of our need,

1722
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,692
But I have reason to believe...

1723
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:14,032
So, what we need

1724
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:15,600
Is on the other side
of that wormhole.

1725
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:20,304
An educated
guess, yes.

1726
01:22:20,305 --> 01:22:22,239
There's only one way
to find out.

1727
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,641
Sir, you can't
do that.

1728
01:22:23,642 --> 01:22:24,842
We have no idea what's
on the other side.

1729
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:28,012
We can use the kino
to find out.

1730
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:29,781
I expect that's the purpose
of this device.

1731
01:22:37,723 --> 01:22:38,957
I'm getting
readings over here.

1732
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:40,425
What have we got?

1733
01:22:40,426 --> 01:22:41,660
Temperature,
gravity,

1734
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:42,794
Atmosphere composition,

1735
01:22:42,795 --> 01:22:46,164
Barometric pressure...

1736
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:47,265
Oxygen nitrogen,
very little co2,

1737
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:48,300
Extremely low humidity.

1738
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:49,635
Habitable, but just barely.

1739
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,336
Good enough.

1740
01:22:51,337 --> 01:22:52,538
Looks like
four other addresses

1741
01:22:52,539 --> 01:22:55,541
Came up here, too.

1742
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:57,643
They could be
other planets within range.

1743
01:22:57,644 --> 01:22:59,245
Maybe we should
think about

1744
01:22:59,246 --> 01:23:00,379
Dialing them up
and seeing--

1745
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,048
No, no, they're locked out.

1746
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:03,850
The ship chose this one.

1747
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:05,218
The stargate is open,

1748
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:06,386
All we have to do
is step through.

1749
01:23:06,387 --> 01:23:09,088
What we have to do
is put a team together.

1750
01:23:09,089 --> 01:23:10,590
Dr. Rush...

1751
01:23:11,759 --> 01:23:14,161
Looks like our time
might be limited.

1752
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:15,595
What is it?

1753
01:23:15,596 --> 01:23:16,596
It's a countdown.

1754
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:17,831
Just over 12 hours left.

1755
01:23:17,832 --> 01:23:19,132
What happens then?

1756
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,333
I suspect

1757
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:22,603
We jump back into ftl.

1758
01:23:29,577 --> 01:23:30,577
[shutter snaps]

1759
01:23:30,578 --> 01:23:32,079
Palmer is a geologist.

1760
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,214
Obviously, she should go.

1761
01:23:34,215 --> 01:23:36,417
Franklin and Brody are the best
of the rest of what we have.

1762
01:23:36,418 --> 01:23:38,352
Thanks for the
ringing endorsement.

1763
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:39,987
He didn't even
mention me.

1764
01:23:39,988 --> 01:23:41,588
Franklin goes,
the others stay.

1765
01:23:41,589 --> 01:23:43,190
We're still going to need
good people

1766
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:44,625
Working on the problem
from this end.

1767
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:46,627
I'd like to go.

1768
01:23:48,162 --> 01:23:49,296
Really?

1769
01:23:49,297 --> 01:23:51,731
If I can help, then--

1770
01:23:51,732 --> 01:23:52,732
Colonel young, please--

1771
01:23:52,733 --> 01:23:53,834
What?

1772
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:55,769
You don't think
I can handle it?

1773
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:57,704
He's going.

1774
01:23:57,705 --> 01:23:59,106
I've been off-world before.

1775
01:23:59,107 --> 01:24:01,208
You have made a habit

1776
01:24:01,209 --> 01:24:03,644
Out of pulling our asses
out of the fire.

1777
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:05,379
Eli, you want to go,
you're going.

1778
01:24:06,715 --> 01:24:08,449
The only one
I'm questioning right now

1779
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:10,651
Is you, Dr. Rush.

1780
01:24:10,652 --> 01:24:11,519
[scoffs]

1781
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,921
Well, besides Palmer,

1782
01:24:13,922 --> 01:24:15,823
I'm the only one who knows
what we're looking for.

1783
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:17,424
We have 12 hours
to find what we need

1784
01:24:17,425 --> 01:24:18,692
And then get back on the ship.

1785
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:19,960
You're sure you can't stop it?

1786
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:21,895
No, we're just along
for the ride for now.

1787
01:24:21,896 --> 01:24:23,363
Then we may all be better off
on the planet.

1788
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:26,333
Well, that's another reason
why I should go.

1789
01:24:26,334 --> 01:24:27,901
Someone to assess

1790
01:24:27,902 --> 01:24:30,070
Whether long-term survival there
is even an option.

1791
01:24:30,071 --> 01:24:32,339
All right.

1792
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:33,406
Okay.

1793
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:35,208
I want everyone clear

1794
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:38,678
That Scott is in charge
of this mission.

1795
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:40,313
Let's gear up,

1796
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:41,481
Let's find
whatever supplies we have,

1797
01:24:41,482 --> 01:24:44,818
And move out.

1798
01:24:49,424 --> 01:24:51,558
Sir...

1799
01:24:51,559 --> 01:24:52,893
About eli--

1800
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:54,127
He volunteered.

1801
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:55,529
He's not trained
for this.

1802
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,231
Just like a lot of the people
we got on this ship.

1803
01:24:57,232 --> 01:24:58,633
I'm going to need to know
what they're made of.

1804
01:24:58,634 --> 01:25:00,535
He'll slow us down.

1805
01:25:00,536 --> 01:25:01,803
Well, if he does,

1806
01:25:01,804 --> 01:25:03,404
You send him
back to the gate.

1807
01:25:03,405 --> 01:25:04,839
If we're going to make it,

1808
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,207
And I'm not just talking
the next few hours,

1809
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:07,908
We're going to need
everyone on board to step up.

1810
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:11,679
Lieutenant...

1811
01:25:13,115 --> 01:25:14,949
Keep an eye on rush.

1812
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:37,906
We'll be back, sir.

1813
01:25:37,907 --> 01:25:39,674
Good luck.
