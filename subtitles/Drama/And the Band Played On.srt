1
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,313
Sirs? May I greets from your hello?

2
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:30,551
Hello.

3
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,719
- Where's the doctor in charge?
- Doctor?

4
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,869
Dr. Aziz.

5
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,336
Doctor. Where is he?

6
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:40,563
Doctor! Yes! To be certain, I take you.

7
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,900
Doctor.

8
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,591
It's okay.

9
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:12,666
Why this happen?

10
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,389
You doctor! How you don't know?

11
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,300
What did she die of?

12
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,215
Pneumocystis Pneumonia.

13
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:51,963
That's only seen when
the immune system fails.

14
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,948
What was the major disease?

15
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,992
That's all she had.

16
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:57,974
That's not possible.

17
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,499
When he got here, he only had
pneumocystis, no major illness.

18
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,231
Now he's developed...

19
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,420
...fungus in the mouth...
warts on his arms...

20
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:29,208
...and more on his legs.

21
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:35,640
...and his brain is rotting with
Toxoplasmosis, a cat disease.

22
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:43,703
Two months before
its nominating convention...

23
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:47,188
...the Democratic Party began
preliminary work on its 1980 platform.

24
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,400
Fellow members
of the platform committee...

25
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,429
...I am Bill Kraus, liaison between
Congressman Phillip Burton...

26
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,535
...and the gay community of San Francisco.

27
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:59,196
The gay rights plank
I'm asking to be included...

28
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,910
...does not ask for special privileges.

29
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,731
It does not ask anyone to like us.

30
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:07,415
It doesn't even ask
that the Democratic Party give us...

31
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:12,220
...many of the legal protections which are
considered the right of all other Americans.

32
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:14,548
What this amendment asks...

33
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,674
...is that the Democratic Party recognize
that we, the gay people of this country...

34
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,390
...are also human.

35
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:39,890
Thank you.

36
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:42,552
Thank you very much.

37
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:45,565
- How you feeling?
- Tired.

38
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,866
I'll be back.

39
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,451
- Doctor?
- No, not now.

40
00:08:58,525 --> 00:08:59,867
Here we are.

41
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:08,092
What is his T... cell count?

42
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:11,026
I gotta tell you, Dr. Gottlieb, this is weird.

43
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,370
- What?
- He doesn't have any.

44
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:17,491
- How can he not have any T cells?
- His immune system's gone.

45
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,358
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dr. Guinan.

46
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,869
Jim? Can I talk to you for a minute?

47
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:45,210
I got this in the mail from Dr. Shendera
in LA, who got it from a Dr. Gottlieb.

48
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:48,059
I think you oughta look at it right away.

49
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,408
It looks like there's a weird epidemic
breaking out among gay men in LA.

50
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:02,550
There've been five cases of pneumocystis...

51
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,436
...with no contributing disease
within the past few months...

52
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,028
...and already two fatalities.

53
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,050
Hot stuff.

54
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,802
Plus, I've called New York
and San Francisco...

55
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,666
...and they've had similar cases.

56
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:17,529
I think this oughta go into
the weekly newsletter as soon as possible.

57
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,426
- Why did you do that?
- I don't decide what is published.

58
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,340
I can only recommend,
but we've got a new administration.

59
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,860
You wanna see this published
so people can read it...

60
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,104
...or do you wanna see it killed?

61
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,187
Thanks.

62
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:57,075
- Don? Is that you?
- Hey, Mary!

63
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,110
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. Nice to see you.

64
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,898
- How long has it been?
- Smallpox in India.

65
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,306
Come on, join us.

66
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:13,557
How long do you plan on doing that?

67
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:15,830
Till I get my peanut butter cookies.

68
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,843
Guys, I'd like you to meet Don Francis.

69
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,306
We're just doing a little demonstration...

70
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,090
...of the benefits
of a sound knowledge of applied science.

71
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:39,004
Hi. Harold Jaffe,
Sexually Transmitted Diseases.

72
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:42,295
Hi. Bill Darrow, Sociology.

73
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:45,430
You didn't shake Harold's hand, did you?

74
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,627
Hi! Thanks for coming.
Did you meet everybody?

75
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,905
- How's Phoenix?
- Warm.

76
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:54,421
Don't we have a meeting at 3:00?
What's everybody doing here?

77
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:57,144
Tryin' to have lunch in four minutes,
like you.

78
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,598
If one of those is peanut butter cookies,
that is mine.

79
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:01,975
Let's go.

80
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:06,106
Dale Lawrence, Division of Host Factors.

81
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,942
What we've got in LA,
San Francisco and New York...

82
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:14,520
...is a number of gay men who've been hit
with a variety of opportunistic infections...

83
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,149
...and that's all we know.

84
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,938
I asked Don to join us
because for the last three years...

85
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,372
...he's been tracking
hepatitis B virus in gay men.

86
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:25,081
And before that worked on
the Ebola fever epidemic in Africa.

87
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,771
Thanks for joining us.

88
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,918
We've gotta hit the phones
and spread out...

89
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:32,567
...contact the health departments
in all major metropolitan areas as usual...

90
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:35,354
...so they can do a hospital... to... hospital
search for cases.

91
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,046
Basic epidemiology.

92
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:41,557
We've got to talk to the patients,
their doctors and friends, relatives.

93
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:45,906
- No question too stupid or too personal.
- Sexual relationships, too?

94
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:49,084
- Lifestyle stuff.
- Household chemical, cleaning...

95
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,097
Diet.

96
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:52,311
- Could be a bad batch of street drugs.
- Pets.

97
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,868
Maybe they all get
the same kind of Kitty Litter.

98
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,138
I'm going to New York today
to take a look at this disease.

99
00:12:58,205 --> 00:12:59,993
- Can you come with me?
- Sure.

100
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,527
If I knew these blotches
would turn purple...

101
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:08,052
...I'd have bought some bags to match.

102
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:12,530
Here, look at my book.
When I was still human.

103
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:18,203
I was the best in the business.
Ask anybody.

104
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:23,036
Leave it to me to get some disease
nobody ever heard of.

105
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,955
Kaposi's sarcoma.

106
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,451
Even my doctor had to look it up.

107
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,432
"Nothing to worry about," he said.

108
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:33,042
"Usually happens
to Italian men in their sixties...

109
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:37,689
"...who continue to live a normal life
until they die of something else."

110
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,178
Do I look like an Italian man in my sixties?

111
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,839
Now I do:

112
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,298
160.

113
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:54,682
Why do they make things like this
that nobody can ever solve?

114
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,540
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

115
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,228
- Hello?
- Would you like me to come back?

116
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:04,891
Can I help you?

117
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,468
I'm from the CDC,
the Centers for Disease Control.

118
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:13,175
Are you one of the interviews
that Dr. Freedman... Kien set up for me?

119
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,732
I'm sorry,
I'm just having a little spot looked at.

120
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:19,415
Gaetan Dugas, Dr. Mary Guinan.

121
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:22,778
If you have a few minutes,
it'd be helpful if you talk to Dr. Guinan.

122
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:27,634
I'm sorry, but I'm barely going to
make my plane as it is, if I'm lucky.

123
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:30,204
I'm a flight attendant.

124
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,171
Could you answer a few questions
while you're getting dressed?

125
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,092
What kind of questions?

126
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:38,038
I assume from what your doctor told me
that you're gay.

127
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:39,698
Also homosexual.

128
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:43,927
And how long have you been having
sex with men?

129
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:50,774
About 10 years, I guess, openly.

130
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:56,732
Could you roughly approximate how many
sexual encounters you have in one year?

131
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:58,258
In a year?

132
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:02,322
- You're serious?
- Yes.

133
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,666
- I don't know.
- Roughly.

134
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:06,139
About...

135
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:10,588
...250.

136
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:12,407
250.

137
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:16,438
Actually, now that I think a bit,
that is a very conservative estimate.

138
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:21,785
- And of these partners, how many...
- I'm sorry.

139
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:25,944
I would love to chat forever
about my sex life. And we could.

140
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:29,619
If I don't leave this minute,
I'm going to miss my plane.

141
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,795
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

142
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,844
- Doctor, I'll call you next month.
- Fine.

143
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,931
All right.

144
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,907
- I look okay?
- Great!

145
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,947
- Of course I do. Thank you.
- Thank you.

146
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,712
- Doctor! Bye... bye!
- Bye!

147
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,114
- Do you have many gay friends?
- Not too many.

148
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:51,735
Two doctors I stay in touch with
from school.

149
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:55,001
- Are they a couple?
- Yeah, actually, 15 years at least.

150
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,825
Kico and I, Kico's my lover...

151
00:15:56,893 --> 00:16:00,505
...we've got a wide circle of friends
and most of them are in relationships.

152
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:01,980
Or want to be in a relationship.

153
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,428
- So what are you saying?
- Lots of men go to these bathhouses.

154
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,297
But there are thousands of gay men in this
city, maybe a couple hundred thousand.

155
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:14,163
They're just cops and waiters and teachers
and lawyers and ditch diggers and athletes.

156
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,818
Talk a little louder,
they can't hear you down the block.

157
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:19,707
I'm sorry, I don't mean to lecture.

158
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,456
I just don't want you to come away
from the bathhouses...

159
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,499
...thinking that's how all gay men live.

160
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,808
Last night we lost another one.

161
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:31,700
In less than three weeks, this handsome
young guy turns into the Elephant Man.

162
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:35,995
Which we found out was caused
by some rare parasite that only sheep get!

163
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:41,019
So I called a vet,
to ask what they do when sheep get it.

164
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,388
They shoot them.

165
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,111
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

166
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:47,254
Bye.

167
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,912
Hi. Selma Dritz,
Department of Public Health.

168
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:56,948
- We're here to inspect the premises.
- I'll try to find the boss.

169
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:58,166
Thanks.

170
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:08,794
Those two guys there, strangers?

171
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,930
Maybe. Probably.

172
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,447
They just met,
and now they're gonna go in the...

173
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:16,793
Right.

174
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,829
It's interesting.

175
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:22,966
Listen to me.

176
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:25,655
Imagine yourself in a place like this...

177
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,305
...only it's filled with women,
really beautiful women.

178
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,563
Imagine one of those Penthouse women
wants to go in that room with you.

179
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:35,603
There's nothing between you but a towel.

180
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:38,546
You're telling me you wouldn't go
in that little room...

181
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,817
...and seriously consider dropping
that little towel?

182
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,181
- Possibly, yeah.
- Yeah.

183
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,810
I know men who would give up food for it.

184
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,919
- Hi, Eddie.
- Darling, how are you?

185
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:49,937
Good.

186
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:54,556
Eddie Papasano, Dr. Harold Jaffe
from the Centers for Disease Control.

187
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,628
Hi. What's the problem?

188
00:17:57,341 --> 00:18:00,156
There may be an epidemic
spreading in the gay community.

189
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:03,385
And I'd like to just come in
and have a look around.

190
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,667
That's impossible. We must protect
the confidentiality of our clients.

191
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:11,669
I know, but you know I speak on behalf
of the Gay Liberation Committee...

192
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,427
...the City Council, the State Assembly.

193
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,729
I can tell you
without fear of contradiction...

194
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:19,131
...you are regarded
second only to Abe Lincoln...

195
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:22,993
...as a citizen who would fight to the death
to preserve civil liberties.

196
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,865
So let's cut the crap.
It's 10:00 in the morning, for God's sake!

197
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,021
Let us in.

198
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,642
- Only for you.
- Thank you.

199
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,016
You're a real mensch.

200
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,761
- How many men come here a night?
- Hundreds, every night of the week.

201
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:39,349
Some bathhouses, more than a thousand.

202
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,537
- What's this?
- Poppers: They're a quick, cheap high.

203
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,454
What are you doing here?

204
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,410
What are you doing here?

205
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,119
God, my wife is gonna kill me.

206
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,871
Did you get the results
on the amyl nitrite study?

207
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:11,345
Yeah, you can forget about poppers.
We ran every test there is.

208
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:14,421
The worst that happened was
two mice danced with a rubber glove.

209
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,609
Go home.

210
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:23,538
So far, not one TV station
has even mentioned it.

211
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:25,685
Not one word
in the straight press, nothing!

212
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:28,851
The number of patients
I'm treating for it is growing so fast...

213
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:31,226
...I don't even wanna think about it.

214
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:34,074
What's happening in Washington?
Do they even know it exists?

215
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,148
If they do, they don't discuss it.

216
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,642
- When do you go back to D.C.?
- Tomorrow.

217
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:42,294
That's the first thing we deal with.
You have to make people aware of it.

218
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:45,812
How? The media all say the same thing,
there's no story.

219
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,299
One journalist told me the only people
interested in gay men dying...

220
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:52,667
...are gay men and the ones
who wish they'd all die.

221
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,635
- I'm late for a meeting.
- Good luck.

222
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:02,836
If we don't get money for research,
and soon, a lot of it, God help everyone.

223
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:04,217
Okay.

224
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:14,418
- What is it?
- Nothing.

225
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,946
Can't you tell me?

226
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,609
Look, you have things to do...

227
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:28,084
...and they're very important things
and I can't tell you not to do them.

228
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,938
I guess I'd hate you if you didn't do them.

229
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:34,681
But I just want...
I just wish that we could... I want us...

230
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,490
All I want is a place where we...

231
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,012
This isn't...

232
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,546
I don't know what I want.

233
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:52,756
What do we think, what do we know,
what can we prove?

234
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:53,722
Zip.

235
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,697
- Only gays?
- Think, but can't prove.

236
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,875
- Only males?
- Think, but can't prove.

237
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,126
The semen depositors.

238
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:03,386
If it's in the semen, unless there's
something unusual about this disease...

239
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:07,446
...it shouldn't make a difference whether
it's deposited in the anus or vagina...

240
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,135
...which could mean that women
will be getting it also.

241
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,147
You should focus on that point.

242
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:15,003
We know the immune system
stops functioning completely.

243
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,785
- In all cases?
- Know, but can't prove.

244
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,121
What we have here...

245
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:23,450
...Looks more like a sexually transmitted
disease than syphilis does.

246
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,793
Think or prove?

247
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:28,754
I can't prove that the sun isn't gonna
turn into a bran muffin next Tuesday...

248
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:31,195
...but after 20 years, I know what I know.

249
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,438
That's not what I'm...

250
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:37,047
It's pure supposition, but it's more than
strong enough to justify a definitive study.

251
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:38,360
I agree with Bill.

252
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:42,585
It's a single infectious agent with
a high probability of sexual transmission.

253
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:44,561
Well then, viral or bacterial?

254
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,800
If you skip "think" and "prove,"
I'd guess viral.

255
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:49,013
A guess, definitely.

256
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:50,710
Let's assume that it's a virus.

257
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:54,556
The question is, is it one that
we already know that has become lethal...

258
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:57,588
...or is this a brand... new virus
that we've never seen before?

259
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,179
Here's a little stat to chew on.

260
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:05,147
In seven months, the number of cases
jumped from 5 to 152 in 15 states.

261
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:06,193
Seven months?

262
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:10,163
Yeah, but the spooky part is that so far
the mortality rate has been 40 percent.

263
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:11,184
40 percent?

264
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,780
And doctors taking care
of these patients say...

265
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:16,667
...the mortality rate could turn out
to be 100 percent.

266
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:18,391
100 percent.

267
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,014
My God!

268
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:34,139
Let's set up a case control study based on
the premise that it's sexually transmitted.

269
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:38,547
We want you to set up a lab here, run it
and handle the causative end of this study.

270
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:42,712
If it's a bug, find it! I've been authorized
to have a task force for three months.

271
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,976
If this disease is like any of the others,
it should be enough time.

272
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:49,874
And, of course, no money,
so we'll have to moonlight this epidemic.

273
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:52,915
Which means, I can't guarantee you
a staff or equipment...

274
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:53,936
Trust him.

275
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:56,346
...until I juggle the budget around
a little bit.

276
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,260
- You gonna show him the lab?
- You wanna see it right now?

277
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:02,358
- I think you should.
- Sure. Come on down.

278
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:04,756
- You have a flashlight?
- It's not that bad.

279
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,217
One of those miner's things
with a little light...

280
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:10,906
It's the only space we have left,
so it's gonna look a little hopeless.

281
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,274
- Only because it is.
- No comment.

282
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:16,789
Actually, it's bigger than it looks.

283
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:21,074
Tom Spira, Paul Florino. Don Francis.

284
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:23,508
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

285
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,510
What is this?

286
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,319
- An incubator from the Smithsonian?
- You know it too well.

287
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,849
Where is the CO2 attachment?

288
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:35,510
We had to put the CO2 tanks
in the next room...

289
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:39,442
...because we couldn't get approval
for a real CO2 incubator.

290
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,646
Hopeless I can live with,
but this is ridiculous.

291
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:20,281
Look, stick around here.
I might be coming right out.

292
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,224
- Dr. Mary Guinan, please.
- Your name?

293
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,561
I'm a friend of Dr. Conant's.

294
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,976
Your name.

295
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,427
You can tell him.

296
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:53,402
He has no idea who you are
and we'll pretend we never heard of you.

297
00:24:57,692 --> 00:24:59,480
- You guys ahead of me?
- You go ahead.

298
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,581
We've got nothin' to do
except go to a Halloween party.

299
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:06,034
And you're in rehearsal, I know.

300
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:09,464
It's tres gauche to fawn,
but I happen to think you're a genius.

301
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:12,913
I mean, a double genius,
as a director and a choreographer.

302
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,373
Is that you?

303
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,435
Bobbi Campbell, self... appointed
K.S. Poster boy.

304
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,929
You look surprised.

305
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:28,948
No, I'm not.

306
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:31,927
Curious, maybe.

307
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:34,263
If the gay community doesn't raise hell...

308
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,666
...do you think Reagan's gonna do
a damn thing?

309
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,614
I wish I had your courage.

310
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:42,163
Courage? No.

311
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,536
I'm scared to death.

312
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:50,233
I just have
this absurd determination to live.

313
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,788
Don't you?

314
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,168
It's open.

315
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,777
- Dr. Guinan?
- Yes.

316
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:14,837
I'll tell you, I expected the neighborhood,
the hotel, this room even...

317
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:19,610
...but I think it would take Fellini to cast
such a beautiful woman in a sweat suit...

318
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:24,181
...as the doctor I'm supposed to reveal
my most intimate sexual eccentricities to.

319
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:25,939
- Hello.
- Hi.

320
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:27,059
I'm Mary Guinan.

321
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:28,888
The reason for the sweat suit is...

322
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:33,396
...somebody stole all the clothing I brought
with me from the laundromat this morning.

323
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,814
Would you mind signing
these two consent forms?

324
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:42,268
One is for the questionnaire and one
is for the specimens I need to collect.

325
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:44,661
Which specimens?

326
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:48,089
Blood, urine, a swab from your mouth
and another from your rectum.

327
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:52,599
In this study, some have the disease,
and some, like you, have no symptoms.

328
00:26:56,956 --> 00:27:00,153
I really don't mind
if you know all this about me...

329
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:03,542
...I'm just not too sure that I want to know.

330
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,842
Is there a name yet for this disease?

331
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:14,998
The gay press calls it
gay pneumonia or gay cancer.

332
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,937
And the straight press
doesn't mention it at all.

333
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,789
I was hung up in traffic coming over here.

334
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:37,082
The Gay Halloween Parade was on.
Have you seen it?

335
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,099
I didn't know they had one.

336
00:27:40,924 --> 00:27:43,859
They do. It's really pretty amazing.

337
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,421
The party's over.

338
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,638
You scared me, sorry.

339
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,202
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

340
00:28:49,532 --> 00:28:51,125
What is that?

341
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,907
It's today's figures.

342
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,067
No. "Butcher's..."

343
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:02,360
When Admiral Nelson
was fighting Napoleon...

344
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:05,242
...and wanted to know how many
people were dead, he'd yell:

345
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:07,795
"What's the butcher's bill for today?"

346
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,206
God.

347
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:15,859
We've injected Mary's samples into mice,
rabbits, guinea pigs and we'll try monkeys.

348
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:19,674
So far, we haven't found any evidence
of parasites, fungus or viruses. Nothing.

349
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,417
You mean, the case control study
yielded zilch?

350
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:26,011
Yes, all we know is that
the disease is caused...

351
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:30,036
...by some unknown organism
or organisms, which we can't see or find.

352
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,956
We don't know if it's a single agent
or a combination.

353
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,605
We don't know how it's transmitted.
We don't know...

354
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:37,844
Don't touch that!

355
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:43,862
Don't you know there's about
a million things in there that can kill you!

356
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:52,662
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:57,307 --> 00:29:59,479
These two women for example...

358
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:05,111
Both dying from pneumocystis.
Ridiculous. Nobody dies from that.

359
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:11,227
Nineteen people died in 3 years.
Rich, poor, women, men.

360
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:14,258
French... African.

361
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:21,076
One can see this illness in
homosexuals, here and in the U.S.

362
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:25,786
Be right back.

363
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,132
Dr. Rozenbaum. Please sit down.

364
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,716
This is very embarrassing.

365
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:49,076
We're both humane men, yes?

366
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,795
But... people refer to us as...

367
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,606
"That hospital where
those people go."

368
00:30:56,219 --> 00:31:02,035
I don't advertise. Doctors send them
because I reported it first.

369
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:09,560
Some of our "normal" patients
are afraid of coming here.

370
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,469
That puts us in a very difficult
position, do you understand?

371
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:24,821
Can I assume that's the end
of the matter?

372
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:26,967
No, it's the end
of the discussion.

373
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:30,482
The end of the matter is that
I'll find another hospital.

374
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:40,629
Politically, as far as the next election's
concerned, we're not dead, but in a coma.

375
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:45,431
For 20 years I've built that coalition
so solid, nobody could touch me.

376
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,150
The only group you can count on
to vote as a block...

377
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,732
...because it's literally life and death
for them now, is the gay vote.

378
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:54,040
San Francisco is the only city
in the world...

379
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:56,180
...where that group can
swing the election.

380
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:59,066
Without them,
you're the ex... godfather of San Francisco.

381
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:01,297
What do they want?

382
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:04,820
Disability insurance for GRID,
if they get it, for one thing.

383
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,942
Gay Related Immune Deficiency.

384
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,337
And money for research, that is crucial.

385
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:16,473
Nobody knows what's causing this thing.

386
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,224
I'll introduce a bill.

387
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:22,418
But if angels came dancing down
to Earth like the Rockettes...

388
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:27,227
...even they couldn't get a dime from this
administration with the name "gay" on it.

389
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:32,441
In New York today, President Reagan
asked voters in Little Italy...

390
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,679
...to support
his economic recovery program.

391
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:37,333
I've never seen so many calories lined up...

392
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:41,330
We have to turn the direction around
that we've been going...

393
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:45,844
...in order to end inflation,
end unemployment...

394
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,849
...and get this country back where
it should be in the eyes of the world.

395
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:52,562
But at year's end, there'll be less money...

396
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:54,610
...to spend for public health next year.

397
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:58,778
I'm sure there is one department
you've been waiting for me to mention:

398
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,243
The Department of Defense.

399
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,793
It's the only department
in our entire program...

400
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:07,610
...that will actually be increased
over the present budgeted figure.

401
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:20,119
I don't suppose you heard back...

402
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:23,635
...on the requisition I put in
for an electron microscope.

403
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,194
- How can I put this to you diplomatically...
- Not approved.

404
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,536
Not approved.

405
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:34,230
How am I supposed to run this lab
without the basic, fundamental...

406
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:38,292
Every month, I write a memo asking
where's the $196,000 I need to run this lab.

407
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:41,233
- I can't even get a yes or no.
- I'm tired. I'm gonna go home.

408
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:46,129
I'm gonna go to bed
and I suggest you do the same thing.

409
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:48,952
- Not approved.
- Dr. Curran?

410
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,190
- What is it?
- Jeff called.

411
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,107
There's an outbreak
among the Haitian population in Miami.

412
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,009
- How many?
- Four known dead.

413
00:33:57,084 --> 00:34:01,240
But since most of them are hiding from
Immigration, there could be dozens more.

414
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,958
None of them were gay, just Haitians.

415
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:05,878
What do you mean "just Haitians"?

416
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,184
That's what he said to ask you.

417
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:11,124
Okay, thanks.

418
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:14,225
Just Haitians.

419
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,975
This disease doesn't make
any sense to me.

420
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:20,793
I don't get it. It's completely off the wall.

421
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:25,082
A doctor in the Bronx has just announced
that 11 newborn babies have got it.

422
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:27,028
And now Haitians.

423
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,865
It's not just a gay disease anymore.

424
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:33,780
The National Center for Disease Control...

425
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:37,234
...is reporting more cases
of two rare and deadly diseases...

426
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,130
...found in homosexual men.

427
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:42,097
There is no apparent explanation
for the outbreak.

428
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:44,788
Health officials are urgently looking
for an answer.

429
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:47,543
It appeared a year ago
in New York's gay community.

430
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:50,645
Then in the gay communities
of San Francisco and Los Angeles.

431
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:53,879
Now, its been detected
in Haitian refugees. No one knows why.

432
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:58,225
Specialists argue that millions of dollars
should be spent for research now.

433
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:00,666
Bobbi Campbell is fighting for his life.

434
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,699
One of a rapidly growing group
whose battle has fascinated...

435
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,592
...and frightened modern medicine.

436
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,482
He has Kaposi's sarcoma. ;

437
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:10,679
A skin cancer that first appeared
on the bottom of his feet...

438
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:12,690
...as spots the size of a quarter.

439
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:16,080
When I first came down with the disease,
I found this button...

440
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,702
...which absolutely reflected
my position at the time.

441
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:23,316
I may be down, but I'm not out.

442
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:28,080
...gay plague that's sweeping across
our country. Say, God is not mocked.

443
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:29,748
You can't fool God.

444
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:33,523
You break all His laws
and God Almighty will judge you.

445
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:40,787
Hey.

446
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:43,479
Hey.

447
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,529
Can I get a really big chunk of meatloaf
with gravy and a couple of pickles?

448
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,456
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

449
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:00,340
Hello.

450
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,205
What's the matter?

451
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:09,177
What do we think, what do we know,
what can we prove?

452
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,063
I'm so sick of that.

453
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:13,979
The only thing we know for sure
is that we don't know anything.

454
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:16,629
Which also happens to be
the only thing we can prove.

455
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,180
We think. Or do we know,
or do we think we know?

456
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,674
I don't know what the hell it is.

457
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:26,133
It's a jelly doughnut.

458
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:31,319
- Thanks, it's a jelly doughnut.
- Your welcome. I owe you about a quarter.

459
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:10,260
Something's gobblin' up the T... cells.

460
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:14,613
I'm tellin' you, Max,
feline leukemia might be a clue.

461
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:17,139
Really looks infectious to me.

462
00:37:17,211 --> 00:37:20,692
Just like your favorite bug,
the feline leukemia virus.

463
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:24,891
- They both cause cancer, right?
- Okay.

464
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:27,314
They both cause immune suppression.

465
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:30,197
- Something's gobblin' up those T... cells.
- Okay.

466
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,601
They both have long incubation periods.

467
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,944
Suspect or know?

468
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,761
These guys had
swollen lymph nodes, fevers...

469
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:39,828
...all sorts of things for years
before they get Kaposi's sarcoma.

470
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:40,793
Good.

471
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,784
- It's hardly scientific proof, but it's good.
- All right, let's add hepatitis B.

472
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,440
- It causes cancer, right?
- Right.

473
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:51,769
Immune suppression? No.
Has a long incubation period.

474
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,454
Can take up to 30 years
to give cancer to the liver.

475
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,312
Right.

476
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,517
Transmitted by sex.

477
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,847
No. Yes.

478
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,369
It all fits!

479
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,759
The disease we're looking for
looks like a combination...

480
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,544
...between feline leukemia and hepatitis B.

481
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:15,408
So isn't it likely what we're looking for
is some kind of new virus?

482
00:38:15,484 --> 00:38:17,785
Like the retrovirus
that causes feline leukemia.

483
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:20,566
Possible.

484
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:23,898
It's also possible
that since your two fields of expertise...

485
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:26,549
...are feline leukemia and hepatitis B...

486
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:31,409
...what looks like a scientific eureka
might only be a case of wishful thinking.

487
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:35,829
It's possible. Maybe likely.

488
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:39,481
Actually it could be a retrovirus,
in which case we need Bob Gallo.

489
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,936
- Will we have to kiss his ring?
- Probably.

490
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:46,326
But here's a man who became
world famous for finding...

491
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:48,981
...the first human retrovirus, HTLV.

492
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:53,202
But he still hasn't found
a major illness to link it to.

493
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:56,851
And if this turns out to be the one...

494
00:38:57,595 --> 00:39:00,312
Then Bob Gallo gets the Nobel Prize.

495
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:09,811
Shit!

496
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,373
Sorry, Dr. Gallo.

497
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:15,990
You're sorry about winning?

498
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,796
Never be sorry about winning.

499
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:24,304
If you don't get
your promotion next month...

500
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,714
...that's when you should be sorry.

501
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:34,101
Dr. Gallo, telephone.

502
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:43,642
- Bob, Max Essex.
- Max, how are you?

503
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,779
Are you working on that
new gay disease yet?

504
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:49,881
No. I'll tell you the truth,
that really doesn't interest me.

505
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:53,944
Don Francis used to be my student,
he's with the CDC now.

506
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:57,720
He's found enough evidence to suggest
that it may be caused by some retrovirus...

507
00:39:57,787 --> 00:40:00,024
...possibly in the same family as yours.

508
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:04,660
I'm gonna explore this with him and I think
it's something you oughta look into.

509
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:09,398
Send me what you have
and I'll put someone on it.

510
00:40:09,468 --> 00:40:10,613
Excellent!

511
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,977
Thanks for the call. Bye.

512
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,522
- What did he say?
- We got it.

513
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,882
I got a call from LA.

514
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:24,021
- Wait a minute. I'm on the phone.
- I got a call from LA.

515
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:27,888
This could be the first real lead
to prove this thing is sexually transmitted.

516
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:30,811
- My plane leaves in 40 minutes.
- The budget isn't approved!

517
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:34,258
Don't sweat it, I'll front the money.
You'll pay me back.

518
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:40,212
If you have definitive proof it was
brought in by a UFO, send it into us.

519
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:41,592
Thank you.

520
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:51,700
666.

521
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,721
Excuse me?

522
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:56,374
It's my room number.

523
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:08,087
That's when I called
the Public Health Department...

524
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,522
...when I saw what room they put me in.

525
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:18,131
But nobody listened to me.
Nobody listens in this place!

526
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,031
I'll listen to you.

527
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:29,847
That's why I'm here.

528
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:39,288
It all started with a barbecue.

529
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:44,593
It was in the summer of 1980.

530
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:48,210
We had it in our backyard.

531
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:52,625
And it was just me and my lover...

532
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,244
...and a gay couple from up the street.

533
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,859
One of them died...

534
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:04,506
...on October 6, 1981.

535
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:09,745
And one died on February 6, 1982.

536
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:13,750
And the other one died on March 6, 1982.

537
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:16,661
There are three sixes, you see?

538
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:18,319
Yes.

539
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:22,066
All of them died of this new disease?

540
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:25,209
There are three sixes.

541
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:27,479
There are three sixes, so I...

542
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:31,511
Do you see any of the names
of those men on this list?

543
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:36,180
October 6 is '81.

544
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:41,238
February 6 is '82.

545
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:45,138
And March 6, '82.

546
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:49,459
Good.

547
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:53,268
- You had sex with all three of these men?
- Listen.

548
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:56,410
- Can you hear that?
- What?

549
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:58,068
Do you hear that?

550
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,127
The music...

551
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:07,413
...it's playing upside down.

552
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:10,233
Which means...

553
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,249
...I'm number four on the list.

554
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:18,256
Four and two makes...

555
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:27,288
Would you tell me the absolute truth?

556
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:30,871
Would you?
No matter how terrifying that may be.

557
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:33,488
I'll try to.

558
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:38,579
Does it make a difference
if I was cremated?

559
00:43:40,763 --> 00:43:42,454
I don't understand.

560
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:45,338
I'm sorry.

561
00:43:58,106 --> 00:44:00,179
Him, him...

562
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:03,960
...and him.

563
00:44:11,546 --> 00:44:13,335
I miss him very much.

564
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:18,961
I am 32 years old and I'm dying.

565
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,518
Can you just leave me alone?

566
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,724
- I'm sorry.
- Get him outta here!

567
00:44:25,243 --> 00:44:29,334
- Here's my card, if you...
- God dammit, get him outta here!

568
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:33,146
Sorry to bother you.

569
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:38,096
Mr. Darrow. I'm not his lover.

570
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:40,912
I'm a friend who takes care of him
on Thursdays.

571
00:44:40,987 --> 00:44:43,256
We take turns in a buddy program.

572
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:47,574
I'm not sure this
is what you're looking for but...

573
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,610
...I think Greg got it
from a man from New York.

574
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:55,415
You don't know a man from New York
with a French... Canadian accent, do you?

575
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:58,101
Very handsome, I was told, very chic.

576
00:44:58,523 --> 00:45:01,273
I don't think so. I mean, I very seldom...

577
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:06,550
Wait a minute.
This might help somebody else, right?

578
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:07,732
Right.

579
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:11,065
Of course I know him.
From the bathhouses.

580
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:15,865
I never had sex with him but almost
everybody I know has, or wants to.

581
00:45:16,603 --> 00:45:18,032
It was fun.

582
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:23,415
Then again, he gave me hepatitis,
so it's quite possible he gave me this, too.

583
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,047
From the moment I first spied him
at the tubs, I was so crazy about him.

584
00:45:29,115 --> 00:45:30,358
He was so gorgeous.

585
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:33,648
Can you just give me his phone number,
or address...

586
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:36,730
...or anyway I can get a hold of him?

587
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:44,022
All I know is he's French... Canadian,
he's an airline steward based in New York.

588
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:46,361
I don't even know which airline.

589
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:47,954
That's okay.

590
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:50,551
If you can just give me his name.

591
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:52,919
I called him Dougie.

592
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:56,881
- Nickname.
- Dougie. And his full name?

593
00:46:05,243 --> 00:46:06,355
Hi.

594
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:11,125
- You back in town?
- No, just for the night.

595
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,267
I'm going to New York...

596
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:17,681
...to try and find a very sexually active
French... Canadian airline steward.

597
00:46:21,627 --> 00:46:24,791
Gaetan Dugas, Bill Darrow.

598
00:46:26,523 --> 00:46:27,603
Hello.

599
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:29,562
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

600
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:32,409
- Sit down. Take all the time you need.
- Thank you.

601
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:33,751
Thank you.

602
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,586
Thanks very much for coming in.

603
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:40,026
I'm very flattered to be asked.

604
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:43,001
Although I've no idea
what I'm here to discuss.

605
00:46:43,163 --> 00:46:46,676
- Would it disturb you if I smoke?
- If you need to, go ahead.

606
00:46:49,242 --> 00:46:52,952
Mr. Dugas, have you had sex
with any of these people?

607
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:57,139
Is that what I'm here for,
to talk about my beautiful lovers?

608
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:58,356
Now I am flattered.

609
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:02,708
Although I cannot possibly imagine
why you'd be interested.

610
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,729
We've found substantial evidence...

611
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:08,690
...to suggest that one of the ways this
disease may be transmitted is sexually.

612
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:13,205
Now, wait a minute.

613
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:17,306
All I have is skin cancer
which is not contagious and you know it.

614
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:22,106
No one's accusing you of anything.
We just need to know as much as we can.

615
00:47:26,586 --> 00:47:30,842
You know, I adore doctors,
but I must say, if it is an epidemic...

616
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:35,673
...this gay plague thing,
it's your fault for not stopping it, not mine.

617
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:37,910
That's exactly what we're trying to do.

618
00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:39,866
And we need everybody's help...

619
00:47:39,931 --> 00:47:44,153
...so if you could give me the names
and addresses of all your lovers...

620
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:47,382
...and start with the people
on this list, please.

621
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,114
My friend, we're talking about
thousands of men...

622
00:47:52,187 --> 00:47:56,660
...all over the world, whose faces I can't
even remember and you want names.

623
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:59,030
As many as you can remember would help.

624
00:47:59,867 --> 00:48:02,169
My book's in my apartment. You call me.

625
00:48:02,235 --> 00:48:03,828
What's the number?

626
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,098
I'll call you.

627
00:48:06,171 --> 00:48:09,269
Help me, don't help me,
that's up to you, but don't fuck with me!

628
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:11,226
I'm not playing games here.

629
00:48:18,747 --> 00:48:22,521
Not before 6:00, and not after 6:30.

630
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:26,706
Thank you.

631
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:31,191
And remember something.

632
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:36,694
Whatever it is, if I got it,
someone gave it to me.

633
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,563
- Mine.
- I'm sorry.

634
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:54,803
This is important!

635
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:56,215
Not to me!

636
00:49:13,306 --> 00:49:17,529
Yes. Hello. It's Bill Darrow from the CDC.

637
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:22,354
- Got plenty of paper? I've got 73 names.
- Sure.

638
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:31,031
All right, this is how it breaks down.

639
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:34,743
This is Patient Zero,
an airline steward from New York...

640
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,299
...and the starting point
of this particular group.

641
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:40,022
These are the eight with whom
he had direct sexual contact.

642
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:42,676
These four in New York, these four in LA.

643
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,186
This is LA Three.

644
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:47,218
He had sex with LA Two,
this man from Florida...

645
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:49,840
...who in turn had sex
with this Florida man...

646
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:52,760
...two from Georgia,
one from Texas, and so on.

647
00:49:52,987 --> 00:49:55,889
In all, 40 cases in 10 cities...

648
00:49:55,963 --> 00:49:58,581
...are verifiably linked to Patient Zero.

649
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:01,946
Which strongly suggests this is
a sexually transmitted disease.

650
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:06,870
Great! That's absolutely terrific work.

651
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:11,760
- That is the first sign of real proof.
- Good job!

652
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,453
Is there any clue
why Patient Zero is still alive...

653
00:50:14,523 --> 00:50:17,174
...and others in this cluster
died almost immediately?

654
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:20,210
We just have to assume
a variable incubation period.

655
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,955
How many of these connections
were made in bathhouses?

656
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:26,131
- Most of them.
- Most of them!

657
00:50:27,514 --> 00:50:29,848
We know what we have to do:
Close the bathhouses.

658
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:33,428
The federal government
doesn't have authority to do that.

659
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:36,532
- How soon can you write a full report?
- Four or five days.

660
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:38,742
I'm from the Bay Area, I could just...

661
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:40,501
Could you stay out of this?

662
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:44,433
It's not my decision what to do with this
information and it's certainly not yours.

663
00:50:44,506 --> 00:50:46,678
Something this important
has to go upstairs...

664
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:49,845
...and based on what they recommend,
we can act.

665
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:55,667
Are you saying that the public might
not even be told what we just found out?

666
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:59,762
Are you saying this is, or is not,
a sexually transmittable disease?

667
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:07,416
The existence of a cluster study
provides evidence for an hypothesis...

668
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:12,086
...that people in the study are not
randomly associated with each other.

669
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:16,280
The study is a sexual cluster, yet we don't
have enough scientific evidence...

670
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:19,729
...to say for certain that one person
gives it to another person.

671
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:22,105
We have to focus more research
into this area...

672
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:26,775
...so we don't prematurely release
information that's not validated.

673
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:32,275
Yet, we're not holding back information
that might provide important medical help.

674
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:34,936
Thank you.

675
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:42,000
In a situation that may slightly embarrass
the White House, your idea is to play dead.

676
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:45,009
I'm the bureaucratic whore,
you're Lawrence of Arabia?

677
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,254
- Do you think I like doing what I do?
- Do you?

678
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:50,454
One of my jobs is to make sure
I don't start a nationwide panic.

679
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:52,277
Is that worse than an epidemic?

680
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:56,175
I won't make enemies with people who can
cut off what little funding we have left.

681
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,244
- I'm juggling political, bureaucratic, public...
- What about science and medicine?

682
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:02,682
What I said in there was pure science,
you know it.

683
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:06,708
There's strong evidence but there's
nothing we can prove scientifically.

684
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:09,626
It can take up to five years
to establish scientific proof.

685
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:11,545
How many people are gonna get sick?

686
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,327
Let's just say we get rid of
the idea of scientific proof.

687
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:19,064
What are you going to replace it with,
the Ouija Board School of Epidemiology?

688
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:25,490
When a house is on fire,
you don't wait for scientific proof.

689
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:29,207
You grab the first hose
and you start putting out the fire.

690
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:47,569
I never said that.
Don't put words in my mouth.

691
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,898
Let me just say something. Listen to me.

692
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,770
You keep saying community!

693
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:56,755
Wait a second.

694
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:06,513
I am just talking about a modern...
Hold on. Just wait a second.

695
00:53:06,874 --> 00:53:09,110
Somebody has to...

696
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:11,284
Goddamn it! Just shut the hell up.

697
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:14,800
I can't believe every time
we have a meeting in this town...

698
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:17,176
...we don't end in a brawl,
we start with one.

699
00:53:17,242 --> 00:53:19,730
I don't have the power
to shut down the bathhouses.

700
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:24,279
As Director of Public Health, you can
shut down any threat to public health.

701
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,501
According to the press conference, there
was no evidence it's sexually transmitted.

702
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,760
You know damn well, if this epidemic
was killing grandmothers and virgins...

703
00:53:32,922 --> 00:53:35,410
...you'd have an army of investigators
out there.

704
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:36,431
Exactly.

705
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:41,296
This is San Francisco, where the bathhouse
is a symbol of sexual freedom.

706
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:46,968
If you want these bathhouses closed down,
the gay community has to help close them.

707
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:48,245
Good night.

708
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:52,151
No way he's gonna budge
and commit political suicide.

709
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:54,968
Why should he, with the gay community
split down the middle?

710
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:56,889
We are not split down the middle.

711
00:53:56,987 --> 00:54:01,045
The vast majority of gay men
are in stable, monogamous relationships.

712
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:04,464
They don't go to the bathhouses,
it's only the minority.

713
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:05,945
Okay, a vocal minority do.

714
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,044
If something isn't done about
this epidemic, they're dead!

715
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:11,220
The vocal minority and a lot more besides.

716
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,073
Just wait a second.
Let me talk for a second.

717
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:27,955
What's the matter?

718
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:36,147
There's been a...

719
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:40,176
- For a while now...
- You don't have to tell me.

720
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:42,551
Yes, I do. I've met someone.

721
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:49,012
He's an architect.

722
00:54:58,523 --> 00:55:01,784
It'd hurt something awful
if you stopped being my friend.

723
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:07,346
How could I stop being your friend?

724
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:21,488
Five, six, seven, eight.

725
00:55:27,418 --> 00:55:28,695
Straight back.

726
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:34,645
Five, six, seven, eight.

727
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:48,657
Five, six, seven, eight.

728
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,655
Hey, Doc.

729
00:56:08,411 --> 00:56:09,393
Hi.

730
00:56:10,522 --> 00:56:13,752
- I'm really happy you could come.
- Thank you for asking.

731
00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:16,633
You said you were going to be
in New York...

732
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:28,116
I'm sorry I couldn't be more specific
with you on the phone.

733
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:39,666
I think I got this thing.

734
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:47,924
I'm really scared.

735
00:56:59,899 --> 00:57:02,768
Why am I so afraid
to tell anybody about this?

736
00:57:09,562 --> 00:57:11,896
I know how hard it is
for you people to get...

737
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:15,672
...the kind of money you need
to fight these things.

738
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:18,873
I want to...

739
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:25,529
Use that wherever you think
it'll do the most good, all right?

740
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:30,386
Thank you.

741
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:41,336
Get out of here. I gotta get back to work.

742
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:27,568
We won't stop!

743
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:31,287
I'm Bill Kraus. This could get you
in trouble with the CDC, couldn't it?

744
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:32,598
Probably.

745
00:58:33,306 --> 00:58:36,689
As I tried to say on the phone,
the CDC caused chaos here.

746
00:58:37,082 --> 00:58:41,784
That press conference was so ambiguous
about sexual transmission...

747
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:45,081
...the gay community
is in complete turmoil.

748
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:57,561
How much longer do you think
we're gonna wait here?

749
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:06,451
Let me tell you something.

750
00:59:06,746 --> 00:59:10,870
No matter what happens here today,
if you try to close my joint, I'll sue you.

751
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:13,684
Do you know the people who have sex
in your bathhouse...

752
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:15,314
...are playing Russian roulette?

753
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:17,175
Please, let's cut out this bullshit!

754
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,647
We're all in this for one thing: Money.
I make it when the guys come in.

755
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:24,499
You doctors,
you make it when they go out.

756
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,984
How long will we wait for him?
He's an hour late. Let's go.

757
00:59:37,146 --> 00:59:39,120
All right. Can we settle down please?

758
00:59:39,194 --> 00:59:43,220
Please, everybody settle down
so we can start. Thank you.

759
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:47,955
While we're waiting for Dr. Silverman,
your Director of Public Health...

760
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,130
...I've got some good news to report.

761
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:53,623
Not just here in San Francisco,
but right across the country...

762
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,487
...gay organizations are raising money
to fight this epidemic.

763
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,032
I'd like to introduce Dr. Don Francis...

764
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:05,586
...from the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta...

765
01:00:05,658 --> 01:00:08,244
...who's been fighting this epidemic
from the start.

766
01:00:14,586 --> 01:00:18,066
First, I'm not speaking on behalf of
the Centers for Disease Control.

767
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:19,796
I'm speaking for myself.

768
01:00:20,698 --> 01:00:24,658
There may have been confusion caused by
the way the information was distributed...

769
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,764
...about whether or not
this disease is sexually transmittable.

770
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:32,883
I'm here to give you the absolute truth
about what we've found.

771
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,399
First, if you get this disease...

772
01:00:36,794 --> 01:00:40,209
...the chances are about 100 percent
that you're going to die.

773
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:44,023
Second, one of the ways
that you can get this disease...

774
01:00:44,122 --> 01:00:47,319
...is by having sex with somebody
who already has it.

775
01:00:47,546 --> 01:00:48,822
We have established...

776
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:52,946
...that most of the people who have
this disease got it in a bathhouse.

777
01:00:58,106 --> 01:00:59,764
Quiet down, please.

778
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:10,969
One at a time, please.

779
01:01:11,354 --> 01:01:13,623
Everyone will have a chance to speak.

780
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:16,952
Please, shut the hell up.

781
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:23,255
How can you say we get it from sex
when the CDC just said that we didn't?

782
01:01:26,106 --> 01:01:29,903
This is another Reagan trick
to shove us back in the closet.

783
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:39,988
What about the bathhouses?

784
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,275
Here's the man we've all been waiting for,
your Director of Health...

785
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:46,069
...Dr. Mervyn Silverman.

786
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:48,211
Let's go.

787
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:53,968
Since the reason for this meeting is to
discuss how we feel, who would like to...

788
01:01:56,058 --> 01:01:58,098
Bobbi Campbell go ahead.

789
01:02:04,698 --> 01:02:08,560
For years, people in my hometown...

790
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:13,080
...were telling me I was a freak
because of my sexual orientation.

791
01:02:13,786 --> 01:02:15,728
Until I came to San Francisco...

792
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:19,673
...and I found a community of freaks
just like me!

793
01:02:20,698 --> 01:02:24,014
We stood together!

794
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,032
And it took a long time...

795
01:02:26,106 --> 01:02:29,968
...but we finally forced this one tiny
spot of the universe, the Castro...

796
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:34,581
...to realize that how we choose to have
sex and where is our own damn business!

797
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:41,110
Which I know to people who haven't
gone through what we have...

798
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:42,934
...sounds funny and they may laugh.

799
01:02:43,578 --> 01:02:45,520
But I know, speaking for most of us...

800
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:51,096
...I would rather die as a human being
than continue living as a freak.

801
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,974
There's a lot of strong feeling
on this subject.

802
01:03:00,922 --> 01:03:03,671
Before I make my decision,
I'd like to put this to a vote.

803
01:03:03,834 --> 01:03:08,504
All those in favor of the city closing
the bathhouses, raise your hand.

804
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:10,448
Close the tubs!

805
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:20,024
All those in favor of keeping
the bathhouses open, raise your hands.

806
01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:31,416
I don't understand.

807
01:03:31,898 --> 01:03:33,327
They're human.

808
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,544
And they're scared.

809
01:03:55,354 --> 01:03:57,590
Why this happen?

810
01:03:59,002 --> 01:03:59,984
You doctor...

811
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,169
...how you don't know?

812
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:18,738
Sorry, we're late.
We were held up by traffic.

813
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:27,285
Let's hope this lymph material
holds the key to the illness.

814
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:38,611
Put this in reserve.

815
01:05:46,874 --> 01:05:48,303
It's amazing to me...

816
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:52,302
...that Americans can think
a disease has a sexual preference.

817
01:05:52,378 --> 01:05:54,516
But that's all Americans think of...

818
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,528
Sex. Sex. Sex.

819
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:37,975
I think this read within weeks, and quickly.

820
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:45,106
Just have Gallo report the detection
of this virus, HTLV, in what?

821
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,587
It was the two East Coast homosexuals.

822
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,395
Two East Coast homosexuals.

823
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:57,300
In this hour, right away, now,
the Science...

824
01:06:57,914 --> 01:07:00,783
This is big. We've finally got the big one.

825
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:11,090
Tell all our best people to drop what
they're doing and get to work on this.

826
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:14,287
- On this day, March what?
- Third.

827
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:18,519
Dr. Robert Gallo makes
the first gigantic strides in winning...

828
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,756
What? The war, the battle?

829
01:07:21,593 --> 01:07:23,601
- The war.
- Battle...

830
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,480
...against whatever they call it now.

831
01:07:31,258 --> 01:07:34,192
Francoise... You do the honors.

832
01:07:42,778 --> 01:07:46,073
Unless the numbers reach 20,000,
we don't have a retrovirus.

833
01:07:51,162 --> 01:07:54,129
300, 320.

834
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,591
Background radiation.

835
01:07:56,986 --> 01:07:59,157
Where did we go wrong?

836
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:00,946
Start from scratch.

837
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:04,018
Modify the culture...

838
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:09,879
...and check any procedural errors.

839
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:23,316
Look what they're calling it.
"He died after another 'Iong illness."'

840
01:08:24,857 --> 01:08:26,264
It's so sad.

841
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:32,311
This could be the first deadly epidemic
in history of which nobody officially died.

842
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:33,752
Look at this!

843
01:08:34,553 --> 01:08:37,750
- Did you see this? Look at this article.
- Where?

844
01:08:38,106 --> 01:08:40,277
"In order to move quickly
and take the lead...

845
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:43,160
"...in what may be a fierce
scientific battle against GRID...

846
01:08:43,225 --> 01:08:46,673
"...Dr. Gallo has formed a special unit
of the National Cancer Institute...

847
01:08:46,746 --> 01:08:50,062
"...to fight and win the battle against
this disease by the year's end."

848
01:08:50,138 --> 01:08:52,559
- What?
- Hot damn! We're in business!

849
01:08:55,417 --> 01:08:59,443
An IV drug user in New York,
I just got back, died from it.

850
01:08:59,513 --> 01:09:01,204
- Gay?
- A woman.

851
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:04,148
It's in the blood supply.

852
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:15,831
- How long has he been ill?
- He was born with it.

853
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:18,069
No. I don't mean hemophilia.

854
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:22,614
He was doing fine until recently,
wasn't he?

855
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:26,610
He's crippled in one knee
because they couldn't stop the bleeding...

856
01:09:26,681 --> 01:09:31,470
...until a few years ago,
when they came out with that new stuff.

857
01:09:31,705 --> 01:09:34,007
- Factor VIII.
- Now look at him.

858
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:37,427
He was doing fine just a few weeks ago.

859
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:41,272
Did you happen to get a new supply
of Factor VIII about that same time?

860
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:45,711
What is that, exactly?
Fake blood or something?

861
01:09:45,785 --> 01:09:48,502
No, it's real blood.

862
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:52,626
But they get it from
thousands of different people...

863
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:58,229
...put it through a lot of different filters
and take out things and add things to it...

864
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:02,158
...till all they've got is the clotting stuff...

865
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:05,463
...that makes you stop bleeding.

866
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,908
He was doing fine until a few weeks ago.

867
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:14,963
I'm really sorry about this,
but I've got some questions which are...

868
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:17,267
...embarrassing.

869
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:19,865
I've gotta ask them.

870
01:10:22,394 --> 01:10:25,492
Has he ever had sexual contact
with another man?

871
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:29,206
I don't understand the question.

872
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,188
He's a man.

873
01:10:31,513 --> 01:10:35,288
How can a man have sex
with another man?

874
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:40,950
I personally don't care...

875
01:10:41,209 --> 01:10:43,576
...if these people were painted
by Norman Rockwell!

876
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:45,878
We have to prove the blood
is contaminated.

877
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:47,187
We've gotta prove it!

878
01:10:47,258 --> 01:10:49,941
What do we know, what do we think,
what can we prove?

879
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:51,635
It is in Factor VIII.

880
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:52,818
- You think?
- I know.

881
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:55,573
- Proof.
- We can't prove anything till we do a test.

882
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:58,871
- We can't test till we find the virus.
- Assuming that it is a virus.

883
01:10:59,226 --> 01:11:00,982
Finding a virus with our equipment?

884
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:04,246
You got a better chance of winning
the Indy 500 with roller... skates.

885
01:11:04,377 --> 01:11:07,247
What about Max Essex?
Is he finding anything out?

886
01:11:07,322 --> 01:11:10,005
He can't keep the cells alive long enough
to see a virus.

887
01:11:10,073 --> 01:11:12,440
- The French have the same problem.
- Gallo, too.

888
01:11:12,505 --> 01:11:15,734
Does anybody have anything positive?

889
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,637
We may be able to do something
about the blood supply...

890
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:21,647
...even though we can't find the virus.

891
01:11:21,722 --> 01:11:24,471
The people getting this disease
are almost identical...

892
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:27,950
...to the group getting hepatitis B,
so we did an experiment.

893
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:31,153
We took the hepatitis B test
and took blood samples...

894
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:34,072
...from 60 gay men who've got it
and 60 men who don't.

895
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:38,454
The test was 88 percent effective
in detecting the disease.

896
01:11:38,553 --> 01:11:40,440
- Really?
- That is fantastic!

897
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,156
If the blood banks can weed out
that many people...

898
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:45,560
...who have the disease
before they donate blood...

899
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:46,705
Exactly!

900
01:11:46,778 --> 01:11:47,890
Wait.

901
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:51,125
Do all of you really believe
that the blood industry...

902
01:11:51,193 --> 01:11:55,982
...is gonna spend millions of dollars
on an idea that is scientifically radical?

903
01:11:56,857 --> 01:11:59,061
It's not so radical if you're a hemophiliac.

904
01:11:59,258 --> 01:12:01,778
Can we be realistic just for one second?

905
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:04,500
We must prove that
it's even in the blood supply...

906
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:06,804
...before we get any action
from those people.

907
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:09,775
It's bound to turn up
in the regular blood supply.

908
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:12,500
I think we should look at transfusions.

909
01:12:13,273 --> 01:12:16,120
In fact, if we can find one patient...

910
01:12:16,313 --> 01:12:18,866
...who got the disease
after getting a transfusion...

911
01:12:18,937 --> 01:12:20,847
...then we need to look at the donors.

912
01:12:20,986 --> 01:12:24,117
See if one of them has the disease
that gave him the blood.

913
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:26,574
If we can find that,
we've made the connection.

914
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:29,998
We just gotta prove the patient
couldn't have gotten it any other way.

915
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:32,307
That's interesting.

916
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:34,830
Interesting? It's so obvious.

917
01:12:35,065 --> 01:12:37,105
It's brilliant!

918
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:53,265
- Terry Mack.
- Dale Lawrence.

919
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:57,517
He's had 12 donors,
all from the New York Blood Center.

920
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:01,685
Are you saying the New York Blood Center
won't give me a list of the donors?

921
01:13:04,186 --> 01:13:08,790
The CDC is convinced he couldn't have
gotten the disease from any other source...

922
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,832
...except the transfusions.

923
01:13:10,906 --> 01:13:14,768
The legal protection of donor
confidentiality prevents me...

924
01:13:14,841 --> 01:13:17,329
A donors has a disease
that will kill the man...

925
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:19,638
...who got the blood from you
to save his life.

926
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:21,363
If we don't find that donor...

927
01:13:21,433 --> 01:13:24,215
...before he donates more blood
and kills more people...

928
01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:27,478
Unless there is
irrefutable scientific evidence...

929
01:13:27,577 --> 01:13:31,669
...that the alleged disease does exist,
that it can be blood... borne...

930
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:35,092
...and if so, has been proven
to be transfusion transmissible...

931
01:13:35,353 --> 01:13:37,458
...there is nothing I can do.

932
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,394
Harold Jaffe, CDC.

933
01:14:09,593 --> 01:14:10,771
- Hi.
- How do you do?

934
01:14:10,873 --> 01:14:12,881
- Harold Jaffe.
- Betsy Reisz.

935
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:13,936
So it's true?

936
01:14:14,937 --> 01:14:17,654
He was born here 20 months ago.
An Rh baby.

937
01:14:18,105 --> 01:14:22,000
Within a week, his entire blood volume
had been replaced six times.

938
01:14:22,777 --> 01:14:24,370
Now he has zoster...

939
01:14:24,921 --> 01:14:27,060
...practically zero T... cell count...

940
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:30,447
...and more opportunistic disease
than we know what do with.

941
01:14:31,673 --> 01:14:34,673
- He had 13 donors?
- All from Irwin Memorial.

942
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:39,857
That's all I could find out. They keep a lid
on it so tight, it's like the Pentagon.

943
01:14:39,929 --> 01:14:42,264
Forget about getting a list of donors
from them.

944
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:46,385
The first irrefutable case
caused by transfusions...

945
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:49,076
...and these people are stonewalling us.

946
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:52,977
Know what we need?
Somebody to scare the hell out of them.

947
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,837
Only Attila the Hun could.

948
01:14:58,233 --> 01:14:59,759
Selma Dritz!

949
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:05,327
- Well?
- I got it.

950
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:08,820
There's one problem, two problems.
I'm freezing, that's one problem.

951
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:10,231
Let's get some coffee.

952
01:15:10,777 --> 01:15:14,093
One of the donors died from the disease
two months ago.

953
01:15:14,457 --> 01:15:15,918
But we can't prove it.

954
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:17,881
What do you mean? Why not?

955
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:22,132
He was from one of the richest,
most socially prominent families in town.

956
01:15:22,233 --> 01:15:24,753
He swore to his dying breath
he wasn't gay.

957
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:26,352
What's the difference?

958
01:15:26,425 --> 01:15:29,872
When somebody dies from this,
you can't mistake it for whooping cough.

959
01:15:29,945 --> 01:15:32,149
His doctor says he died from encephalitis.

960
01:15:32,217 --> 01:15:34,868
- It's on his death certificate.
- Let's talk to the doctor.

961
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:37,205
And get him to say what? He lied?

962
01:15:37,273 --> 01:15:39,542
Somewhere in town,
there must be somebody.

963
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:42,608
A gay man he had sex with or...
Does his family know?

964
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:46,965
My brother wasn't gay.

965
01:15:47,193 --> 01:15:49,364
No matter how hard you search...

966
01:15:49,433 --> 01:15:52,280
...you won't find any evidence
to suggest the contrary.

967
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,155
He was on the board
of several corporations.

968
01:15:55,225 --> 01:15:58,356
He was the chairman of the Fundraising
Committee for St. Patrick's.

969
01:15:58,425 --> 01:16:00,148
He was meticulous...

970
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:09,935
He was meticulous
in concealing his other life...

971
01:16:10,969 --> 01:16:12,376
...even from me.

972
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,842
Please don't ask me to betray him now.

973
01:16:18,905 --> 01:16:22,582
I'm very sorry.
But we're trying to stop an epidemic.

974
01:16:23,481 --> 01:16:26,263
We know that this disease
can be transmitted by gay sex.

975
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:29,206
We hope to prove it's also transmitted
by blood products.

976
01:16:29,337 --> 01:16:31,311
Your brother was a blood donor.

977
01:16:31,673 --> 01:16:34,007
And we know that at least one person...

978
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:36,529
...who got his blood, got the disease.

979
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,890
If you can help us...

980
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,999
...it would be completely confidential.

981
01:16:47,897 --> 01:16:51,726
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I really don't know anything myself.

982
01:16:51,993 --> 01:16:53,815
Here's his stuff.

983
01:16:55,289 --> 01:16:56,751
His mail.

984
01:16:58,169 --> 01:17:00,057
Here's his address book.

985
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:02,542
You can look through it if you want.
I have.

986
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:06,003
There's no one in there I don't know.
Nothing unusual.

987
01:17:06,649 --> 01:17:08,820
I wish he would've told me, but he didn't.

988
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:13,426
Look at this. What about this entry?

989
01:17:17,305 --> 01:17:18,865
"Marc, Repairman"?

990
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:29,554
Dr. Conant's office.

991
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:33,783
- Is someone named Marc there?
- This is Dr. Marcus Conant's office.

992
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:35,407
May I help you?

993
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,036
Sorry, wrong number.

994
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:43,379
Only for you.

995
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:47,801
I was the secret doctor he came to
for those messy little problems...

996
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:51,503
...he couldn't let his family physician
know about.

997
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:54,225
In 1980, he had a case of K. S...

998
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,014
...pneumocystis...

999
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:58,003
...the whole bag of horrors.

1000
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:02,547
Thank you very much. I love you.

1001
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:05,364
Thanks a lot, Doctor.

1002
01:18:05,721 --> 01:18:08,688
All right,
let the blood banks stonewall this one!

1003
01:18:12,825 --> 01:18:17,746
I'd like to remind everyone that
these are not regulations from the CDC.

1004
01:18:17,817 --> 01:18:20,631
This is a workshop where every agency...

1005
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:24,374
...connected to the blood industry can
evaluate information the CDC has found.

1006
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:28,375
We're hoping to be able to arrive
at some course of action.

1007
01:18:28,441 --> 01:18:31,790
One option is to establish guidelines...

1008
01:18:31,897 --> 01:18:34,548
...to keep people at high risk
from donating blood.

1009
01:18:34,617 --> 01:18:38,097
Banning homosexuals from giving blood
won't protect the blood supply.

1010
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,430
What it will do is stigmatize them.

1011
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:45,139
Reminds me of blood banks
rejecting donations from blacks...

1012
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:47,183
...for fear of syphilis.

1013
01:18:47,257 --> 01:18:50,552
The civil rights implications
of establishing guidelines...

1014
01:18:50,617 --> 01:18:51,893
Civil rights, my ass!

1015
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:55,671
My son's a hemophiliac and if homosexuals
are infecting the blood supply...

1016
01:18:55,737 --> 01:18:57,526
...why not keep them from donating?

1017
01:18:57,593 --> 01:19:00,909
The entire gay community?
Then what? Separate drinking fountains?

1018
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:02,894
One for gays! One for humans!

1019
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:04,976
Don't start that gay rights crap!

1020
01:19:05,049 --> 01:19:07,667
There are 20,000 hemophiliacs
in this country...

1021
01:19:07,737 --> 01:19:11,032
...and GRID has become the second
leading cause of death.

1022
01:19:11,097 --> 01:19:13,879
We have rights, too.
One of them is the right to stay alive.

1023
01:19:13,944 --> 01:19:16,792
I know that we're dealing
with a very complex...

1024
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:19,124
...and a highly emotional issue, but...

1025
01:19:19,193 --> 01:19:21,233
How can you expect us
to be unemotional...

1026
01:19:21,337 --> 01:19:23,792
...when at least one person
is dying every day...

1027
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:26,647
...from a disease that doesn't
even have a name?

1028
01:19:26,777 --> 01:19:30,006
If the CDC can't bother
to come up with a name...

1029
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:33,269
...at least it should stop the media
from calling it GRID!

1030
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:38,197
Enough people hate gays without having
the stigma of this disease placed on us!

1031
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:43,566
Especially since it's been shown that this
disease is no longer merely gay... related.

1032
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,059
I make a motion
to officially call this disease...

1033
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:50,128
...Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome...

1034
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:51,950
...or AIDS.

1035
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,591
Questions or discussions on this issue?

1036
01:19:57,689 --> 01:19:59,031
I second it.

1037
01:19:59,385 --> 01:20:01,719
All in favor of Dr. Voeller's motion.

1038
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:07,122
And opposed? The motion's carried.

1039
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:09,012
Dr. Bove?

1040
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:12,592
The FDA Advisory Panel
to the blood banks feels that...

1041
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,859
...the evidence for nearly all of this
is inferential.

1042
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:19,922
The CDC's evidence of blood
transmission cannot be warranted...

1043
01:20:20,025 --> 01:20:25,044
...until the CDC shows definitively that
an infectious agent causes this disease.

1044
01:20:25,305 --> 01:20:28,403
Nothing about it exists
in the peer... reviewed medical literature!

1045
01:20:28,505 --> 01:20:30,294
Not one case!

1046
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,984
Evidence of such
blood transmission is lacking.

1047
01:20:33,081 --> 01:20:37,390
May I point out that the blood industry
is under the jurisdiction of the FDA...

1048
01:20:37,464 --> 01:20:41,010
...and according to Dr. Bove, they don't
acknowledge there is an epidemic.

1049
01:20:41,112 --> 01:20:44,625
Because there is no evidence
that it's a blood... borne disease.

1050
01:20:44,729 --> 01:20:47,184
Suppose, for example,
a small amount of blood...

1051
01:20:47,353 --> 01:20:50,288
...by some unlikely chance,
is contaminated.

1052
01:20:50,456 --> 01:20:54,548
With no test to find out which blood
is safe and which isn't, what should we do?

1053
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:57,206
Destroy the entire blood supply
in America...

1054
01:20:57,272 --> 01:21:01,069
...because some of it may
or may not be contaminated?

1055
01:21:01,209 --> 01:21:02,736
No.

1056
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:06,483
In fact, testing is the second option
that we should discuss.

1057
01:21:07,257 --> 01:21:11,032
We at the CDC have found
that the hepatitis B test...

1058
01:21:12,024 --> 01:21:16,759
...is 88 percent effective
in identifying patients with this disease.

1059
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:19,763
Is the CDC suggesting
that the blood industry...

1060
01:21:19,864 --> 01:21:23,759
...spend $100 million a year
to use a test for the wrong disease...

1061
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:28,208
...because of a handful of transfusion
fatalities and eight dead hemophiliacs?

1062
01:21:28,473 --> 01:21:30,545
How many dead hemophiliacs
do you need?

1063
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:34,163
How many people have to die
to make it cost efficient...

1064
01:21:34,297 --> 01:21:36,086
...for you to do something about it?

1065
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,997
A hundred? A thousand?

1066
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:41,848
Give us a number
so we won't annoy you again...

1067
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:44,661
...until the money you begin spending
on lawsuits...

1068
01:21:44,793 --> 01:21:48,655
...makes it more profitable for you
to save people than to kill them!

1069
01:22:06,585 --> 01:22:09,880
The disease called AIDS,
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome...

1070
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:12,333
...sounds less than deadly,
more like a diet pill.

1071
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:14,132
Medical researchers are warning...

1072
01:22:14,232 --> 01:22:16,142
The risk of contracting AIDS...

1073
01:22:16,344 --> 01:22:19,573
Henry Pinya, who has AIDS,
got into a minor traffic accident.

1074
01:22:19,736 --> 01:22:22,584
Police called the Hazardous
Materials Team.

1075
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:25,870
The impact on blood banks
could be disastrous.

1076
01:22:26,329 --> 01:22:29,460
Doctors learned today that
at least one hemophiliac patient...

1077
01:22:29,592 --> 01:22:32,375
...was given blood plasma from a donor
who died of AIDS.

1078
01:22:32,568 --> 01:22:35,983
Possible association of AIDS
and blood transfusion...

1079
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:38,358
...is of the order of one in a million.

1080
01:22:40,633 --> 01:22:44,659
I've been looking all over for you.
I just talked to Paul O'Mally.

1081
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:47,278
He's wrapping up the hepatitis B study
and listen:

1082
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:50,264
12 of the first 24 cases of AIDS
in this country...

1083
01:22:50,393 --> 01:22:54,703
...are men that we've been tracking for
hepatitis B every year since 1978.

1084
01:22:55,321 --> 01:23:00,209
We've been talking about using the test,
but forgot about the hepatitis B study.

1085
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:03,637
- Congratulations.
- You don't think this is important?

1086
01:23:03,704 --> 01:23:07,567
30,000 blood samples and detailed
questionnaires from 7,000 gay men...

1087
01:23:07,705 --> 01:23:12,276
...from five cities, taken every year since
three years before the epidemic broke out.

1088
01:23:12,344 --> 01:23:15,825
We've got the natural history
of the epidemic in a freezer in Phoenix.

1089
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:17,009
I know the study.

1090
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,015
You're saying we should pull
the samples and organize them.

1091
01:23:20,089 --> 01:23:23,863
- Where will we get the money to do that?
- Juggle or steal it.

1092
01:23:23,929 --> 01:23:26,929
There's nothing to juggle or steal.
There's no money, none.

1093
01:23:27,288 --> 01:23:30,288
The $866,000 budget that we requested
a year ago...

1094
01:23:30,393 --> 01:23:32,814
...for the task force
still hasn't been approved.

1095
01:23:32,889 --> 01:23:36,151
Where do you think we'll get the money
to do a job as massive as this?

1096
01:23:36,217 --> 01:23:37,711
That's your job.

1097
01:23:37,881 --> 01:23:41,525
How am I supposed to do my job
with you shooting your mouth off?

1098
01:23:41,592 --> 01:23:42,541
What?

1099
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:47,057
Your outburst at the blood bank meeting
damaged the credibility of the CDC.

1100
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,423
The only way we'll get the blood banks
to start testing...

1101
01:24:05,496 --> 01:24:09,806
...is if we find somebody with enough clout
they've got God's unlisted phone number.

1102
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:11,863
Which these people do.

1103
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:14,135
Jesus, this is proof.

1104
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:17,271
Why haven't they sued somebody,
raised hell?

1105
01:24:17,368 --> 01:24:20,664
Publicity, litigation,
pictures in the tabloids.

1106
01:24:21,048 --> 01:24:23,765
My dear young man, it simply is not done.

1107
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:27,377
If you can convince them how many lives
they'll save if they go public...

1108
01:24:27,449 --> 01:24:30,765
...that comes under the heading
of public service which they are big on.

1109
01:24:30,841 --> 01:24:31,823
If!

1110
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,673
...might be of some assistance to us.

1111
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,462
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

1112
01:24:37,817 --> 01:24:41,778
Complications of all kinds
are quite common after heart surgery.

1113
01:24:42,136 --> 01:24:45,748
What could my case
possibly have to do with AIDS?

1114
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:49,428
They didn't tell you?

1115
01:24:50,264 --> 01:24:51,541
Tell me what?

1116
01:24:51,897 --> 01:24:53,587
We thought we'd heard everything.

1117
01:24:55,289 --> 01:24:56,565
My God.

1118
01:24:57,817 --> 01:24:59,442
I'm sorry.

1119
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:11,405
I have here your medical records.

1120
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:16,532
You're aware that...

1121
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:21,301
...during your surgery you were given
20 units of blood from Irwin Memorial?

1122
01:25:24,089 --> 01:25:25,463
We know that.

1123
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:31,215
When you started getting all these
bizarre diseases, one after another...

1124
01:25:32,473 --> 01:25:34,774
Didn't your doctors tell you why?

1125
01:25:35,032 --> 01:25:38,066
We've had so many doctors.

1126
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:42,291
None of them had
any specific explanation, just...

1127
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,750
...severe complications due to surgery.

1128
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:53,647
I have here a letter
from one doctor to another...

1129
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,227
...at the University of California Medical
Center, where you had your surgery.

1130
01:25:59,128 --> 01:26:02,259
"We have discovered
that one of her blood donors...

1131
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:04,720
"...is an AIDS patient."

1132
01:26:16,824 --> 01:26:18,351
May I?

1133
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:07,346
No.

1134
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:19,662
Every blood bank in the country
has known for some time...

1135
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:24,241
...that some of the blood it has been using
for transfusions is contaminated.

1136
01:27:26,873 --> 01:27:29,458
We've been unable to get them
to start testing...

1137
01:27:29,528 --> 01:27:32,212
...or to take any precautions whatsoever.

1138
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,902
I'm terribly sorry.

1139
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:38,418
Are you telling me...

1140
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,776
...they knew they were giving AIDS
to people and continued to do it?

1141
01:27:52,216 --> 01:27:56,177
We've had extensive discussion
on the subject and as of May 1...

1142
01:27:56,248 --> 01:27:58,998
...Irwin Memorial will begin testing
for antibodies...

1143
01:27:59,064 --> 01:28:01,431
...to the core of the hepatitis B virus.

1144
01:28:03,864 --> 01:28:05,206
Good.

1145
01:28:05,496 --> 01:28:08,944
This is the test we've been urging you
for a year to use...

1146
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,990
...until a better test comes along.

1147
01:28:11,064 --> 01:28:15,287
Not good. That test is not totally effective.

1148
01:28:15,577 --> 01:28:18,806
You're forcing the Red Cross
to start using it, too...

1149
01:28:18,969 --> 01:28:20,791
...or we can't compete.

1150
01:28:21,081 --> 01:28:25,107
Absolutely. We are not convinced
that it's transmitted by transfusion at all.

1151
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,312
What does it take to convince you?

1152
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:29,555
The CDC confirmed...

1153
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:33,779
...that the number of transfusion cases
has quadrupled in the past eight months.

1154
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,302
You know you can't prove that.

1155
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:38,350
Technically, you're right.

1156
01:28:38,744 --> 01:28:41,744
But 89 percent of severe hemophiliacs...

1157
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,598
...who had the most transfusions
have become infected.

1158
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,774
89 percent!

1159
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,277
I find it very hard to equate these figures...

1160
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:53,805
...with the possible loss in revenue!

1161
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,189
I make a motion that FDA
regulations require...

1162
01:28:59,352 --> 01:29:03,476
...the hepatitis B test be used
to screen all blood and blood products...

1163
01:29:03,544 --> 01:29:05,878
...before they're used on patients.

1164
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,014
Second.

1165
01:29:08,472 --> 01:29:09,683
In favor?

1166
01:29:11,192 --> 01:29:12,370
Opposed?

1167
01:29:14,712 --> 01:29:16,370
Motion not carried.

1168
01:29:19,576 --> 01:29:21,267
Let me ask you this:

1169
01:29:22,937 --> 01:29:25,751
When doctors start
acting like businessmen...

1170
01:29:26,232 --> 01:29:28,949
...who can the people turn to for doctors?

1171
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,233
Jesus!

1172
01:29:38,488 --> 01:29:41,009
Every day I plan to buy some groceries.

1173
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,152
I drive by each night on my way home...

1174
01:29:43,288 --> 01:29:46,322
...and no matter how late it is,
you're always up working.

1175
01:29:46,392 --> 01:29:48,247
You want pasta salad, melon?

1176
01:29:48,312 --> 01:29:49,424
Melon.

1177
01:29:51,737 --> 01:29:53,046
Anything new?

1178
01:29:53,592 --> 01:29:54,901
Any hope? Anywhere?

1179
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,437
Of anything?

1180
01:29:56,504 --> 01:29:59,286
Reagan still hasn't
said the word "AIDS" in public.

1181
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,741
I'm not asking about miracles.

1182
01:30:03,032 --> 01:30:06,032
I think the only hope we have...

1183
01:30:06,424 --> 01:30:08,247
...is the election's coming up...

1184
01:30:08,472 --> 01:30:10,927
...and with the whole country in a panic...

1185
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,382
...even the Moral Majority is
on Reagan's ass to do something quick.

1186
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:18,093
Sure he will,
the same old political smoke and mirrors.

1187
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:23,279
A friend of mine sneaked me
a memo from the White House...

1188
01:30:24,248 --> 01:30:27,063
...claiming they've already spent
$26 million on:

1189
01:30:27,353 --> 01:30:31,095
"Studies relevant to patients with AIDS."

1190
01:30:31,928 --> 01:30:34,678
If they spend $10 million on research
for the common cold...

1191
01:30:34,744 --> 01:30:38,900
...they call it relevant because in both
cases the immune system breaks down.

1192
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,555
The truth is, out of that $26 million...

1193
01:30:42,072 --> 01:30:45,749
...only $750,000 has actually been spent
on AIDS research.

1194
01:30:47,256 --> 01:30:49,973
What happened to the rest, I have no idea.

1195
01:30:51,192 --> 01:30:53,167
- Hello.
- It's Don Francis.

1196
01:30:54,233 --> 01:30:56,949
I know this is kind of
a strange question, but...

1197
01:30:57,017 --> 01:30:59,951
...who do you know that can get me
an electron microscope?

1198
01:31:00,024 --> 01:31:01,301
Try Nancy.

1199
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:11,183
They're dying!
The cells are still dying!

1200
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,661
They've been dying all week.

1201
01:31:20,248 --> 01:31:24,023
Is there anything we haven't
tried to keep the cells alive?

1202
01:31:25,528 --> 01:31:30,034
We tried every culture in
the incubators and the freezers...

1203
01:31:30,488 --> 01:31:36,751
We tried anti... interferon,
human cells, what's left? Nothing.

1204
01:31:40,184 --> 01:31:45,880
Yes, try again by feeding the cells,
not just once but continuously.

1205
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,447
22,000

1206
01:32:03,992 --> 01:32:06,927
We've found something.
A retrovirus.

1207
01:32:10,712 --> 01:32:14,290
But is it Gallo's HTLV
or a new one?

1208
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,661
Here it is.

1209
01:32:26,328 --> 01:32:31,762
Here's a photo of what you
just saw. Your virus.

1210
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:36,564
Here's Gallo's virus.

1211
01:32:37,432 --> 01:32:39,472
See... It's round.

1212
01:32:39,768 --> 01:32:41,426
Yours has a bar.

1213
01:32:41,624 --> 01:32:44,471
It's easy to see the difference.

1214
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,786
What you found is
a new human retrovirus.

1215
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:50,609
Bob. Montagnier.

1216
01:32:50,776 --> 01:32:52,085
How are you?

1217
01:32:52,184 --> 01:32:54,573
We tested our virus with your antibodies.

1218
01:32:54,904 --> 01:32:57,173
We find the two
not immunologically... related.

1219
01:32:57,432 --> 01:33:00,530
- Really?
- I'm writing a paper with all the details.

1220
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:05,845
What we've found is a new retrovirus,
which we think is the AIDS virus.

1221
01:33:06,488 --> 01:33:08,310
That's fascinating!

1222
01:33:09,112 --> 01:33:11,533
I just did a paper, too, for Science.

1223
01:33:11,736 --> 01:33:15,630
It shows that my virus, HTLV,
is the most likely candidate for AIDS.

1224
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,084
Why don't you send me your paper
and I'll make sure...

1225
01:33:20,184 --> 01:33:22,093
...it gets published along with mine.

1226
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,495
I'll write the summary
to make sure it gets published.

1227
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,419
Send me samples of your virus
as soon as you can, by courier.

1228
01:33:30,616 --> 01:33:32,209
I'll verify what you got.

1229
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,655
Sure.

1230
01:33:39,096 --> 01:33:43,831
He wants to see our paper
and samples of our virus.

1231
01:33:44,472 --> 01:33:46,577
Frankly, since I've worked
with him...

1232
01:33:46,904 --> 01:33:51,410
Francoise please, Dr. Gallo
is an eminent scientist.

1233
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:53,998
Send him anything he wants.

1234
01:33:54,712 --> 01:34:00,408
Shouldn't an independent agency
test our results?

1235
01:34:03,064 --> 01:34:04,308
Absolutely.

1236
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:08,370
I'll get Don at the CDC
to send blind samples...

1237
01:34:08,824 --> 01:34:12,598
...to prove it's the AIDS virus.
- Good idea.

1238
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:15,989
Just got a call from Paris,
they found the virus.

1239
01:34:17,592 --> 01:34:20,309
- That's terrific!
- I just got a call.

1240
01:34:23,192 --> 01:34:27,469
I just got a call from Paris.
They think they've found the AIDS virus.

1241
01:34:36,024 --> 01:34:38,893
I need 30 coded samples
on a plane to Paris tonight.

1242
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,080
Can you do that?

1243
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,797
I'm sitting here in a complete stupor,
totally unable to comprehend...

1244
01:35:18,872 --> 01:35:22,767
...what kind of a cosmic joke this is for me,
the man they call a sexual nazi...

1245
01:35:22,839 --> 01:35:25,654
...for preaching safe sex
with such fire... and... brimstone...

1246
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:28,305
...I was beginning to sound
like Sadie Thompson.

1247
01:35:28,376 --> 01:35:30,612
Not Sadie Thompson, the Preacher.

1248
01:35:30,776 --> 01:35:34,769
Sadie Thompson was her name.
Rain, wasn't it? The name of the...

1249
01:35:35,352 --> 01:35:37,774
God, I'm babbling. I can't stop.

1250
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,717
How long does it take, do you think,
for it to really sink in that I've got it?

1251
01:35:46,296 --> 01:35:47,703
Maybe not...

1252
01:36:01,432 --> 01:36:02,774
I'm sorry.

1253
01:36:02,968 --> 01:36:05,837
God damn you!

1254
01:36:06,391 --> 01:36:09,839
Why can't this happen
to somebody that you hate?

1255
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,920
I'm going to leave you and Kico my house.

1256
01:36:16,376 --> 01:36:18,132
- What?
- I'll put it in my will.

1257
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,680
I don't want to live with Kico.
He's completely irresponsible.

1258
01:36:21,751 --> 01:36:23,726
He won't pay his half of the phone bill.

1259
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,451
He would never take the garbage out
on Friday nights.

1260
01:36:26,648 --> 01:36:30,642
Come on! If that's the most that you have
to leave me, then to hell with you.

1261
01:36:33,175 --> 01:36:34,550
Live.

1262
01:36:54,743 --> 01:36:55,954
Anything?

1263
01:36:58,392 --> 01:37:02,352
How can I isolate this virus
if I can't keep the cells alive?

1264
01:37:03,543 --> 01:37:06,610
How is it possible that
in the first few months...

1265
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,353
...we found our virus
in two men who had AIDS.

1266
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,789
Since then, we haven't found it
in another case?

1267
01:37:12,856 --> 01:37:16,085
- Not one other case.
- I told you, both of those men had T cells.

1268
01:37:16,152 --> 01:37:17,494
I don't wanna hear that!

1269
01:37:17,656 --> 01:37:20,077
- But you...
- I'm sorry. I don't wanna hear it.

1270
01:37:20,152 --> 01:37:21,461
Listen to me.

1271
01:37:21,527 --> 01:37:25,783
Statistically, what are the odds
on finding two men with AIDS...

1272
01:37:25,848 --> 01:37:29,328
...both of whom
also have the same leukemia...

1273
01:37:29,911 --> 01:37:32,529
...which is so rare
that it's hardly found in anybody.

1274
01:37:32,664 --> 01:37:35,085
- That's ridiculous. All right?
- Fine.

1275
01:37:35,192 --> 01:37:37,047
Somebody in this lab made a mistake.

1276
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,532
I want you to call the French Institute...

1277
01:37:39,608 --> 01:37:41,779
...and get some more samples
of their virus.

1278
01:37:41,848 --> 01:37:45,393
While you're at it,
find out how they keep the cells alive.

1279
01:37:52,696 --> 01:37:54,289
Popovic here, yes?

1280
01:37:54,616 --> 01:37:56,110
Who's calling?

1281
01:37:57,944 --> 01:37:59,886
It's Dr. Essex for you.

1282
01:38:01,847 --> 01:38:03,408
How are you?

1283
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:04,788
How's it going?

1284
01:38:04,983 --> 01:38:07,252
Everybody's wondering
when you're gonna publish.

1285
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,927
I had the cause of AIDS, but I...

1286
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:22,316
The thing is, it comes from
my family of viruses. That's definite.

1287
01:38:24,087 --> 01:38:27,121
I may have something else, too.
I've got three variants.

1288
01:38:27,352 --> 01:38:28,726
I can't analyze it yet...

1289
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:31,381
...in a way that I'd want to
put my name on it.

1290
01:38:31,448 --> 01:38:32,942
What do the French have?

1291
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:34,962
How do you know they have anything?

1292
01:38:35,128 --> 01:38:39,252
Don Francis sent them blind samples
to verify that theirs is the AIDS virus...

1293
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,514
...and they passed, almost 100 percent.

1294
01:38:43,383 --> 01:38:46,929
Don Francis from the CDC
sent the French samples?

1295
01:38:47,063 --> 01:38:48,110
The French?

1296
01:38:48,439 --> 01:38:49,781
Are you upset?

1297
01:38:50,168 --> 01:38:51,411
Upset?

1298
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:54,860
No, the French amuse me.

1299
01:38:57,304 --> 01:39:00,620
What I don't understand
is how somebody from my own side...

1300
01:39:00,759 --> 01:39:03,509
...somebody from the U. S...

1301
01:39:05,592 --> 01:39:09,454
Listen, I gotta run.
Let me call you back as soon as I can.

1302
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:11,728
Okay. Bye.

1303
01:39:16,023 --> 01:39:17,584
...all the interviews in LA.

1304
01:39:17,656 --> 01:39:22,031
Then, I bled 215 gay men at the
San Francisco Venereal Disease Clinic...

1305
01:39:22,168 --> 01:39:26,194
...and using the T... cell test, found that
65 percent of them were abnormal...

1306
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:29,169
...and had no idea they had it.

1307
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,476
- No symptoms whatsoever.
- No symptoms?

1308
01:39:31,928 --> 01:39:36,019
It's like all the plagues in the world's
history squeezed into this one. Worse.

1309
01:39:36,152 --> 01:39:37,777
If you take Bill's cluster study...

1310
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:41,076
...where sexual contact with one person
led to 40 people gettin' it...

1311
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:43,510
If each of those 40 give it to 40 others...

1312
01:39:43,671 --> 01:39:46,192
You've got people who don't know
they have the disease...

1313
01:39:46,295 --> 01:39:50,157
...givin' it to others who don't know
they have it for up to six years.

1314
01:39:53,944 --> 01:39:55,438
Can I talk to you alone.

1315
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:56,944
What is it?

1316
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:02,415
Gallo called. From now on, you can
expect practically no cooperation from him.

1317
01:40:02,488 --> 01:40:06,449
He's cut off your supply of reagents,
antibodies to the HTLV virus...

1318
01:40:06,616 --> 01:40:09,299
...almost everything you need to function.

1319
01:40:09,368 --> 01:40:10,710
Why?

1320
01:40:11,768 --> 01:40:14,735
Did you send blind samples to the French
to test their virus?

1321
01:40:14,999 --> 01:40:16,658
Yes, it's common courtesy.

1322
01:40:17,336 --> 01:40:18,994
Tell that to Gallo.

1323
01:40:54,136 --> 01:40:55,118
Hello.

1324
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:56,917
Dr. Francis?

1325
01:40:57,271 --> 01:40:58,286
Who's calling?

1326
01:40:59,064 --> 01:41:00,340
Dr. Gallo.

1327
01:41:04,055 --> 01:41:05,648
This is Dr. Francis.

1328
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:08,591
Congratulations.

1329
01:41:09,176 --> 01:41:10,353
On what?

1330
01:41:11,096 --> 01:41:13,616
For helping the French with the virus.

1331
01:41:14,967 --> 01:41:17,488
What makes you think
they didn't discover the virus?

1332
01:41:18,007 --> 01:41:20,047
What makes you think I care?

1333
01:41:21,623 --> 01:41:24,438
I don't understand the purpose of this call.

1334
01:41:25,623 --> 01:41:27,794
That's the purpose of this call.

1335
01:41:41,239 --> 01:41:42,352
My God.

1336
01:41:49,719 --> 01:41:50,996
It's open.

1337
01:42:39,064 --> 01:42:41,551
It is now the country's number one
health priority.

1338
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,972
Tonight's science correspondent
has the first of two pieces on AIDS.

1339
01:42:45,047 --> 01:42:48,146
In San Francisco, police and firemen
were issued masks to wear...

1340
01:42:48,216 --> 01:42:50,769
...in case they have to resuscitate
AIDS victims.

1341
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,135
In Coronado, California,
the city suspended first aid classes...

1342
01:42:54,199 --> 01:42:57,876
...because city employees feared catching
AIDS from the class mannequin.

1343
01:42:57,976 --> 01:43:01,554
In San Jose, two nurses quit
rather than treat AIDS patients.

1344
01:43:01,848 --> 01:43:04,815
In New York's prisons,
there have been several AIDS cases.

1345
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:07,702
The prison guards are demanding
special protective suits.

1346
01:43:07,768 --> 01:43:11,346
The city's funeral directors
are refusing to embalm AIDS victims.

1347
01:43:11,543 --> 01:43:15,438
I lost my job, my housing, I lost friends.

1348
01:43:15,639 --> 01:43:17,974
It's not carried on the air.

1349
01:43:18,136 --> 01:43:21,681
It's not like pneumonia.
That's the message we must get across.

1350
01:43:22,168 --> 01:43:26,128
If the numbers stay in the general area
that they are now...

1351
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:28,621
...I do not think this represents
a great problem.

1352
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,700
You need a lift?

1353
01:43:35,799 --> 01:43:37,294
How ya doin'?

1354
01:43:37,463 --> 01:43:41,555
Gallo says that he's found the virus
and he's got a blood test, too.

1355
01:43:41,655 --> 01:43:43,924
He has a blood test
or says he has a blood test?

1356
01:43:43,992 --> 01:43:46,709
He's got it! He's passed both tests.

1357
01:43:47,032 --> 01:43:49,236
- That's good news.
- It's not good news.

1358
01:43:49,367 --> 01:43:51,571
Because Gallo wants to take all the credit.

1359
01:43:51,703 --> 01:43:54,387
And he wants the patent for the NIH.

1360
01:43:54,487 --> 01:43:57,684
- If he does that the French'll sue.
- That's right. They'll sue.

1361
01:43:57,911 --> 01:44:01,260
So it'll probably take years
before anything gets done.

1362
01:44:02,199 --> 01:44:03,726
Drive carefully.

1363
01:44:04,695 --> 01:44:06,637
It's why we do what we do.

1364
01:44:08,471 --> 01:44:10,358
It's the gift of time...

1365
01:44:10,807 --> 01:44:15,248
...and the smile of healthy children.

1366
01:44:17,879 --> 01:44:19,919
That's what this means to me.

1367
01:44:27,415 --> 01:44:29,586
All I can say is, thank you.

1368
01:44:33,464 --> 01:44:35,187
Congratulations.

1369
01:44:40,119 --> 01:44:42,934
- You need to talk to me.
- I'm the needy one? Nice try.

1370
01:44:43,512 --> 01:44:45,584
The French had the virus
a year and half ago.

1371
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:47,630
- So?
- They can prove it.

1372
01:44:48,023 --> 01:44:50,390
- Me, too. Times ten.
- In court!

1373
01:44:50,775 --> 01:44:53,197
What do they pay you, the French?

1374
01:44:54,647 --> 01:44:57,462
The gift of time
and the smile of healthy children.

1375
01:44:57,591 --> 01:45:00,406
I've used that line 50 times
and I still believe it.

1376
01:45:00,471 --> 01:45:01,715
Who wrote it for you?

1377
01:45:01,783 --> 01:45:04,271
The French are claiming
they wrote it for me.

1378
01:45:04,407 --> 01:45:06,546
A year and a half ago, no less.

1379
01:45:07,576 --> 01:45:11,351
- Did you like my phone call?
- No, but I'm beginning to understand it.

1380
01:45:11,416 --> 01:45:13,204
If you understood, you wouldn't be here.

1381
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:17,232
We can play this with charm,
intimidation, or without the bullshit!

1382
01:45:17,303 --> 01:45:18,797
Explain one thing to me.

1383
01:45:19,096 --> 01:45:21,070
Ten times ten times ten...

1384
01:45:21,175 --> 01:45:24,491
...my name is in every book ever written
on the human retrovirus.

1385
01:45:24,567 --> 01:45:27,120
Why would you get in bed with the French
instead of me?

1386
01:45:27,224 --> 01:45:30,901
It's you against the French?
I thought we were all against the virus.

1387
01:45:30,968 --> 01:45:33,073
If you go to court now, everybody loses.

1388
01:45:33,143 --> 01:45:35,892
You, the people who die
while you quibble over credit...

1389
01:45:35,959 --> 01:45:37,137
What do you want?

1390
01:45:37,271 --> 01:45:40,817
To stop you from turnin' a holocaust
into an international pissing contest!

1391
01:45:40,887 --> 01:45:43,570
- By letting them take the credit?
- I talked to them.

1392
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:45,460
They're willing to settle in private.

1393
01:45:45,527 --> 01:45:49,389
We must get together. There can't be
confusion among scientists in the public.

1394
01:45:49,463 --> 01:45:54,252
If you go to court now when nobody's done
a goddamn thing to stop this epidemic...

1395
01:45:56,759 --> 01:45:58,483
Do what you want.

1396
01:45:59,383 --> 01:46:02,165
- I've said what I came to say.
- I'm going to Switzerland.

1397
01:46:02,231 --> 01:46:04,566
April 1, for a three... day conference.

1398
01:46:06,423 --> 01:46:09,293
I may, or I may not,
stop in Paris on my way back.

1399
01:46:09,431 --> 01:46:11,853
If I do, it'll be on one condition...

1400
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:14,931
...I meet only with my peers.

1401
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:19,182
Who besides God qualifies?

1402
01:46:41,911 --> 01:46:44,726
Twenty... five minutes
is quite long enough to wait.

1403
01:46:49,879 --> 01:46:51,668
Gentlemen. Francoise!

1404
01:46:53,815 --> 01:46:56,019
Good to see you. You look wonderful!

1405
01:46:57,112 --> 01:46:58,322
How are you?

1406
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:01,812
You lost some weight.
You look good, very good.

1407
01:47:03,736 --> 01:47:05,645
Good to see you again.

1408
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:17,068
I've got the comparative serology results,
the EMs...

1409
01:47:17,335 --> 01:47:20,750
...the gels for the different proteins,
GP... 120, 41, 24...

1410
01:47:20,823 --> 01:47:25,078
Why don't you wait out in the hall?
I'll call if I need you.

1411
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:29,390
What?

1412
01:47:29,463 --> 01:47:32,758
You don't think I'd discuss anything
with you in the room?

1413
01:47:39,639 --> 01:47:40,686
Fine.

1414
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,131
So you made some good progress?
We did, too.

1415
01:48:09,463 --> 01:48:10,870
Come in.

1416
01:48:22,231 --> 01:48:24,119
We've agreed to write three papers...

1417
01:48:24,183 --> 01:48:27,314
...which will be published
in the same issue of Science magazine.

1418
01:48:27,383 --> 01:48:29,652
The CDC will do the serology paper.

1419
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:32,916
Dr. Gallo will write the paper
analyzing nucleic acids.

1420
01:48:32,983 --> 01:48:35,503
We'll do the paper discussing the proteins.

1421
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:38,958
We've all agreed to make
a joint announcement together...

1422
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:40,752
...and share the credit.

1423
01:48:41,048 --> 01:48:43,436
We'll keep each other informed.

1424
01:48:48,376 --> 01:48:51,190
From the first day that AIDS
was identified...

1425
01:48:51,767 --> 01:48:53,141
...in 1981.

1426
01:48:53,751 --> 01:48:57,133
HHS scientists and their medical allies...

1427
01:48:57,495 --> 01:49:01,903
...have never stopped searching
for the answer to the mystery of AIDS.

1428
01:49:02,615 --> 01:49:05,844
And not only have we found the cause
to AIDS...

1429
01:49:06,007 --> 01:49:08,146
Didn't she have her teeth done?

1430
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,198
...a blood test will be available.

1431
01:49:11,607 --> 01:49:15,731
The man who discovered the virus...

1432
01:49:16,375 --> 01:49:20,466
...which causes AIDS, excuse me...

1433
01:49:20,727 --> 01:49:24,720
...is our eminent Dr. Robert Gallo.

1434
01:49:29,527 --> 01:49:32,113
Thank you, Secretary Heckler.

1435
01:49:33,463 --> 01:49:37,260
I should start and be brief by saying that...

1436
01:49:37,431 --> 01:49:40,530
...there are obviously
other major contributors.

1437
01:49:41,111 --> 01:49:44,853
In our own group,
I have to mention someone...

1438
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:50,132
...who came to us from Czechoslovakia,
Dr. Mika Popovic.

1439
01:49:50,615 --> 01:49:53,812
A lot of this couldn't have been done
without the previous support...

1440
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:58,385
...from the Cancer Institute
on the earlier HTLV isolates.

1441
01:49:59,063 --> 01:50:01,877
I've seen discussions
about the work in Paris.

1442
01:50:02,935 --> 01:50:06,961
There was, there is not,
there never has been...

1443
01:50:07,959 --> 01:50:11,701
...fights or controversies between us
and the group in France.

1444
01:50:11,863 --> 01:50:15,824
I came back from a meeting
astonished to see this kind of discussion.

1445
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:19,125
The laboratory at the Pasteur Institute
and my laboratory...

1446
01:50:19,223 --> 01:50:21,262
...have been friends for about 15 years.

1447
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:22,925
We are in fact collaborating.

1448
01:50:24,055 --> 01:50:25,549
I can't watch.

1449
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:32,177
Phase One is finished. We've found
the virus, we're working on a blood test.

1450
01:50:32,503 --> 01:50:34,838
This is my proposal for Phase Two:

1451
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:37,715
Prevention, education and cure.

1452
01:50:38,263 --> 01:50:39,757
If that goes through...

1453
01:50:39,895 --> 01:50:43,953
...I wanna be transferred to San Francisco
and work on it from there.

1454
01:50:45,335 --> 01:50:48,085
$37 million a year?

1455
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,644
- That's totally unrealistic.
- It's not.

1456
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:52,113
It's cheap.

1457
01:50:52,247 --> 01:50:56,076
It's about 15 cents per person
to make the entire population safer.

1458
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:59,244
- It's what's needed.
- I'm sure it is, but you won't get it.

1459
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:01,905
If you ask for this much, you'll get nothing.

1460
01:51:01,975 --> 01:51:04,942
- Try to re... figure for $4 million...
- I won't re... figure it.

1461
01:51:05,015 --> 01:51:07,535
It's an honest report.
I want you to send it in.

1462
01:51:07,607 --> 01:51:10,738
I'm tryin' to tell you
you're going about this the wrong way.

1463
01:51:10,807 --> 01:51:15,542
It's cheap. Wait a few years, and we'll
be talking about billions in health care.

1464
01:51:21,783 --> 01:51:23,309
I'll send it in.

1465
01:51:24,215 --> 01:51:27,346
Four more years.

1466
01:51:28,663 --> 01:51:29,611
Thank you.

1467
01:51:30,135 --> 01:51:32,207
Thank you all very much.

1468
01:51:37,143 --> 01:51:39,728
It seems we did this four years ago.

1469
01:51:43,702 --> 01:51:47,477
Nancy and I would like to express...

1470
01:51:49,975 --> 01:51:51,501
Nancy!

1471
01:51:52,695 --> 01:51:55,892
This is not a political issue,
this is a health issue.

1472
01:51:56,087 --> 01:51:58,737
This is not a gay issue,
this is a human issue.

1473
01:51:58,807 --> 01:52:02,452
Had this disease afflicted children or
members of the Chamber of Commerce...

1474
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:05,616
...the Reagan administration
would've broken down all doors...

1475
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:08,818
...in order to push the government
on all fronts to deal with it.

1476
01:52:09,079 --> 01:52:12,592
I came here today in the hope
that my epitaph would not read:

1477
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:14,834
"I died of red tape."

1478
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:16,591
Four more years!

1479
01:53:21,047 --> 01:53:23,632
Can I get a coffee and a jelly donut?

1480
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:33,809
Are you coming from work
or going to work?

1481
01:53:34,135 --> 01:53:35,411
Going to.

1482
01:53:36,055 --> 01:53:37,070
You?

1483
01:53:38,679 --> 01:53:40,239
I couldn't sleep.

1484
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:45,518
I heard your Phase Two proposal
was turned down.

1485
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:48,214
Officially, "too expensive."

1486
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:51,060
Unofficially,
and they say this diplomatically:

1487
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:54,101
"You should look busy and do nothing."

1488
01:53:57,046 --> 01:53:59,861
Was that meant to be diplomatic,
how you just told me?

1489
01:54:00,759 --> 01:54:02,995
It was meant to sound angry.

1490
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:05,197
At me or at you?

1491
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:06,892
At me?

1492
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:08,849
Why me?

1493
01:54:09,655 --> 01:54:13,299
I don't know. I guess, both. All right?

1494
01:54:14,519 --> 01:54:16,974
Sometimes I look at you
in awe and wonder.

1495
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:19,154
I mean it.

1496
01:54:19,415 --> 01:54:22,579
How you wind your way through
bureaucratic bullshit every day...

1497
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:24,272
...and never get a drop on you.

1498
01:54:24,343 --> 01:54:27,245
- How do you do it?
- By not asking questions like that.

1499
01:54:27,383 --> 01:54:29,390
Insult me if you like, directly...

1500
01:54:29,495 --> 01:54:33,106
...but don't insult both of us by disguising
this as some kind of compliment.

1501
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:35,636
Insult you? How?

1502
01:54:36,183 --> 01:54:38,517
The awe and the wonder? I mean it.

1503
01:54:42,487 --> 01:54:45,105
I asked the Second Floor for a transfer.

1504
01:54:46,262 --> 01:54:48,237
Can you help push it through?

1505
01:54:48,407 --> 01:54:50,414
I already have. It's done.

1506
01:54:52,503 --> 01:54:55,088
Really? Where to?

1507
01:54:56,247 --> 01:54:59,542
- How do you want this, diplomatically?
- I've gotten used to angry.

1508
01:54:59,639 --> 01:55:00,784
San Francisco.

1509
01:55:01,847 --> 01:55:03,374
Reward or exile?

1510
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:12,979
If you hate it, why spend your entire career
working for the government?

1511
01:55:16,886 --> 01:55:20,596
Remember what Willie Sutton said when
they asked him why he robbed banks?

1512
01:55:20,662 --> 01:55:23,859
"Because that's where the money is."
This is where the diseases are.

1513
01:55:25,303 --> 01:55:26,645
Bugs.

1514
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:35,662
Sometimes I look at you
with awe and wonder.

1515
01:56:00,919 --> 01:56:02,446
There it is.

1516
01:56:03,255 --> 01:56:05,644
A little cake for the maverick among us.

1517
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:08,239
Something the boys
in the retroviral lab whipped up.

1518
01:56:16,054 --> 01:56:19,666
Excuse me, can I speak to you alone
for a second, please?

1519
01:56:25,079 --> 01:56:26,453
You might need this.

1520
01:56:29,367 --> 01:56:31,374
That's great, they're rose... colored.

1521
01:56:32,214 --> 01:56:34,451
- Definitely you.
- Well done.

1522
01:56:34,902 --> 01:56:36,212
Looks good.

1523
01:56:39,190 --> 01:56:41,841
- To Don Francis.
- Long may he live.

1524
01:56:42,615 --> 01:56:44,655
- Speech!
- Say something.

1525
01:56:50,423 --> 01:56:53,106
I got a call from
our Washington lawyer.

1526
01:56:53,655 --> 01:56:55,564
Gallo got the patent
for the blood test.

1527
01:56:56,183 --> 01:56:59,565
Even though we applied five months
before him.

1528
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:04,304
Here's Gallo's virus which is
almost identical to ours.

1529
01:57:04,854 --> 01:57:06,032
Look at the photo.

1530
01:57:06,295 --> 01:57:09,873
It's a picture of our virus LAV,
which he calls his virus...

1531
01:57:10,102 --> 01:57:12,012
...and names it HTLVIII.

1532
01:57:13,335 --> 01:57:18,998
The only way to compare one virus
to another is by DNA.

1533
01:57:23,446 --> 01:57:29,873
Put together a team to break
the genetic code of both viruses.

1534
01:57:31,286 --> 01:57:33,010
This time he's gone too far.

1535
01:57:41,303 --> 01:57:44,881
The genes of any two different isolates
of the same virus...

1536
01:57:45,303 --> 01:57:49,743
...are expected to deviate from each other,
usually by 6 to 20 percent.

1537
01:57:50,167 --> 01:57:56,462
The genetic sequence
of Dr. Gallo's HTLVIII prototype isolate...

1538
01:57:56,919 --> 01:58:01,109
...varies from our virus, called LAV...

1539
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:03,221
...by less than 1 percent.

1540
01:58:03,703 --> 01:58:06,998
They are identical to a degree that would
not be anticipated...

1541
01:58:07,062 --> 01:58:10,478
...from any two isolates
from the same family.

1542
01:58:12,183 --> 01:58:13,459
Thank you.

1543
01:58:13,591 --> 01:58:16,241
Are you suggesting that Gallo
stole it from the French?

1544
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:20,275
I think that question would
best be answered by someone else.

1545
01:58:25,975 --> 01:58:28,909
Excuse me,
I'm not quite sure what he was saying.

1546
01:58:29,527 --> 01:58:33,455
The virus Gallo has
is the same kind the French have?

1547
01:58:33,942 --> 01:58:38,798
Not the same kind. It's the same virus
exactly, from the same patient.

1548
01:59:02,742 --> 01:59:03,953
You okay?

1549
01:59:06,359 --> 01:59:07,569
Sit down.

1550
01:59:15,895 --> 01:59:17,902
Should I call an ambulance?

1551
01:59:20,407 --> 01:59:22,000
Stay there.

1552
01:59:52,918 --> 01:59:54,325
I just heard.

1553
01:59:55,415 --> 01:59:56,756
Let's go up.

1554
02:00:12,374 --> 02:00:14,065
Hello.

1555
02:00:16,918 --> 02:00:18,260
This is Don.

1556
02:00:19,798 --> 02:00:21,359
Nice to meet you.

1557
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:24,368
Look who's here.

1558
02:00:24,663 --> 02:00:26,004
Is that Don?

1559
02:00:27,478 --> 02:00:29,005
There's two of you.

1560
02:00:30,423 --> 02:00:33,357
We're both Don,
don't ask me which is which.

1561
02:00:40,214 --> 02:00:44,273
One moment he's talking perfectly
coherently, the next he's talking gibberish.

1562
02:00:45,878 --> 02:00:49,588
I'm gonna take Kico for a cup of coffee.
You wanna join us?

1563
02:00:50,999 --> 02:00:53,868
- No, I think...
- I'll be back in a minute.

1564
02:01:58,518 --> 02:02:01,584
Would you hand me my...

1565
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:09,488
Glasses?

1566
02:02:20,502 --> 02:02:22,324
Am I talking gibberish?

1567
02:02:23,222 --> 02:02:25,109
No, not to me.

1568
02:02:34,167 --> 02:02:36,174
This didn't have to happen.

1569
02:02:38,198 --> 02:02:40,020
We could've stopped it.

1570
02:02:41,495 --> 02:02:43,021
Can you still?

1571
02:02:45,462 --> 02:02:47,349
Can we still stop it?

1572
02:02:48,438 --> 02:02:49,845
I don't know.

1573
02:02:53,302 --> 02:02:57,044
I used to be afraid of dying.

1574
02:02:59,542 --> 02:03:01,233
I'm not anymore.

1575
02:03:02,615 --> 02:03:05,778
I'm more afraid of what happens...

1576
02:03:08,086 --> 02:03:10,606
...to the people who live.

1577
02:15:40,932 --> 02:15:42,494
{{{the end}}}
