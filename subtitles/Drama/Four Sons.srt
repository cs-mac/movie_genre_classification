<i>Meet needs to
be on neutral ground.</i>

3
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:06,618
<i>There's an Indian
reservation ten minutes</i>

4
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:07,341
<i>from here.</i>

5
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:08,187
<i>Very private.</i>

00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:10,556
<i>Juan Carlos just
locked down our Irish cartel</i>

8
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:12,928
<i>Where are the letters?</i>

9
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>Tara's still got 'em?</i>

10
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,019
<i>Just leave her out of it, huh?</i>

11
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:17,168
<i>Too late.</i>

12
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,848
<i>We have an internal threat.</i>

13
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:20,818
<i>The doctor.</i>

<i>We'll clean it up.</i>

16
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:25,235
<i>What?! Oh, my God!</i>

17
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:26,947
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

18
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:30,324
<i>Jax!</i>

19
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,562
<i>You'll be okay.</i>

23
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:43,150
<i>Clay killed your old man.</i>

24
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,837
<i>Clay's got to go, son.</i>

25
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:48,558
<i>Want to tell me
what happened to Piney?</i>

26
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:51,272
<i>You should know,
you're Clay's boy.</i>

27
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:53,360
<i>Clay killed my old man!</i>

28
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,864
<i>Did you know?!</i>

29
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,048
<i>No, Ope!</i>

30
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,764
<i>You're gonna die at the gavel.</i>

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,477
<i>Ope!</i>

32
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:07,466
<i>Put it down.</i>

33
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:13,892
<i>Please, Ope...
don't make me kill you.</i>

34
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:44,784
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

35
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:51,780
<i>I heard shots!</i>

36
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:57,290
Oh, shit.

37
00:01:58,835 --> 00:01:59,567
<i>What happen?</i>

38
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:00,456
<i>Call an ambulance.</i>

39
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:01,168
<i>Oh, Christ!</i>

40
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,916
<i>Call an ambulance now!</i>

41
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:05,379
<i>Gunshots.
Sheriff's gonna be all over this!</i>

42
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:07,889
<i>Get me outside.</i>

43
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,136
<i>It happened in the garage.</i>

44
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:12,923
<i>Yeah. Come on. Come on!</i>

45
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:16,024
<i>On three. Two, three!</i>

46
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:19,552
<i>What do I tell Roosevelt, huh?
Mexicans?</i>

47
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,617
<i>No, say it was black.</i>

48
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:23,134
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

49
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:26,401
<i>Hey, I'll take care of Opie!</i>

50
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,695
<i>Get rid of those guns and
clean up the blood!</i>

51
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:31,457
<i>I'm getting real good at that.</i>

52
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,311
<i>He was shot by
two black guys outside</i>

53
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:34,260
<i>the garage.</i>

54
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,200
<i>You ever want to make patch,
that's your story until</i>

55
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,510
<i>I tell you otherwise.</i>

56
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:38,458
<i>I get it.</i>

57
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,483
<i>Keep it wrapped.</i>

58
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,349
<i>Get out of here.</i>

59
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:19,326
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ.</i>

60
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,583
<i>You think he's gonna make it?</i>

61
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,793
<i>I don't know.</i>

62
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:25,271
<i>Hey, you should get out
of here, too. Go.</i>

63
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:26,423
<i>Yeah.</i>

64
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,475
<i>I'm gonna kill him.</i>

65
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:18,213
<i>No, you're gonna let
me find out what the hell happened.</i>

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,735
<i>Talk to your mother.</i>

67
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,649
<i>Gemma and Unser found my
old man up at the cabin.</i>

68
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:26,357
<i>They knew Clay killed him.</i>

69
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,799
<i>Tried to pass it off
as a cartel hit.</i>

70
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,831
<i>How do you know all that?</i>

71
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,296
<i>Unser followed
me up there last night.</i>

72
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,704
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

73
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:45,155
<i>I'm gonna drop you at the
emergency care off of Crane.</i>

74
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>- Lyla'll pick you up?</i>
- Yeah, man.

75
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:52,290
<i>You've got to lay low, Ope.</i>

76
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,863
<i>I'll tell the guys
you're up at the cabin.</i>

77
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:59,300
<i>I will find the
truth, I promise.</i>

78
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:06,445
<i>Just what I need...
another promise.</i>

79
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,890
<i>- What's his blood pressure?</i>
<i>- Uh, 80/60.</i>

80
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:22,492
<i>- How much fluid has he had?</i>
<i>- Uh, two liters.</i>

81
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:24,697
<i>- Both lines in?</i>
<i>- Both lines in, Doctor.</i>

82
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:26,985
<i>- Okay. Call the O.R.?</i>
<i>- Right away, Doctor.</i>

83
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:36,026
<i>I was headed over to</i>
<i>get a new starter for my truck.</i>

84
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:39,810
<i>I roll up to the gate, see
a black SUV speeding out.</i>

85
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:40,324
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

86
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:41,859
<i>A Yukon, I think.</i>

87
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:44,568
<i>Looked like two
African-American males.</i>

88
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,362
<i>Uh, tinted windows.</i>

89
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,086
<i>Didn't get a real good look.</i>

90
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:48,850
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

91
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:50,156
<i>Uh... pulled in the</i>

92
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,030
<i>lot, find Clay laying there.</i>

93
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,575
<i>Did he say anything?</i>

94
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,158
<i>About the shooters.</i>

95
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,421
<i>No, he was...
barely conscious.</i>

96
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,257
<i>I called EMS.</i>

97
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,072
<i>And there was
no one else on the lot?</i>

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,492
<i>No.
We'd split an hour or so before.</i>

99
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:11,131
<i>So Clay was by himself?</i>

100
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:12,403
<i>Yeah.</i>

101
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,622
<i>He was keeping the
garage open late for me.</i>

102
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,805
<i>Yeah?
And what about security cameras?</i>

103
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,239
<i>They don't record.</i>

104
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,897
<i>Of course they don't.</i>

105
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,252
<i>All right, I want to speak to
Clay when he's conscious.</i>

106
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:30,982
<i>The rest of you, just...
stay available.</i>

107
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:34,395
<i>Hey.</i>

108
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:37,372
<i>So they were black Niners?</i>

109
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:38,663
<i>Had to be.</i>

110
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:40,191
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

111
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,940
<i>I didn't see colors.</i>

112
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,577
<i>Hey, Gemma.</i>

113
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:51,730
<i>This is on me.</i>

114
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,961
<i>Nah, nah, nah, Clay
wanted me to stay.</i>

115
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,037
<i>He had a feeling something
was going down.</i>

116
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,446
<i>We don't know
anything yet, Tiggy, okay?</i>

117
00:06:58,514 --> 00:06:59,758
<i>I do, I do, I do.</i>

118
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,356
<i>A brother asked for help...
I turned my back.</i>

119
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,401
<i>Hey.</i>

120
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:04,615
<i>Hey.</i>

121
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:10,262
<i>How bad is it?</i>

122
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:13,048
<i>Doc said he's critical.</i>

123
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:16,005
<i>One of the bullets hit a lung.</i>

124
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:22,775
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>

125
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,286
<i>I'm his wife.</i>

126
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,570
<i>We're prepping him for surgery.</i>

127
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,362
<i>Follow me and I can
bring you up to speed.</i>

128
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,993
<i>That's okay.</i>

129
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,034

Lieutenant Roosevelt,
thank you for joining us.

142
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:26,553
The Wahewa land is proving to be
a bit of a logistical challenge.

143
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,943
You know Clay
Morrow was shot last night.

144
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,276
Yes, I know.

145
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,270
Black retaliation, yes?

146
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,952
He's in critical condition.

147
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,402
We got two other key
members in lockdown.

148
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,308
Do you really think this
meet is gonna happen?

149
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,178
The Irish are here.

150
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,476
The cartel.

151
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,249
They all have a lot to lose if
they let this opportunity pass.

152
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:50,359
My guess is...
Teller takes the reins.

153
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:52,369
Either way we
have to play this out.

154
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,549
That means you don't get Clay.

155
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:58,617
It appears someone else
is determined to right that wrong.

156
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,066
Rough night?

157
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:43,080
Clay got shot.

158
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,806
He's in critical condition at St. Thomas.

159
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,546
Hm. Who did it?

160
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:51,895
I'm not sure.

161
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:57,046
I'm still getting out, Tara.

162
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,946
Deal with the Irish
goes down today.

163
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,491
And then what?

164
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,896
Then I put my goddamn
family in a car and we drive the

165
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,032
hell out of Charming.

166
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:08,056
Just like that, Jax?

167
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:13,678
- Change your clothes, wash off the blood...
- Yeah, Tara,

168
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:14,997
just like that.

169
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,646
Look...
I know it's not gonna be an easy

170
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:29,317
shift-- I'm not delusional-- but
I also know you're not clear

171
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,605
right now.

172
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,774
I'd argue...
I'm the clearest I've ever been.

173
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:38,406
Trust me, babe...
rage feels that way.

174
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:43,481
Have Phil and Elyda
help you pack.

175
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,019
I'll be back tonight.

176
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:47,554
Yeah.

177
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,854
Okay.

178
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,898
Jax.

179
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:03,498
Tell me you love me.

180
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,491
I love you, Tara.

181
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,725
Do you love me?

182
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,708
If I could stop I would.

183
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,558
I love you, Jackson.

184
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:04,157
You need a bigger bowl?

185
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:07,512
I like cereal.

186
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,290
Stay close to Tara.

187
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:12,401
She's going to need
your help today.

188
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:13,924
Absolutely, man.

189
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:17,042
And if you see Gemma,
tell her I'm looking for her.

190
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:18,361
Okay.

191
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,075
Hey.

192
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,014
How's he doing?

193
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,494
They've gone back into surgery.

194
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,048
Having a problem with his lung.

195
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,783
Goddamn cigars.

196
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,402
Shit.

197
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:41,231
Any word from Bobby or Juice?

198
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,688
Nothing on Juice.

199
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:49,278
Hopefully he's off on
one of his joyrides.

200
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,906
We have bigger problems.

201
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:53,526
I talked to Lowen.

202
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,147
Bobby signed in at Stockton
and didn't sign out.

203
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:58,761
What the hell does that mean?

204
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,406
Maybe Lenny can tell us.

205
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,580
He wants a sit-down
with you today.

206
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,861
Lowen said he's pretty
jacked up about it.

207
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,953
Oh, my God.

208
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,189
Okay.

209
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:11,076
Ope and Tig are MIA, too.

210
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,843
Ope's at the cabin
checking on Piney.

211
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:16,722
Tig's so wound up about this
Clay thing he's probably neck

212
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,779
deep in cold pussy.

213
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:22,574
All right, I'm going
to go to Stockton.

214
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,895
Keep me in the loop.

215
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,657
Hey, you be careful, yeah?

216
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,539
Where is she?

217
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:26,885
Bedroom.

218
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,681
Jax is looking for you.

219
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:32,457
It sounded important.

220
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,117
Another vacation?

221
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:45,175
Yep. 'Cause the first
one went <i>so</i> well.

222
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,100
Clay was shot last night.

223
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,672
I know.

224
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,763
By Opie.

225
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,821
What?

226
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:13,978
Why would Opie do that?

227
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,581
Because Clay killed his father.

228
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,754
Piney's dead.

229
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,558
Clay put a shotgun to his chest.

230
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,564
Oh, my God.

231
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:33,661
He killed him because
he thinks he had the letters.

232
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,409
No.

233
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:39,981
Piney didn't...
he never even saw them.

234
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:40,956
I know.

235
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:44,187
But Clay will do anything to stop
that truth from leaking out.

236
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,564
He's the one that tried
to have you killed, Tara.

237
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,233
Clay hired those men
that came after you.

238
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,588
How do you know that?

239
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,389
He took money out
of our safe to pay 'em off.

240
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:05,127
I confronted him.

241
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,673
That's why he did this.

242
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:16,209
Clay... will keep on hurting
everything and everyone that

243
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:22,605
gets in his path...
until he gets those letters.

244
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,983
He threatened me yesterday.

245
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:30,172
Told me Jax and I would never
make it out of Charming unless I

246
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,825
gave them to him.

247
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,490
'Cause he's already read 'em.

248
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:34,983
The copies.

249
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,247
He knows how dangerous they are.

250
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,241
Where are the letters, Tara?

251
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,275
I'll give them to Clay;

252
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,951
we put this to bed.

253
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,521
I'm out of options.

254
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,846
This may be the only way
we get out of this alive.

255
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:02,450
And if we do
that-- get out of this alive--

256
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,648
then you know Jax
and I are leaving.

257
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,972
I know.

258
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,038
They're in the storage unit.

259
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:31,286
Towards the back, underneath
a stack of boxes.

260
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:33,871
Old TM receipts.

261
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:42,207
Okay.

262
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,043
Gemma.

263
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,135
Tell me you love me.

264
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,406
I love you.

265
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,023
When did you get visitation?

266
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:13,919
That's what I
need to talk to you about.

267
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,880
Otto made some kind of deal.

268
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,529
What are you talking about?

269
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,655
I heard it from the guards.

270
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:25,001
He met with a Fed attorney, gave
up something, got me visitation

271
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,729
and yard time.

272
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:29,349
Shit.

273
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,383
Bobby visited Otto yesterday.

274
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,272
Never signed out.

275
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:36,633
Juice is MIA, too.

276
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:39,441
Why the hell would Otto flip?

277
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,222
Had to be something
to do with Luann.

278
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:48,740
Uh, talk to Clay,
let me know what I should do.

279
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,571
Yeah, all right.

280
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,569
Hey... thanks, Lenny.

281
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:17,678
Come on, come on, come on.

282
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,059
Come on.

283
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:43,362
Oh, shit! Look out!

284
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:53,831
V!

285
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,340
Just be there,
just be there, all right?

286
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,073
I'm heading out of Oakland
on the 5-80, all right?

287
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:23,148
They got him at the
garage, hit him twice.

288
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:24,685
Do they know
who was responsible?

289
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,360
Not yet.

290
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,722
Could be all the shit we
stirred up in Oakland.

291
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:30,902
Well, we're sorry
about what happened to Clay.

292
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,272
But how do we handle today?

293
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:34,211
I can run the exchange
with the Kings, but we may have

294
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:35,743
a bigger problem.

295
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,735
I just heard from one
of my guys in Stockton.

296
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,440
We got a member inside
who may have flipped.

297
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,807
Otto Delaney.

298
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,592
He's been talking to the U.S. attorney.

299
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:45,776
Does Otto know about us?

300
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:48,006
No, but he might have
given up another member.

301
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:50,959
It means the Feds
could be circling us.

302
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:53,231
Too big of a risk for today.

303
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,738
We've got contacts
that can find out about Otto.

304
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,631
Don't do anything till
you hear from us.

305
00:23:58,398 --> 00:23:59,557
Yeah, okay.

306
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:01,672
All right.

307
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:05,142
Call Medina.

308
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,266
Have him vet out every agency.

309
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,847
Find out what the
hell this is about.

310
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:15,751
Yeah.

311
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,993
Tig's in trouble, brother.

312
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,186
Needs an escort home.

313
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:20,754
Oaktown.

314
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:22,218
Shit!

315
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:32,573
♪ ♪

316
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,417
Drive, idiot.

317
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:20,579
Come on, boys.

318
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,242
Go.

319
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:29,783
Do not lose 'em!

320
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:33,731
Go!

321
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:37,869
Goddamn it!

322
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:50,011
What the hell's going on?

323
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:52,867
Go. Go ahead!

324
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:56,515
Chibs, stay with Tig,
we'll block him off!

325
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,411
Let's go, bro!

326
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:26,632
Damn it!

327
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:23,882
What happened?

328
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:25,316
I went after Laroy, man.

329
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:27,328
What tel hell
is the matter with you?

330
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,378
Hey, we don't even
know if it was the Niners.

331
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:31,518
Come on, man.

332
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:32,735
Come on.

333
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:36,776
The way we backed Alvarez in
Oakland, it had to be Laroy that

334
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:38,504
gunned down Clay.

335
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,152
It is a club call, not yours.

336
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,999
You're gonna start a
goddamn war, man.

337
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,030
I don't give a shit.

338
00:27:45,114 --> 00:27:45,981
Yeah, obviously.

339
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:47,258
Hey, Jax.

340
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:48,185
Rat just called.

341
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,095
Clay's out of surgery.

342
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:50,527
I'm gonna go see him.

343
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:54,597
Hey.

344
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,939
No more rogue shit.

345
00:27:57,095 --> 00:27:58,235
Do you hear me?

346
00:27:58,815 --> 00:27:59,859
Yeah.

347
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,266
He's right.

348
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,689
Had to be Laroy.

349
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:12,084
He's got to die.

350
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,333
Like, a lot.

351
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:20,887
It's Romeo.

352
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,610
Yeah.

353
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:25,941
Had my contacts
look into Otto Delaney.

354
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:30,103
Not sure who he was talking to,
but he never sold out your club.

355
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:31,321
You sure?

356
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,053
My guy got it from inside.

357
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,691
I pay a lot of
money for information, Jax.

358
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,076
It's accurate.

359
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:41,775
Trust me, if I thought it was a risk,
I wouldn't be making this call.

360
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:43,661
I'll see you at 3:00.

361
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:46,105
Yeah.

362
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:47,163
Okay.

363
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,800
We're a go.

364
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,884
Head up to the
warehouse with Tacoma.

365
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:53,306
Pull one of each big gun.

366
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:54,501
We'll need 'em for the meet.

367
00:28:54,592 --> 00:28:55,926
Thanks.

368
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,486
Track down Lowen.

369
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,387
Have her start making calls.

370
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,587
I'm starting to get really
worried about Juice and Bobby.

371
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,133
Aye.
Um, don't worry.

372
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,334
- We'll-We'll find them.
- All right.

373
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:13,882
I'm gonna dig into Clay's
scheduling info, get up to speed

374
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,202
for the Irish.

375
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,056
Sorry, brother.

376
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:05,356
I should have stayed.

377
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,780
Had your back.

378
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:15,578
I mean, just turning in this SA
tag-- I don't know, man--

379
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:22,454
was just kind of lost in
this cartel shit.

380
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:27,787
I love you, Clay.

381
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:30,369
I do.

382
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:36,010
I guess I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head around you

383
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,960
stepping down.

384
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:41,332
I don't know...
I don't know what I'm gonna look

385
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:43,296
like when that
happens, you know?

386
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,068
This is not your fault, baby.

387
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,205
Oh, honey.

388
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:57,764
It's okay, sweetheart.

389
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,019
It's okay.

390
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:02,432
Oh.

391
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,275
He knows you love him.

392
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,065
It's okay, really.

393
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:11,758
Yeah.

394
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,010
Thanks.

395
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,045
Ah, shit.

396
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,170
Shit. How are you?

397
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,448
I'm fine.

398
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:22,251
Where's Jax?

399
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:24,459
Oh, he's at the clubhouse.

400
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,665
Uh... give me a minute, yeah?

401
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,010
Okay.

402
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:44,252
Sorry.

403
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:57,494
I've been looking for you.

404
00:31:58,518 --> 00:31:59,900
Shut the door.

405
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,035
What happened to Piney?

406
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:27,923
Clay killed him.

407
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:33,475
Look, I know Clay and
Piney were beefing over this

408
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:36,299
- cartel shit...
- It wasn't over the cartel.

409
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:41,034
It was over these.

410
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,359
Maureen Ashby put them in your
bag before you left Belfast.

411
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,585
They're letters
from your father.

412
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:01,752
Tara found them before you did.

413
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:06,201
Tara had these?

414
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,398
Why didn't she tell me?

415
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,783
She knew they
would break your heart.

416
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:17,230
Same way they did mine.

417
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:28,379
When Thomas got sick, your dad
stopped going to Belfast...

418
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:32,459
started writing to Maureen.

419
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,773
What does this
have to do with Clay?

420
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:43,625
JT and Kellan decided
to get the MC out of guns, away

421
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:45,568
from the IRA.

422
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:49,266
Clay thought it was a mistake.

423
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,234
He was afraid John would
destroy the club.

424
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:58,306
So he decided to kill him.

425
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:07,175
The first time... he sent John
into a Mayan ambush, unprotected.

426
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,878
Your dad made it out.

427
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:14,861
But he knew it was
Clay who'd set it up.

428
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:18,330
And he knew Clay
would try again.

429
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,380
He predicted it would
be mechanical.

430
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:26,558
He was right.

431
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:29,551
The accident.

432
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:39,760
The only person JT ever
let work on his bike was Lowell Sr.

433
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,963
Clay must have...
paid him off or threatened him.

434
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:50,753
He had to be the one who
sabotaged the Panhead.

435
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:54,235
Lowell Sr.
was killed by the Mayans a week later.

436
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:55,910
Yeah.

437
00:34:57,622 --> 00:35:00,137
Clay buried the secret.

438
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,709
How do you know all this?

439
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,695
The letters.

440
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,574
The speculation.

441
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:18,266
The Mayan ambush.

442
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,726
John knew Clay would kill him.

443
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,833
And Clay knew those
letters would prove it.

444
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:29,394
Enough to get him voted out,
undo everything he'd worked for.

445
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,820
Piney got ahold of these.

446
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:38,559
He must have threatened Clay.

447
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:42,166
Oh, my God.

448
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,891
That's not all.

449
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:56,124
I found the cover letter Maureen
wrote telling you to read them.

450
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,478
It was in your house.

451
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:01,822
I knew Tara was the
one who'd found them.

452
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:05,303
I... I panicked.

453
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:07,014
I told Clay.

454
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:15,532
Clay knew...
that Tara had these?

455
00:36:17,606 --> 00:36:19,934
He tried to kill Tara.

456
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,935
That thing that happened in the
park, that wasn't the cartel.

457
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:32,340
That was guys Clay hired
to kill your wife, Jax.

458
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:36,877
How did you get them?

459
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:38,596
Tara gave them to me.

460
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:43,650
Don't be upset with her.

461
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,221
She didn't want
you to read them.

462
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,819
She didn't know
what you might do.

463
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:55,614
Why are you
telling me this, Mom?

464
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,451
Why now?

465
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:08,585
Because I know how
dangerous secrets can be.

466
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:14,140
And it's time we all
knew the truth.

467
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:22,887
Clay Morrow killed your father.

468
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:27,584
Stole that seat away
from this family.

469
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:33,949
Gunned down your
father's best friend.

470
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:38,318
And he tried to kill your wife.

471
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:44,708
He's a murderous traitor.

472
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:49,755
And there's only one thing
to do now, Jackson.

473
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:56,223
For your father, your
family and your club.

474
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,985
It's in you.

475
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:08,316
It's who you are.

476
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:13,812
Clay has to die.

477
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:27,634
Read 'em.

478
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:31,739
See him in your
father's own hand.

479
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:38,877
And then you kill him, Jax.

480
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:45,552
You kill Clay before he's on
his feet and strikes first.

481
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:50,527
And when it's done...
you take your place at the head

482
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:56,626
of this table...
where a Teller belongs.

483
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,048
Where you belong.

484
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:07,783
Clay came through the surgery.

485
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,469
Lung's okay.

486
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:12,958
Should be out of intensive
care in a few days.

487
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:18,679
Good.

488
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:25,233
So...
what happens now?

489
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:26,907
Things are in motion.

490
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:28,200
Yeah.

491
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,096
I have no doubt.

492
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:34,555
But maybe you want to tell
me what the hell that means?

493
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,563
Tara gave me the letters.

494
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:45,344
Jax is reading them.

495
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:47,399
Oh, Christ!

496
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:49,860
Not all of them.

497
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:51,455
We're protected.

498
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:57,155
Clay... not so much.

499
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:01,613
Got a minute?

500
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:07,587
Uh, yeah, I'll...
go give Chucky a hand.

501
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,029
Doc.

502
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:16,689
I been waiting for you.

503
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:20,181
Yeah, I know.

504
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,016
Where are the letters?

505
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:25,607
Did you bring them to Clay?

506
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,524
No.

507
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,537
How many did you take
out before you gave them to Jax?

508
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:48,169
If you knew...
why'd you tell me where they were?

509
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,504
Because I'm smarter
than you are, Gemma...

510
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:54,529
and I know Jax
better than you do.

511
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,904
You should have told me.

512
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,727
I was going to.

513
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,309
When you got out, you were
so eager to leave, I just...

514
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,638
I was afraid it would push you back in.
I'm sorry.

515
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:31,383
I have to kill him, Tara.

516
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:35,109
I know.

517
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,802
And this is how you do it.

518
00:43:04,522 --> 00:43:06,262
It's a blood thinner.

519
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,743
Inject it into his IV line and
pull the tube from his chest.

520
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:15,849
He'll bleed into his lungs and...
drown.

521
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:21,044
It'll happen quick.

522
00:43:21,138 --> 00:43:23,891
You know, just...
look like he pulled it out in his sleep.

523
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,506
Jackie!

524
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:32,038
Time for the meet!

525
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:33,486
We got to go, brother.

526
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:05,680
You kill him...
and then you come and get me and

527
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:10,377
our boys and drive us out
of this poisonous town.

528
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,872
I will.

529
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:17,082
I promise.

530
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:50,690
What are you doing?

531
00:44:53,854 --> 00:44:55,773
Everything you taught me.

532
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,263
He's mine.
