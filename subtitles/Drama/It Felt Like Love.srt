1
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,666
You know it looks
more suspicious if you
stand outside, right?

00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,774
Shh.

5
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,325
Come on. Just touch it.

6
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,860
No.

7
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,928
It's not gonna bite.

8
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,582
Come here.
No.

9
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,488
Stop.

10
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:42,407

17
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,932
call me
when you get home.
All right.

18
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,434
Like the second you
walk through the door.
Okay.

19
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,004
<i>Please exit</i>
<i>through the rear door.</i>

20
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,481
He's too cute.

21
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,449
Yeah.

22
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,819
He, uh, went down on me
for the first time last week.

23
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,621
He did?

24
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,658
Yeah. It was good, but he
definitely needs practice.

25
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,828
Yeah. I hate it
when they need practice.

26
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,777
¶¶

27
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,822
If you're not gonna
feed the dog,
neither am I.

28
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,591
We don't even have dog food.

29
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,193
You know where the money is.

30
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,862
You go to the store,
you buy things
for yourself.

31
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,198
What's in there, coffee?

32
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,434
Anything good?

33
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,214
Should we euthanize her?

34
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,153
Let's do it. For fun.

35
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,790
Much easier than fighting.

36
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,681
Why are you still wearing
your bathing suit?

37
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,116
It's summer. It's hot.

38
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,828
Let's play a game.

39
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,633
I thought you wanted
to watch TV.

40
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,502
I did, but now I'm bored.

41
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,938
Dare.

42
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,741
Like truth or dare?

43
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,843
Like what?

44
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,512
It could be anything.

45
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,517
Come on.
Use your imagination.

46
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,098
It's just not the kind of game
you play with two people.

47
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,033
It's just more fun
with a group, you know?

48
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,243
How 'bout checkers?

49
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,064
Come on.

50
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,666
Come on.

51
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,736
Come on. Please.

52
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,941
Please. Please.

53
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,681
Come on. Come on.

54
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,798
I love how dark I get
during the summer.

55
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,801
Sometimes I get so dark
people actually
think I'm black.

56
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,036
Shut up.
It's true.

57
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,673
Do you have any tampons?

58
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,274
No.

59
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,077
Nothing?

60
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,914
I'm kind of irregular,
so I don't need them
that much.

61
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,350
That's gonna be a big problem
once you start having sex.

62
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,995
Hey, chiara!

63
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,431
Oh, hey, Sammy.
How's your summer been?

64
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,333
- It's going good. You?
- Fine.

65
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,069
Do you still work
at hall of fame?

66
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,137
Yeah. You should stop by
sometime and say hi.

67
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,139
Okay.
All right.
See ya.

68
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,050
No. He's just
some guy I know
from my neighborhood.

69
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,319
You sure
you never dated him?
No. He's a douche.

70
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,121
He'd fuck anything.

71
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,108
Who was that?
Just some girl
I was hanging out with.

72
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,910
Who?

73
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,378
Just some girl.

74
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,946
What's her name?

75
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,582
Jessica.

76
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,317
Is she in your grade?

77
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,520
She's in sixth,
going into seventh.

78
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,322
We made out.

79
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,325
You did?
Yeah.

80
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,960
It was all her idea.

81
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,829
I met a guy.

82
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,831
Cool. Where?

83
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,532
At the beach.

84
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,101
He went down on me.

85
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,971
All right.

86
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,341
It was good,
but he needs practice.

87
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,444
So, what are you doing later?

88
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,148
Probably going out.

89
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,853
All right. So, I'll just
come over after dinner.

90
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,358
¶¶

91
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,236
¶¶

92
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,189
Wanna help?

93
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,657
No.

94
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,373
What else do you
have to do today?
Stuff.

95
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,009
Like?
Stuff.

96
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,044
You used to like to help.

97
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,030
<i>Please exit</i>
<i>through the rear door.</i>

98
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,244
You can't get her
or whatever.

99
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,712
I was, like,
"all right. Watch me."

100
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,014
I walk over to introduce myself.

101
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,482
Bro, this girl is 35 years old.

102
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,184
Thirty-five?
Thirty-five.

103
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,119
How'd that go?
I didn't think
I was gonna get it.

104
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,654
Talked to her
about five minutes.

105
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,424
Next thing you know,
boom, got her number,
and that was it.

106
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,360
Maybe that's cause there
was no more alcohol left.

107
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,063
I took a walk to mobil.

108
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,099
And, like, this guy is
standing at the window,

109
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,968
and he's taking mad long.

110
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,103
And I'm, like,
"hurry the fuck up.
I'm trying to get my beer."

111
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,038
He's like,
"oh, shut up."

112
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,109
Did you hit him?
Yeah. This hand
is killing me.

113
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,745
Yeah?
Yeah. I knocked him out.

114
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,049
Hi.
Hey.

115
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,185
How's it going?
Good.

116
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:31,456
Cool, uh, I was just
in the neighborhood.
Shopping.

117
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,224
Where do you live?

118
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,759
Gravesend.

119
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,427
And you were shopping
around here?

120
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,162
Yeah.

121
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,732
Mmm.

122
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,333
How do I know you again?

123
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,435
The beach.

124
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,604
That's right.
You look different.

125
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,439
Yeah.

126
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,376
So, do you go to murrow
with chiara?
Yeah.

127
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,112
That's a nerdy school, right?

128
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,381
Like, it is and it isn't.

129
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:57,782
Mm-hmm.

130
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,456
What school do you go to?

131
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,025
Kingsborough.

132
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,293
High school or college?

133
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,263
College.

134
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,742
Um, I should get back to work.

135
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:28,413
Yeah. Uh, do you
have matches?

136
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,781
You know that's
bad for you, right?

137
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,682
Yeah.

138
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,338
Lila, you're
late again.

139
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,409
Class started 15 minutes ago.
Hurry up and get in there.

So, what's
your favorite way
to masturbate?

186
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,887
What?

187
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,358
What's your favorite
way to masturbate?

188
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,394
What? Just tell me.

189
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,999
All right.
So, show me.
No.

190
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,667
Just show me.
No.

191
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,535
Come on.
Nope.

192
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,372
No.

193
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,843
Have you ever
made out with lila?

194
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,545
I've made out with all
my girlfriends but lila.

195
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,616
I think you should
make out with lila.

196
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,456
Lila?

197
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,824
No. Thanks.

198
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,793
Why not?

199
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,863
'Cause you could have
herpes or something.

200
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,631
Thanks.

201
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,333
I'd rather have herpes
than rabies.

202
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,804
Oh.

203
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:08,492
<i>You've reached the offices</i>
<i>of the president</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

204
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,628
<i>Nah. I'm playing.</i>
<i>This is Sammy.</i>

205
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,063
<i>If I call you back, I call you.</i>

206
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,699
<i>If I don't, then, oh well.</i>

207
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,045
It feels so nice.

208
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,481
Nice?
Really nice.

209
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,498
I really wanna be with you.

210
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,533
Keep going.

211
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:25,469
Like, I wanna<i> be</i> with you,
be with you.

212
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,904
I don't know.

213
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,506
Why?

214
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,742
'Cause you've been
with other guys.

215
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,477
Three.

216
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,179
Three's a lot
when you think about it.

217
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,115
You know, one, two, three.

218
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,053
Is it?

219
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,055
Don't stop.

220
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,894
Why does it bother you?

221
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:53,764
It doesn't.
Just forget it.

222
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,730
<i>Yo.</i>
Hey, Sammy?

223
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:36,300
<i>Yeah.</i>
It's lila,
chiara's friend.

224
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,702
<i>You forgot your shit here.</i>

225
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,171
Yeah, I... I kind
of need them back.

226
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,008
<i>I'm at work. You can</i>
<i>swing by and grab them.</i>

227
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,877
Um, can I maybe meet you
after work tomorrow?

228
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,698
Look what Patrick got me.

229
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,608
Shh.

230
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,253
Stick your finger in there.
They'll suck on it.

231
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,854
No.

232
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,359
They don't have teeth.

233
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,862
You do it and tell me
what it feels like.

234
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,066
You're scared of everything.

235
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,368
I'm not, but think
what you want.

236
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,683
Get on.

237
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,822
Do you get dizzy easy?

238
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,225
No.
Uh-huh.

239
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,232
Boo!

240
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:31,101
Sorry. I was just
taking a piss.

241
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,469
Come on.
This way.

242
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,509
Do you have a boyfriend?

243
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:40,344
No.

244
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,846
Chiara's always got boyfriends.

245
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,815
Well, that's different.

246
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,817
Why?

247
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,185
'Cause she's needy.

248
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,007
Can I ask you something?

249
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,809
Sure.

250
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,443
Do you want something from me?

251
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,514
What would I want anyways?

252
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,982
Oh, fuck.

253
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,652
Fuck.

254
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,459
Fuck. Shit.

255
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,079
What's chiara doing tonight?

256
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:32,282
Out with her new boyfriend.

257
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,484
Who's her new boyfriend?

258
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,487
This guy, Patrick.

259
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:45,195
It's kind of serious.
He gave her a promise ring.

260
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,632
It won't last.
It might.

261
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,968
It won't.

262
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,536
You're so pessimistic.

263
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:56,173
I'm not pessimistic,
but, trust me,
it won't last.

264
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,608
They're in love, so it might.

265
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,212
They're not in love.
Yes. They are.

266
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,481
Oh.

267
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,755
No. No.
That's right.
Discipline the animal.

268
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,259
Hear? Try spanking him.

269
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,728
Like this.

270
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,463
Stop.

271
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,375
¶¶

272
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,625
¶¶

273
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,470
¶¶

274
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:40,143
Yo, does your dog
like to get high?

275
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,645
I don't know.

276
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,313
What's the dog's name?

277
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,148
Coffee.

278
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,616
What kind of name is that?

279
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,188
You named your dog
after a hot
fucking beverage?

280
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,323
Ignore them.
They're just
being dicks.

281
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,650
She's so hot.
So hot.

282
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:23,286
Gross. Why is she
rubbing herself like that?

283
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,688
'Cause it gets her off.

284
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,423
Looks painful.

285
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,266
Her titties are kind of perky.

286
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,767
She's got peach titties.

287
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,469
She's got a nice ass.

288
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,638
I remember one time
I made a porn.

289
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,773
My ex-girl
found the video.

290
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:47,410
She didn't like it so much.

291
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,778
Punched me in my face.

292
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,884
I still got to keep
the porno, though.

293
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,852
I've thought about doing that.

294
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,255
Doing what?

295
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,257
Like, as a career option.

296
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,826
Really?

297
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:07,564
Yeah, totally.
Like, the hours are really good
and so is the pay.

298
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:12,435
And I like sex, a lot.
Like, a lot, a lot.

299
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,672
She's not very good.
I've seen better.

300
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,607
What's your name again?

301
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,442
Lila.

302
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:23,180
Lila, why don't you
come and put your ass
right here?

303
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,862
So I can smack your ass
with this paddle...

304
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,817
Till it turns sore.

305
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,320
Turn that white ass red.

306
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,942
I should go.
I have to get up early.

307
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,378
It's the weekend.

308
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,347
Yeah, but, my mom's
in the hospital.

309
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,284
Get me a 40.

310
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,929
¶ It's the best rap

00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,048
¶ Either way, don't matter,
still spinnin'... ¶

320
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,816
25th ave.

321
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,885
Between what and what?

322
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,720
What and what?

323
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,922
Well, we can't
drive up and down
your block all night.

324
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,958
Hmm.

325
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,594
¶ Witnesses can't believe ¶

326
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,529
¶ how your mom's,
like, I can't believe ¶

327
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,032
¶ they ain't even my plan,
that'd kill my seed ¶

328
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:24,401
¶ please, livin' in the fast
Lane, I keep my Lane... ¶¶

329
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,443
under, over, drop.

330
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,779
Drop. Out and...

331
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,650
Out, to the side.
Left.

332
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,788
Okay.

333
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:50,894
Under, over, drop,
around, drop, up.

334
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:55,765
Out, in, left, right, left.

335
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,775
One, two, drop, three
and get lower.

336
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:11,381
Out, in, one, two, three.

337
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,016
And then you jump
into line, right.

338
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,934
Can you look at something?

339
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,602
No.

340
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,874
Just look.

341
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,509
I'm sure you're fine.

342
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,010
Just look.

343
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,013
What am I looking for exactly?

344
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,550
Does it look red or irritated?

345
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,786
I-I don't know.

346
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,554
I would do this for you.

347
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,889
I really don't know.

348
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,426
It looks like you've
been scratching it.

349
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,896
I have. That's why
you're checking if
there's anything there.

350
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,798
I'm sure you'll be fine.

351
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,959
What do you think
about, you know,
keeping things open?

352
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,928
Why?

353
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,033
'Cause you've had
all these other experiences.

354
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:53,269
I'm older.
A little, anyway.

355
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,807
Look, I know
I want to be with you.

356
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,043
But I can't commit
until we're even.

357
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,678
Even?
You know what I mean.

358
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,781
No. Say it.

359
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:07,917
Don't make me say it.

360
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,348
You need some help?
You look like
you're coming apart.

361
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,233
Okay.

362
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:08,071
Olivia, levia,
Rita and Aiden,

363
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,440
please come help light candles
16 through 10.

364
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:13,376
<i>¶¶ realize she's on her way ¶</i>

365
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:19,482

366
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:23,252
<i>¶  ¶</i>

367
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,121
You never get mad...

368
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,290
Except when I miss my curfew.

369
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:30,827
You are a pair of angels
that supports me in
everything I pursue.

370
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:33,262
You threw me this party
in such a spectacular venue,

371
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,832
and you even let me pick
the tasty dessert menu.

372
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,000
To say we're always happy
would be untrue,

373
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:41,070
but we stick together
and don't need
family therapy or glue.

374
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:44,340
Mom and dad, come help me light
candles number three and two.

375
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,780
<i>¶ And I'm on that road today ¶</i>

376
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:56,452
<i>¶ we are finally on the way,</i>
<i>16 today ¶</i>

377
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,960
You are so close to my heart,
and I'm totally smitten.

378
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,963
When I see you,
my heart pounds
and my eyes brighten.

379
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:09,832
So handsome and gentle,
in your arms,
my knees weaken.

380
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,468
I hope this moment lasts
and never comes undone.

381
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,071
Zach, please help me light
the most special on my cake,

382
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,173
candle number one.

383
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:20,143

386
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,495
Is everything okay?

387
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,368
Can I cut in?

388
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,841
Um, I didn't get a chance
to talk to you.

389
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,176
My hands are kind of full.

390
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,178
When did you
and Patrick break up?

391
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,614
I don't really want
to talk about that here.

392
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,953
Can you hold onto this for me?

393
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,435
Wow. You really
cleaned up.

394
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:55,605
I know.
What are you doing later?

395
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:58,074
Writing
thank-you cards.

396
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,609
Do you wanna come
to a party with me?

397
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:02,378
No.
Please.

398
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,413
- Why?
- See ya.

399
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:07,350
Bye.
'Cause I would do it
for you.

400
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,180

Bored yet?

00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:55,564
It's better than a lot
of parties we've
been to this summer.

408

hey, what's up?
I remember you.

410
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,139
You girls need a drink?

411
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,207
It's a party, not a funeral.

412
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:07,710
It's okay. I'll get it.

413
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,713
What's your name?
Chiara.

414
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:12,515
Devon.

415
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:15,318
Nice to meet you.

416
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,987
I like the way you sparkle.

417
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:21,424
You look like a pink disco ball.

422
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,569
Every time I see you,
you look different.

423
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,638
Yeah, I just came from a thing.
Chiara's thing.

424
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,307
Right, right, right. Fun?
Yeah.

425
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,309
Mmm. Um.

426
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,216
It doesn't work that way.

427
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,218
Whoa. Look at that.

428
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,591
What's that about?

429
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,661
I don't want to lose it.
No?

430
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,163
It's kind of over,
but I'm just holding onto it.

431

00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,287
Oh, gross.

471
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,225
I'm gonna call a car service.

472
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,827
Why? It's early.

473
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:15,397
I'm not drunk.
I'm just hot.

474
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,642
I-I can't.

475
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,911
Open your mouth.

476
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:30,779
Why?
I'll do it.

477
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:33,382
Why?
Open your mouth.

478
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,446
There's puke in your hair.

479
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:08,184
Get it off me.
No. Do it yourself.

480
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,668
I don't know
what you're talking about.

481
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,305
Oh, you wanna go again? Like...
I don't understand, man.

482
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:07,476
Bro, what the fuck?

483
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,413
What about your dick?

484
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,552
Thanks a lot, Devon.
Thanks a lot, man.

485
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:18,821
I always got you, bro.

I gotta, gotta be up

489
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,366
Can you set my alarm?

490
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:06,435
Am I your mother?

Hi.

499
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,709
Where are you going?

500
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,777
Work.

501
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,646
Sucks.
Yeah.

502
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,032
- Please don't do that.
- I don't mind.

503
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:31,833
It's my fucking mess.

504
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,305
I said stop it.

505
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:37,199
I spent the night
with this guy last night.

506
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,134
Who?

507
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,871
He's a friend
of a friend.
Is he your boyfriend?

508
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:49,945
No, but it's kind of
better than a boyfriend,
you know?

509
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:53,382
No.
It's kind of
more exciting.

510
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:56,385
That sounds too exciting.

511
01:00:56,387 --> 01:00:59,087
It's hard to describe.

512
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,691
Are you just getting home?

513
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:05,227
My dad's gonna kill me.

514
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:07,863
Maybe you should go.

515
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,865
I will.

516
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,835
What're you gonna tell him?

517
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,937
I don't think I can lie.

518
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,306
That would just make it worse.

519
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:20,008
If you hear screaming,
call the cops.

520
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,044
Shut up.

521
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:24,946
I'm serious.

522
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:27,849
Just tell him you were
at chiara's, or something.

523
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,831
You're really late.
It's really early.

524
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,401
Don't bullshit me.
What are you gonna do,
punish me?

525
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:49,738
No. If you don't
give a shit,
I don't give a shit.

526
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,707
Don't you wanna know
where I was?
No.

527
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,743
Stop trying
to pique my interest.

528
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:58,113
Chiara's? Nate's?

529
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:01,717
I was with
this guy.
Who?

530
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,053
You don't know him.
You don't have a guy
that I don't know about.

531
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,490
If you did,
believe me, I would know.

532
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,828
Hang that up
when you take it off.

533
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,397
I don't want to see it
crumpled up in the corner
of your room.

534
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,466
Please.
Fine.

535
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,323

01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,437
- Hi.
- Yo.

539
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,839
I...
what do you want?

540
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,941
I called you before.

541
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,411
I'm working.
I figured.

542
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:06,815
What's up?
You know.

543
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:11,086
What? Look, I'd love to hang,
but I'm kind of busy.

544
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,388
My dad freaked
that I came home so early.

545
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,957
He'll get over it.
I hope so.

546
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,425
He will.

547
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:24,132
Do you mind
if I hang here?
That's not such a good idea.

<i>¶¶</i>

549
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:43,151
I really don't think
I could be high
enough to pass out,

550
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,287
then fuck you,
and not remember it.

551
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:49,457
We were really drunk.
Do you get
what I'm saying?

552
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,494
But you have had
that happen before, right?

553
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,244
Hi.

554
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,115
Sorry about the other night.

555
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,117
I just didn't want you
to do something stupid.

556
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,853
I know.

557
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:19,955
Did you do something stupid?

558
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:23,225
I don't know.
It's kind of a blur.

559
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:25,527
How blurry?
Did you sleep with him?

560
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,296
I don't know. Maybe.

561
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,501
Is everything okay?

562
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,987
I'm gonna see
if I can get you
an appointment.

563
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:55,190
Please don't.
No. This is not okay.

564
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,992
You don't know
where he's been.
Please don't.

565
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:58,960
I'm sure it's fine.

566
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,288
I'm gonna take out
the speculum now,

567
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,290
so I need you
to take a deep breath.

568
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,634
It's a bit early
for the first pap smear.

569
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:44,539
We usually don't do them until
the patient is sexually active,

570
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:48,209
or until after
the patient turns 21.

571
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:52,547
At your age,
I would recommend...

572
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:55,483
Um, an hpv vaccine.

573
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,657
Your gown is on backwards.

574
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:07,295
Can I ask you
a few questions?
Sure.

575
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,332
Do you smoke?
At parties.

576
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:13,401
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume in a week?

577
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:16,671
Like 60 ounces a week.

578
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:19,007
Do you remember
to wear your seat belt...

579
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:21,609
Every time you get
into a car or taxi?

580
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,979
I try.

581
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:26,214
And how often
do you menstruate?
I don't know.

582
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,716
Monthly?
Maybe.

583
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:30,986
Every two months?
Sounds right.

584
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:34,289
Would you like to be tested
for stds?
No.

585
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,558
Do you have any history
of high blood pressure,

586
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,727
cancer or heart disease
in your family?

587
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:40,528
Yes.
Which?

588
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,631
Cancer.
Who, and what kind?

589
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,400
Mom. Breast cancer.

590
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:48,503
At what age
was she diagnosed?
I don't remember.

591
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,272
Alive or deceased?

592
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:53,375
Deceased.

593
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,146
I would like you
to consider participating...

594
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:01,783
In a surveillance program
at some point in
the next few years.

595
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,157
Are there any questions
I can answer for you today...

596
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:11,393
About your personal
or sexual health?

597
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,232
Lila, is there a reason
you came in today...

598
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:20,368
For emergency contraception?

599
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,038
I think the nurse
made a mistake.

01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,610
What do you think
she's doing here?

605
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:11,913
Your mom let me in.

606
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:13,716
I think she's here
'cause she wants your dick.

607
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,786
She can suck my dick.

608
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,688
You never shower.
She don't want...

609
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,423
Your smelly little stinky dick.

610
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:26,528
I think she wants
to suck all our dicks.

611
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,399
She only likes
to pretend to
suck your dick.

612
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,873
I'll do it.

613
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,660
It's gonna be a little hard
to do standing up.

614
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:01,496
Go on.

615
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:04,832
Come on, puppy, sit. Sit.

616
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,946
Did you decide
who you're gonna do first?

617
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,886
Pick me.

618
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,711
Do you like it?

619
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,649
Do you like it?

620
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:34,022
Do you like my dick?

621
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,463
It doesn't like you.

622
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,617
What do you want?

623
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,658
What's wrong?

624
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,770
Oh, come on.
What's wrong?

625
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:03,611
What's wrong?
