Yelena Yatsura

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,072
presents

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,080
See, those 18 tons
there are even since '65.

7
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:10,798
I don't care if they're from '41!

8
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,072
Well! Where is he? It's past two.

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,791
- Valya, stop fuckin' around.
- Nosirev! Nosirev!

10
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,678
The chunks are you know...
I boiled them a bit.

11
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,079
It's the right smell - absolutely.

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,597
Tomorrow at nine - all of it.
You take care of loading.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,994
- What about those 18? Ha?
- Not now.

14
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,913
What about the Kantemir meat?
It's minus 28 there.

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,674
Don't work with ground meat.
Told you 100 times.

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,674
It's minus 28 down there,
everything'll be fine,

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,788
- All packaged back in '92.
- I don't work with ground meat.

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,678
Eight years old. Cutlet meat with powder.
In tin cans.

19
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,675
- Plus, they deliver.
- I don't work with ground meat.

20
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,365
So he says, take six cans,

21
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,915
pour water, stick in a newspaper,

22
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,477
and put them inside. And the moisture
problem will be solved.

23
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,995
Shithead!

24
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,912
The curves will get all rusty.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,911
Put varnish on the pegs.

26
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,675
And you'll get church bells instead of a piano.

27
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,796
The glass'll crack, eh?!

28
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,994
Hey what about that Blutner?

29
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,195
Semi-lousy. The basses are off.

30
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,318
Se-emi lo-ousy,

31
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,312
Sem-i-i l-o-usy.

32
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,910
- How much is it?
- One and a half thousand.

33
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,596
One-and-a-ha-a-lf.

34
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,313
He cra-zy or something?

35
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,591
May-y-be...

36
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,070
And whe-re's my tuning fork?

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,989
Who-the-fu-uck kno-ows?

38
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,398
He-ere it-is.

39
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,591
That's it, finished!

40
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,079
Bye.

41
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,395
- The metro is closed.
- We don't use the metro.

42
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,796
- What are you... already?
- Uh-uh.

43
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,788
Why?

44
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,988
It's nothing...

45
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,474
Nothing.

46
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,672
Where?

47
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,074
Where's the money?

48
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,388
In the vase.

49
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,788
Which one?

50
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,908
Which one?

51
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,908
The 'Gagarin' one.

52
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,470
- Marina...
- What?

53
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,796
- What's it with you?
- Nothing.

54
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,999
I'll tell Paravazik.

55
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,311
Fuck off.

56
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,595
What will it be?

57
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,672
What goes down better at three in
the morning: Vodka or blood?

58
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,311
I drink beer at night.

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,399
So what do you want?

60
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,472
I'll start with vodka. Then we'll see.

61
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,389
- Absolut, Smirnov?
- Do you have Moscovskaya?

62
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,908
Of course.

63
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,792
- How much?
- 50 grams. And a tomato juice.

64
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,916
I'll have a beer. What do you have?

65
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,472
- Tuborg, Baltika.
- I'll have a Baltika.

66
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,391
What kind of bastard
would run over a dog at night!

67
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,308
Why?

68
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,318
What, why?

69
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,319
Well, it's more likely to happen at
night than during the day.

70
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,193
The city's empty! He didn't even look.
Idiot. People are assholes...

71
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,911
So are dogs.

72
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,199
They throw themselves under cars.

73
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,189
- Themselves? 'Cos a dog's life is shit?
- Because man's is.

74
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,996
A dog's life is comfortable actually.

75
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,915
- What do you want to drink?
- White Russian.

76
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,675
- I'm out of cream.
- Ah, come on.

77
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,996
A dog gets hit, and the bar's out of cream.

78
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,990
- Anything else?
- What else?

79
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,997
You got any Curacao?
One half with vodka. Lots of ice.

80
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,594
It's not so simple with dogs.

81
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,996
A friend of mine hit two dogs.

82
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,313
And each time
something bad happened to him after...

83
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,194
His lover left him.
Then something with his teeth.

84
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,471
Then he hit a drunk on Profsoyuznaya.
Killed him.

85
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,593
Straightaway he got lucky with a flat.
Good European furniture too.

86
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,191
- For cheap?
- Very.

87
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,191
Dogs are closer to God.

88
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,788
Are you a believer?

89
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,594
No.

90
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,989
Haven't had Curacao in a while.
Wish everyone looked that way.

91
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,790
Everyone'd be gay then.

92
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,799
Nowadays they're bloody everywhere...

93
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,074
Have you tried Curacao with tequila?

94
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,391
- No, is it good?
- A killer.

95
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,280
- But I don't like it.
- Why'd you suggest it then?

96
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:01,397
- Women like it.
- Women are into tequila now.

97
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,308
Yeah?

98
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,072
Two women I know. One never drank.

99
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,075
Now soon as I turn up - she's there
with salt, cutting a lemon.

100
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,793
The other, drinks a bottle of tequila
a night with her husband.

101
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,796
Home alcoholism.

102
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,391
I can't stand tequila.

103
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,676
- It's made from cactus, yes?
- Yes.

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,479
Reminds me of aloe!

105
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,589
My grandma used to give it to me
for arthritis. Shit!

106
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,592
- Did it help?
- No.

107
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,794
Soon as February comes, the white glops...

108
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,911
White like cream?

109
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,388
Sweeter.

110
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,193
- Damn. I forgot my cigarettes.
- Let me see.

111
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,594
You got some?

112
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,593
Had them somewhere.

113
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,908
Not lights?

114
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,674
No.

115
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,195
Well, okay.

116
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,309
Sese.

117
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,918
What's 'sese'?

118
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,394
That's 'thank you'
- in Chinese.

119
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,391
You know Chinese?

120
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,308
Christ, no!

121
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,194
Why not?

122
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,911
- It'd blow my roof off.
- Smart Russians are learning it.

123
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,919
- Why?
- China - is the future.

124
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,677
- You think so?
- I'm sure.

125
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,193
You know the workforce in China?

126
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,791
- 600 million people.
- 600 million!

127
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,799
I don't believe it.
You know that for sure?

128
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,073
Absolutely.

129
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,399
What, you work in the Statistics Institute?

130
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,908
Worse than that.

131
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,397
- Where?
- The presidential administration.

132
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,799
And what - what'd you do there?

133
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,992
Well, what do you do in any administration?
Administrating.

134
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,391
Is it in the Kremlin?

135
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,395
Our department is on the Lubyanka.
In the KGB building.

136
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,479
Cool.

137
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,395
And what do you do there? Security?

138
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,994
We aren't responsible for security.

139
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,593
My department delivers mineral
water to the Kremlin.

140
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,916
It's time for a grappa. Barman!

141
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,596
- I hope you're not out of grappa?
- No.

142
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,795
And I'll have another beer.

143
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,992
What kind of water goes to the Kremlin?

144
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,678
Varies. From Evian to Borgomi.

145
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,672
What kind does the president drink?

146
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,396
The president drinks spring water.

147
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,913
From where?

148
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,673
From the source of the Volga. Tver region.

149
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,478
- What's there?
- That's where the Volga starts.

150
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,792
There's a well with a spring.
The great Russian river.

151
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,470
- Does the water taste good?
- Yes. The water's nice and soft.

152
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,309
- You deliver it yourself?
- Not personally. I'm the boss.

153
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,075
How often do you see the president?

154
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,191
About twice a month.

155
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,677
- Tell me, is he a drinker?
- Practically not.

156
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,314
A glass of French wine sometimes, you know.

157
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,311
'Chateau de Latour'.
And a glass of champagne at ceremonies.

158
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,193
- But his wife likes a drink.
- Really? What?

159
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,390
- Champagne.
- French?

160
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,045
Of course, not Russian!

161
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,071
- She really drinks a lot?
- Yes.

162
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,197
About two bottles of wine a day!

163
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,795
Not really a lot. Two bottles of wine!
If it was vodka!

164
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,075
A Russian woman should be able
to drink a liter of vodka.

165
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,965
Right! My friend can drink all on her own.

166
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,468
And afterwards go...
you know... out on the catwalk.

167
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,965
- Is she a model?
- Yes.

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,195
And you go out on the catwalk too?

169
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,919
No. I'm in a different business.

170
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,078
- Interesting, what kind?
- Advertising.

171
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,078
- What do you advertise?
- Different stuff.

172
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,913
Right now there's this Japanese device.

173
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,193
A home appliance?

174
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,913
No... it's this device...

175
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,469
- Can I have another cigarette?
- Sure.

176
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,394
This absolutely new device...

177
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,079
For...

178
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,069
For improving your health at work.

179
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,915
- Something like an air ionizer?
- Almost.

180
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,191
But an absolutely new generation.

181
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,394
You hook it up to the socket in the office,

182
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,393
in a few minutes it generates these waves,

183
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,914
and it works very nicely, right away.

184
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,078
People don't get tired, there's no aggravation,

185
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,676
I really didn't believe it at first.

186
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,316
Work is work though.

187
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,595
Before I advertised air conditioners,
now this device.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,195
Then I took one to try myself,
and put it on at home.

189
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,075
- And how was it?
- It really helped.

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,309
Usually I get up - and everything's wrong,

191
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,599
I want to cuss everything.
You ride around all day,

192
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,196
work, sign stuff...

193
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,312
I was in a good mood!

194
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,674
The Japanese really do know how to make stuff.

195
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,993
What's it called?

196
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,594
In Japanese it's called 'Chao van.'

197
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,674
'Chao van? '

198
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,073
Yes. It's the name of a Japanese bird.

199
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,880
You know, the one they worship.

200
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,045
- A crane?
- No.

201
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,992
Different bird... there's a picture of it,

202
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,592
it's bluish with this reddish tail.

203
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,197
Lives up in their forests, or mountains.

204
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,674
- It only sings at night.
- Like an owl?

205
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,399
No. When it sings,

206
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,000
all the Japanese start to feel much better.

207
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,194
Sleep?

208
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,365
In general. They even cry in their sleep.

209
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,073
- In their sleep!
- 'Chao van.' Never heard of it.

210
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,398
Have you sold a lot of them?

211
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,989
Around one and a half thousand.

212
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,674
- Maybe you could give us one?
- I'd be pleased to.

213
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,991
Just leave your phone number.

214
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,880
Well, you won't be able to
get through to the Lubyanka.

215
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:11,560
Better if you gave me yours.

216
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:12,788
Okay.

217
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,595
Damn, left my cards in the office as usual.

218
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,471
Let me give you my number.

219
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,072
Marina Borisovna.

220
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,391
Call from nine to seven.

221
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,593
When I'm not away,
I'm always in the office.

222
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,394
Or, well, leave a message with the secretary.

223
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,674
Thanks.

224
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,195
You want another drink?

225
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,072
Okay. Only something else.

226
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,477
- Champagne?
- Okay.

227
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,991
Hey, wake up.

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,592
I'm not sleeping.

229
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,193
So cheers! Marina Borisovna.

230
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,676
- What's your name?
- Oleg Nikolayevich

231
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,998
And yours?

232
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,399
Just Vladimir.

233
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,677
Well than Oleg Nikolayevich
and 'just Vladimir',

234
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,796
Let's go with the flow!

235
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,313
- Or rather - tune in.
- Not like in the army, though.

236
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,798
No, musically-speaking.

237
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,077
You a musician?

238
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,595
Do I look like one?

239
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,594
Yup.

240
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,991
No. Way off. Organic chemist.

241
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,393
Horrible!

242
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,077
In school I just hated chemistry!
All those formulas!

243
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,191
To each his own.

244
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,311
You in a chemical Institute, or in industry?

245
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,073
I work in a top secret department.
They used to call it a 'mail box'.

246
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,070
- For the military?
- No, not the military.

247
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,675
Why's it so closed then, this box?

248
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,791
It's hard to explain.

249
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,197
Inventions, or something?

250
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,198
There's nothing left
to invent in this business.

251
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,677
- In organic chemistry?
- No. In genetic engineering.

252
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,915
- Genetics? Trendy job.
- It's the job.

253
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,394
So what d'you do, breed sheep?

254
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,996
- That too.
- Cows? Cattle?

255
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,398
Yeah, that too.

256
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,799
- What, and people too?
- Of course.

257
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,674
What?

258
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,400
That's banned. There was some
international conference,

259
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:41,198
they banned cloning human beings.

260
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,197
You forget what country we're living in.

261
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,311
What is banned there is allowed here.

262
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,194
Yeah.

263
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,075
- And... it worked with a human?
- Yeah, long ago.

264
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,080
What? How long? Has some boy-clone
already been grown?

265
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:01,196
Not a boy anymore. Or even a teen.

266
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,725
What - a guy? I mean, an adult?

267
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,796
Sure enough.
The oldest is now 44 years old.

268
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,598
It's crap! 44! When was he cloned?
In Khrushchev's time?

269
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,670
The first human cloning
experiments began in 1947.

270
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,792
Professors Bronstein, Lukin.
Doctor Nesmeyanov.

271
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,675
The first success.

272
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,397
The first Stalin Prize in genetics.

273
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,389
Stalin Prize...
Genetics was outlawed back then.

274
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,472
Outlawed officially. But people
went on with their work, as usual.

275
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,309
There were two secret major government projects:

276
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,078
The atomic bomb and cloning. Only,
cloning is a western word.

277
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,076
Here we call it 'doubling'.
The objects are 'doubles'.

278
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,314
We don't use the word 'clone' in our institute.

279
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,990
Where is this institute? Or is that a secret?

280
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,070
There're no secrets nowadays.
Ever been on Volgina street?

281
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,445
- Where's that? - Somewhere near Belyaevo?

282
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,678
Yes. Shemyakin's institute of organic
chemistry is down there.

283
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,590
There's a secret laboratory in it. Where I work.

284
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,679
What, they grow there,
these people... 'doubles'?

285
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,474
No, we just have a laboratory there.

286
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,991
- The doubles grow in incubators.
- Where are these incubators?

287
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,677
What do you mean? There are quite a few.

288
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,194
How many?

289
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,914
I don't remember, when I started there

290
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,797
six years ago there were about 40.

291
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,595
- 40.
- 12 incubators in Moscow alone.

292
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,795
Four near us in south-west Moscow.
Eight in the suburbs.

293
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,668
I don't understand anything!
Do people grow in them?

294
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,072
We just have a laboratory.
We lay the genes down.

295
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,177
The people grow up in society.

296
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:11,674
Kindergartens, orphanages.

297
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,668
Fuckin' bullshit! Where'd these clones go?
To the army, ha?

298
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,913
No. Same as the rest... Different places.

299
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,075
There are special programmes.
Managed by special departments.

300
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,599
- Which departments?
- The KGB, the defense ministry.

301
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,789
- How many clones are there?
- In our laboratory?

302
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,311
No, in general? How many've been grown?

303
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,597
Hard to say. You see my professor -

304
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,677
he's been in this project since 1968.

305
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,313
He says that then throughout the country there

306
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,917
were about 6000 healthy
doubles and about 19000 sick ones.

307
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,280
Now... Jesus, I couldn't even tell you.

308
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:54,396
Wait, so you're saying that...

309
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,198
Nonsense... the 'doubles' are among us?

310
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,965
So why no-one knows about it?
Nobody writes about it?

311
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,310
In the president's administration
nobody's ever said anything!

312
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,676
There've been publications. A number of them.

313
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,317
Sure your people talked.
Just you didn't pay attention.

314
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,072
- I would pay attention to that.
- No, you didn't.

315
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,073
There was a big article six months ago
in a tabloid, 'Twins Village'.

316
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,320
It described a village somewhere in Mordovia,

317
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,075
that's full of sick twins. Twins,
triplets, quadruplets.

318
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,339
They all have some kind of internal disease.

319
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,999
- For twins it's a normal thing.
- Normal?

320
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,525
A lot of sick people too.

321
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,676
Yeah, but four kilometers from this village is

322
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,789
Soyuz 4- one of the first Soviet incubators.

323
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,996
These twins are production waste.
The first Soviet doubles.

324
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,391
Volodya! Past midnight, great time for stories...

325
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,069
Let me tell you how I once saw a UFO.

326
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,676
Near Smolensk, after the army draft.
We were takin' a leak,

327
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,313
it was there, hanging above the forest.
Bluish-green!

328
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,480
Really. Three of us saw it.
The guys at the gate did too!

329
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:13,472
I once saw a ghost. In Petersburg.
I got so scared.

330
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,596
I'm not insisting on it,
let's go on to something else.

331
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,073
Just Marina asked me where I work...

332
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,791
Forget it. Hey,
get me a shot of something stronger?

333
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,593
Right. Before midnight - lower the strength,
after - raise it.

334
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,677
How do you know?
A lot of boozing in your line of work?

335
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,670
We like to relax. Work is tough,

336
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,725
just to get around.
And we can afford a drink.

337
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,593
- The whole firm relaxes together?
- Yup. Don't you?

338
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,594
- Or you got prohibition there?
- No, nobody bans it.

339
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,677
Just not in groups...
Everyone has their own friends.

340
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,795
We just go two or three of us to
our favorite places.

341
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,392
- Like where?
- John's, Kempinsky,

342
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,398
sometimes - Pushkin.

343
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,995
Volodya, I can't really recall any bars
around Belyaevo.

344
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,593
- Or you just booze in your lab?
- Pure spirit with the clones?

345
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,790
I've had a few drinks with them.
Not in the lab. In the slums.

346
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,396
- Where?
- In the Krasnoyarsk slum.

347
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,911
It's this place, where...

348
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,675
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.
Like a transit prison...

349
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,991
But let's go on to something else.

350
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,993
Barman, another 50 grams of
Moskovskaya and that's it.

351
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,596
- And 50 for me too.
- And I'll go home.

352
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:46,913
- Come on, tell!
- Tell her, she's asking.

353
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,319
You won't believe it
- no interest to be a clone...

354
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,195
Tell about this... this transit place.

355
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,073
Let's get this down first.
To 'accordance'.

356
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,594
What?

357
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,072
For everyone to live in accord
with his place on earth.

358
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,391
Good toast.

359
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,075
To start with, there are three types of doubles:

360
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,790
M-type, F-type and Type-4,
or simply 'fours'.

361
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,788
The Germans conducted the first in 1937.

362
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,799
It was M-type. Then stolen by the KGB.

363
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,471
Then Professor Bronstein modernized it,

364
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,996
added the domino principle: A paired chromosome

365
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,469
connected to the unpaired one when substituted.

366
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,677
That allowed for you to make one double.

367
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,071
That's F-type.

368
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,594
In 1968, the now-deceased
Nikolai Petrovich Golosov

369
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,069
discovered Type-4 doubling.

370
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,914
That's when four chromosome-complexes
are put in one cell.

371
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,198
Four doubles developed, four clones.

372
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,593
The most amazing thing

373
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,677
is that '4' produced the least errors

374
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,075
and the optimal survival rate.

375
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,397
They tried doubling by three, seven;
even a double-12.

376
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,940
But four turned out to be the ideal number.

377
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:24,965
It was never sacred in any culture's history.

378
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,595
Not '3', '5', '7' or '12'.
But '4'! The number the world rests on.

379
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,914
This is the heart of the matter of four corners.

380
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,680
- Like four table legs. - Yes.

381
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,318
And about three years ago

382
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,399
I was sent on a work
trip to the Krasnoyarsk slum.

383
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,245
It's a cool place. The things that happen there!

384
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,590
Built back in Stalin's time
- the first incubator in the USSR.

385
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,673
So I came, did my job.

386
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,390
I was met by this guy from Initial Correction,

387
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,077
he says, what are you doing tonight?

388
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,399
35 miles to the city - let's
drink with the 'fours'?

389
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,397
Why not? We took two liters of vodka,
canned food...

390
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,797
The territory there must be like half of Moscow.

391
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,395
We arrive.

392
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,445
There are different departments around,

393
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,790
We went into this huge building,
where the 'fours' live.

394
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,672
- All 'fours' and all twins?
- Yes.

395
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,919
Sure. There are around 300 of them there.

396
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,676
Jagged bricks sticking out of the walls.

397
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,317
They're all dressed horribly,
of course. In rags, dirty.

398
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,910
He says lets go to dept 32.

399
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,792
The 16-year-old girls are there - all 'fours'.

400
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,797
So we went in.

401
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,799
They look at us.

402
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,077
We poured some vodka for them.

403
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,672
They come up, four of each.

404
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,594
We drink.

405
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,475
The first one, the one with the biggest tits -

406
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,916
four of them too - tears my shirt,
and right on me!

407
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,193
The guard comes in,

408
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,991
And says: What the fuck're you doing?

409
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,788
Can you imagine?

410
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,389
So we were kicked out.

411
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,194
I practically lost my job.

412
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,994
That's not a flying saucer, eh? That's a story!

413
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,798
There was this other time,

414
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,399
Not in the Krasnoyarsk slum, in the Pushkin one.

415
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,913
We came there with this guy.

416
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,390
We weren't really boozing,
we were there for work...

417
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,910
We come to this building,

418
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,988
full of blacks,

419
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,470
All 'fours', and all men.

420
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,000
If you worked in the institute for five years,

421
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,797
you have to pass this test:

422
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,670
You're thrown in with these niggers, on your own.

423
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,311
All twins, all 'fours', and all blacks,

424
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,913
They have to fuck you...

425
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,998
That's it, shut up!

426
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,993
What do I owe you?

427
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,913
Okay, here.

428
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,990
What assholes work in the president's
administration.

429
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,311
You quarrel?

430
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,071
It's just late. Everyone wants to sleep.
Except me.

431
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
220 rubles. 150.

432
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:11,396
220.

433
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,845
Here.

434
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,791
Let's go to this place.

435
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,677
- What place?
- It'll be good there.

436
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,318
- How's that?
- Like this?

437
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,799
- Tomorrow'd be better.
- Now is better.

438
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,913
Tomorrow's better. I can't now.

439
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,671
And tomorrow I can't.

440
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,471
Hey, Volodya, at least finish your story.

441
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,474
What?

442
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,074
What'd you do there with them?
With those 'fours'.

443
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,988
The 'fours'?

444
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,993
I was joking.

445
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,074
You made it all up?

446
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,474
Yes.

447
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,596
- Everything?
- Everything. From the start.

448
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,596
I'm a piano-tuner.

449
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,989
- Fuck! You hear that?
- What?

450
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,198
All that crap.

451
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,069
Siberia, or something? He's a hunter?

452
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,312
Go back to sleep.

453
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,912
Just bring me mineral water and a main course.

454
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,789
We have a large selection of main courses.

455
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,280
What's your special?

456
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:56,918
Our special -

457
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,317
is young round piglet with apple radish. Superb.

458
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,396
- What kind of piglet?
- Round.

459
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,917
- Ground up or something?
- No, that's the breed.

460
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,472
- What breed?
- Round piglet.

461
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,237
- What are they, overfed?
- They're perfectly round.

462
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:22,914
A piglet can't be round.
What do you, pump them up?

463
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,074
- No. They're born that way.
- Where?

464
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,591
The 'Kommunarka' state farm.

465
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,799
They've been sending us round
piglets for two years.

466
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,917
Listen buddy, I sell meat seven years,
and I never heard of them.

467
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,679
Take a look in the kitchen.

468
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,674
Sasha,

469
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,678
this gentleman here wants to look at the piglets.

470
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,911
This is the musicians' room.

471
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,191
I'm a musician.

472
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,599
The musicians have left.

473
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,072
Obviously, not all of them.

474
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,919
- You a drummer?
- I was a pianist once.

475
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,472
- And I was a person once.
- And now?

476
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,916
God knows...

477
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,472
Sometimes I wake up,
look at myself in the mirror and think:

478
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,316
Who is this? What is this?

479
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,471
And you don't like what you see?

480
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,070
That's not the point
- if I like it or not.

481
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,390
People can have strange tastes...

482
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,676
The point is that
- there's no name.

483
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,077
Who has no name? The reflection?

484
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,391
The person.

485
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,191
This here is a turtle.

486
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,991
And this is glass.

487
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,591
And this is the floor.

488
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,320
And they'll always, always be

489
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,594
turtle, glass and floor.

490
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,994
Nothing else. They've already been made.

491
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,479
Finished.

492
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,072
But we - not yet.

493
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,472
And we could easily become anything or anyone.

494
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,392
That's why a person doesn't yet have a name.

495
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,672
Actually, I'm Volodya.

496
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,798
So what?

497
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,469
In just half an hour you could
become a stray dog.

498
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,911
Or a rag, that a nice girl
uses to wipe her feet on.

499
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,593
Or just a piece of live meat.

500
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,314
That's not true.
You can decide not to turn into a dog,

501
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,311
or rag. Or a piece of meat.

502
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,399
There's always a choice.

503
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,671
Suicide?

504
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,470
Yes. But that's just a palliative.

505
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,077
A what?

506
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,073
- You know, a forced move.
- So what?

507
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,313
In this game, forced moves are out.

508
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,676
Senior sergeant Nikonov. Your ID?

509
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,912
Okay.

510
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,396
When will winter end?

511
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,994
When spring starts. Come over to the car.

512
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,794
- What's the problem?
- We'll explain at the station.

513
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,077
- What's the problem?
- Get in.

514
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,391
'Hey, Suley, Marinka:

515
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,078
Go to Leninsky 65, entrance 4,
flat 72. His name's Valera.

516
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,390
He's waiting since nine.'

517
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,677
'Raya, don't go to Bogdan's tomorrow,
he wants Thursday.

518
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,596
A little later, like after eleven.'

519
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,445
'Girls, pick up the phone,

520
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,472
I can't get in downstairs.
The lock got frozen again.'

521
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,991
'Marina Kravchenko,
I'm the conductor of train number 162,

522
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,313
see, like, I'm at the station now, just got in,

523
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,917
I got asked to tell you

524
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,072
from Maly Okot, that Zoya died.'

525
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,793
'Wanted to know, what about five, with Lena.

526
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,992
They'll ring you... '

527
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,075
Buildin' all these damn buildings...

528
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,797
- Want some vodka, girl?
- I'm not allowed.

529
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,319
- You going far?
- The polygon.

530
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,193
What, you in the army?

531
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,912
No. My narcologist recommended it.
So I don't shoot up.

532
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,525
Grenade launcher... gets you higher than heroin.

533
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,791
Shove in a few grenades
- you couldn't care less for a needle.

534
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,999
Buildin' these damn buildings...

535
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,390
- Want some vodka?
- I'm not allowed.

536
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,674
- You going far?
- The polygon.

537
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,308
Why?

538
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,672
To shoot a grenade-launcher.

539
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,196
- What, you in the army?
- No.

540
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,675
My psychiatrist's advice for the head.
Calms the nerves.

541
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,799
And helps against suicide.

542
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,590
Just shove in a few grenades
- and you want to live again.

543
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,074
Misha, I'm home!

544
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,910
Hello, my dear.

545
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,391
Mish, I'm tired of saying...

546
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,797
You don't have to wash the garbage can every day.

547
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,195
Son, you can't imagine how strong
the microbes are today.

548
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,596
Everything is ready.

549
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,388
It's your favorites

550
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,399
today.

551
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,474
Pea soup, croutons,

552
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,471
then cutlets

553
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,391
with potatoes in mushroom sauce.

554
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,193
- Fruitjelly.
- Steamed cutlets?

555
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,598
Don't torture me.

556
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,671
Hey, Misha...

557
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,391
- No, it's...
- What is it?

558
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,398
Some bloody rubbish.

559
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,479
I'm calling the ambulance.

560
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,798
- It can't go on anymore...
- Don't torture me, son.

561
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,074
You'll have to move, Mish.

562
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,994
I can't live with you. Or live like this.

563
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,317
I'm calling the ambulance. That's it.

564
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,312
Very good for you...

565
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,793
There's a limit to my patience...

566
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,998
a real limit!

567
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,676
You can't imagine...

568
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,913
Or understand...

569
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,910
- Please.
- I can't. I don't' want to.

570
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,793
Quiet now...

571
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,197
I can't eat your steamed meat
seven months in a row!

572
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,480
Son, believe the great ones.

573
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:20,471
Dear!

574
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,474
I asked you, I told you a thousand times.

575
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,319
You, Misha - listen to me!

576
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,760
Mishenka, please, for once, just a simple steak!

577
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:34,469
Son, steaming - is a great thing.

578
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,669
Is it so hard? You want a scandal?! Tell me.

579
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,669
- Okay! It's a scandal!
- Son, don't torture me.

580
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,958
Exhausted by hunger, he ate in secret,

581
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,479
thought he was stealing food.

582
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,191
But that was better

583
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,672
than begging from strangers.

584
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,074
Son,

585
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,988
can you imagine

586
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,668
how many maniacs there are out there?

587
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,392
I get this call. From Vitaly Ivanovich.

588
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,677
He says, lend me 700 dollars.

589
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,645
Can you imagine?!

590
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,318
Give me the fairy stories.

591
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,677
700 dollars.

592
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,193
Amazing!

593
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,319
I mean, he knows

594
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,998
my bills

595
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,070
are sorted by their numbers.

596
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,914
So I tell him it's just not polite,

597
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,310
I don't care about the money,

598
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,593
after all, they're not mine - they're Oleg's.

599
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,319
But you won't give back the notes I give you -

600
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,675
you'll give back totally different notes.

601
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,991
And what kind of order,

602
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,197
will there be after that?

603
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,193
Son, it's been a long time

604
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,799
since we've gone to your mum's grave.

605
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,471
It's horrible there.

606
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,191
Oaks, fences.

607
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,391
Birds shitting all over it.

608
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,913
And bums.

609
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,594
Misha, go sleep.

610
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,594
You can't even imagine the power of hell.

611
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,190
So, you weren't in Saratov,
on the 8th and the 25th?

612
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,195
I have never been in Saratov.

613
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,913
That's interesting!

614
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,794
What's this then?

615
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,919
- What are these things?
- A cup, a hammer.

616
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,074
Correct.

617
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,319
Why've you've gone so pale then?

618
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,196
I really have never been in Saratov.

619
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,645
What, never ever?

620
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,593
You never were at Mayakovsky Street 7, flat 68?

621
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,470
That night from 7 till 9, with Vitya Rogozhin?

622
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,589
You didn't drill? Or knock?

623
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,074
And that whore,

624
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,993
didn't step out on the balcony?

625
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,072
And the truck didn't drive up?

626
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,996
And your coat didn't get caught on the nail?

627
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,790
When the neighbor yelled?
The hunchback neighbor.

628
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,999
And you didn't sing with Victor in the garage?

629
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,198
In the garage, by the bridge.

630
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,472
So, now d'you remember?

631
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,074
You want to read the hunchback's testimony?

632
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,477
No?

633
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,197
Tryin' to be like sap, musician?

634
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,078
Now you're talkin'
- 'never, never'!

635
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,398
Round piglets.

636
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,398
Danger! High voltage.

637
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,669
I thought you were in America, Marina.

638
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,077
In the train I dreamt I was late. And I am.

639
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,799
All the same now...

640
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,916
Zoya Kravchenko.

641
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,594
Oh, how will we get along without you...

642
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,792
The bitter minute has come

643
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,198
Mother dear forgive,

644
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,999
For we shall never see you

645
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,594
Ever, in this life's road.

646
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,669
These working hands are worn

647
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,671
Forever folded now they are

648
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,397
And dear, you shall never

649
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,797
Return to us.

650
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,669
Days you went hungry

651
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,595
Nights you did not sleep

652
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,799
Your last piece of bread

653
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,675
You shared half with us.

654
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,397
Okay, gals, to the hut. Cold.

655
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,195
Cold.

656
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,189
Manya, take the chairs in.
