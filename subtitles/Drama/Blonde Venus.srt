Hey, you guys, wait a minute.
How far is it to the next town?

3
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,558
- Only 10 miles.
- Then it's no use, boys. I'm through.

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,679
Just cover me with leaves and tell
my mother I died with her name on my lips.

00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,796
Time out while we watch Joe die.

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,758
Is anyone around here human enough
to give me a cigarette?

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,034
Here you are.

And you're the guy who said
this was going to be a pleasure trip.

9
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,873
- It's part of your education.
- Yeah?

10
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,030
You can't leave Germany
without taking a walking trip.

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,235
Why can't I?

Oh, look! What's that?

Hey, brother, can you give us
a lift into town?

15
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,996
We've been hiking all day
and we're tired. Tired.

[Man speaking in German]

What did he say?

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,918
He says he's engaged
for the whole afternoon.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,989
That settles it.

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,117
He just wants to bargain. Come on.
We'll pay you well. We're Americans.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,951
- What did he say?
- He says he's a man of honour.

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,359
- Theatre? Actresses?
- Actresses? Are they young?

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,552
Ask him quickly, for heaven's sakes,
how many of them are there?

- Will you please go away?
- You speak English.

37
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,389
Really quite a surprise.
Have you just come from America?

38

- Rather a long swim, isn't it?
- Will you go away?

What a charming country this is.
I've half a mind to settle here for good.

Would you mind telling me how long
this is going to keep up?

41

You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Now that you call my attention to it,
I guess I am.

Please. We have to be back in the theatre

Otherwise, we'll all lose our positions.

Well, young man,
what seems to be your trouble?

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,197
Dr. Pierce, I have a rather peculiar request
to make.

62
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,191
I want to sell you my body.

Why do you particularly
want to sell it to me?

Well, sir, in view of your reputation
on this side of the water...

65
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,116
I had an idea that my body
in its present condition...

might be very interesting to you.

- What is your occupation?
- I'm a commercial chemist.

70
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,078
I've been working on a process
whereby the various radium products...

71
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,354
can be utilised without danger.

72
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,192
How long have you been working
on this thing?

73
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
- Ten or twelve years.
- That's a very valuable idea.

Who made your diagnosis?

75
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,509
I know enough about the symptoms
to do it myself.

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,717
- Have you had any blood tests lately?
- Three weeks ago and again last night.

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,268
I think I'm good for another eight months,
a year at the most.

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,157
I wish I could help you,
but I'm afraid I can't.

Do you know anybody else
who might be interested in my condition?

Look here, Doctor, I need money very badly.

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,549
Why, are you married?

82
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,914
I wouldn't have come here if I weren't.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,070
- Any children?
- Yes, a little boy.

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,357
- Does your wife know about your condition?
- She does.

85
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,237
I told her last night.

86
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,437
Come to think of it, I've just heard
from a friend of mine in Germany.

87
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,034
There's a specialist there named...

88
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,032
What was that name?

89
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,473
Holzapfel.

90
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,916
- Been pretty successful in cases like yours.
- Holzapfel? At Dresden?

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
- Yes. Do you know him?
- Do I know him?

92
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,996
He was one of my professors
when I was studying over there.

93
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,354
He was, was he?

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,318
Doctor, how much do you think
it would cost?

95
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,713
Well, the cure is said to take
three or four months.

96
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,315
I should say about $1,500.

97
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,950
$1,500?

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,673
- That's a lot of money, isn't it?
- It certainly is.

99
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,673
- Aren't you working?
- Only at odd jobs, one or two days a week.

100
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,469
Let's see. I could let you have, say, $50.

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,391
No, Doctor, thank you.

102
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,274
Thank you so much for your patience.

103
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,039
Glad you came to see me.

104
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,472
Bedtime, Johnny.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,597
Daddy, can't I just stay up
10 minutes longer?

106
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,715
No.

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,994
- Five?
- No.

108
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,354
- Two?
- No.

Alley-oop.

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,151
Wait a minute, Mummy.

111
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,151
Right in the bull's eye, Johnny.

112
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,030
- Which one are you going to tell me?
- Which one do you want to hear?

113
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,271
- The one about Germany.
- But you've heard that one so often.

114
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,590
- I want to hear it again.
- Ned.

115
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,674
Coming.

116
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,471
- All set, Daddy?
- You bet.

117
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,310
Go on, Mummy.
It was springtime in Germany...

118
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,311
It was springtime in Germany,
and it was warm.

119
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,915
I had spring fever
and the air was full of blossoms.

120
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,918
Now it's your turn.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,878
Let's see. I was out with
some other students on a walking trip...

122
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,758
and pretty soon we came to a dragon
sitting in an automobile...

123
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,070
who told us there was a magic pool
in the forest.

124
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,874
- And what did you do?
- We went to the pool, of course.

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,076
- And what do you suppose we saw?
- What?

126
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,675
Imagine! Half a dozen princesses
taking a bath.

127
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,314
- And what did you do when you saw him?
- I told him to go away.

128
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,511
- And did he?
- He did not.

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,233
And what happened then?

130
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,515
The most beautiful princess of all...

131
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,273
said that if I'd go away,
she'd grant me my wish.

132
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,512
- And what did you wish?
- I wished to see her again.

133
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,352
I couldn't think of anything better to wish.

134
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,433
So that night I went to a theatre,
and music began to play.

135
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,636
And out upon the stage
stepped this princess...

136
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,599
and she looked more beautiful than ever.
She was beautiful!

137
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,708
And then your heart began to go like this?

138
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,512
And Mummy began to sing?

139
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,239
And my heart stopped beating entirely.

140
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,798
What happened to you when you saw him?

141
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,350
I could hardly sing, and I could barely wait
until I saw him again.

142
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,034
But you did see him again, didn't you?

143
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,190
I met him later that night.

144
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,678
- What happened then?
- You can never guess.

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,468
- We went walking.
- Go on, walk.

146
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,753
Okay, skipper.

147
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,198
And then we came to a park.

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,919
Only there was a tremendously large
yellow moon up in the sky.

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,275
It was altogether too big and too bright.

150
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,954
But it was dark under the trees, very dark.

151
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,678
This is a tree, Johnny.

152
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,116
- And what happened under the tree?
- Then he kissed me.

153
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,958
- And what happened after that?
- He kissed me again.

154
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,991
And what happened then?

155
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,677
Then we were married.

156
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,953
And then?

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,639
And then we started to think about you...

158
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,839
Get out of here.

159
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,800
[Singing lullaby in German]

160
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,599
Would you need that $1,500 all at once?

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,078
No, but if I had $300,
I could at least get to Germany.

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,355
I haven't yet figured out
a way of paying the rent...

163
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,635
unless I part with the microscope.

164
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,280
So I'm afraid we'll have to postpone
our trip abroad this year.

165
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
I could earn that money
by going back to the stage.

166
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,151
I won't have you do that.

167
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,276
But the doctor says you must go away.

168
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,239
If I worked a few weeks,
I might make enough for your passage.

169
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,875
And then we'll find a way
to keep you over there...

170
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,188
until you get well.

171
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,716
It's out of the question.
I won't have you go back to the stage.

172
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,198
- Ned?
- What is it?

173
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,993
I was going back to my old work anyway.

174
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,548
- Will it make you happy?
- It isn't that. We need money.

175
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,200
It's only a question of weeks.
My formula is almost completed...

176
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,669
- and then we'll have all the money we need.
- I know, dear.

177
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,595
But in the meantime, I'm going to do
something to give you a chance to get well.

178
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,956
AGENT: Have you come to be placed?
HELEN: Yes.

179
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,917
- What's your name?
- Faraday.

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,195
- What's that?
- Helen Faraday.

181
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,035
- Got an appointment?
- No, I haven't.

182
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,590
You'll have to wait,
all these people are ahead of you.

183
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,631
Thank you, honey. I'll see you later.

184
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,551
Going to lunch, Sally,
be back in 10 minutes.

185
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,834
MAN: Morning, Mr. Smith.

186
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,194
You remember me?

187
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,032
WOMAN: What about the job
you said you had for me?

188
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,673
SMITH: Just a minute, folks.
Just a minute...

189
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,990
JIM: You remember my dramatic sketch,
Mr. Smith?

190
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,798
SMITH: Just a minute, Jim.

191
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,870
You're waiting to see me, aren't you?
Run along, Eddy, I'll see you later.

192
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,598
Come on in, baby.

193
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,193
[Voices rise in protest]

194
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,709
WOMAN: I beg your pardon,
we've been here a long time!

195
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,360
SMITH: You'll be here a long time after
she's gone.

196
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,034
Sit down, take a load off your feet.

197
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,353
- When was the last time you worked?
- Five or six years ago.

198
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,271
- Where?
- Germany.

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,151
- Can you put over a song?
- I used to be able to.

200
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,718
- How much will you take?
- Anything I can get. It doesn't matter.

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,189
Don't tell me you're working
just for the love of your art.

202
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,794
- Who's your boyfriend?
- I haven't any.

203
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,269
- Will you work for $25 a week?
- Yes.

204
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,079
Well, you're in luck, baby.
You came to the right man.

205
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,116
I guess, maybe I can get you $30 or $40.

206
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,634
I might be able to raise it to $50.

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,558
That includes commission, of course.

208
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,393
I generally get 20%,
but seeing it's you, I'll make it 15.

209
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,118
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

210
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,633
You know that ain't a high commission...

211
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,553
considering the personal service
I give my clientele.

212
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,949
Why, the minute you put yourself
in my hands, baby...

213
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,679
your interests are closer to me
than my own. Get me?

214
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,716
Get up and walk around a bit.

215
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,759
Let's see what you got.

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,149
- What I've got?
- Let's see your legs.

217
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,554
- Is that enough?
- For the time being.

218
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,552
- What did you say your name was?
- Helen Faraday.

219
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,313
No, we got to get something different.

220
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,158
Something unusual. Something that's
easy to say and hard to forget.

221
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,314
Jones. I got it. Helen Jones.

222
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,793
But my name isn't Jones.

223
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,317
What of it? My name ain't Smith either,
but I get by just the same, don't I?

224
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,709
Hello.

225
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,075
Tell her I'm out to lunch. Hey, wait a minute.

226
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,118
Call up O'Connor's and tell him
I'm bringing him a pip.

227
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,509
You've certainly got me all hopped up, baby.

228
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
Yup, you certainly got me hopped up.

229
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,311
So, this is the pip you phoned about.

230
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,515
Where did you pick her up?

231
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,831
I ran across her a long time ago.
I've been saving her for a spot like this.

232
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,629
- Can she croon? What I need's a crooner.
- She can croon in a pinch. Who can't?

233
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,350
I got one good-looker
eating her head off on me already.

234
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,512
- I don't know if I can use another.
- All right, then. All right.

235
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,512
I got three or four spots I can
place this dame without half trying.

236
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,079
Come on, baby.

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,839
Wait a minute. What's your hurry?

238
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,717
I didn't say I wouldn't give her a tryout,
did I?

239
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,119
All right.

240
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,953
And if she makes good, it's $40 a week
and her grub the first week.

241
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,270
$50 the next, and $75 if she stays on.

242
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,874
And you take out my 15%
every Saturday night.

243
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
- I was figuring on starting her at $30.
- $30?

244
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,797
I don't handle no $30 junks. Scram.

245
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,713
All right. All right. Keep your shirt on.

246
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,788
- What did you say your name was?
- Jones.

247
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,433
Well, we'll change that. Come on,
I'll show you your dressing room.

248
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,469
What time is it?

249
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,632
A little after 6:00. What's all the rush?
You said you weren't on till 10:00.

250
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,995
Yes I know, but I have to rehearse again.

251
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,311
Johnny, darling, I forgot my hairbrush.
It's on my dresser.

252
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,990
Good heavens, where is my music?

253
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,274
- This it?
- Here you are, Mummy.

254
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,918
Thank you, Johnny. Yes, thank you.

255
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,677
Johnny is to have his soup, carrots, toast,
a glass of milk, and a pudding.

256
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,355
And don't let him stay up late.

257
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,679
Here you are, Mummy.

258
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,515
- What's that for?
- Good luck.

259
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,150
Thank you, Johnny. I need it.

260
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,639
- Goodbye, Ned.
- Goodbye, Helen.

261
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,790
I hate to see you do this.

262
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,269
Don't, Ned. Don't make it too difficult.

263
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,072
Good night, Ned. Good night, Johnny.

264
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,752
Good night, Helen.
What time will you be back?

265
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,956
It might be late, better not sit up for me.
Good night.

266
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,917
- Bye, Mummy.
- Goodbye, Johnny.

267
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,030
Come on, Johnny,
we better have our dinner now.

268
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,509
Gee whiz, are we going to have dinner
on our own every night?

269
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,397
I don't know, Johnny.

270
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,270
So you're the Blonde Venus?

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,719
Don't tell me you thought of that label
all by yourself.

272
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,633
No, Mr. O'Connor told me
it would help me in my work.

273
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,234
He would. He didn't have to think up
any name for me...

274
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,072
when I helped put this dump on the map.

275
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,072
My name's "Taxi Belle" Hooper.
Taxi for short.

276
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,390
Do you charge for the first mile?

277
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,550
Say, you trying to ride me?

278
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,751
Don't get the wrong idea.
They call me Taxi...

279
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,512
because I won't ride in nothing else.

280
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,750
Safety first, that's my motto.

281
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,798
Good drinking partners
always make bad drivers.

282
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,755
"Do I charge for the first mile?"

283
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,877
- Hello, Taxi.
- Hello.

284
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,156
How are you getting along, Miss Jones?
Almost ready?

285
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,753
Almost, thank you.

286
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,637
That "Blonde Venus" gag of mine
did the trick.

287
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,076
The house is packed.
I'll have my hands full tonight.

288
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,156
- Why were you late again? Run out of gas?
- Don't crab, I couldn't help it.

289
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,117
- Nick just came in.
- Why tell me?

290
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,919
You're not pulling any wool over my eyes.

291
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,955
I'm sick and tired of this joint.

292
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,429
O'Connor would jump all over me
if it wasn't for Nick.

293
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,351
Look what he gave me the other night.

294
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,635
- Who, O'Connor?
- No, that tightwad wouldn't give you...

295
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,119
the sleeves out of his vest.

296
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,953
This bracelet is a present from
Nick Townsend. You've heard of him.

297
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,476
The politician, loads of jack.
Runs this end of town.

298
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,994
I can hock it any day I like for $1500.

299
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,399
- $1500?
- Yeah, maybe I can get more.

300
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,278
I did him a little favour once
and this is how he came through.

301
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,557
I wish he'd ask me for some other favours,
if you know what I mean.

302
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,155
I told you once before
my name wasn't Georgy.

303
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,118
- And it ain't Oscar either.
- All right, Rudolph, have it your own way.

and run along? We don't want any trouble.

- Yellow, huh?
- Yes, maybe I am.

309
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,635
As a matter of fact, I'm scared stiff.

someone's going to get a punch in the jaw...

That's all right, O'Connor.
I rather enjoyed it.

Were you expecting them from anyone else?

You embarrass me, Mr. Townsend.
You better go now. I have to dress.

What are we going to do about tonight?
Shall I wait for you after the show?

- A great favour?

Yes, a great favour.

- She said some very nice things about you.

Well, now, don't get the wrong idea.

Taxi really did me a favour
and only a favour.

And there's nothing more between us
than just that...

406

although she'd like to give people
the impression that there is.

How am I to believe that, Mr. Townsend?

I'll give you a bracelet.
There's nothing between us, is there?

I don't accept bracelets from a stranger.

410
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,911
There's no reason
why we should remain strangers.

This kid certainly looks like you.

412

I was waiting up for you.
I guess I fell asleep. What time is it?

413
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,235
Late enough. You'd better go to bed
and get some sleep.

414

I need some too.

We have a big day ahead of us.

416
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,276
We must buy tickets and pack
and get you off quickly.

Tickets? Pack? Why, don't tell me...

Don't ask me more now. I'm too tired.

Of course, I forgot. You must be tired.

- Yes, Johnny.

454
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,394
Come along, let me take you home.
You'd have to take a taxi, anyway.

455
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,910
I'm no magician.
I can't pick her out of the air.

456
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,753
- I've done my best to find her.
- Did you try her home?

457
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,912
Sure. I tried her home
and I found out plenty. She's married.

458
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,434
- Married?
- And what's more, she's got a kid.

459
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,192
- A kid?
- And her husband's gone to Europe...

460
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,269
for his health.

461
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,952
- For his health?
- He sailed three weeks ago.

462
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,156
She ain't been home all day
and neither has the kid...

463
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,719
and nobody knows when she'll be back.

464
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,358
Maybe something's happened to them.

465
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,238
And me picking a winner
for the first time this year.

466
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,992
Blooie goes my 15%.

467
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,629
Why, the next one I get I'll nail down,
if I have to marry her.

468
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,836
What's the idea of sending for me in a rush?

469
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,229
Hello, Taxi. How are you, darling?

470
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,311
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing wrong.

471
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,755
I got a swell new number
all lined up for you.

472
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,593
I want you to start rehearsing it
this afternoon.

473
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,399
Yeah. There's a catch in this somewhere.

474
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,913
[Telephone ringing]

475
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,309
Hello.

476
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,437
O'Connor, I meant to call you up
yesterday, but I didn't get around to it.

477
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,272
Miss Jones isn't going to work
for you anymore.

478
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,228
What's the idea? She can't quit me like this.

479
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,958
- Who's that?
- Nick Townsend.

480
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,555
After me giving her all this publicity
and working up a swell following for her.

481
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,518
Do you happen to have a contract
with Miss Jones?

482
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,717
- Do you have that dame under contract?
- Have I got a million dollars?

483
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,076
I don't need no contract with my artists.
My word's as good as my bond...

484
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,276
and I stand to lose a lot of dough
if she don't show up.

485
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,591
You ought to see the drop in my business
the last two days she hasn't been here.

486
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,116
I'll talk to you about that later.
Meantime, you just forget about Miss Jones.

487
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,073
O'Connor's isn't a fit place
for you to be seen in night after night.

488
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,593
Besides, you got Johnny to look after now.

489
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,750
Who's going to take care of him
if you keep on working?

490
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,354
You can't make enough money there anyway
to send to your husband...

491
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,919
unless you meet another sucker like me.

492
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,558
And there's another thing I want you to do.

493
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,835
A friend of mine has left town
and his apartment is empty.

494
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,876
I suggest that you and Johnny
spend the summer there.

495
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,154
It'll do both of you a lot of good.

496
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,310
What do you expect for all of this?

497
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,559
Nothing. I like you, that's all.

498
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,949
And I think you've got a swell kid.

499
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,350
And I'm trying to help you both
out of a tight spot.

500
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,395
There's no use trying to fool myself,
or you, Helen.

501
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,234
I'm crazy about you, and I want you
to like me, too, if you can.

502
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,118
You're making it difficult for me not to.

503
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,710
Come on, honey, give me a little kiss,
will you? Just a little one?

504
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,873
- How are you, Mrs. Weiss?
- I'm fine, Mrs. Collins. How are you?

505
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,428
- I'm all right. It's a fine day.
- Yeah, it's a fine day.

506
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,795
- Have you seen Mrs. Faraday?
- No, I didn't see Mrs. Faraday.

507
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,518
- Was she here again?
- Yes, she was here again.

508
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,830
- She's living now with her sister, you know?
- Her sister?

509
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,957
- I thought it was her aunt.
- Maybe you are right. Maybe it was her aunt.

510
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,838
- Or maybe it was her uncle.
- Yeah, maybe it was her grandmother.

511
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,950
- Anything the matter?
- He's coming back.

512
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,871
- When?
- In about a month.

513
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,235
- Completely cured?
- Yes, he's well now.

514
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,231
- What are you going to do?
- Go back to him.

515
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,515
- Do you want to?
- He's my husband.

516
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,273
- I see. You going to tell him about me?
- No.

517
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,068
- Do you still love him?
- He needs me.

518
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,991
- So do I, Helen.
- Not the way he does.

519
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,310
You're strong, Nick. He's not.

520
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,312
JOHNNY: Did Peter Pan have wings?
MARY: No.

521
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,913
- Did he have an aeroplane?
- No.

522
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,319
Well, then how'd he fly?

523
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,994
We're going for a walk, Mrs. Faraday.

524
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,794
- Goodbye, Mummy.
- Goodbye, sweetheart. Have a nice walk.

525
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,394
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello, Mr. Townsend.

526
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,956
- Don't stay out too late, Mary.
- No, ma'am, I won't.

527
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,073
When do I say goodbye to you and the kid?

528
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,994
I kind of wish now I'd never met you.

529
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,195
No, I take that back.

530
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,192
A little of you is worth
a lifetime with any other woman.

531
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,510
Let's end this thing right, Helen.

532
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,318
Can we end it right?

533
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,631
Let's go away for a couple of weeks
together, just you and I.

534
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,358
I don't understand. Haven't you seen her?
Doesn't she come here at all?

535
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,237
Sure I have.
She generally comes around here...

536
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,231
two or three times a week for her letters.

537
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,390
But this time, I haven't seen her for 10 days.

538
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,515
Two weeks, Mr. Faraday.

539
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,715
- Ten days.
- Two weeks.

540
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,916
If you don't shut up,
I'll give you a bust in the mouth.

541
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,117
Two weeks, Mr. Faraday.
Go on, sweep the cellar.

542
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,839
- We have to go back today, don't we?
- Yes.

543
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,913
There's a boat leaving for Europe
tomorrow morning.

544
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,514
I can't stay in the same city with you
without seeing you.

545
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,512
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

546
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,270
A year, a couple of years.

547
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,192
Till I forget you.

548
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,475
I wish I were someone else.
Then I could stay here with you forever.

549
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,757
So do I, Helen, not only for my sake,
but for your own.

550
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,354
- There's trouble ahead of you.
- I know it.

551
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,756
She worked here for three weeks
and then she quit.

552
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,034
I ain't seen or heard of her since.

553
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,917
In this business, they come and they go.

554
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,558
But she wrote me
you put her under contract.

555
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,232
Raised her salary to $150 a week.

556
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,073
- She did?
- Now I know where I've seen you.

557
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,674
You're the guy whose picture Venus had
on her dressing table.

558
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,990
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I don't know.

559
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,675
- But you ask a guy named Nick Townsend...
- Shut up, if you know what's good for you.

560
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,318
Don't mind her. She's cracked.

561
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,197
Wish I could help you locate
your dame, brother.

562
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,077
But I don't know a thing.

563
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,720
In this business, they come and they go.

564
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,473
- Helen.
- Ned.

565
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,916
Where's Johnny? Where've you been?
What's happened?

566
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,310
It's been awful coming here, finding you
gone, not knowing where to look for you.

567
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,834
Your letter said you were staying
another month.

568
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,717
But I cabled you a week ago.
Where have you been?

569
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,392
Where's Johnny? I'm crazy to see him.

570
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,314
I'll bring him as fast as I can.
We didn't know you were here.

571
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,993
Where is Johnny?

572
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,958
You haven't lived here for months.
What's happened?

573
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,515
If someone were to say I'd been
untrue to you, would you believe it?

574
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,953
What do you mean "untrue"?

575
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,031
I had planned to lie about it.

576
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,908
The money you needed,
I didn't get it the way I told you.

577
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,834
- A man gave it to me.
- Is his name Townsend?

578
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,239
It doesn't matter.

579
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,199
So when you told me the manager had given
you an advance and raised your salary...

580
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,679
It was a lie.

581
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,189
Why did you do it?

582
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,555
How else could I have obtained money
so quickly?

583
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,676
I ought to be grateful to you, I suppose.

584
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,671
How much do I owe you and him for my life?

585
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,749
Ned.

586
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,116
How much, beside the $1,500
I've gotten from you? How much?

587
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,269
That's all.

588
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,954
I'll see that you get it back.
That's simple enough, isn't it?

589
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,075
Yes.

590
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,513
Well, what next?

591
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,870
I'm here, if you'll have me.

592
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,958
Go on as before?

593
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,109
You saved my life, and I'm very happy.

594
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,714
Let us go and thank this gentleman
for his kindness to us.

595
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,472
Or would you rather I shoot him dead?

596
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,711
It doesn't matter. He's not to blame.
The minute I was out of sight...

597
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,031
you took up with the first man
who could give you the things I couldn't.

598
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,554
What puzzles me now
is why you should want to come back to me.

599
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,076
- I love you, Ned.
- Send Johnny back here and clear out.

600
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,790
Go on. What are you waiting for?

601
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,916
Are you going to take
Johnny away from me?

602
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,389
You've been a rotten mother to him.
You're through with him.

603
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,232
The law will give him to me if you don't.

604
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,675
If you and your friend
try to put up a fight for him...

605
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,988
I'll take the case to court.

606
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,390
And you'll find out soon enough
who's entitled to the custody of the child.

607
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,232
I've been a good mother to Johnny.

608
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,914
Let's not dispute that point, Helen.
Johnny's all I've got left.

609
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,594
Bring him here, or tell me where he is
and I'll get him myself.

610
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,591
No, I'll bring him here.

611
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,039
- Baltimore car, please?
- Baltimore car, next car, 118.

612
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,555
What can I do for you?

613
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,076
I want the police to help find my wife
and child. They've been missing two days.

614
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,391
See Capt. Riley, room 68, down the hall,
third door on your right.

615
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,875
Isn't this your picture, Mummy?

616
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,159
- Why did you do that?
- It was such a bad picture.

617
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,356
I thought it was pretty good.

618
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,557
Where's my hat, Johnny?

619
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,233
Now, don't forget to lock the door.

620
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,915
I'll only be a few minutes,
and then we'll go home and get some sleep.

621
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,672
I'll lock the door, Mummy.

622
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,036
Finish your orange juice.

623
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,072
How about a kiss?

Mr. Faraday?

650
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,954
This is Police Headquarters.
We've got a report on your wife.

651
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,031
She's singing at the Star Cafe in Baltimore.

652
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,076
She and the child
are staying at the Brittany Hotel.

653
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,354
Do you want us to have her arrested?

654
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,431
No, I'm going after her myself.

655
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,032
She checked out about 8:00 this morning,
didn't leave a forwarding address.

656
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,317
If you're talking about Mrs. Blake,
I heard her phoning about trains to Norfolk.

657
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,549
Norfolk?

658
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,438
Can I have a timetable, please?

659
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,635
Front.

660
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,748
- Get this gentleman a local timetable.
- Yes, sir.

661
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,873
Key for 515, please.

662
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,592
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

663
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,072
Please send a maid to 151.

No, 151.

- 175.
- Johnny!

667
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,756
No, it's definitely 151.

00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,035
- 198.
- Yes.

- Come in.

680

- What's your name?
- Viola.

- Viola?
- Yes, ma'am.

682
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,634
Johnny, this is Viola. Viola, this is Johnny.

683
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,517
- How do you do, Johnny?
- Hello, Viola.

684
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,795
Viola is going to stay with you
until I come back.

685
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,517
There you are. You better not try
to get a job in this town, young lady...

686
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,478
if you want to keep out of sight.
I've had that circular for two days.

687
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,279
And there was a man here an hour ago
that I think was your husband.

688
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,349
My husband!

689
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,193
Whoever he is, I've got the feeling
he doesn't like you very much.

690
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,635
And if I were you, I'd keep away
from cabarets altogether.

691
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,153
Please don't tell anyone I was here.

692
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,959
Don't worry. I've got a kid of my own.
Good luck.

00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,352
85 cents.

694
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,950
- Is that a lot of money?
- No. I'm going to pay it right now.

695
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,316
I'm afraid I can't pay this.

696
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,548
- Why not?
- I haven't any money.

697
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,398
What'd you do, forget your purse?

698
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,471
My little boy was hungry.
We had to eat somewhere.

699
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,471
What do you think this is,
a free soup kitchen?

700
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,949
This is the third time today
I've been gypped out of a meal.

701
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,951
And, by golly,
I won't stand for any more of it.

702
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,598
I'm going to call up the police.

703
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,636
Don't call the police.

704
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,915
I'll wash dishes, clean up, anything.

705

You going to wash my dishes?

706

Go back and see the cook.

707
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,719
Come on, Johnny.
I'm going to show you a nice, big kitchen.

708
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,994
Won't that be fun?

709

- Of course you can.

Charged with vagrancy?
Guilty or not guilty?

Not guilty.

Yes, sir.

I can't pay the fine.

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,433
Please don't send me to jail.
I have a boy, 5 years old.

Where is he?

At the Plantation Hotel.

721

Who's with him?

722
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,272
He's alone. I left him asleep.

723
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,911
A woman who leads the sort of life you do
has no right to the custody of a minor child.

- There's that man out there again.
- What man?

736
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,439
Just a white man that's been
snooping up and down the street...

737

for the last couple of days.

but I guess it slipped my mind.

00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,440
I know when a white man's browsing
and when he ain't.

754
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,112
I'm going out a bit. Don't let anybody
near Johnny. I've locked him in.

755
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,634
No, ma'am.
There ain't nobody going to get by me.

756
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,037
Terribly warm today, isn't it?

757
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,712
Warm? It's hot.

758
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,950
You look as cool as a cucumber.

759
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,553
What will you have, folks?

760
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,596
I'll have some beer, cold beer.

761
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,238
Make it two.

762
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,200
What are you doing down here, big boy?

763
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,390
Nothing much. Why?

764
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,156
You don't look like the kind of a man
who comes down this way.

765
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,079
Cigarette?

766
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,916
I might ask you the same question.

767
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,069
Why?

768
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,754
You don't look anything like
these other women.

769
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,672
Give me time.

770
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,557
Couple of schooners.

771
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,438
There you are.

772
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,870
Why don't you tell me
what you're doing here?

773
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,428
I'm not doing much of anything.
On the level, I'm not.

774
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,669
Quit your kidding.

775
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,116
You've never had an idle day in your life.
I can tell.

776
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,472
You're a man who's been up and around.

777
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,790
A go-getter, that's what you are.

778
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,314
Say, you're a pretty smart girl, aren't you?

779
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,799
Am I?

780
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,519
What kind of business do you think I'm in?

781
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,469
Rich man, poor man, beggar man.

782
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,716
- Thief.
- You're getting hot.

783
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,878
Doctor, lawyer...

784
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,319
I give up.

785
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,639
But I know it's something very active
and exciting.

786
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,270
And a little dangerous, too.

787
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,870
I got to hand it to you, baby,
you almost hit the nail right on the head.

788
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,155
I thought so.
Who are you after, a bank robber?

789
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,355
Not this time.

790
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,634
Just a woman and a kid.

791
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,996
But she's given us one of the longest
and toughest chases we've ever had.

792
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,514
How do you know
she's in this neck of the woods?

793
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,830
I know, all right.
I got the whole border covered.

794
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,275
She hasn't got a chance in the world.

795
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,550
You say she got away from you before.

796
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,993
Yeah, I'll have to hand it to her.

797
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,311
I had her all sewed up in Baton Rouge,
or at least I thought so.

798
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,516
But she leaves a hot trail behind her.

799
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,558
The faster she has to travel,
the faster she has to work.

800
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,870
You ought to hear
some of the suckers squawk.

801
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,871
She takes them like Grant took Richmond.

802
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,758
I was only one day behind her in Savannah.

803
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,071
But she played a one-night stand on me
and beat it down here...

804
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,957
while I was following a chump steer...

805
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,191
all the way up to Memphis
and back for the last month.

806
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,794
Well, she had a bit of a rest, anyway.

807
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,075
You sympathise with her, don't you?

808
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,194
Well, I don't.
She ought to get wise to herself.

809
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,555
The way she's living now
isn't doing that kid any good.

810
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,313
Some people might call it mother-love,
but I don't.

811
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,994
What does a man know about mother-love?

812
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,790
Come on, let's go.

813
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,512
That's just what I was thinking.

814
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,114
I'm getting sick and tired
talking about that dame.

815
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,112
Got anything to drink at home?

816
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,191
You better take something along.

817
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,758
Hello, auntie. Just browsing around.

818
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,308
Yes, boss, I can see that.

819
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,872
- Make us a couple of highballs, auntie.
- Yes, sir.

820
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,552
Mind if I take off my coat?

821
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,949
No, make yourself at home.

822
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,675
What's the matter, baby?
Did I hurt your feelings?

823
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,751
I haven't got any anymore.

824
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,034
You mustn't talk like that.

825
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,635
You seem to be in an awful hurry.

826
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,952
Well, I ain't exactly got a lot of time
on my hands.

827
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,519
I have.

828
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,274
That's your bedroom?

829
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,669
Yes. Want to see it? I'll show it to you.

830
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,469
Come on. Nobody's going to bite you.

831
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,311
Say, who you got in there?
What are you trying to do, frame me?

832
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,400
- Hello, Mummy.
- Hello, Johnny. I'll be right with you.

833
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,152
All right, Mummy. I'll wait.

834
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,591
Say, is that your kid?

835
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,112
I'll give you three guesses,
Sherlock Holmes.

836
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,795
You're Helen Faraday!

837
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,154
What a brain!

838
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,309
What a chump I was.
You pegged me right off the bat, didn't you?

839
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,868
Yes, I pegged you right off the bat.

840
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,112
You've got your badge on your face,
not under your coat.

841
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,635
You and your whole crowd.

842
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,349
You could never have caught me,
not in a thousand years.

843
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,795
And now get out.

844
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,714
And don't forget to tell that husband
of mine that I'm giving the kid up.

845
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,310
Not because he hounded me into it,
but because I'm no good.

846
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,710
You understand? No good at all.
You get me?

847
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,077
No good for anything.

848
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,753
Except to give up the kid,
before it's too late.

849
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,030
- Daddy!
- Johnny!

850
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,913
My name's Wilson, Mr. Faraday.
I had charge of the case down here.

851
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,594
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No, thank you, Mr. Wilson.

852
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,949
When's the next train north?

853
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,917
There'll be a train to Washington
in a few minutes.

854
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,070
A ticket and a half. Section.
I'll be back in a minute.

855
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,230
Johnny, wait here. I want to talk to Mother.

856
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,311
In this envelope are $1,500.
I've been wanting to pay this for a long time.

857
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,550
It's what I owe you for my life.

858
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,839
It would have been better, Helen,
if you'd let me die.

859
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,990
You might as well know
what that money means to me.

860
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,991
It represents my life work.

861
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,878
Had I been able to exploit it properly
I could have made a fortune.

862
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,996
But I sold my rights and now we're quits.

863
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,389
Stay away from Johnny, for good.

864
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,313
Give him a chance to forget you.

865
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,312
That's the only way
you can be a good mother to him now.

866
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,556
Johnny, will you go over
and say goodbye to Mother?

867
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,198
Say goodbye to Mother?

868
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,395
Yes, Johnny.

869
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,196
CLERK: Will you sign your name here,
please?

870
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,033
Daddy says I should say goodbye to you.
Aren't you coming with us?

871
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,554
No, dear, I've got to pack. I'll come later.

872
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,552
But there's nothing to pack.
Why aren't you coming with us?

873
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,398
I'll come later.

874
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,031
Be a good boy and go with Daddy.

875
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,917
When will you come? Tomorrow?

876
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,912
Yes, tomorrow.

877
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,788
Gee whiz, I wish you were coming now.

878
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,154
CLERK: How about a pillow, sister?
HELEN: [Slurring] I don't need a pillow.

879
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,916
CARDPLAYERS: Go on, beat it.

880
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,670
Get out of my way.

881
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,750
Snap out of it, kid.
Tomorrow is another day.

882
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,314
Maybe for you, but not for me.

883
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,751
Why, what's the matter with tomorrow?

884
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,196
I'm going to kill myself tomorrow,
that's what's the matter with it.

885
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,557
Me, too. Make a hole in the water.

886
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,071
Why are you going to kick off?

887
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,792
'Cause that's the way I feel.
Isn't that reason enough?

888
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,189
That's no reason for anything.

889
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,716
I've got a good reason. Haven't got a dime.

890
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,878
Never had any money and I never will have.

891
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,276
Is that all? I can fix that.

892
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,477
In this envelope are $1,500.

893
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,915
It represents my life work.

894
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,318
Had I had time to exploit it properly,
I could have made a fortune!

895
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,030
Queen of Hearts, that's me.

896
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,951
HELEN: Queen of Hearts!
CARDPLAYER: Get out of my way!

897
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,075
CARDPLAYER: You don't get out of here...

898
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,309
- I'll crown you.
- Oh, shut up!

899
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,433
I'm not going to stay in this dump anymore.

900
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,431
I'm going to find myself a better bed.

901
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,671
Don't you think I can? Just watch!

902
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,993
Hello, Townsend, how's the market?

903
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,877
I don't know. Just flew back from Venice.

904
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,995
Going back to the States?

905
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,672
Yes, day after tomorrow. How's the show?

906
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,159
It's just one of those revues.

I, for one, don't think I'll sit through it.

908
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,590
Say, what do you happen to know
about this Helen Jones?

909
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,796
You don't mean to tell me
you're interested in her!

I didn't say I was, did I?

911
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,717
They say she came over from South America
about five months ago.

912
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,917
When she got here, she used man after man
as a stepping stone.

913
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,309
Then all of a sudden,
Paris went wild over her.

914
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,995
That's all I know, except they say
she's as cold as the proverbial icicle.

915
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,680
- That's pretty cold, isn't it?
- It's cold enough for me.

Well, if it isn't old Nick himself.

919
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,475
I expected you to pop up some day.

920

If this is a dream, Helen,
I hope I never wake up.

Let me come backstage, will you?

a single day since I last saw you.

It certainly is great to see you again, Helen.

How did you happen to come to Paris?
How long have you been here?

Thank you.
I've got a million questions to ask you.

950
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,955
Better not ask them, Nick.
I'd rather not talk about the past.

Well, let's talk about the present.

Are you happy?
Are you in love with anybody?

No, it's tragic to me.

Wish I were necessary to your happiness.
But I guess I never did mean much to you.

Maybe you did.
Anyway, nothing means much to me now.

Home, I suppose, with his father.

And then what happened?

1059
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,435
I've forgotten.

1060
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,479
Don't you remember you came to a dragon
sitting in an automobile?

1061
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,948
Yes, I remember that.

1062
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,828
And you went and saw a lot of princesses
taking a bath, didn't you?

1063
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,196
Yes, I suppose I did.

1064
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,759
What did you do then?

1065
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,276
I told him to go away,
but he wouldn't until I granted him a wish.

1066
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,679
What was the wish?

1067
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,996
He wanted to see me again.

1068
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,510
You didn't want any other wish, did you?

1069
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,036
No, I was very sentimental in those days
and very foolish.

1070
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,438
Why were you foolish?

1071
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,440
That night you went to a theatre, didn't you?

1072
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,392
Yes, I went to a theatre.

1073
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,837
And then you saw Mummy on the stage
and she was very beautiful.

1074
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,870
And then your heart went like this.

1075
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,028
I didn't know much about women
in those days.

1076
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,232
You're telling it all different.

1077
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,914
You tell it, Mummy.
What happened when you saw him?

1078
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,276
- I don't know, Johnny, dear.
- Don't you remember, Mummy?

1079
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,152
I could hardly sing.

1080
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,799
What happened then?

1081
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,350
You could never guess. We went walking.

1082
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,351
Please walk, Mummy.

1083
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:46,992
And then you came to a park and
there was a dark tree and a yellow moon.

1084
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,794
You're not doing it right at all.
You're supposed to kiss each other.

1085
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,636
Better be a good boy
and go to sleep, Johnny.

1086
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,473
- Your mother's got to go away now.
- All right, Daddy.

1087
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,670
[Helen singing in German]

1088
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,511
Let me stay with you both, Ned.

1089
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,750
That's where you belong, Helen.
