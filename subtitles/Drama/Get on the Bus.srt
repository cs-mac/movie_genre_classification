1
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,691
- Are you ready, Virge?
- Anytime.

2
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,653
Turn him out!

3
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,777
- Ya-hoo!
- Go get him, Bo!

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,535
Make time, Bo!
Get on him, Bo!

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,134
<i>Turn him over, Bo!</i>

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>Get him over! Get him over!</i>

7
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,529
<i>Good time! Good!</i>

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,537
What was my time?

9
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,048
- Five-eight.
- Five-

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,298
That's good enough to win just about
every prize they got at that rodeo!

27
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,209
Bo, when you was five,

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,053
I just throwed you on a horse- smack-

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,057
and there you was ridin'.

30
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,250
- Remember?
- Yup.

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,656
When you was eight,
I throwed you in the creek- splash-

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,691
and there you was swimmin'.

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,015
- Ain't that right?
- Sure, Virge.

34
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,449
Splash!

35
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,451
Bo, you're 21 years old...

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,577
and we're on our way to
a big city- Phoenix, Arizona.

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,577
It's time you met up with a gal.

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,691
A gal?

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,135
<i>Oh, it ain't nothin' to be scared of.</i>

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,132
<i>In a way, women and swimmin'
is pretty much the same.</i>

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,496
You got good reflexes, boy.
You'll make out just fine.

42
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,534
So long, Bo.

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,451
<i>Bring back some prize money.</i>

44
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,259
Take it easy, Orville!

45
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,850
Two for Phoenix, Arizona.

46
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,936
We goin' down for the rodeo.

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,496
I figure I'm gonna win me just about
every prize they got down there.

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,497
Well, that's nice.

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,817
Now sit down someplace.
You got a long ride ahead of you.

50
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,500
<i>- Bo, the lady's hat!
- Hmm?</i>

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,891
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- Why don't you look where you're goin'?

52
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,932
It was an accident, sir.
He ain't used to travelin'.

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,410
- This is his first time off the ranch.
- Virge, that's a lie!

54
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,095
That's a lie and you know it!
I been all the way to Helena.

55
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,968
That was when he was 12 years old-
to have his tonsils out.

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,091
Well, that still counts!

57
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,290

<i>I've been thinkin'.</i>

64
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,457
You know, about what you said.

65
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,457
What was that?

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,653
You know. About me findin' a gal.

67
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,216
Oh, what- What about it, Bo?

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,259
I don't know anything about gals, Virge.

69
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,655
Nothin' at all.

70
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,171
Well, that's what I mean.
It's about time you learned.

71
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,849
It ain't nothin' to be scared of, Bo.

72
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,098
You know how much you like swimmin'
when you got used to it.

73
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,008
Besides, I know the idea
crossed your mind once or twice.

74
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,973
I seen you lookin' at them
pictures in Orville's magazines.

75
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,210
<i>♪ I'll give to you a feathery bed ♪</i>

76

♪ With downy pillows for your head ♪

77
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,373
Maybe I glanced at them pictures
a couple of times.

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,809
But if I do find me a gal,

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,098
it ain't gonna be one of them gals
from all those magazines.

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,370
I already decided.

81
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,214
I'm gonna get me a...

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,251
angel.

83
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,531
<i>- An angel?
- That's right.</i>

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,011
I wouldn't set my sights
too high if I were you, Bo.

85
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,369
You just figure on pickin' out
some plain-lookin' little ol' gal,

86
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,976
<i>with a cooperatin'nature
and a good personality.</i>

87
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,735
I mean, we gotta be realistic.

88
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,739
What's some angel gonna want
with a cowhand like you?

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,409
What's that got to do with it?

90
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,373
That steer this mornin',
he didn't wanna get throwed, did he?

91
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,411
<i>Well, I throwed him.</i>

92
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,731
Some wild horse you're breakin',
he don't wanna get broke, do he?

93
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,288
But you don't let
what he wants stop you.

94
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,218
What makes you think
a girl's any different?

95
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,133
This trip is gonna be
mighty educational.

100
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,769
She gives me any trouble,
she's gonna find herself...

101
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,495
with them little old wings
just pinned right to the ground!

102
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,978
<i>Oh!</i>

103
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,775
- Mornin', ma'am!
- What are you doing?

104
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,772
Push-ups, ma'am.
Gotta get the kinks outta my bones.

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,016
Hey, cowboy,
get up off that floor!

106
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,093
Thirty! Whew!
I can do 30 set-ups, too.

107
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,775
Pipe down and stop botherin' folks.
You woke up everybody in the bus.

108
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,649
Well, it's mornin', ain't it?
It's time to get up.

109
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,340
That's the trouble with you city folk.

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,054
Lay around in bed all day long...

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,740
and you get soft.

112
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,970
Hey, when do we stop for breakfast?

113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,456
Look! There's a place!
Hey, you passed it!

114
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,697
Look. This ain't no taxi.
It's a public vehicle.

115
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,415
Stops where it's scheduled to stop
and no place else.

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,014
And meanwhile what's
a passenger supposed to do?

117
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,011
Just starve to death?

118
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,371
Poor old lady back there, you can hear
her stomach rumblin' from here!

119
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,452
Bo! You're out in civilization!

120
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,334
Forgive him, ma'am.
He didn't hear a thing.

121
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,538
Our next official bus stop is Grace's
Diner, a couple of miles up the road.

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,249
That's where we stop-
Grace's.

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,500
Can we get some breakfast in here?

124
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,337
Hello, Grace.

125
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,372
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

126
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,849
- Hello, Elma. You the passenger?
- That's right.

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,370
- She's goin' for the symphony concert.
- And to see my sister.

128
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,815
How about a little service?

129
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,090
Sounds like your passengers are hungry.

130
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,176
Oh, I'll go ahead and wait on 'em.

131
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,814
Ah, some crazy cowboys.

132
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,579
That young one there,
he's a real troublemaker.

133
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,577
His friend ain't so bad.

134
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,612
He just sits in the back of the bus
playin' his guitar.

135
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,176
A little music's real nice
when you're drivin' along.

136
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,138
I'm very fond of music myself.

137
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,973
Are you, Grace?
I didn't know that.

138
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,412
Yeah. I'm a very musical person.

139
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,257
Well, come on in.
I'll fix you somethin' to eat.

140
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,576
Ahh.

141
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,213
Ma'am, uh-

142
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,410
Ma'am, I-

143
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,136
Give me about three hamburgers.

144
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,769
- Three? How do you want 'em?
- Raw.

145
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,175
- Honest?
- Well, sure.

146
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,014
That's the only way to eat 'em, with
a big hunk of onion and some piccalilli.

147
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,017
And a piece of pie.

148
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,452
And you'd better set a quart of milk
beside him. He's still a growin' boy.

149
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,008
- Well, all right.
- Pie and coffee for me.

150
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,415
I'm still growin' too,
but in a different way.

151
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,260
Gotta watch my figure.

152
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,973
Real nice place you got here.

153
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,534
As much as I've seen of it, anyway.

154
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,531
What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,009
<i>I was just thinkin'.</i>

156
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,815
I'll bet that apartment you
got upstairs is real nice too.

157
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,979
Love to see it sometime,
how you got it fixed up and all.

158
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,335
Hmm, don't pour it!

159
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,090
Ahh.

160
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,098
Okay, mister, let's get goin'.
We're never gonna make Phoenix...

161
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,780
sittin' around this broken-down,
miserable restaurant.

162
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,249
Hey! You!

163
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,251
All aboard, folks.

164
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,410
Now wait a minute!

165
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,890
I happen to be the owner of this here
broken-down, miserable restaurant.

166
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,416
Don't pay him no mind. You're only the
twelfth human bein' he's seen this year.

167
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,930
- Just his way of talkin'.
- Well, it ain't a way I care a lot for.

168
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,818
- I don't blame you a bit.
- Virge!

169
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,931
Bo, you're plumb wrong
about this place.

170
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,176
It's nice and clean and well-run!

171
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,212
And you certainly couldn't ask
for a prettier or a more charmin' owner.

172
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,729
- Wait a minute, cowboy.
- I mean it, ma'am.

173
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,574
And I wanna apologize for
this young barbarian here.

174
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,255
- Hey, what ya doin'?
- It's just somethin' I seen in a movie.

175
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,974
- It don't offend you, I trust.
- Oh, of course not.

176
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,455
Only you just caught me
up short, that's all.

177
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,451
Hand kissin'?

178
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,140
That ain't my idea
on how to get a gal.

179
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,177
- We know that, Bo.
- Bye, Grace.

180
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,177
So long, honey.

181
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,929
- You the one that plays the guitar?
- That's right, ma'am.

182
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,052
I'm real fond of music myself.

183
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,136
All aboard.
Bus loadin' right away.

184
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,490
Good-bye, Grace.
See you in a couple of days.

185
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,497
- So long, Carl.
- Come on, cowboy.

186
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,373
- Good luck at the rodeo, cowboy.
- Thanks, ma'am.

187
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,248
Come back real soon, you hear?

188
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,053
- So long, Carl.
- So long, Grace.

189
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,648
<i>Come back soon, hear?</i>

190
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,609
Talk about angels. How about her?

191
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,689
Well,

192
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,419
she may be an angel, Virge,

193
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,175
but she ain't my angel.

194
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,133
How can you tell?

195
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,171
I'll know.

196
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,171
When I see my angel,

197
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,899
I'll know right off the bat.

198
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,730
Fasten your seat belts and take off your
coats. We're startin' to lose altitude.

199
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,693
Landin' in Phoenix
in about an hour.

200
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,049
Well, I'm sorry to leave you folks,
but this is where we get off.

201
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,133
"Welcome, cowboys.

202
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,297
The town is yours."
Yee-haw!

203
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,178
That's us, Virge! That's us!

204
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,491
So long, fellas.
Don't let him take any wooden nickels.

205
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,895
I'll be drivin' you back
tomorrow night.

206
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,897
That is, if you're still in one piece.

207
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,057
Don't you worry about us, mister.
We're gonna be all right.

208
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,172
You just drive your bus.
Come on, Virge, let's go register.

209
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,177
Is that our hotel?

210
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,532
<i>Bo!</i>

211
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,612
Bo, wait on the corner.

212
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,935
You gotta try to remember:

213
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,972
They go when it's green,
they stop when it's red.

214
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,059
Never seen so many gals.

215
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,375
Must be a hundred head of 'em.

216
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,376
Bo!

217
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,735
Wait till it turns green.

218
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,169
♪ Kiss me quick and go
my honey ♪

219
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,575
♪ Kiss me quick and go ♪

220
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,373

221
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,930
<i>Bo, you're gonna wash yourself down
to a nub! What are you doin' anyway?</i>

222
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,739
Ain't got nothin' like this at home.

223
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,328
Shower and bath at the same time!

224
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,169
Bo, you have a terrible habit
of overdoin' everything.

225
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,212
- Come on!
- Yee-haw!

226
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,656
<i>Listen, Bo,
if you're gonna take all night,</i>

227
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,691
<i>I'm gonna step across the street.</i>

228
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,294
<i>That there Blue Dragon place
seems kind of interesting.</i>

229
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,379
You go ahead, Virge. I'll be over there
in a couple of minutes.

230
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,090
Just wait outside.

231
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,769
- Why ain't you outside where you belong?
- Aah!

232
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,892
I've heard enough of you,
you ignorant hillbilly!

233
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,534
Now get out there
and get to work!

234
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,179
You'd better change into
your costume, honey. You're late.

235
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,612
And he called me an ignorant hillbilly.
How do you like that?

236
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,339
Well, ain't ya?
I don't mean ignorant.

237
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,849
I mean, but you do
come from the Ozarks.

238
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,416
I ain't sung hillbilly since I was-

239
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,373
Well, not since
I turned "chantooze."

240
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,137
I've been tryin' to be somebody.

241
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,009
Can you imagine if Hildegarde...

242
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,290
was jumpin' down between her numbers,

243
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,014
sittin' in some truck driver's lap?

244
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,853
I don't know why you just don't quit.

245
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,851
I can't.

246
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,851
Look.

247
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,329
I don't get paid till Wednesday.

248
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,968
I owe for my room and everything.

249
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,017
Besides that,

250
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,177
it took me too long to get this far.

251
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,818
What's that line for?

252
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,931
- That line?
- Uh-huh.

253
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,409
You might say that this line here...

254
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,419
is the history of my life up till now.

255
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,412
- See right there where it starts?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,255
That's River Gulch,
the little old town where I was born.

257
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,855
River Gulch.
I never even heard of it.

258
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,971
Well, it ain't there anymore anyway.

259
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,017
Floods come and washed us all away-

260
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,700
all except me and my baby sister, Nan.

261
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,169
- Oh.
- I just picked her up...

262
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,293
and took her along here, this line.

263
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,378
- Yeah?
- Till we got to Lubbock, Texas.

264
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,020
- You know what happened there?
- What?

265
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,415
Nan got this job as a waitress,

266
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,219
and I got to workin'
in Liggett's Drugstore.

267
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,259
- Yeah?
- And, uh, this amateur contest opened.

268
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,575
And, uh, Nan said to me,

269
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,134
"Honey, why don't you enter
yourself in that contest?

270
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,131
You've been watchin' people in movies."

271
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,416
Well, Nan and I used
to live in the movies.

272
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,892
"You've been watchin' people put over
their songs and gestures," you know.

273
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,939
And so, um, I did it, and I won it.

274
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,773
- First prize?
- No. Second prize.

275
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,610
A couple of boys jugglin' milk bottles,
they won first prize.

276
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,056
Anyway, that's how I got
my direction and all.

277
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,057
Direction?

278
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,091
Oh, sure.

279
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,855
If you don't have a direction,
you just keep going around in circles.

280
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,737
And look. You can see by this
just how straight my direction is.

281
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,856
River Gulch-
that's where I started-

282
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,778
this is where I am now,
and look where I'm goin'.

283
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,609
- Where?
- Hollywood and Vine!

284
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,857
Look, straight as an arrow.

285
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,211
River Gulch- whew-
Hollywood and Vine!

286
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,570
What happens when you get there?

287
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,413
What happens?
Honey, you get discovered.

288
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,936
You get tested,
with options and everything!

289
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,018
And you get treated
with a little respect, too.

290
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,651
What's goin' on in here?

291
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,970
She's changing into her costume.

292
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,614
You want her to go out there naked?

293
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,129
Get out there and
take care of them tables.

294
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,495
Come on, Dinah Shore.

295
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,339
Them cowboys is gettin' real lonesome.

296
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,337
Zip her up.

297
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,250
Go zip yourself up!

298
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,451
He looks like the safest.

299
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,417
- Oh, I never know what to say to 'em.
- It's easy.

300
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,129
Just say some cute
little joke, like, um,

301
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,650
"Hello, mister. Buy me a drink.
I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton."

302
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,692
That's a real cute one. Go on.

303
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,251
Hello, mister.

304
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,735
- Howdy.
- I wonder if you'd buy me a drink.

305
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,289
I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton.

306
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,494
That's a good one.
It sure is.

307
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,214
Whiskey for the lady.
Beer for me.

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,259

Hey, what ya doin'?
Let go of me.

317
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,219
- That ain't whiskey!

00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,252
Last night I had to drink
15 tea and sodas.

My name is Beauregard Decker, ma'am.

391
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,450
I'm 21 years old and I own my own ranch
up in Timber Hill, Montana,

392
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,492
where I got a fine herd
of Hereford cattle, a dozen horses,

393
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,010
and the finest sheep and hogs
and chickens in the country.

394
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,058
Now, I come down for the rodeo tomorrow
with the idea in mind...

395
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,570
of findin' me an angel,
and you're it.

396
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,413
Now, I don't have a whole lot of time
for sweet talkin' around the bush,

397
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,253
so I'd be much obliged to you
if you'd just step outside with me...

398
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,291
into the fresh air.

399
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,291
W- What'd you say?

400
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,129
My name is Beauregard Decker, ma'am.

401
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,975
I'm 21 years old and I own my own ranch
up in Timber Hill, Montana, where I-

402
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,250
Yes, I- I know.
I heard all that part.

403
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,656
- Okay, let's get outta here.
- No, uh-

404
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,608
I'm mighty grateful to you
for what you did,

405
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,291
but, uh, we're-we're not allowed
to go out with the customers.

406
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,057
But you could buy me a drink
if you wanted.

407
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,569
I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton.

408
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,578
Don't ever use the stuff.
Besides, I ain't got time for a drink.

409
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,419
- I wanna be in bed by 10:00.
- Huh?

410
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,930
I'm ridin' in the rodeo tomorrow,
so I need my sleep.

411
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,976
- Oh.
- So will you come on?

412
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,136
Well, we're not supposed to-

413
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,450
- Bo.
- Hold my hat, will you, Virge?

414
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,775
- Where you goin'?
- Splash!

415
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,416
You're sure a good singer.

416
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,452
I'm a "chantooze."

417
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,451
Oh.

418
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,054
That's why I call myself Cherie.

419
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,689
That's my name: Cherie.

420
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,930
That's all the name you got?

421
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,937
That's all you need.

422
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,530
Like Hildegarde,
she's a "chantooze" too.

423
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,211
Cherry.

424
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,174
Cherie! It's French.

425
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,455
It means "dear one."

426
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,095
Well, my name's kinda French:
Beauregard. It means somethin' too.

427
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,097
What's it mean?

428
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,053
I ain't gonna tell you.
You'll laugh at me.

429
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,893
- No, I wouldn't.
- Yes, you would.

430
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,056
Honest, I wouldn't.

431
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,774
Well,

432
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,210
it means "good lookin'."

433
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,059
I never told that to a single person
in my whole life.

434
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,569
My ma was French.
She gave it to me.

435
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,213
That's a real pretty name.

436
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,217
Beauregard.

437
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,613
<i>You are, too. Real beauregard.</i>

438
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,253
Everybody just calls me "Bo."

439
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,739
- Cherry.
- Cherie.

440
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,817
It was real nice the way
you made everybody shut up in there,

441
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,369
like you had respect for me.

442
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,852
You made them have respect too.

443
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,372
- I liked that.
- You did?

444
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,412
- Yes.
- How about me? Did you like me too?

445
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,417
Well, when I first saw you,

446
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,100
I thought you was
some kind of a hooligan,

447
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,893
yellin' and stompin' like that.

448
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,095
But when I realized
you was doin' it for me,

449
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,609
I was attracted to you.

450
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,617
Attracted?

451
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,816
You was?

452
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,500
- I still am.
- You still are?

453
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,736
Really attracted?

454
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,851
Uh-huh.

455
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,500
'Course, it's only what you might call
a physical attraction.

456
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,531
Physical?

457
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,091
I mean, you're so
big and strong and-

458
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,569
well, so darn healthy-lookin'.

459
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,016
Guess I am in pretty
good shape for the rodeo.

460
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,570
'Course, you gotta be when you're
competin' in all five class-A events.

461
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,011
Cherry.

462
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,177
Beauregard.

463
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,699
Pardon me, sir.
Have you seen Cherie?

464
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,533
That little gal you was settin' with?

465
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,009
No. She went off with another customer.

466
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,257
I was worried.
It's about time for the second show.

467
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,089
Virge, I want you
to be the first to know.

468
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,053
After all, it was really your idea.

469
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,057
What was?

470
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,058
I found me that gal,
just like you said.

471
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,529
Cherry and me- we're engaged.

472
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,258
- We're what?
- Engaged.

473
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,611
Virge, I want you to meet Cherry.

474
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,617
Cherry, this here's old Virge.

475
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,732
- He'll be livin' with us, of course.
- We already met.

476
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,892
Now wait a minute. Somebody's got
the wrong idea around here.

477
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,897
What do you mean, Cherry?

478
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,818
My name ain't Cherry.
I told you, it's Cherie.

479
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,295
I can't say it fancy like that.

480
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,934
Anyway, what's the matter with Cherry?

481
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,255
Well, it ain't dignified.

482
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,774
<i>- Bo-
- Now, tomorrow afternoon...</i>

483
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,175
is the preliminaries for the rodeo.

484
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,177
We'll get married out there!

485
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,133
Married? Out where?

486
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,137
At the rodeo.

487
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,412
Tomorrow night, after the finals, we'll
all three of us catch the bus back.

488
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,452
Bo, you don't know nothin'
about this gal!

489
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,539
I know she's my angel.
That's good enough for me.

490
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,010
<i>Well, your angel
was hustlin' me for drinks!</i>

491
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,216
Sixty cents a shot!

492
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,009
And come to find out, it weren't
whiskey she was drinkin'. It was tea!

493
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,614
Of course it was, Virge!

494
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,890
Angels don't touch no liquor!

495
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,057
Cherry, I just gotta kiss you again!
I can't help myself!

496
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,217
<i>Stop! Cut it out!</i>

497
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,296
- Everybody's looking.
- Let 'em look!

498
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,769
Ain't no crime for two people
to show a little affection,

499
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,175
especially when
they're gettin' married tomorrow!

500
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,689
Cherry, I just know
we're gonna be very happy together...

501
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,697
<i>till death do us part!</i>

502
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,937
Hey, I better get goin'.
I gotta get into bed.

503
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,096
Virge, come on. Let's get goin'.

504
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,538
Cherry, we're gonna make all the rest
of the plans in the mornin'.

505
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,810
But meanwhile,
for a weddin' present...

506
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,688
I'm gonna get you a deep freeze,
or an electric washer,

507
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,732
or any other major appliance you want.

508
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,136
<i>Good night, darlin'.</i>

509
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,615
Come on, honey. You're on again.

510
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,129
What's the matter? What happened?

511
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,610
You know somethin'?
I'm not quite sure.

512
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,737
This whole thing is probably my fault.

513
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,251
I told you it was about time you started
learnin' somethin' about women.

514
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,014
Now, I ain't sayin'
this particular gal you picked out...

515
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,614
ain't a good one to practice on.

516
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,852
But a fella can't go around marryin'
the first gal he meets.

517
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,891
Why not?

518
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,096
You better get your mind
on that rodeo.

519
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,490
Fellas back at the ranch
bet their money on you.

520
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,140
Anyhow, she has no intention
of marryin' you.

521
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,288
Oh, yes, she has, Virge.

522
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,615
She's got a physical attraction to me.

523
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,975
- Oh.
- She said so herself.

524
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,131
Oh!

525
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,420
- Virge?
- Yeah, Bo?

526
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,936
What's the difference between a-

527
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,531
a physical attraction and, well,
just a regular attraction?

528
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,938
Well, a gal can be
attracted to a fella...

529
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,733
for lots of reasons.

530
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,249
His mind, for instance.

531
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,974
- His mind?
- Sure.

532
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,490
Like if he's smart or reads poetry...

533
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,929
or somethin'.

534
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,614
- No kiddin'?
- That's right.

535
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,217
- I can read and write.
- Mm-hmm.

536
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,815
I don't know no poetry.

537
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,455
But I can recite the Gettysburg Address.
Would that count?

538
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,011
It might, Bo.
I doubt it, but it might.

539
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,937
♪ Magic has me in its spell ♪

540

<i>I told you, we're gonna be married!</i>

548
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,892
<i>- I'm just wakin' her up for breakfast.
Cherry.</i>

549
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,932
<i>Cherry, wake up! It's me, Beauregard!
Good morning, Cherry!</i>

550
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,971
She didn't say nothin' to me
about gettin' engaged.

551
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,450
- Why's it so dark in here? Let's get
a little air. - I don't allow callers-

552
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,532
Cherry, come on, get outta bed. We gotta
be in time for the parade at 10:30.

553
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,652
- Listen, young man!
- Ma'am, I don't want trouble from you.

554
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,975
How do I know
that you're engaged to her?

555
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,376
Cherry, wake up and tell her
you know me!

556
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,371
What?

557
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,530
Oh, it's you!

558
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,128
- You see? She knows me.
- For the love-

559
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,455
- I don't know what's goin' on in this-
- Cherry?

560
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,611
<i>Come on, come on. Get outta bed.</i>

561
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,810
<i>We gotta get goin' because
we're gonna be married today,</i>

562
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,896
<i>and we got a lot of things to do.</i>

563
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,774
What's the idea
of bustin' in here like that?

564
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,970
What time is it, anyway?

565
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,933
Well, it's after 9:00.
I've been up for hours.

566
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,092
9:00? I didn't even
get to bed till 5:00!

567
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,097
5:00?

568
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,417
Well, no wonder
you're so pale and white.

569
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,379
Cherry, know what that is out there?

570
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,371
That's the sun.

571
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,338
Will you get outta here
'fore I call the police?

572
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,655
You shouldn't stay up
so late like that.

573
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,731
When we get up
to the Suzie Q Ranch,

574
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,733
we're gonna be in the old sack
every night at 7:30.

575
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,091
Listen, Bo. I think we oughta
get somethin' straight.

576
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,650
I have no intention in
the world of marryin' you,

577
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,055
so you might as well
get it out of your head.

578
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,933
We're gonna talk all that over
on the way to the parade.

579
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,534
You see, Cherry,
the whole problem is that...

580
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,932
you just haven't had time yet
to get attracted to my mind.

581
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,133
Your mind? I know all about your mind
I ever wanna know.

582
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,854
And do you know I can say
the Gettysburg Address?

583
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,529
Come bustin' in here
like a wild Indian.

584
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,770
Sometime-

585
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,817
Cherry?

586
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,898
Well, what?

587
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,971
"Four score and seven years ago,

588
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,257
"our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation,

589
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,656
"conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition...
- Bo?

590
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,533
"that all men are created equal.

591
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,009
"Now we're engaged in a great civil war,

592
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,410
"to determine whether that nation or any nation...
- Bo, listen.

593
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,094
"so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure. - Bo-

594
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,609
"We are met here on a great
battlefield of that war.

595
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,089
I hate parades. I'm not goin'.

596
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,172
"The world will not long remember,
nor little note, what we say here,

597
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,934
"but it will never forget
what they did here.

598
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,858
- Bo?
- "Rather it is for us, the living,

599
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,857
Please let me sleep.

600
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,939
to be so concentrated
and so dedicated-"

601
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,332
If you go any further, Mr. Lincoln,
you're gonna miss the parade.

602
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,931
- Elliot, got anything?
- Great.

603
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,580
- Would you hold it, please, miss?
- Hold it?

604
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,260
<i>Uh, we're from Life.</i>

605
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,697
<i>Life Magazine?</i>

606
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,892
<i>That's right.
"Life Goes To A Rodeo."</i>

607
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,654
Or "rodeo" to you.

608
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,380
They wanted me to ride
in the parade too, but I said,

609
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,929
"If I ride in it,
how can I see it?"

610
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,898
Just come right in here, Cherry.
Excuse us, everybody.

611
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,938
Come on up here.
We're gonna see us a parade real good.

612
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,249
Can't we find a place
to sit down, Bo?

613
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,940
I'm tired.
You didn't let me get no sleep.

614
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,774
- You hop right up here on my shoulder.
- No!

615
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,930
You can rest, and see the parade
at the same time!

616
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,848
- You put me down!
- Hey, this is a nice arrangement!

617
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,500
Can you see everything?

618
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,890
Too much.

619
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,931
Boy, look at that!

620
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,011
I'm glad I'm not in this parade,
so I can see it.

621
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,051
Here comes some of Daniel Boone's men!

622
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,132
<i>We're seein' us a real hootenanny
of a parade, ain't we, Cherry?</i>

623
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,251
<i>Look at them boys dancin' it up.</i>

624
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,373
<i>Ain't they talented?
Ain't they resplendent, Cherry?</i>

625
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,060
Hey, Cherry, look!
There's cowgirls, and they got-

626
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,777
Hi!

627
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,256
<i>Hi! Where is he?</i>

628
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,372
- You gonna marry him?
- No!

629
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,570
Then you're gonna go to the rodeo?

630
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,413
- No.
- Then what you gonna do?

631
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,456
Run away.

632
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,731
Hey, what's goin' on up there, Cherry?

633
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,896
<i>Who were you signalin' at?</i>

634
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,259
To... Vera.
She's a friend of mine.

635
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,612
She's gonna get two tickets to
the rodeo this afternoon to watch you.

636
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,335
Get two tickets for the rodeo.

637
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,178
Two?

638
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,418
Hey, there's ol' Virge!
Ya-hoo!

639
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,452
- Whoa! Stop it!
- Virge, here we are!

640
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,492
We been watchin' you, Virge,
and you're doin' just-

641
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,259
Hello, there. Stop it, Bo!

642
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,130
Oh, sorry, lady.
You're over there in the bleachers.

643
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,171
Over there?

644
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,297
But it's so much nicer
right here in the shade.

645
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,490
That's right.

646
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,498
Come on, honey.

647
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,059
Oh, they got us over here
with the livestock.

648
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,216
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

649
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,333
<i>we go into our first event of the
afternoon: cowboy saddle bronc riding.</i>

650
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,769
<i>The contestant is required
to ride ten seconds...</i>

651
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,090
<i>until the signal
from our timer's horn.</i>

652
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,210
<i>That was Duane Howard of
Minnewaukin, North Dakota.</i>

653
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,098
The second rider up is Guy Weeks.

654
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,296
And here's our next rider,
Casey Tibbs-

655
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,729
<i>five times World's Champion
Saddle Bronc Rider,</i>

656
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,017
<i>twice All-Around
Champion Cowboy of the World.</i>

657
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,329
<i>- Watch the work of our pickup man
as he makes the recovery of Casey Tibbs,</i>

658
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,488
<i>Fort Pierre, South Dakota.</i>

659
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,737
Cherie, wake up! It's him!

660
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,289
- Tell him to go away.
- No, I mean it's him.

661
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,769
He's gonna ride now.

662
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,688
Oh, we're at the rodeo.

663
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,130
What's that green thing.

664
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,820
That ain't green, Virge.
You know what that is?

665
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,171
♪ It's that old black magic ♪

666
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,296
♪ That's gonna make me win ♪

667
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,571
What's that he's got around his neck?

668
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,049
Ain't that your scarf?

669
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,092
So, that's where it went!

670
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,098
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a newcomer here this afternoon.</i>

671
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,212
<i>- From Timber Hill, Montana, Bo Decker.
- Go!</i>

672
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,771
<i>- I can't look!
- You are stuck on him! I knew it!</i>

673
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,329
<i>Good work, Bo.
How about a hand?</i>

674
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,096
Hey, Cherry! Ya-hoo!

675
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,776
<i>Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo!</i>

676
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,893
<i>- Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- You know, I think he is crazy.</i>

677
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,733
Sure he is.
Crazy as a bedbug.

678
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,856
I told you he was.

679
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,897
He thinks we're gettin' married
this afternoon here at the rodeo.

680
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,580
What makes him think that?

681
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,611
I don't know.

682
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,089
Sure weren't nothin' I said.

683
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,416
This mornin' after the parade,

684
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,652
he dragged me down to the city hall
and bought us a marriage license.

685
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,254
You didn't sign nothin', did ya?

686
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,336
Well, I had to do somethin'.

687
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,850
He was makin' such a fuss
in front of all those people.

688
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,891
Honey.

689
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,857
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's a ride to watch.

690
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,689
<i>The cowboy has drawn one of the toughest
horses in our bareback riding contest.</i>

691
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,497
Don't fall off.

692
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,498
- He fell off.
- I'm sorry.

693
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,692
<i>Hey, is that a diamond?</i>

694
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,452
Well, it ain't exactly a diamond,

695
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,691
but it ain't exactly
not a diamond either.

696
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,934
He paid $43 for it.

697
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,893
- No kiddin'.
- Plus tax.

698
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,132
He made me take it,
but it ain't on my finger.

699
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,296
And neither is that
wedding ring he bought.

700
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,456
It ain't gonna be either.

701
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,214
Weddin' ring?

702
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,376
Oh, honey.

703
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,452
<i>Cowboys' calf roping
is our next contest.</i>

704
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,652
<i>This is a race against time,
and every second counts.</i>

705
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,129
<i>Notice the work
of the horse at all times,</i>

706
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,649
<i>keeping the rope snug and tight.</i>

707
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,252
I'm just gonna pretend
that little ol' calf is Cherry.

708
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,416
I'm goin' after her
and I'm gonna get her.

709
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,777
- When I get her, I'm gonna rope her.
- Don't let the calf get away.

710
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,409
Get goin', Cherry!

711
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,491
<i>Here's our newcomer again,</i>

712
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,776
<i>Bo Decker of Timber Hill, Montana.</i>

713
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,255
Was that fast enough for you,
Cherry? Yee-hoo!

714
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,657
<i>Who is she, Bo?</i>

715
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,175
Come on.

716
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,776
<i>Hey, look! Photographers from Life!
They're headin' this way.</i>

717
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,379
<i>Life Magazine?</i>

718
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,135
They're coverin' the rodeo. They almost
took my picture this mornin'.

719
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,854
Where's my lipstick?

720
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:53,695
Oh! Would you please
hand me my lipstick, please?

721
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,816
Smile!

722
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,896
Basic.

723
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,891
Thank you.

724
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,574
I didn't have my lipstick on yet!

725
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,089
<i>The most dangerous
of all rodeo events...</i>

726
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,933
<i>is the wild Brahma bull
riding contest.</i>

727
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,290
<i>And as an extra star
in this feature,</i>

728
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,412
<i>we have cousin Hugo,
our bullfighting chimpanzee.</i>

729
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:18,011
<i>It is Hugo's job to ride on the dummy,
and attract the bull over to him.</i>

730
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,932
<i>The cowboy clowns
are also there to distract the bull...</i>

731
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,972
<i>and draw him away from the cowboy
when he gets bucked off.</i>

732
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,693
Keep your mind on that bull,
or you're gonna break your neck.

733
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,459
Don't worry about me, Virge.
I ain't gonna break my neck.

734
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,656
If I was to break my neck,
I couldn't get married.

735
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,289
If he was to break his neck,
that's about the only hope you've got.

736
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,730
Believe it or not,
here's our old friend, Bo Decker.

737
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,129
<i>He's still wearing
that green scarf.</i>

738
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,292
<i>Let's hope it brings him luck
again in the bull riding.</i>

739
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,371
Aah!

740
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,095
<i>Good riding, Bo.</i>

741
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,412
Cherry! Did you see me
ride that bull?

742
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,532
<i>Cherry!</i>

743
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,850
Bo, stop it!

744
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,018
Cherry!

745
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,092
He don't have no manners at all.

746
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,410
No, but he's got somethin' else.

747
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,857
And he's gonna get some little gal.
You just watch.

748
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,170
Well, it ain't gonna be me.

749
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,292
Besides, how can we get married?

750
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,490
He ain't made no arrangements.

751
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,531
Silly.

752
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,339
Cherie, look.

753
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,888
Ain't that a preacher?

754
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,971
Oh, my goodness!

755
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,736
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me, please.

756
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,573
- Hey, where's the cowboy that's gettin' married?
- What?

757
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,930
- Getting married? Here at the rodeo?
- That's right.

758
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,176
- Elliot.
- Boing!

759
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,294
There she is! The cowboy's girl.

760
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,492
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Bo Decker is also entered...</i>

761
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,736
<i>in our bulldogging contest.</i>

762
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,328
Get him, get him, get him!

763
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,369
- How do you get outta here?
- The exit's over there.

764
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,936
But to get to it, you gotta
go around the corral, then you-

765
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,255
Where you goin'? Hey!

766
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,290
<i>Cherie!
You shouldn't be crossin' there!</i>

767
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,099
Cherry, where you goin'?
Cherry, what's goin' on here?

768
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,098
Wait a minute, Cherry!
Where you goin'?

769
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,451
Oh, my shoe! Oh, I'll get it!

770
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,491
Cherry, come back!

771
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,492
Stop her! Hey, somebody hold
this thing for me!

772
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,014
I'm tellin' ya, she ain't here,

773
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,018
she ain't been here, and I don't know
when she's comin' back.

774
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,212
I don't believe you!
She's here someplace. I know she is.

775
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,729
<i>Bo, if she ain't here,
she ain't here.</i>

776
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,648
<i>Now we gotta go get some supper, and get
your mind clear for the finals tonight.</i>

777
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,216
I don't care about the finals!
I want Cherry!

778
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,251
- Cherry!
- Ma'am.

779
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,695
He don't give up that easy.

780
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,290
If I'm not careful, I'm gonna end up
in East No Place, Montana,

781
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,412
with nothin' but him
and a bunch of cows.

782
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,411
Hey, what are you doing?

783
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,418
We're gonna pack your stuff and we're
gonna stash your suitcase at the club,

784
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,496
just in case you have
to make a quick getaway.

785
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,492
I can't go back to the club.
That's the first place he'll look.

786
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,050
If you don't show up for work, they sure
ain't gonna give you no advance.

787
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,091
Now listen.
He's ridin' in the rodeo.

788
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,176
You're safe till it's over anyway.

789
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,774
And you just tell that cashier...

790
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,813
that you gotta have money 'cause
your poor old grandmother is sick.

791
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,811
My poor old grandmother's sick.

792
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,130
I just don't understand that boy.

793
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,094
- What's he got on his mind, anyhow?
- Me.

794
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,059
I'm gonna find her and I'm gonna marry
her, and that's all there is to it.

795
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,131
<i>You gotta get her off your mind.</i>

796
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,137
At least till after the rodeo tonight.

797
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,935
- I ain't gonna be in the rodeo tonight.
- If you'll go to the rodeo,

798
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,177
- I'll find her and hold her for you.
- You will?

799
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,291
I don't say she's gonna marry you.

800
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,298
But I'll have her there at
the Blue Dragon when you get through.

801
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,651
- Okay, Virge, if you promise!
- I promise!

802
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:48,218
My poor ol' grandmother's very sick,
so if I could just have an advance.

803
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,770
Not without the boss okays it,
and he's watchin' the rodeo.

804
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,130
He'll be back when it's over.

805
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,820
Her grandmother'll be dead by then.

806
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,693
Let's you and me have
a little drink, miss.

807
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,739
C'mon. I'm so dry,
I'm spittin' cotton.

808
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,771
Two whiskeys, miss.

809
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,336
Take it easy. I'm on your side.

810
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,809
I don't want him to marry you neither.

811
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,580
- You don't?
- I sure don't.

812
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,256
Oh! I suppose I ain't
good enough for him, is that it?

813
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,894
I didn't say that.

814
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,177
I suppose he's as pure
as a bunch of driven snow.

815
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,530
As a matter of fact, he is.

816
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,135
You trying to tell me-

817
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,697
He never even kissed a gal
before he met you.

818
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,251
You're forgettin' he spent his whole
life pretty far out in the country.

819
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,975
I know what happens in the country.
I'm from the country myself.

820
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,649
I've been kissing boys
since I was knee high to-

821
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,170
Well, that's the point!
You're kinda sophisticated for Bo.

822
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,179
He sure didn't kiss
like it was the first time.

823
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,849
Well, Bo picks things up real quick.

824
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,496
First time, huh?

825
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,457
That's right.

826
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:17,818
Sure ain't never had that honor before.

827
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,853
I hate to put you through this, but I promised
him I'd keep you here till he got back.

828
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:28,294
Course, I didn't say anything about where
you might take a notion to go after that.

829
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,651
Oh! Ol' Vera's
sure gonna miss you, honey.

830
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,095
Oh, what was I supposed to say again?

831
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,650
<i>I never was any good at lyin'.</i>

832
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,371
It ain't all that complicated. We just
sit here and talk to him for a while.

833
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,974
Then you turn casually
and you say,

834
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,058
"Bo, the show is gonna start
pretty soon.

835
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,775
I guess I better go
powder my nose."

836
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,976
And then what do I-

837
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,530
And then you go to your dressing room
where your suitcase is.

838
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,213
You change your clothes,
you climb out of the window,

839
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,179
and you get down to the bus station.

840
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,936
The rodeo must be over.
Wonder what's keepin' Bo?

841
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,894
I know what's keepin' him.
He's probably arguin' and yellin'...

842
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,778
and pushin' some poor
little helpless animal around.

843
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,539
<i>Whatever give you
an idea like that, Cherry?</i>

844
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,220
Nice to see ya, honey.

845
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,776
I was afraid ya got yourself trampled
to death in that crowd this afternoon.

846
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,653
Where ya been, Bo?

847
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,738
Well, I had a couple of errands
to run after the rodeo.

848
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,978
I bought us three tickets
for tonight's bus to Montana.

849
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,660
<i>By the way,</i>

850
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:46,331
there's $4,000 that I got for winnin'
every event at that there rodeo.

851
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,209
'Cept steer wrestlin'. Would've won
that too but they gave me a bum steer.

852
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,293
Don't give me no credit for that one.
One of the other fellas thought it up.

853
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,611
Well, Virge,

854
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,612
I got our gear all packed up
and waitin' outside in a taxi.

855
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,329
All we gotta do is stop by
Cherry's house and pick up her suitcase.

856
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,692
Your nose is kinda shiny,
ain't it?

857
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,459
Huh? Oh.

858
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,737
Oh!

859
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,099
Bo, the show's gonna start
in just a minute, and,

860
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,614
uh, uh, I-I-I gotta go
p- powder my nose.

861
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,939
Why, Cherry? You're not gonna do
your show tonight.

862
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,971
- I ain't?
- No, of course not.

863
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,218
- You gotta go pack your suitcase.
- Oh, it's already packed.

864
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,455
I mean, I-I-I gotta go powder my nose.

865
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,368
Cherry, what's the matter with you?
Are you sick or somethin'?

866
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,418
No, I ain't sick, Bo.

867
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,249
I just can't lie to you
and I can't marry ya,

868
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,497
<i>and I ain't goin' to Montana with you.</i>

869
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,497
And good-bye forever.

870
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,656
Cherry, wait a second!
Cherry, wait!

871
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,248
Cherry!

872
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,409
You ain't got the manners
they give a monkey!

873
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,690
I hate you!
And I despise you!

874
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,533
And give me back my tail!

875
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,453
<i>- Cherry!
- Here's your bag.</i>

876
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,855
<i>- Here's your coat and hat.
- Cherry!</i>

877
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,858
You ain't got time. Change at
the bus station. Put on your coat.

878
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,570
I'm sorry, Cherry. I didn't mean to rip
your tail off. You can sew it back on.

879
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,658
Well, good luck, honey.

880
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,938
Thanks, Vera.
You've been real sweet.

881
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,051
Oh, let her go, let her go, Bo!

882
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,535
What do you mean, "let her go"?
Where's she goin'?

883
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,890
Cherry! Cherry!

884
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,096
Where'd she go?

885
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,377
Ticket to Los Angeles, please.
One way.

886
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,415
<i>Los Angeles bus
leaving from gate two.</i>

887
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,577
Bo, Bo! Wait a minute, Bo!
Help me unload this stuff.

888
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,091
Here, Bo. Forget her, Bo.
You'll find somebody else.

889
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,337
Hank and Orville was tellin' me about
this new schoolmarm who's stayin'-

890
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,691
I don't want no schoolmarm!
I want Cherry!

891
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,893
<i>- Los Angeles bus leaving from gate two.
- Cherry!</i>

892
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:02,013
Bo, you just can't take people places
like that! There's laws against it, Bo!

893
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,291
- This way, straight ahead.
- Which-

894
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,934
Lady, here's the Los Angeles bus.

895
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,217
Please, miss, to the rear of the line.

896

<i>Bus for Helena, Montana, now loading.</i>

Gate's closed.

898
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,573
- Cherry, don't get on that bus.
- No, Bo, no.

899
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,938
- I'm gonna get her. Ain't gonna take "no" for an answer.
- You ain't goin' over that fence.

900
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,570
Please, stand to the rear.

901
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,850

00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,056
Abducted?

916
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,450
You know,
like kidnapped... by him.

917
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,088
Oh, that's awful!

918
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,489
What are you gonna do?

919
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,459
I thought maybe as soon
as we got someplace,

920
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,572
I'd ask the driver to stop
and let me off.

921
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,931
But we've been ridin'
for hours and hours,

922
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,251
and we still don't seem
to be no place at all.

923
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,611
Not only that,
I'm freezing to death.

924
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,652
I don't have much on under my coat.

925
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,538
You mean just your underthings?

926
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,539
No, it's my costume,
but it's just a bitty old thing.

927
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,299
Now it doesn't even have its tail.

928
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,735
Its what?

929
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:24,251
Its- Oh, it's a long story.

930
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:29,249
You're shivering!
Don't you have anything warm to put on?

931
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,291
Will you help me change?

932
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,411
Of course.

933
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:38,136
- Here, hold this up for me, will you?
- Sure.

934
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,416
Cherry? Cherry, where are you?
Cherry!

935
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,532
Cherry?
What's goin' on up here?

936
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,692
Get away from me!
Can't you see I'm gettin' dressed?

937
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:08,336
Bo, ain't you caused enough trouble
for one night? Come back and sit down!

938
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:24,773
I can't figure it out.

939
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,057
Why don't she like me? Why?

940
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:33,379
Of course, if you loved him,
it wouldn't be so bad.

941
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,778
Yeah, but I don't.

942
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,816
Not at all?

943
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,890
There are some gals who don't like
to be pushed and grabbed...

944
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:54,411
and lassoed and drug into buses
in the middle of the night.

945
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,896
How else was I gonna get her
on the bus?

946
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,089
Well, I'm askin' ya.

947
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,016
Go to sleep!

948
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,969
I don't know why I keep expecting myself
to fall in love, but I do.

949
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,739
Well, I know I expect to someday.

950
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:26,017
I'm seriously beginning to wonder if
there's the kind of love I have in mind.

951
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,330
What's that?

952
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,492
I don't know. Uh-

953
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,051
You see, I've been goin' with guys
since I was about 12.

954
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,693
Honest?

955
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,209
I almost married a cousin
when I was 14.

956
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,217
<i>But Pappy wouldn't have it.</i>

957
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,979
I never heard of anyone
marrying so young!

958
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:49,451
Down in the Ozarks,
we don't waste much time.

959
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:54,449
I sure am glad, though,
I never married my cousin Malcolm.

960
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:59,256
'Cause he turned out real bad,
just like Pappy predicted.

961
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,299
But I sure was crazy
about him at the time.

962
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:07,931
And I've been losing my head
about some guy ever since.

963
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,738
Bo was the first one
that ever wanted to marry me...

964
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,449
since my cousin Malcolm.

965
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,890
Naturally I'd like to get married...

966
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,932
and have a family and all them things.

967
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,858
But you've never been in love?

968
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,653
I don't know.

969
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:34,050
Maybe I have and I didn't know it.

970
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:38,139
That's what I mean.
Maybe I don't know what love is.

971
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:52,533
I want a guy I can
look up to and admire.

972
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,779
But I don't want him to browbeat me.

973
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:03,531
I want a guy
who'll be sweet with me.

974
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,573
But I don't want him
to baby me either!

975
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,739
I just gotta feel
that whoever I marry...

976
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,097
has some real regard for me...

977
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:19,890
aside from all that... loving stuff.

978
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,534
You know what I mean?

979
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,656
I think so.

980
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,619
This storm is getting terrible!

981
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,813
There's Grace's lights.
I think we're gonna make it.

982
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:44,899
You can sneak off when I get off.

983
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,895
I can if that wild man don't wake up.

984
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,369
Sure awful rough.
I wish I had my chains on.

985
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,690
Shh!

986
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,180
Shh!

987
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,337
This is as close as I can get.

988
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,094
You're gonna have to walk from here.

989
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,300
You sure picked some night
for traveling.

990
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:38,298
Come on! Come on in!

991
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,090
Whew!

992
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,415
Ah.

993
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:51,453
Grace, this is Cherie. We gotta find
some place for her to hide.

994
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,538
- She's being abducted.
- She's been what?

995
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,850
You know! Kidnapped!

996
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,778
Yes, that's right.
By a man in the bus, a cowboy.

997
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,215
He's out there asleep,

998
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:06,572
so if I could stay until the bus pulls
out again, I sure would appreciate it.

999
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,810
Bus ain't pullin' out.

1000
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,010
Huh?

1001
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,449
Road's all closed up ahead.
I got word to hold that bus here.

1002
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:17,772
<i>The highway gang's out,
but it may take the rest of the night.</i>

1003
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,209
Oh! The rest of the night?

1004
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:24,259
Mr. Bus Driver, are we
gonna stay here very long?

1005
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,298
'Cause my aunt and uncle
are supposed to meet us, you know.

1006
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,332
Don't you think we oughta wake
those cowboys up too?

1007
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,378
- Well-
- Brrr! It's cold!

1008
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:40,213
- Well, look what the cat dragged in!
- Hiya, Grace.

1009
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,292
Who's that with ya?
Ain't they cute!

1010
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,570
They're gonna visit
their aunt in Helena.

1011
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:50,211
Looks like they're gonna visit
their Aunt Grace, for tonight anyway.

1012
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,370
Everybody is.

1013
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,096
Highway's all closed... up ahead.

1014
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,251
Oh, now, ain't that too bad!

1015
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,976
<i>What's this I hear about you carrying
a kidnapper on your bus?</i>

1016
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,214
You mean that cowboy?

1017
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,889
He ain't kidnappin' nobody.
He's asleep.

1018
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,217
He might freeze out there.
Why don't you go out and wake him up?

1019
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,815
Oh, no! I mean, couldn't you just
let him sleep a little longer?

1020
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,337
He's had a very busy day.
Two rodeos and... a lot else.

1021
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,974
Sure. Let him sleep for a while.

1022
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,295
Kinda works out better
for everybody that way.

1023
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:33,619
<i>- How soon is the next bus back?
- Ain't no busses running tonight.</i>

1024
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,935
You're all stuck right here.

1025
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,336
<i>For the time, anyway.</i>

1026
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,816
You know somethin', Grace?

1027
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,968
This is the first time you and me have
had more than five minutes together.

1028
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:53,051
So what?

1029
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,216
I don't know.

1030
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:58,412
I was just thinking about
that apartment you got upstairs.

1031
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,856
Sure would be nice
to sit up there for a while,

1032
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,369
listen to the radio or somethin'.

1033
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,970
Maybe have a couple of beers.

1034
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,938
That wouldn't be a hint
or somethin', would it?

1035
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:16,180
Elma, where is this place
we're at now anyway?

1036
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,812
Oh, about here. It's so little,
it's not even on the map.

1037
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,015
I sure am way off my direction.

1038
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:36,899
- Whatcha lookin' at?
- Oh, nothin'. Just your hands.

1039
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:41,338
You got real big hands.

1040
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,020
Big all over.

1041
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:48,452
- I used to be state wrestling champion.
- No kiddin'!

1042
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,413
I always admire a man who can fight.

1043
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:57,052
Hey! Why didn't anybody wake us up?
Me and Virge might've froze out there!

1044
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,375
- Hey, close the door!
- Cherry!

1045
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,259
Cherry!

1046
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:14,331
- How come you got off the bus without lettin' me know?
- Shut the door, cowboy!

1047
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,772
How come you want to slip off the bus,
and come in here all by yourself?

1048
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,016
Where was you brought up?
In a barn?

1049
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,495
That's right! He was!

1050
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,975
What's the matter with you, mister?
You afraid of a little fresh air?

1051
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,051
The man's right, Bo.
It's cold out there.

1052
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:34,536
That don't give him no right
to insult my manners.

1053
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:38,858
No man ever had to tell me
what to do, did he, Virge? Did he?

1054
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,529
You opened the door, you should've
closed it. That's all I'm sayin'.

1055
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:47,452
The door's closed now,
so what ya arguin' about?

1056
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:52,770
Cherry, let's you and me
sit down and have a-

1057
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,050
That's your suitcase, ain't it?

1058
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:58,172
For cryin' out loud,
will you leave me be?

1059
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,689
Well, ain't that your suitcase?

1060
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:03,892
Yes, that's my suitcase. Grrr!

1061
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,494
What'd you bring it in here for?

1062
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,730
Cherry, I'm asking ya a civil question.

1063
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,653
What did you bring
your suitcase in here for?

1064
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,379
- Now, tell me!
- You keep away from me, Bo Decker.

1065
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,937
- Bo, will you- - Virge, you keep outta
this. This is between me and Cherry.

1066
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:24,292
Was you tryin' to fool me again?
Is that what it was?

1067
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,372
- Take your hands off of me, Bo!
- Tell me.

1068
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,411
<i>Cherry, you tell me!</i>

1069
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,008
Okay, cowboy, leave the lady alone.

1070
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,098
You better keep outta this,
if you know what's good for ya.

1071
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,849
- It ain't none of your business.
- I ain't so sure about that.

1072
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,854
A bus driver's kind of like
the captain of a ship.

1073
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,852
The welfare of the passengers
is his responsibility.

1074
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,728
<i>- If anything happens in the bus-
- We ain't in a bus!</i>

1075
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,737
We're in a bus stop!

1076
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,899
This is an official,
authorized bus stop!

1077
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,130
- Ain't it, Grace?
- When the sign's up.

1078
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,254
You still got no right interfering
between two people gonna get married!

1079
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,577
We ain't gettin' married!
That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya.

1080
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,453
But you're too bullheaded
and mean to listen!

1081
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,936
Cherry, I'm tellin' you,
you're gonna marry me,

1082
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,699
and I ain't gonna
discuss it no more!

1083
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,328
There must be a preacher
around here someplace, ain't there?

1084
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,855
Down the road a ways,
but, uh, he's asleep.

1085
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,613
We're gonna wake him up,
and put him to work.

1086
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,971
- Aah! Help, everybody!
- Oh, shut up!

1087
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,739
I'll make ya a good husband.
You'll have nothin' to be sorry about.

1088
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,778
- No! No!
- I'm telling you, cowboy. Put her down!

1089
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,856
- Open the door, Virge.
- No! No!

1090
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,857
Go ahead, open the door!

1091
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,097
I ain't gonna open it, Bo.

1092
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,694
- You ain't?
- No!

1093
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,653
You've been against this
right from the beginning!

1094
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:50,331
That's right. First 'cause I figured
the lady wasn't good enough for you.

1095
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,298
But now 'cause I figure
you ain't good enough for her!

1096
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,417
That's how it is, cowboy.
Now, are you gonna put her down?

1097
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:59,338
You're gonna get out of my way!

1098
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,577
You're gonna have to fight me first.

1099
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,497
I love a good fight.

1100
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,414
- One thing I can't stand is a bully.
- Who says I'm a bully?

1101
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,178
I do!

1102
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,929
Quiet! A man's got to fight
for what he wants!

1103
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:18,332
There's a big difference
between a fighter and a bully, Bo.

1104
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,894
But there's only one way
you're gonna learn it.

1105
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,939
For once in your life, somebody's
gotta beat the livin' tar out of ya!

1106
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,177
Go to it, Captain.
He's ripe for it.

1107
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,256
I'd do it myself
if I was big enough.

1108
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:34,737
But you ain't big enough!

1109
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,374
And neither is he!

1110
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:42,893
Ain't no man ever got the best of me,
and there ain't gonna be.

1111
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,978
I'm willin' to try, cowboy!

1112
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,613
Just step outside.

1113
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,049
Delighted!

1114
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,615
Oh, Grace, make 'em stop!

1115
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,369
Look, cowboy, why don't you
save yourself a lot of trouble?

1116
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,095
- Go tell that little girl you're sorry.
- I ain't sorry!

1117
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,774
He never ain't!
That's his whole trouble!

1118
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,777
You stay outta this, Virge.

1119
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,892
I had just about enough of you tellin'
me what's right and what's wrong.

1120
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,649
No, you ain't! You can stand
just a little bit more!

1121
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,251
Virge! What're you doin'?

1122
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,336
I'm startin' a fight.

1123
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,451
He's gonna finish it for me.

1124
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:32,653
But remember this, Bo. Every time
he hits ya, it's me hittin' ya!

1125
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,691
Do ya hear that? It's me!

1126
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,499
And it'll be me hittin' ya back!

1127
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:40,617
Move over. I'm gettin' cold.

1128
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:49,179
How 'bout that!
And that... and that!

1129
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,857
You're doin' great, mister!

1130
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,619
- Gouge him, cowboy! Bite him!
- Make them stop!

1131
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:01,450
Now you two come away
from this window!

1132
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:05,493
You don't wanna watch things like that
or you're gonna grow up mean...

1133
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:09,129
<i>like all my brothers
and my cousins too!</i>

1134
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,455
Now you sit down there
and behave yourselves!

1135
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,656
<i>You oughta be in bed!</i>

1136
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,130
Grace has a big bed upstairs,
and a sofa too.

1137
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,820
All right, boys,
lay off them gas pumps!

1138
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,734
Had enough, kid?

1139
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,615
Go put your coat on, honey.
This is gettin' good.

1140
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,890
Cherry?

1141
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,413
Virge, make him stop
'fore somebody gets killed!

1142
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:06,216
Give up! Come on, give up!
You ain't got a chance.

1143
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,177
You had enough?

1144
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,213
No, he ain't. Not till he promises
to apologize to everybody in the place.

1145
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,331
And quits molestin'
that poor little girl.

1146
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,690
You hear what he said?

1147
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,699
- C'mon, Bo, you're whipped. Admit it!
- Okay.

1148
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:26,613
Bo?

1149
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,412
Get away, damn it!

1150
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,815
How 'bout the promise, Bo?

1151
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:40,128
- Is she gone?
- She's gone.

1152
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:44,776
- Okay, I promise.
- All right.

1153
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,098
He'll be all right.

1154
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,610
Come on, Bo, the storm is over.

1155
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,377
I'm sorry it had to be like this.
It's all over now.

1156
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,373
Come on inside and wash up,
get some coffee.

1157
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,772
Come on!
You can't stay out here.

1158
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,296
I, I can't go in there.

1159
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,417
She's seen me get whipped.

1160
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:28,490
Carl, honey, you was
just plain tremendous!

1161
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,775
<i>Eh!</i>

1162
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:36,577
I think maybe I earned me a bottle of
that cold beer you got in the icebox...

1163
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,895
upstairs.

1164
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,934
Snowplow's out.
Shouldn't be too much longer.

1165
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,015
C'mon, Bo, cheer up.
Bus'll be leavin' pretty soon.

1166
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,489
We'll be back
on the ranch tomorrow.

1167
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,454
I don't care if I ever see
that ranch again.

1168
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,929
Lonesomest durn place
I ever did see.

1169
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,858
It's like goin' back
to a graveyard.

1170
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,813
Good mornin', honey.

1171
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,170
They're sleepin' just fine.

1172
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,458
Must've read myself to sleep.
Such an interesting story.

1173
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:25,977
- Can I have a cup of coffee?
- Sure, honey. Elma just run it through.

1174
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,735
- Bo?
- Yeah?

1175
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:34,291
This'll be a good time
to keep your promise.

1176
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,531
- Why should you be so scared?
- Who's scared?

1177
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,130
I'm gonna do it.
Just give me a little time, that's all.

1178
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:46,374
But I warn ya, it ain't gonna do
no good less'n you really mean it.

1179
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,015
- I mean it.
- All right then.

1180
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,216
Go ahead.

1181
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,698
Ma'am, I want to apologize.

1182
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,771
For what?

1183
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,330
- For causing all that ruckus.
- Ah!

1184
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,378
<i>You don't need to apologize
to me, cowboy.</i>

1185
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:21,092
I love a good fight. You're welcome
at Grace's Diner anytime.

1186
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,417
I mean anytime!

1187
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,411
Thanks.

1188
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,131
I must've acted like a hoodlum.
I apologize.

1189
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:46,809
Oh, that's all right.

1190
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,135
Thank you, miss.

1191
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,814
Have I gotta wake him up?

1192
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,733
No, he can wait.

1193
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,735
Virge, I can't do it.
I just can't do it.

1194
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,219
Why not?

1195
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,332
I can't face up to her.
She's seen me get beat.

1196
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,849
You made me your promise.

1197
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:27,448
You owe that girl an apology
whether you got beat or not,

1198
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,457
and you're gonna say it to her.

1199
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,016
Now, go on, Bo. Go on!

1200
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,056
Well, don't watch!

1201
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,416
<i>I'll do the dishes, honey.</i>

1202
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,891
- I can do 'em, Grace.
- No, you go on with the kids' breakfast.

1203
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:50,137
- Cherry?
- Yes?

1204
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:58,900
Cherry, it wasn't right of me
to do what I did to you,

1205
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,057
treatin' you that way,
draggin' you on the bus,

1206
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,729
and tryin' to make you marry me
whether you wanted to or not.

1207
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,259
Do you think you can
ever forgive me?

1208
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,333
I guess I've been treated worse
in my life.

1209
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,932
Well, I... reckon
that's all there is to be said.

1210
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,459
I wish you luck, Cherry.

1211
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,219
I wish you the same, Bo.

1212
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,289
Here's your bandana back.

1213
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,771
Thanks.

1214
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,896
Oh!

1215
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,418
Here's your ring.

1216
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,175
I wish you'd keep that.

1217
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,649
All right, Bo.

1218
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,329
Well, so long.

1219
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,337
So long.

1220
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:22,133
That wasn't so bad, was it?

1221
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,656
- Why don't we sit down and have ourselves some breakfast?
- I ain't hungry.

1222
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,891
- Just some coffee then.
- I couldn't get it down.

1223
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:32,057
Phone!

1224
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,740
Turn the water off, honey.

1225
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,539
Grace's Diner.

1226
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,690
What?

1227
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:44,654
Oh, it is?
Okay, I'll tell him.

1228
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,737
Hate to wake him,
but the road's cleared.

1229
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:51,055
- Hey, Carl.
- Huh?

1230
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,536
The road's cleared. But you're
gonna have to put your chains on.

1231
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,659
- It's still awful slick. Elma?
- Okay.

1232
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,096
Hey, Elma,
better wake the kids up.

1233
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,569
The road's clear, folks.

1234
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:09,137
Bus'll be ready to leave soon as I get
the chains on and pull it up front.

1235
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:11,979
Anybody wanna help me?

1236
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:15,211
Uh, sit here, Bo. I'll help him.

1237
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,972
Bo?

1238
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,455
Yeah?

1239
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,452
I just wanted to tell you something.

1240
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:48,017
It's kinda personal
and embarrassing too.

1241
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,694
But I ain't the kind of girl
you thought I was.

1242
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,495
What do you mean, Cherry?

1243
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:05,499
Well, I guess a lot of people'd say
I led a real wicked life,

1244
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:09,090
and I guess I have too.

1245
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,058
What are you tryin' to tell me?

1246
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:23,610
Well, I just figure that...

1247
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,339
since you met me
at the Blue Dragon,

1248
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,099
that you just took it
for granted that...

1249
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:32,491
I'd had other boyfriends 'fore you.

1250
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,051
You had?

1251
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,500
Yes, Bo.

1252
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:44,458
Quite a few.

1253
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,098
Virge tried to tell me that,

1254
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:52,929
but I wouldn't believe him.

1255
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,215
Well, it's true.

1256
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,491
So you can see,

1257
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,458
it-

1258
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,008
You're better off,

1259
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:08,332
'cause I ain't the kind
of gal you thought I was at all.

1260
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,893
I'll go wake the children.

1261
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,209
Cherry,

1262
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:31,259
would I be molestin' you
if I was to tell you somethin'?

1263
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:35,531
No.

1264
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:39,369
Since you brought the subject up,

1265
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:44,654
y- you are the first gal
that I ever had anything to do with.

1266
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:49,052
I never thought I'd hear myself
sayin' that, but I said it.

1267
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,531
Virge told me that,

1268
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,009
but I couldn't hardly believe him.

1269
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,335
That's the truth.

1270
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:03,652
You see, I lived all my life
on a ranch and...

1271
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:08,058
I guess I just didn't know
anything about women...

1272
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:10,489
'cause they're different from men.

1273
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,736
Well, naturally.

1274
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,212
Brrr! All ready to roll, folks.

1275
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,693
Feelin' better, cowboy?

1276
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:31,409
I ain't the happiest critter
that's ever been born.

1277
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:35,658
I feel a little shook up myself.
How 'bout shaking hands?

1278
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:41,611
- Well- - Go ahead, Bo. He's
just tryin' to be friends.

1279
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,459
- I don't mind.
- No hard feelin's?

1280
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,536
No hard feelin's.

1281
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:53,090
There's a nice state, miss. Montana.

1282
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,290
How 'bout a cup of coffee
for the road, Grace?

1283
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:59,208
- Nice fella, Bo.
- Maybe I'll think so someday.

1284
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:02,173
Maybe we'd better be boarding the bus.

1285
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,619
- Cherry?

1286
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,374
Hi, Bo.

1287
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:20,335
Cherry, you won't be
gettin' on this bus.

1288
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:24,294
I know that I promised
not to molest ya,

1289
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,571
but if you give your permission
that it'd be all right,

1290
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,330
I... I'd like
to kiss you good-bye.

1291
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:37,170
I'd like for you to kiss me, Bo.

1292
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,375
I really would.

1293
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,816
- Bo!
- What?

1294
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:50,019
I think this time
it oughta be different.

1295
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,131
Oh!

1296
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:24,849
Golly,

1297
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,892
when you kiss somebody for serious,

1298
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:32,093
it's kinda scary, ain't it?

1299
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,692
Yes, it is.

1300
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:15,293
- Here they are. All breakfasted.
- I'm still hungry.

1301
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:18,133
- See you Wednesday.
- Keep that beer on ice, will ya, Grace?

1302
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:21,337
Maybe next time
I'll get a chance to finish it.

1303
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:29,250
- Come on, kids.
- I turned down the heater.

1304
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,059
- Honey, will you throw this water on the fire?
- Sure.

1305
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:36,497
This bus stop is closed
as of now!

1306
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,853
Cherry?

1307
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,896
Yes?

1308
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,369
- Virge has been figurin' things out.

1309
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,379
And, well, he says...

1310
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,936
that seeing as how you had
all them other boyfriends before me,

1311
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:58,458
and seeing as I never even
had one single gal friend before you,

1312
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:02,619
well, Virge figures
that between the two of us...

1313
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,095
it kinda averages out...

1314
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:10,374
to things being proper and right.

1315
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,938
That's what Virge thinks.

1316
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,773
What do you think, Bo?

1317
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:23,851
Well-

1318
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:35,857
Well, I've been thinkin'
about them other fellas, Cherry,

1319
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,410
and, well, what I mean is,

1320
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:44,699
I like you the way you are,
so what do I care how you got that way?

1321
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,371
Bo!

1322
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,935
That is the sweetest,
tenderest thing anyone ever said to me.

1323
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,975
It's awful hard for a fella
after he's been turned down once,

1324
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,649
to get up enough guts to try again.

1325
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,890
You don't need guts, Bo.

1326
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,891
I don't?

1327
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,979
That's the last thing
in this world you need.

1328
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,571
Well, anyhow,

1329
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:43,090
I just don't have any now.

1330
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:48,699
So I'll just have to tell you
what I feel in my heart.

1331
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,251
Yes?

1332
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:59,458
I still wish you was
goin' back to the ranch with me,

1333
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,889
more than anything I know.

1334
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,059
Yeah, I do.

1335
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:14,817
I'd go anywhere in the world
with you now.

1336
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:18,694
<i>Anywhere at all!</i>

1337
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:21,732
Y- Y-You would?

1338
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,737
Anywhere at all!

1339
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:26,499
You, you would?

1340
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:29,851
- Yes, I would!
- You would?

1341
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:34,732
<i>I would, I would, I would!</i>

1342
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,331
You would? You would?

1343
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,809
<i>You would?</i>

1344
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:45,012
Yes, I would. I would.

1345
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,210
Virge!

1346
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:50,657
Oops.

1347
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,300
She's gonna marry me!

1348
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:57,174
Ain't it wonderful when somebody
so terrible turns out to be so nice?

1349
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:01,612
Our ranch is gonna be
the nicest place in the world...

1350
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:04,459
'cause we're gonna have
an angel on it!

1351
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,730
- Here's your map.
- Here's your bag.

1352
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,175
Oh, this ol' thing!

1353
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:12,258
That's right, Cherry!
I'll show you the way to Montana!

1354
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,811
- Okay!
- Come on, Virge.

1355
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,295
- Wait a second, Bo.
- Doggone it, come on!

1356
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:26,493
- Now listen!
- Come on, Virge, what you waitin' for?

1357
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:31,648
You asked for a second!
You gotta hear me. Bo, I ain't goin'.

1358
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,492
You ain't what?

1359
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,697
You don't need me to look after you.

1360
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,573
Fact is, you got someone
you gotta look after.

1361
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,694
Here's your wedding ring.

1362
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:52,168
Virge, I wish you'd come.
I liked you long 'fore I ever liked Bo.

1363
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,739
Gettin' late, folks.

1364
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:56,738
You better hurry.
The bus can't wait all day.

1365
01:31:56,860 --> 01:32:01,695
Doggone it, Virge! You're my buddy!
I ain't gonna let you go.

1366
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,375
You're comin' with Cherry and me,
'cause we want you to!

1367
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:08,492
- Let me be! Let me be!
- Bo! Bo!

1368
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:12,095
You just can't do it that way.
You just can't!

1369
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,292
If he don't wanna come,
you can't make him.

1370
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:23,935
Whatever I got left up there,
the boys can have it.

1371
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,330
- Bye, Bo.
- C'mon, Cherry, let's make it fast.

1372
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,655
Well, Cherry!

1373
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:49,898
You're liable to freeze
to death in that skimpy little thing!

1374
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,574
But what about you?
You'll need something.

1375
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,051
Ya-hoo!

1376
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,460
Uh-oh!

1377
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,653
<i>Bye, everybody!</i>

1378
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:01,210
Bye! Bye!

1379
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:12,933
<i>♪ You can have my everything
My house, my money, my wedding ring ♪</i>

1380
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,528
<i>♪ And in the bargain I'll throw in me ♪</i>

1381
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:21,530
<i>♪ If you will marry me ♪</i>
