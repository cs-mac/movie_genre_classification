00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:05,376
If you are gonna help me
with haley´s record,

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,508
you could maybe
move into the house with me.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,281
It´s a
business arrangement?
Of course.

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:13,013
Mouth: with me tonight is my new
color announcer, gigi silveri.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,116
You really expect us
to practice in this dump?

6
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,217
Whitey: not only practice.

7
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,588
Till further notice,

8
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:20,351
you´re gonna
play all your games in here.

9
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:23,124
If you tell whitey
i have a heart condition,

10
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,625
i´m off the team.

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,558
If I don´t tell whitey,
you´re off the planet.

Brooke:
it was you, wasn´t it?

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,162
The dress I designed --
the one you made --

14
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:32,633
it got me
into rogue vogue.

15
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,706
Your clothes are good,
but if you´re afraid to go --

16
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:38,769
oh, no, i´m gonna go,
and i´m gonna win.

17
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,611
Nathan:
did you think about it --

18
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,042
having a baby
to stay together?

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,514
Let me see the pills.

20
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:46,177
I cannot believe
you still don´t believe me.

21
00:00:46,177 --> 00:00:47,548
Here.

22
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,781
Take them.
I don´t need them anymore.

23
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:54,385
Your future as a basketball
player is totally secure.

24
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:56,827
Your future as my husband --
not so much.

25
00:00:56,827 --> 00:01:00,131
You know, I thought about you
every day I was gone,

26
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,793
and you´re even prettier
than I remembered.

Keith Scott?
Put your hands behind your head.

28
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,168
What the hell is this?

29
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,771
You´re under arrest for the

Well, Stanford may not be
too realistic for you, faily.

Haley.

52
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,712
What?

53
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:23,574
I think you just called me
"faily." My name´s Haley.

54
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,516
My mistake. I must have
thought that was your name

55
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:27,378
because you failed
every class.

56
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:29,220
I didn´t fail anything.

Well [scoffs] that
is none of your business.

Then there was the hcm test.
You failed that, too.

60
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:39,390
No, I didn´t.
Oh, that´s right.

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,262
You failed
the friendship test

62
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,564
by letting Lucas play basketball
with a serious heart condition.

You understand
that we have you on tape

buying a bottle of liquor
the day of the fire.

83

Yeah.

Come on, mom. It´s Keith.
This is important.

Your future
is important.

Don´t you have a meeting with
your guidance counselor today

94

to talk about colleges?

Oh, you wouldn´t
want to miss that.

96
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,894
Keith didn´t go to college,
and look where he ended up.

97
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,767
What the hell is wrong with you?
He´s your brother.

98
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,599
Exactly. someone should have
told him that

99
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,000
before he tried
to light me on fire.

100

to do with that.

Don´t waste your breath

I mean,
not that i´m not grateful

for the "get out of jail free"
card, but what´s the catch?

You´re here
so I can help you decide

117
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,379
which college
is best for you.

118
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,782
I doubt i´ll even go to college,
so you´re wasting your breath.

And you´re
wasting my time.

Why do you think
your brother

would accuse you
of trying to kill him?

122

Maybe he´s still mad at me
for sleeping with his wife.

123
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,892
Woman: is your wife gonna factor
into the college you pick?

That´s not really your business,
is it?

125
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:27,498
Anyway, colleges come to me.
I don´t go to them.

126
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:29,660
Then why´d you come back
to Tree Hill?
´Cause I live here.

127
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,703
Woman: and do you want
to stay close to home?
Probably.

128
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:35,406
I mean, I can´t really afford
to go to college out of state.

Okay, okay.
Stop, all right?

131
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:42,813
I want to
talk to my brother.

132
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:44,344
I know he´s out there.

133
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,447

Yeah, okay. Okay.

138
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,859
I confess.

139
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,592
I bought
a bottle of liquor.

140
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:03,894
I was just so thirsty.

141
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:06,467
I´m sorry, Dan.
Can you forgive me?

142

Hey, there´s no need to bring
mom into this, Danny.

145
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,046
Okay, that´s enough.

146
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:19,009
Wipe that dumb smile
off your face.

Help. police.

150
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,694
Well, I guess I just don´t
really get the point of college.

151
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,726
The point
is to find something you love

152
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,498
and hopefully
make a career of it.

153

What makes you happy?

154
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,673
I don´t know.
Music, I guess.

155
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:46,577
But everyone loves your stuff.
You know that, right?

156
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:50,911
I just think this would be
a great opportunity for you.

can be so neurotic.

159
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,119
No, that was Brooke.

160
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,552
She´s got this
fashion-show thing coming up,

161
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,555
so she calls me every second
she has a new idea,

162
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,657
which is pretty much
every second.

163
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:09,760
I didn´t think i´d hear from her
again now that her and Lucas

164
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,663
have stopped this whole
nonexclusive crap.

165
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,805
Nonexclusive meaning?

166
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,938
Basically,
friends with benefits.

167
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,842
Friends with benefits?

168
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,815
Isn´t that
just sleeping around?

169
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,617
No. it´s like
being friends

170
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,849
with someone
you get to have sex with,

171
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,782
but you can still hook up
with other people, too.

172
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,156
Okay. so, you´re right.

173
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,928
It´s the same.

174
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,694
And what about you?

175
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:46,136
Do you have
any beneficial friends?

176
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,668
No.

177
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,900
I dated this guy Nathan
for a while,

178
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,803
but we were more benefits
than we were friends.

179
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,876
But we´re just friends --
no benefits -- now.

180
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,779
And then...
There was this other guy, but --

181
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,911
but he was more than that.

182
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:08,989
Were you in love
with him?

183
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,926
That´s the hard part.

184
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,528
Sex is easy.

185
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,600
But if you find someone
you´re in love with

186
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,901
who´s also your friend,

187
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,073
wouldn´t that be
the greatest benefit?

188
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,876
Well, that´s the fairy tale,
i guess.

189
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:28,909
Well, there´s nothing wrong
with fairy tales.

190
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,642
Everyone ends up
happily ever after.

191
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:37,718
When I was little,
my parents took us to California

192
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,690
so my sister
could look at colleges,

193
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,922
and Stanford
was just one of our stops,

194
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,224
and I was only 8,
but I just fell in love.

195
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,858
I´d never seen anything like it
growing up in Tree Hill --

196
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:50,100
all those different people
in one place,

197
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,032
and I just
thought to myself,

198
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
"wow, this must be
what the world is like.

199
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,167
This is where
i want to be."

200
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:00,841
And ever since then,
i´ve just wanted to go there.

201
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,014
Where does your husband
want to go?

202
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,818
Haley: hey, uh, this came
to the apartment for you.

203
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:09,620
I guess they think
you still live there.

204
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,682
Thanks.

205
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:14,224
2,798 miles --

206
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:17,027
that´s how far apart
our dream schools are.

207
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:18,959
Yeah.

208
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,792
Nathan, I said some things
the other night --

209
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,734
I said
some things, too.

210
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,966
I´m sorry.

211
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,039
Me too.

212
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,972
I guess we can add this

213
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,804
to the list of things
we should have talked about.

214
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,246
We can
talk about it now.

215
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:37,908
I didn´t realize

216
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:40,010
I was supposed to figure out
my entire future today.

217
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,883
You should at least
be thinking about it.

218
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,785
Trust me,
i´ve been thinking about it

219
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,717
ever since
i could shoot a basketball.

220
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,319
Look, mayor Scott,
the arrest was a favor,

221
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:52,192
but without anything solid,
i can´t hold him.

222
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,025
In fact, the only charges
i could bring

223
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,928
would be against you
for assaulting your brother.

224
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:00,931
Can I fire you?

225
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,132
No.

226
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:03,934
It´s good seeing you,
Danny.

227
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,806
Oh, uh,

228
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,079
could this visit take the place
of Christmas this year?

229
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,088
[ Sighs ]

230
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,922
Haley: Stanford is, like,
my dream school.

231
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:25,225
It´s where i´ve wanted to go
since I played pretend s.A.T.S.

232
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,998
Man, I forgot
how much of a nerd you were.

233
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:29,029
Oh, whatever, Rambo.

234
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,361
Rambo was cool!

235
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,033
Ha!

236
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,065
Oh, I don´t feel like
i´m picking a college

237
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:37,307
as much as I feel like
i´m picking a future.

238
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,840
Yeah, but didn´t you
kind of pick a future

239
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,071
when you married Nathan?

240
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,643
Watch it, mister.

241
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,917
Hey, by the way, you´re, um,
like, feeling all right

242
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:47,948
and everything, right?

243
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,649
Yeah, i´m fine. Why?

244
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,122
I just had this dream
that you had a heart attack.

245
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,954
And you´re buying
your medicine

246
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,987
and you don´t need to borrow
any money or anything, right?

247
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:59,259
Yes, i´m fine,
but thank you.

248
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,361
What´s up, boyfriend?
Faily?

249
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,264
And i´m never telling you
anything again ever.

250
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,997
Speaking of, though, what is the
deal with these meetings today?

251
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:08,939
College is like
a million years away.

252
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:11,071
Or 3,000 miles. Bye.

253
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,442
Okay, I don´t get it.

254
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,174
She just realized
that she and Nathan

255
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,206
want to go to college across
the country from each other.

256
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,008
They just
figured that out?

257
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:21,712
Isn´t that the sort of thing
couples talk about?

258
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,413
Yes. so...

259
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,756
What are your plans
after high school?

260
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:27,858
Hmm. well, I always figured
i´d marry a millionaire

261
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:31,021
and he´d whisk me away to his
private island in the Bahamas.

262
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,764
Where are you on that,
anyway?

263
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:36,296
How´s the fashion institute´s
basketball team?

264
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:40,700
Is there a good fashion program
at, like, basketball school?

265
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:48,008
Mouth,
you´re totally screwed.

266
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,180
Principal Turner
wants to see you.

267
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,745
I don´t think
i did anything wrong.

268
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,716
I mean,
did he say what he wants?

269
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,849
No, because
he didn´t actually send me.

270
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,320
I just need your help.

271
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,322
But I had an appointment
with the guidance counselor.

272
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,925
Why would you let some burnout
in a dead-end job

273
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,356
tell you
where to go to college?

274
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,458
I mean, college obviously
didn´t work for her.

275
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,161
Rachel,
that burnout´s my mom.

276
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,034
See? I can joke, too.

277
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,936
But seriously,
i need to get back.

278
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:19,739
Just catch the counselor on her
lunch hour at the soup kitchen.

279
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,971
I need your help.

280
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,173
Marvin McFadden?

281
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,479
Keith.

282
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,455
Are you okay?

283
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,057
Yeah, yeah, i´m fine.

284
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,090
The Tree Hill jail
isn´t exactly attica.

285
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,133
You didn´t
have to wait for me.

286
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,935
We can´t let Dan
get away with this.

287
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,338
We should probably sue him or
call the news or maybe even --

288
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:50,500
go out?

289
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,943
The ravens are playing
tomorrow night,

290
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:56,176
and I was thinking that maybe
we should go together.

291
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,508
You´re asking me out
on a date?

292
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:02,082
Keith, Dan is trying
to convict you of murder.

293
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,154
I didn´t kill anyone.

294
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:06,857
Dan is just
trying to rattle me.

295
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:10,961
Besides, nothing would make me
happier than taking you out.

296
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:15,095
And nothing would make Dan
angrier than seeing me happy.

297
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,897
Well, okay, then.
I´d love to.

298
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:20,570
But, for the record, i´ll be
doing it for the first reason.

299
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,272
Okay.

300
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:26,106
The second reason
will just be a bonus.

301
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,039
So, you´re interested
in fashion design?

302
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,112
Yes, but i´m interested
in a lot of things.

303
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,413
Such as?

304
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,315
I´m student council
president,

305
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,918
captain of the cheerleaders,
founder of dwnoti,

306
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,221
and girlfriend of ravens´ star
shooting guard Lucas Scott.

307
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,493
And what are your plans
after high school?

308
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:46,456
After high school,
i have cheer practice.

309
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,131
5, 6, 7, 8.

310
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,964
Cross front, cross back,
turn around, and pop!

311
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:55,035
And pop!

312
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,907
Back it up.

313
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:59,039
Whoa! stop!
Halt! Cut!

314
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,011
Why is everybody
here early?

315
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,072
You´re like an hour late.

316
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,473
I don´t think so.

317
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,515
Unlike you, i´ve never
thought there was a 13:00.

318
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,848
Brooke, Rachel said you wanted
us here an hour early.

319
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,152
And where did you two
think I was this whole time?

320
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,453
Late, as usual.

321
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,285
Brooke, the classic´s
next month,

322
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,187
and we don´t
have a routine yet.

323
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:19,589
I figured since mouth
helped you out last year,

324
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,462
we could maybe come up with one
and surprise you,

325
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,994
so...surprise.

326
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,996
The only way
i´d be surprised right now

327
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,938
is if you were
actually wearing underwear.

328
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,170
I guess no surprises,
then.

329
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,872
Okay. I am the captain
of this squad.

330
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,476
It is my job to come up with
a routine for the tournament.

331
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,149
The tournament´s the same
weekend as rogue vogue.

332
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,151
You´ll be
in New York City.

333
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:46,156
That´s why you submitted
my fashion designs.

334
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:48,218
Surprise.

335
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:06,536
But i´m really hoping
to still play basketball....

336
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:12,182
I guess i´m not ready
to give it up.

337
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:13,683
Keith:
you know, in jail,

338
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:16,216
a shot like that would make you
somebody´s girlfriend.

339
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,917
Yeah, well, you´d know.

340
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,619
I was worried about you.
Are you okay?

341
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,921
Yeah, i´m fine.
Anyway, you´re a kid, Lucas.

342
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,493
You should worry
about kid stuff.

343
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:27,227
Oh, you mean like school,
money, mom,

344
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,699
college scholarships,
scouts?

345
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,562
Wow, it´s tough being a kid
these days.

346
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,205
Since when do you
worry about scouts?

347
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:37,707
Since I realized if I get
a basketball scholarship,

348
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,239
my mom
won´t have to worry.

349
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,411
She likes
to worry about you.

350
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,243
I don´t want her to.

351
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,275
College is expensive.

352
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,418
We´ll manage.
We always have.

353
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,423
What?
you said we.

354
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:59,559
I, um...
Asked your mom out on a date.

355
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,262
I hope that´s okay
with you.

356
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,963
I think it´s great.

357
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,035
What did she say?

358
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,366
Funny.

359
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,338
I guess you had to
ask the question.

360
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:12,102
My track record with your mom
is about as bad as the ravens´.

361
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,373
Aah!

362
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,575
So, do me a favor --
win tomorrow night.

363
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,248
I was gonna say "score,"
but I didn´t think that
was appropriate.

364
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,986
Oh, hi. Come on in.
Have you seen my friend mouth?

365
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,289
He looks just like you, only he
has a skank attached to his hip.

366
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,021
I´m sorry, Brooke.

367
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:33,193
I was trying to help all
the cheerleaders, including you.

368
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,724
Well, for the record,

369
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:37,127
when you´re helping Rachel,
you are not helping me.

370
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,528
I don´t think
she tried to set you up.

371
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:40,670
She said she had no idea
it was the same weekend

372
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,402
when she submitted
your designs.

373
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,205
And you believed her?
Mouth, she is lying, okay?

374
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,777
If you weren´t so busy trying
to see through her shirt,

375
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,679
you would see through
her b.S. -- She´s using you.

376
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,241
How?

377
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,043
I don´t know.
I am not a conniving bitch.

378
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,315
But I know that
if she´s being nice to you,

379
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,187
it is for a reason,
and not a good one.

380
00:16:57,187 --> 00:17:00,190
If you want a new friend,
hang out with the raisin girl.

381
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,422
Her name is gigi.

382
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,255
Yes, gigi -- good.
Rachel -- bad.

383
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:08,328
So, I should stick with
my own kind.

384
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,100
I´m not saying that.

385
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,103
I just know how someone like her
sees someone like you.

386
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:14,534
Someone like me?

387
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:19,169
I get it. A hot girl would never
hang out with someone like me

388
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:21,071
unless
she wanted something.

389
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:22,712
No, mouth, wait.

390
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:25,615
Why? do you have no furniture
for me to move?

391
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:28,618
Woman: your parents
aren´t around?

392
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,750
No, but that´s not unusual
for Tree Hill.

393
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,224
We should have milk cartons
with missing parents on them.

394
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:36,586
It must be difficult
being alone.

395
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:37,727
I´m not alone.

396
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:39,559
I hate being alone.

397
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,162
I have my roommate
and my squad,

398
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,693
my friends,
my Peyton, my Lucas.

399
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,695
Lucas: hey. I didn´t know
what to get you,

400
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:48,598
so I got a little bit
of everything.

401
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:52,202
Is there a kick in the head
in there? That´s what I deserve.

402
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,544
[ Scoffs ]
what´s wrong?

403
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:58,708
Mouth came over earlier, and
i went all "mean girls" on him.

404
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,451
Wait a second.
You were mean to mouth?

405
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,082
Yeah, you know what?

406
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,754
There might be a kick
in the head here somewhere.

407
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:07,387
He´s gotten all buddy-buddy
with that escort wannabe Rachel,

408
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,088
who I found out only entered me
in rogue vogue

409
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,820
because it´s the same weekend
as the classic.

410
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,392
So do them both.

411
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,694
I can´t.
I need you to help me decide.

412
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,667
This is my last year to take
my squad to the classic and win,

413
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,670
but rogue vogue could be my only
chance at showing my designs.

414
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,233
You know what I would do
if I was you?

415
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,734
Hmm?
do them both.

416
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,176
You are not helping.

417
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,677
Okay, they´re
in different states,

418
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:30,740
but they´re during
different times of the weekend.

419
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,143
And I would still have to
be in two places at once.

420
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,584
I´m not supergirl.
I can´t --

421
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,388
I could fly.

422
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:39,889
Oh, my god.
This could totally work.

423
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,222
I could win two trophies
and keep one on my dresser

424
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,254
and shove the other one
up rachel´s --

425
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,499
hello, Peyton.

426
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,231
Oops, I mean Haley.

427
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,733
It´s hard to keep all of
nathan´s girlfriends straight.

428
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,636
You know, i´ll probably
call the next one you.

429
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,238
So, what are you
doing here?

430
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,709
Oh, just some official
mayor business.

431
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:01,741
Wouldn´t want
to bore you.

432
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,743
Oh, thanks.

433
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,176
How´s my new song doing,
anyway?

434
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:08,218
What are you
talking about?

435
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,719
The song
you´re recording.

436
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,851
Nathan´s paying Chris Keller
to work with you,

437
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,783
and since i´m paying
nathan´s allowance

438
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:16,626
for being such a good
little boy, it´s kind of mine.

439
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,758
Oh...

440
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,790
You didn´t know where
the money was coming from.

441
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,862
Don´t you and Nathan
talk about anything?

442
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,765
Yeah, mostly we talk about how
happy he is to be away from you.

443
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,668
You know, that´s not exactly
the thank you I was expecting

444
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,542
after dropping thousands
of dollars on your career.

445
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,674
I´ll see you in class.

446
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,809
Nathan...

447
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,382
Did you pay Chris
to help me with my music?

448
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,753
Good morning
to you, too.

449
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:45,855
I just ran into your dad.
Is that true?

450
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,217
Yeah.

451
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,758
Why didn´t you
tell me, Nathan?

452
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,291
I want us to be honest with
each other about everything.

453
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,593
So, what, every time I want
to do something nice for you,

454
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,395
I have to ask first?

455
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,867
It was very nice, but you, like,
totally went behind my back,

456
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,799
and it felt like something
Dan would do.

457
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,578
Do I have to change the locks
at school now?

458
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:10,810
I´m the mayor.
I have the keys to the city.

459
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,612
Besides, is that any way
to talk to your new teacher?

460
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,414
Principal Turner
asked me

461
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,215
to speak to your
political-science class.

462
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,987
You´re kidding.

463
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:20,850
I need to get away from my dad,
and basketball´s the way out.

464
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,254
The plan´s always been
high school and then Duke,

465
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,455
then the NBA.

466
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,497
Who came up
with this plan?

467
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,230
My dad.

468
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,703
Whoa, where are you going?
Are you just gonna skip class?

college is fun.

I can see you majoring in art
or music or business.

tarot cards or a ouija board?

Well, how ´bout this?

Do you by any chance
see a name for this album?

Hopefully something better
than "this album."

Piece of advice for you,
gramps --

00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:44,493
most coaches
play their leading scorers.

634

It kind of helps them,
you know, win.

of the second half.

Can I talk to you,

Not if it´s about your brother,
Ferris Bueller.

647
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:29,168
The only reason Nathan skipped
class was because of Dan,

648
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:31,000
and the only way
to get him away from Dan

649
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,401
is to let the scouts
see him play.

650
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:34,173
It´s not your place
to defend him.

Yes, it is. You made me

Well, he´s my teammate,

I appreciate your concern
for your teammate,

but rules are rules,

a way to win without him.

because once in a while,

787
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,410
Why? you don´t think
he was impressed

788
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,811
with my
bench-sitting skills?

789
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:47,546
[ Sighs ]

790
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,449
Haley...i´m sorry.

791
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:55,724
It´s just...If I tell you
not to go to Stanford,

792
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:59,388
i´m telling you not
to follow your dreams -- again.

793
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:03,432
If I tell you to go, i´m saying
i don´t want to be with you.

794
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:06,164
So, what do you
want me to say?

795
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,298
Say you love me.

796
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:11,570
Of course I love you.

797
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,473
Shea: Scott!

798
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,205
Dave shea.

799
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:18,347
You played
a great game today.

800
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:21,880
Lucas: thanks.
I had a lot of help.

801
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,914
You know, you should meet
my brother, though.

802
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:27,586
Uh...hey, Nathan!

803
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:36,295
How you doing?

804
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:39,298
All right.
Good to meet you.

805
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,873
The truth is, I don´t really
like to think about college...

806
00:36:44,873 --> 00:36:47,376
´Cause that means
high school´s over.

807
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:56,785
After graduation, everyone will
probably go play basketball

808
00:36:56,785 --> 00:37:00,489
or sing
or start record labels.

809
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,323
And i´ll have to
start all over...

810
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,395
Alone.

811
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:11,460
I´m sure i´ll be fine.

812
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:18,367
But, like I said,
i don´t like to think about it.

813
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,845
♫ I could hold you in my arms ♫

814
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,577
Lucas: at the end of the day,

815
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:31,580
I just want to be with
my family and friends.

816
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,384
I want to play basketball,
and I want to go to college.

817
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:39,388
That´s not too much to ask,
is it?

818
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:42,030
It´s just hard
because the game´s

819
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,364
the only thing
that ever mattered to me...

820
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,296
Till Haley came along.

821
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:53,702
♫ I could hold you forever ♫

822
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:55,504
Coach...

823
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:58,977
I wanted to talk to you
about not playing me tonight.

824
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,780
I´m not having
this conversation again.

825
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,413
It was
the right thing to do.

826
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:09,458
Well, that was a good tip
you gave to Lucas.

827
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,520
It may have
won us the game.

828
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,995
Tonight you put the team
ahead of yourself.

829
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,027
That´s what
a true leader does,

830
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:21,930
and that´s something
your father never learned.

831
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,303
And don´t worry
about that scout.

832
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,977
I´ll see he comes back.
You´ll get your shot.

833
00:38:28,977 --> 00:38:31,510
Thanks, coach, but, uh...

834
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,344
I was hoping maybe you could
call somebody at Stanford.

835
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:42,090
All right,
i´ll make a call.

836
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:47,025
It´s just hard
because before I was married,

837
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,698
I thought Stanford
was my future.

838
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,003
But all those different faces
i remember,

839
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:57,035
all those different people...

840
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,738
None of them are Nathan.

841
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:09,518
♫ and I could hold you
in my arms ♫

842
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:10,619
Hey.

843
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,721
Hi.
how was the game?

844
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:14,583
Yeah, it was okay.

845
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,986
It wasn´t exciting watching
the ravens get their first win?

846
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,430
I was there.

847
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,792
Well, why didn´t you
come say hi?

848
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:26,795
Oh, I just wanted
to watch you do your thing.

849
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:29,398
Oh.
you were great.

850
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:31,670
Yeah, I can go pom-to-pom
with the cheeriest.

851
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,502
I´m serious, Peyton.

852
00:39:33,502 --> 00:39:35,704
You´re smart, you´re funny,
you´re beautiful,

853
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:38,807
and what I can see, there´s
nothing that you´re not good at.

854
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:41,450
You want something?

855
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,981
Except taking compliments,
apparently.

856
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,653
No, i´m sorry.

857
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:48,457
I just --
i´m not used to it.

858
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:52,160
As I watched you tonight,
i thought to myself,

859
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,865
"this girl has so much
to offer the world.

860
00:39:56,865 --> 00:40:00,128
If only
she could see it."

861
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,932
Are you sure
you´re okay?

862
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:05,574
Yeah, i´m fine.

863
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:07,576
I, um...

864
00:40:07,576 --> 00:40:10,439
I came up with
a possible album title

865
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:14,112
and took a shot
at the cover art.

866
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,689
What do you think?

867
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,594
"Friends with benefit."

868
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:27,055
I love it.

869
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:33,201
So, I think
i want to study art and music...

870
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:35,464
And maybe business.

871
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:37,435
Any suggestions?

872
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:43,872
♫ I could hold on ♫

873
00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:48,747
♫ forever ♫

874
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:54,452
♫ and I could hold you
in my arms ♫

875
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,886
♫ ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♫

876
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:00,689
♫ I could hold on ♫

877
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:03,892
♫ forever ♫

878
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:06,695
I hope
you got your pants on.

879
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,801
Go home, Danny.

880
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:14,773
This isn´t your life.
