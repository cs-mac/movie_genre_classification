- How about we write a book together?
- Are you interested in me?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,370
<i>I feel like my head
is going to explode.</i>

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,990
You finally look
like an anchor now.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,610
<i>You've grown up a lot while I was gone.</i>

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,020
<i>Cha Ki Young's world is gone now.</i>

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,720
How dare you bring home a low-class,
uneducated girl like that! Marriage?

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
<i>I don't want to get married either!</i>

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,670
Cha Ki Young! I swear,
I'll kill you if you show yourself!

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,150
Reporter Park, what should I help you with?

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,740
<i>Go! What do you want?</i>

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,740
<i>- I can't get an abortion.
- Call your future husband.</i>

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,360
<i>I almost killed my baby once!
How can I do it again?</i>

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,620
<i>Do you want me to date
a cheap girl like Hyun Myung Yi?</i>

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>I won't forgive you!</i>

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,370
- She's pregnant.
- It's true that she's pregnant. Is it yours?

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,760
- Are you crazy!
- Come quickly! Cha Ki Young!

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,920
I got a sperm donation and
am now successfully pregnant.

[Episode 5]

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,920
I want a child more than I want a husband.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,010
That's why I went to a sperm bank
and received a sperm donation.

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,540
I am now successfully pregnant.

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,190
Anchor Cha, which hospital did
you get the sperm donation from?

24
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,650
No comment.

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,960
- Are you stepping down from your job?
- No.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,770
There is no clause written
in the station's policy

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,160
that states I must step down
if I become pregnant.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,540
That's what you were planning?

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,090
Anchor Jo, when did you first find out
about Anchor Cha's pregnancy?

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,840
There are pictures of you carrying
Anchor Cha to the hospital.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,430
- How do you explain this situation?
- Get out of my way!

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,440
Stop!

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,200
Get out. I said get out!

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,570
A sperm bank? Are you joking right now?

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,760
You think I don't know that you're
trying to hide the identity of the father?

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,990
I feel so relieved.
I think my nausea is finally going away.

37
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,650
Do you think the broadcasting station
and the institution of marriage is a joke?

38
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,950
You're done for. I'm going to destroy you.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,450
- Anchor Cha! Please say something!
- Who is the father?

40
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,120
<i>I... am currently three months pregnant.</i>

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,380
<i>That's why... I went to a sperm
bank and received a sperm donation.</i>

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,710
<i>I am now successfully pregnant.</i>

43
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,840
Oh no! I'm late!

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,020
- You think she'll get fired?
- Her career is over.

45
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,950
- Are you just getting in?
- I had to go to the hospital.

46
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,720
Has anyone gotten
hold of Anchor Cha yet?

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Yes, we had no idea she was pregnant.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,910
- I swear, I'm going to go nuts.
- Hello?

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,620
If we don't tread carefully, the whole
news team is going to get fired, too!

50
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,590
We have no idea what's going on either.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,460
<i>Who is the baby's father?</i>

52
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,290
- Isn't she your daughter?
- Yes, she is.

53
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,390
<i>I am currently three months pregnant.</i>

54
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:04,190
<i>I want a child more
than I want a husband.</i>

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,770
<i>That's why... I went to a sperm
bank and received a sperm donation.</i>

56
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,990
<i>I am now successfully pregnant.</i>

57
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,380
Excuse me, but I can't release
a patient's information.

58
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,390
It's illegal and unethical.

59
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,950
Look here, which newspaper
do you work for?

60
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,670
Asking these kind of questions is illegal!

61
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,890
The reporters have been calling, and
I was wondering what was going on.

62
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,010
One of my nurses showed me a
recording of your press conference.

63
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,480
Director, a mass of reporters
are gathered outside.

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,760
Kick them out and lock the doors.
Unplug all the phone lines as well.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,130
Yes, Sir.

66
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm sorry you have to go through
this because of me, Il Jong.

67
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,250
Why did you say that
you got a sperm donation?

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,410
It's not very favorable for me
to marry the baby's father.

69
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,000
You think his family won't
do anything when they find out?

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,470
It's not only the baby's father.
Besides you, nobody would stand for it.

71
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,330
Regardless of the situation, it's my job
to encourage women to have babies.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,950
What's your reason for trying
to have a baby this way?

73
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,260
I'm following my instincts
for the first time in my life.

74
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,190
I'm sure I'll get hurt quite a bit.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,310
It doesn't matter if I get hurt.

76
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,460
I just don't want my baby to get hurt.
Please help me.

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,970
Are you asking me to say that you got
the sperm donation from our hospital?

78
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm sorry... but please
do that for me, Il Jong.

79
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,840
Legally and by policy...

80
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,650
I won't confirm or deny it.
Is that good enough?

81
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,120
- Open the door!
- Is the doctor inside?

82
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,440
- It's Anchor Cha!
- Anchor Cha!

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,630
Which hospital did you get
the sperm donation from?

84
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,210
I have to go and relay the news right now.
Please get out of my way!

85
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,310
- Are you going to announce the news today?
- Of course.

86
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,310
Work and being pregnant
are two different issues.

87
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,960
It's not a normal pregnancy. Do you think
the broadcasting station will accept it?

88
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,510
Why is my pregnancy not considered normal?

89
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,750
Are you saying it's a crime for a
woman to have a child on her own?

90
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,150
Our country was ranked having
the lowest birth rate in the world.

91
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,130
I don't think that's a question
a reporter should be asking.

92
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,470
- It's not that...
- Anchor Cha! Anchor Cha!

93
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,620
Anchor Cha! Just a moment!

94
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,150
<i>Will you be stepping down
as an anchor then?</i>

95
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,910
<i>I...
[Hyun Myung Yi]</i>

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,630
<i>Reporter Park, did you see the press
conference on Anchor Cha's pregnancy?</i>

97
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,700
<i>How could something like
this have happened.</i>

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,680
<i>I was certain Anchor Cha
aborted the baby.</i>

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
<i>I followed her and saw everything.</i>

100
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,470
Where is Cha Ki Young right now?

101
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,000
We haven't been able to get a hold
of her after her press conference.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,710
Her phone is turned off as well.

103
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,610
What are we going to do about
the evening news tonight?

104
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,040
Let's fire her, President Seo.

105
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,310
In any case, the board
members have all agreed

106
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,340
that letting her go
is the best decision.

107
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,890
As time goes by and the viewers start
to sympathize with Cha Ki Young...

108
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,240
It will be difficult to fire her.

109
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,560
Don't you think the women's group or
her fan club will interfere on her behalf?

110
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,560
In order for the viewers
to forget Cha Ki Young

111
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,460
we have to fire her right away.

112
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,040
What about Cha Ki Young's successor?

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,500
Ever since the rumors
of Cha Ki Young's pregnancy

114
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,820
Anchor Jo has been preparing someone to
take her place. Her name is Kang Young Joo.

115
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,590
<i>[Anchor Cha Ki Young declared herself
a single mother by sperm donation!]</i>

116
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,780
815... don't be scared.
If anyone gets hurt, it'll only be me.

117
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,260
You just tuck yourself away in
my stomach. I'll protect you.

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,700
Something like this won't kill us.

119
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,490
Go back! Please go back!

120
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,130
- Anchor Cha is here, Anchor Cha is here.
- What?

121
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,660
[Announcer Kang Young Joo
promoted to nine o'clock news.]

122
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,420
Hello.

123
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,920
Is the cue sheet out?

124
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,510
- Not yet.
- What about the news articles?

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,040
You didn't see the announcement board yet?

126
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,420
Bring the cue sheet and the news articles
to the dressing room when it comes out.

127
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,880
Did she not see the announcement board?
What's wrong with her?

128
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,550
She did something crazy, but she
really must have lost her mind.

129
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,640
She's not our anchor anymore.

130
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,570
Hey, Cha Ki Young is
getting ready right now?

131
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,720
Yes.

132
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,290
She's not preparing to
announce the news, is she?

133
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,910
Maybe she really didn't get a chance
to see the personnel appointment.

134
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,580
Go get that announcement letter
and show it Cha Ki Young this instant!

135
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,210
Anchor Cha is preparing herself right now.

136
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,690
Hey, go somewhere else to put your makeup
on, and prepare to announce the news.

137
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,020
I don't want any one of you

138
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,440
to show Cha Ki Young the cue
sheet or the news articles!

139
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,010
Did you get the news
articles and the cue sheet?

140
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,520
- Right here.
- The first impression is very important.

141
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,300
- You can't make a mistake! Get going!
- Yes, Sir.

142
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,610
Park Tae Young, what brings you here?

143
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,040
You don't do interviews.
You're just a food reporter.

144
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,440
- Open the door!
- You can't interview her right now!

145
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,900
What is it?

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,480
Is... Myung Yi inside?

No.

- No.

Why are you looking for Hyun Myung Yi?

152
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,570
[Starting today, I will be the nine o'clock
news anchor. My name is Kang Young Joo.]

153
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,010
- Anchor Cha is coming!
- What? What are you talking about?

154
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,680
- Didn't we change anchors?
- What are you talking about?

155
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,140
Is the news not out yet?

156
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,870
[Personnel Appointment]

157
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,900
The news, not this!

158
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,170
Anchor Cha, I'm sorry
that this has to happen.

159
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,290
But, as you can see, there has
been a change in personnel.

160
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,410
Are those the news articles?

161
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,260
I'm sorry, but I can't give them to you.

162
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,210
Director, what should we do?

163
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,050
Should we drag her out?

164
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,780
Just what the heck is going on right now?

165
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,890
I'll go and take care of it
personally, President Seo.

166
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,360
Yes, Ho Pyung?

167
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,870
<i>I thought you took care of Cha Ki Young!
Just what are you doing?</i>

168
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,430
I got it, Ho Pyung. That stupid idiot!

169
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,360
- Eun Cha!
- Kang Young Joo, you follow me.

170
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,760
Move.

171
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,500
Don't embarrass yourself by getting
dragged out of here in front of everyone.

172
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,620
Try and protect whatever pride
you have that's left over.

173
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,750
Anchor Cha, this is the last of my pride.

174
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,880
I thought very highly of you.

175
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,930
But, is this how you repay
the station that raised you?

176
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,490
By stabbing us in the back?

177
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,420
Director, I sincerely apologize
for this inconvenience.

178
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,520
Take the chair away.

179
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,710
I'll send you to study abroad, so go
over there and have your baby quietly.

180
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,500
Then I'll reinstate you.

181
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,660
I thought of doing that many times.

182
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,480
However, I don't want to run away and hide
like a criminal in order to have my baby.

183
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,780
Because it's not a crime to have
baby without getting married.

184
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,580
So, you're saying you will
continue to relay the new?

185
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,300
While your stomach is growing?

186
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,130
Yes, that's what I would like to do.

187
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,670
New personnel has already been announced!

188
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,580
In the meantime, go home for today,
and let's talk about it again tomorrow.

189
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,920
I would like to protect my position today.

190
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,510
Will someone please bring me my chair?

191
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,430
Hey, Park Tae Young.
You're not worth it. Go!

192
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,400
It's five minutes before we go live.
President Seo, what should we do?

193
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,820
What are you guys doing?
Hurry and drag Cha Ki Young out!

194
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,030
Kang Young Joo, go and take her place.

195
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,140
- Let's go.
- Don't do this.

196
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,300
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Let's go.

197
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,490
- Let go of me!
- You have to leave!

198
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,880
- You have to leave!
- Let's go!

199
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,190
- Why are you doing this?
- Let's go!

200
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,070
- Leave!
- Let's go!

201
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,350
Are you okay?

202
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,110
Are you okay?

203
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,990
President Seo, this isn't
going to work out.

204
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,330
It's two minutes
before we go live.

205
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,650
Let her announce the news for today.

206
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,750
I will personally make sure
that Cha Ki Young

207
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,490
walks out of here on her own.

208
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,330
Are you sure? You promised!

209
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,190
Yes, President Seo!

210
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,200
Hyun Myung Yi! Hurry up and bring
Cha Ki Young's chair! Quickly!

211
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,720
Everyone go back to their positions!
Quickly!

212
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,320
Ten seconds before we're on air!

213
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,980
Where is the chair! Just bring
whatever you can find! Quickly!

214
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,660
- Will this be fine?
- It's fine! Put it in there!

215
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,340
Standby!

216
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,520
<i>Hello, this is Channel Korea with your

Director, what should we do now?

223
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,710
<i>They say happiness plays a huge factor
in order to live freely among the public.</i>

224
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,750
You said everything was taken
care of with that child, right?

225
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,290
Yes.

226
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,940
<i>I want a child more
than I want a husband.</i>

227
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,280
<i>That's why I went to a sperm bank
and received a sperm donation.</i>

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,550
<i>- I am now successfully pregnant.
- What is this now?</i>

229
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,850
Welcome.

230
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you have a good night.

231
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,060
This was Channel Korea with your nine
o'clock news. My name is Cha Ki Young...

232
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,880
and Jo Eun Cha.

233
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,120
<i>We've headed over to commercial.</i>

234
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,110
Good job, everyone.

235
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,370
- This is no joke.
- What a mess.

236
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,060
I told Hyun Myung Yi to bring the chair.
Where did she disappear to?

237
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,690
- I don't know.
- How is the bulletin board?

238
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,480
The server has crashed
and the SNS is no joke.

239
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,320
Photos of Cha Ki Young was ranked first

240
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,040
and her declaration of being a single
mother was ranked second on the internet.

241
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,640
Cha Ki Young has been the talk of
the town today. Are you pregnant too?

242
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,690
I ate like crazy today.

243
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,310
I'm throwing up on purpose because
I'm afraid I'll gain weight.

244
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,750
Why did you buy so much clothes?

245
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,560
You told me to wear cheap clothes.

246
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,680
You said you hated cheap clothes.

247
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,870
You said you have to wear designer
clothes if you want to meet a rich man.

248
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,510
Yoo Ri, can you introduce
me to a guy? Someone decent.

249
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,910
- Did you fail to seduce Park Tae Young?
- Yeah.

250
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,530
Why?

251
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,240
Since I'm a knockoff, I wasn't able
to handle a luxury brand like him..

252
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,580
I got indigestion, so I gave up.

253
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,610
Since I'm lacking, too
much luxury is a burden.

254
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,420
So, introduce me to a mid-grade brand.

255
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,330
Among all the doctors and lawyers

256
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,530
take out the men who were raised in Gangnam
and graduated from ivy league colleges.

257
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,350
Someone from the country.
A simple, country bumpkin.

258
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,490
You know... a man who was raised in the
country and doesn't know women very well.

259
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,430
Someone who lives by himself
in a seven hundred square foot studio.

260
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,200
They have potential, but they're
men who are easy to manipulate.

261
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,580
To Seoul please.

262
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,720
We're in Damyang County.

263
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,560
I know, so hurry up and take me to Seoul.

264
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,710
<i>Hey.</i>

265
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,630
I want to see you. Are you home?

266
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,770
- Go ahead and talk.
- I want to talk to you face to face.

267
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,070
<i>Come up.</i>

268
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,160
I thought I should see you
at least once and tell you.

269
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,520
About what?

270
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,310
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,680
This is what I wanted to say to you.

272
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,910
Why would you be sorry towards me?

273
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,130
I liked you.

274
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,940
But, I decided that marrying
you would be difficult.

275
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,850
If I become a part of your family, I would
have to completely throw myself away

276
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,990
and become an empty shell.

277
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,930
That was difficult for me to do.

278
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,090
I have no idea what it is that
you're trying to say to me.

279
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,410
It would be hard for me to have
the baby if your family finds out.

280
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,480
And even if I did...

281
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,460
I felt like they would have
taken the baby away from me.

282
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,470
If it's about your baby,
I'm not interested.

283
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,170
Go back.

284
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,480
<i>- Yes, Father?
- Is Cha Ki Young's baby your baby?</i>

285
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,740
It isn't mine.

286
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,170
Then what in the world is going on?

287
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,080
<i>It hasn't been long since that
crazy wench came to our house.</i>

288
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,570
What kind of nonsense is
she blabbering on the news?

289
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,040
I don't know too much about that either.

290
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,190
I'm in the middle of a meeting right now.
I'll call you later.

291
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,140
If you have nothing more
to say, can you leave?

292
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,710
Make sure your parents understand.

293
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,030
- About what?
- That it wasn't your baby.

294
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,750
It's not mine!

295
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,910
You're right, so please
tell that to your parents.

296
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,170
Even if by chance that
sperm did belong to me...

297
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,690
It has nothing to do with me!

298
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,940
Because you already aborted my baby.

299
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,920
815, the world...

300
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,410
is a lot colder than I thought.

301
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,290
I went to Choi Il Jong's
maternity clinic to confirm

302
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,970
if Cha Ki Young's sperm donation was true.

303
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,230
Man, they are completely
tight-lipped over there.

304
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,780
That hospital...

305
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,970
belongs to the husband of
Announcer Na Yoon Hee

306
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,220
Cha Ki Young's best friend.

307
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,920
- So what?
- What do you mean so what?

308
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,490
They could have lied
and conspired together.

309
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,060
So, are you saying that Cha Ki Young
might have a secret boyfriend?

310
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,460
I can't believe you're a
paparazzi with that brain of yours.

311
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,070
This... did you take it?

312
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,180
- No. A man named Pedro took it.
- Pedro?

313
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,710
- Who is Pedro?
- He's a freelancer.

314
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,380
Ah, I have his number.

315
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,090
I got you.

316
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,100
Coming.

317
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm coming.

318
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,470
Is the baby's father inside?

319
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,190
No.

320
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,490
Where did you hide him?

321
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:01,420
Ki Young, it's fine that you're pregnant.
Where is the man?

322
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,750
- I don't have one.
- Why don't you have a man?

323
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,290
What are you going to do?

324
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,490
Let's abort it, okay?

325
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,560
- I don't want to.
- What are you going to do then?

326
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,100
- I'm going to have it.
- Oh my gosh, you've lost your mind.

327
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,110
You're not even married! How could you
say that you're going to have a baby!

328
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,580
Let's go and abort it
first thing tomorrow.

329
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,220
You can have a baby
after you get married.

330
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,800
- I don't want to get married.
- Then you have to abort the baby!

331
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,760
I can't do that!

332
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,390
Then... let's just kill ourselves!

333
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,390
Mom!

334
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,080
- Mom! Don't do this! Mom!
- Let go of me, you brat!

335
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,770
Do you think I'm able to
think clearly right now?

336
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,510
How can I live when I'm too embarrassed
to even lift my head back home?

337
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,720
- It's better to just die!
- What's wrong with you? Don't do this!

338
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,010
Let go! Let go of me!

339
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:14,460
I can't go on living! I just can't!

340
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,630
Let's go and abort the baby
right away tomorrow.

341
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,180
Even when you were married
to someone like Dad

342
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,760
you said you couldn't leave him
because of your children!

343
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,470
Then why can't you understand
where I'm coming from?

344
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,370
What's to become of your life
if you go through with this?

345
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:43,080
I raised you so well!
How could you destroy your own life?

346
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,450
How? How could you do this?
You've lost your mind, haven't you?

347
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,030
You're not in your right mind, right?

348
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,050
What do you think you're doing?

349
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,310
It's better to just kill yourself
if you're going to have the baby!

350
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,590
Mom!

351
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,770
Just die!

352
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,530
Mom.

353
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,530
Mom!

354
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,820
Mom!

355
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,780
I have to go to work.

356
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,720
The news won't be aired until the evening.
What's the point of going out this early?

357
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,240
People are doing everything
they can to get rid of me.

358
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,730
I need to go and protect my spot.

359
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,680
Unbelievable.

360
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,480
A woman is following her
instinct to have her baby.

361
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,840
Who do they think they
are to interfere?

362
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,780
- You should eat before you go.
- I'm fine. I don't have an appetite.

363
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,480
You say you're pregnant, but you're
going around and starving yourself.

364
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,350
I'll be back, Mom.

365
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,300
I'm not going anywhere
until you abort the baby.

366
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,600
My poor baby.

367
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,560
What are we going to do now?
What are we going to do?

368
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,100
What are we going to do?

369
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,600
It's Jo Eun Cha!

370
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,180
What can I help you with?

371
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,790
- He's so handsome!
- He's so good-looking!

372
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,500
It's fine.

373
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,180
We're from Yeo Heng Man.
Please give this to the president.

374
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,270
But, where exactly is Yeo Heng Man at?

375
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,580
Tada!

376
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,520
We're a support group that advocates
a woman's right to be happy.

377
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,410
I swear!

378
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,360
The broadcasting station
isn't a place where

379
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,670
anyone can just come
and go as they please.

380
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,060
Please leave! Go away! Leave!

381
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,200
We have over ten thousand
members in our group.

382
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,720
If Anchor Cha gets kicked out,
you, Jo Eun Cha

383
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,430
will be branded as a man who
trampled a woman's happiness

384
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,570
and become the number one person
on every woman's blacklist. Got it?

385
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,900
By any chance,
is Park Sun Nyeo also a member?

386
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,490
Who is Park Sun Nyeo?

387
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,790
Do you know her?

388
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,030
Didn't Park Sun Nyeo send you ladies here?

389
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,650
We don't know a Park Sung Nyeo.

390
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,590
- We don't know her!
- We're from Yeo Heng Man!

391
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,280
The scariest thing in this whole
world are middle-aged women.

392
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,190
But what's even scarier than
them are feminists. Feminists!

393
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,980
One of the women's group
sent a statement

394
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,300
saying that they are
supporting Cha Ki Young.

395
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,030
I'm going crazy.

396
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,000
- What were the ratings for last night?
- Yes, Sir.

397
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,680
It went up five percent.

398
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,570
[Nine o'clock News
Overall Ranking and Rating]

399
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,180
The news is the least of everyone’s concern.

400
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,680
The people are more interested in whether
or not Cha Ki Young is announcing the news.

401
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,100
Even so, the ratings can't continue
to rise because of her scandal.

402
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,360
The elderly and male viewers
are throwing a fit

403
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,250
and demanding that
we fire Cha Ki Young.

404
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,160
The female viewers and people
in their twenties and thirties

405
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,720
made a fan cafe on the internet.

406
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,750
And they're continuing to support her.

407
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,830
Of course we should we fire her.

408
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,250
She's a woman who's not even married.

409
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,200
To watch her relay the news while
her stomach gets bigger everyday?

410
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,800
We can't allow that.

411
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,750
Jo Eun Cha.

412
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,830
You promised me that you would
have Cha Ki Young quit voluntarily.

413
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,410
She came to the station since
dawn to protect her position again.

414
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,010
Jo Eun Cha, what are you going to do?

415
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,330
If only we can find the man
who donated the sperm to her.

416
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,860
What are you talking about?

417
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,120
President Seo.

418
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,940
Do you honestly think the meticulous
and flawless Cha Ki Young

419
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,220
would accept a sperm donation from
a faceless man and become pregnant?

420
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,460
Then...

421
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,840
Did you guys see Cha Ki Young's
press conference yesterday?

422
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,570
Yeah, I thought she was awesome.
She relayed the news with such confidence.

423
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,030
She's amazing, but she still has her phone
turned off. I can't get a hold of her.

424
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,940
It's probably turned off because
the reporters won't leave her alone.

425
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,490
'Talk and Taste' is going to be a huge hit.

426
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,330
It's almost as if someone knew we
would be launching our book soon.

427
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,490
and they just decided
to promote it for us.

428
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,460
The birth of A Korean Angelina Jolie!

429
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,930
Editor, what do you think
about this headline?

430
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,450
It's awesome. We'll easily sell
a hundred thousand books.

431
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,730
Right?

432
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,940
Stop overreacting and focus
on preparing the book launch.

433
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,800
It's totally useless if
Cha Ki Young decided

434
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,490
to cut off all contact
and keep silent.

435
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,270
- Continue to call her.
- Yes, Ma'am.

436
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,980
- Check ahead and find out where she lives.
- Yes, Ma'am.

437
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,240
Got it?

438
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,530
<i>- Hello?
- Is this Pedro?</i>

439
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,240
Who are you?

440
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,590
<i>Reporter Jo Nam Chul from Deep Focus
gave me your number to call you.</i>

enough for that picture?</i>

444
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,370
Ten million won?

445
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,410
Wait a minute.

446
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,620
- You know me, don't you?
- Who are you?

447
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,880
You're Park Sun Nyeo's boyfriend.

448
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,460
No, I'm not.

449
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,660
Seeing how good-looking you are,
you're a player, aren't you?

450
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,430
How much are you getting paid to do this?

451
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,350
Watch what you say.

452
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,290
Ah, my back! You bastard!
Stop right there! You bastard!

453
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,390
What is this?

454
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,490
The doctor said it's going to take
two weeks for me to completely recover.

455
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,180

inflicted bodily harm onto me.

00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,910
I'm not the father of Cha Ki Young's baby.

458
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,810
You're a legend in the journalism world.
Have you lost your touch?

459
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,340
An exclusive article of
you and Cha Ki Young

460
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,310
is going to be
published this month.

461
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,870
You are the only woman for me.

462
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,740
Why won't you acknowledge
my feelings for you?

463
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,220
My boyfriend is going to
get angry if he finds out

464
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,340
that we're even talking
to each other!

465
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,980
What? You mean that
naive and innocent punk?

466
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,400
Ah, seriously.

467
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,310
Honey, it's me...
By any chance, did you hurt Jo Eun Cha?

468
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,800
I'll take care of the hospital bill
this time, but don't do that again.

469
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,930
Honey, his body is totally
different from yours.

470
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,110
He won't heal because he's so old.
It's just a waste of hospital fees.

471
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,810
So, hold it in from now on, okay? Promise?

472
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,720
Right now?

473
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,310
Okay, baby.

474
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,580
Okay, baby?

475
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,180
My boyfriend said if he doesn't see
me everyday, he'll get a brain tumor.

476
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,660
One centimeter at a time.

477
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,580
I swear!

478
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,680
What is this?

479
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,330
[Talk and Taste]

480
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,380
Park Tae Young and Cha Ki Young
are publishing a book together?

481
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,610
They're publishing a book together

482
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,820
but they're acting like
they don't know each other.

483
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,200
I got you.

484
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,820
Hey, Prosecutor Park.
I need a favor from you.

485
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,260
Yes. I'm counting on you.

486
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,490
A place where she can
abort it quietly without

487
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,530
having to worry about
rumors being spread.

488
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,880
Make sure they know what they're doing.

489
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,320
I plan on taking her this Saturday.

490
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,930
Welcome.

491
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,000
I'd like to lease my studio.

492
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,510
Why... you worked so hard to get
it and it hasn't even been a year.

493
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,760
Hey, Sun Nyeo.

494
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
<i>Are you the father of Cha Ki Young's baby?</i>

495
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,310
No.

496
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,890
Then it's true, Jo Eun Cha is the father.

497
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,490
- What are you talking about?
- Hey.

498
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,690
Don't you know that she
cheated on you with Jo Eun Cha?

499
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,770
<i>Why do you think she accepted
him as a double anchor?</i>

500
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,700
<i>It's because they had something
going on between them!</i>

501
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,340
I'm busy so hang up.

502
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,650
Whether it's a lease or monthly basis,
I'd like to move out as soon as possible.

503
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,970
Sure, I understand.

504
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,170
Do you have anything
open on the tenth floor?

505
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,880
- I do, but it's a little expensive.
- The price doesn't matter.

506
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,290
The water pipes are also broken.
There's quite a bit that needs to be fixed.

507
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,900
That's not a problem, just fix it.

508
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,440
Anchor Cha Ki Young lives on the 11th
floor and she's very sensitive to noise.

509
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,080
A song writer who used to live on that
floor moved because she complained so much.

510
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,250
Well, I only cook, so it should be fine.

511
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:11,130
Cooking doesn't make any noise. Now,
let's sign a contract for the tenth floor.

512
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,550
Really?

513
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,690
But...

514
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,810
You're absolutely sure that Anchor
Cha Ki Young lives on the eleventh floor?

515
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,670
Of course!

516
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,030
Are you Anchor Cha Ki Young?

517
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,780
Chairman Park Kang Rok
would like to see you.

518
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,780
I'm working right now.

519
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,580
She said to let her know ahead
of time if you want to see her.

520
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,820
- What?
- But...

521
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,570
she's busy this month so
she can't make time for you.

522
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,360
Unbelievable! Honey, just
what in the world did you do?

523
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,930
- Tae Yun.
- Why are you crawling back in again?

524
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,160
- I'm moving in indefinitely, Father.
- Says who?

525
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,210
I've completely broken up
with Cha Ki Young.

526
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,440
Just what in the world did that
crazy girl mean with her words?

527
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,580
She got what from what bank?

528
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,630
You crazy fools!

529
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,240
- Please sit down.
- Bunch of crazy idiots!

530
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,630
Please sit down. Sit down.

531
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,010
Goodness.

532
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,470
You still haven't ate, right?

533
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,350
It's been awhile since we've
shared a meal together as a family.

534
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,880
I'll call Sun Nyeo to come home early.

535
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,300
Go up to your room and get some rest.

536
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,320
Eat it while it's still hot.

537
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,920
Is it good?

538
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,330
Even though I'm from the country,
I'm quite ahead of the times.

539
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,100
If you were the daughter of a farmer...

540
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,070
I might have applauded you.

541
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,300
Is it necessary to get
married in this day and age?

542
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,780
I know too.

543
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,490
I know, but...

544
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,970
because you're my child...

545
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,060
my head and heart are telling
me two different things.

546
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,930
Why is that?

547
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:49,160
The pain you will have to go
through after you have that child...

548
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,330
Just thinking about that pain...

549
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,020
It breaks my heart.

550
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,150
I feel the most sorry towards you.

551
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:11,130
Making sure that I marry well...
I know that was your only hope.

552
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,420
I made an appointment this
Saturday at a hospital in Damyang.

553
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:24,760
Mom, I feel like I'm going
to die if I abort the baby.

554
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,870
If you have that baby...
I feel like I'm going to die!

555
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,970
- It's not Tae Yun's baby, Father.
- Then why did he bring her home?

556
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,940
You know Tae Yun always
does whatever he wants.

557
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,040
If it's not your baby,
isn't that girl really crazy then?

558
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,970
I mean, she came here to introduce
herself so she could marry you.

559
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,600
And now she's pregnant
by going to a sperm bank?

560
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,090
- Why...
- Father.

561
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,330
I don't think Tae Yun is the father.

562
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,610
I think her personal life has
always been complicated.

563
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,770
There are pictures of her being carried
inside the hospital by a different man.

564
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,390
If not, she would've used
the baby as an excuse

565
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,670
and tried to trap Tae Yun into marriage.

566
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,000
Why would she announce that she
got pregnant from a sperm donation?

567
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,240
I'm pretty sure she said that because she
can't reveal the identity of the father.

568
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,300
Or maybe he's married.

569
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,860
What?

570
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,180
Hey, that's why you ended
it with Cha Ki Young, right?

571
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,920
Stop talking about her.

572
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,330
You stupid fool! Of all the women out
there, you picked a crazy woman like that?

573
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,770
Sit down.
Your father's not done eating.

574
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,130
Why is it that both of our children
are always lacking in some way?

575
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,440
We have one who brings home a crazy woman!

576
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,920
And an idiot who is almost
forty years old and still single!

577
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,430
I'm going to get married.

578
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,550
Who is it this time?

579
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,190
A woman that you and
mother are pleased with.

580
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,350
Will we be able to live
separately once we get married?

581
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,560
No. We'll have to live with my
parents until they pass away.

582
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,350
I'm the only son since
the last four generations.

583
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,790
Eleven memorial services
are held every year.

584
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,950
You'll have to wash my seriously prickly
and abnormal sister's underwear.

585
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,700
And you will have to wear
traditional clothing everyday.

586
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,650
Ah, I see.

587
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,380
What is your salary?

588
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,480
It's about forty to fifty
million won a year.

589
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,400
Do you have any debts?

590
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,480
I have a mortgage that's almost paid off.

591
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,790
If it's a house mortgage,
then do you own it or is it leased?

592
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,170
Ah, the men and women in our
family don't eat together.

593
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,140
You'll have to prepare everyone's
meals separately, three times a day.

594
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,460
Is that so?

595
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:15,910
But... there is one way to
live separately from my family.

596
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,230
It's a lease.

597
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,110
You got a loan to lease the house?

598
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,270
I wanted to live without getting
any support from my parents.

599
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,400
My dream was to buy a house
of my own before

600
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,960
the age of thirty-five by saving
money from my salary.

601
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,790
The cost of buying a house
is so expensive

602
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,490
that it's impossible to buy one even if I
saved every penny for the rest of my life.

603
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:35,990
Do you want to cut all
ties with your parents

604
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,660
and live in a measly three hundred
square foot room with me?

605
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,930
My salary is forty million won.

606
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,210
If we scrimp and save
for about twenty years...

607
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,810
We would be able to buy a a seven hundred
square foot apartment in Seoul.

608
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,110
Will you be willing to work
if we get married?

609
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,110
Yes!

610
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,420
No one has been able to get in touch with
Anchor Cha since the press conference.

611
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,000
No matter how much I call her,
she won't answer her phone.

612
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,830
She won't even agree to a single interview.

613
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,370
She relays the news, though.

614
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,030
I was told she disappears as
soon as she's done with the news.

615
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,480
And she goes around avoiding
the reporters like a ghost.

616
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,950
I heard all interviews have been
banned at the broadcasting station.

617
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,250
They're afraid she might
cause an accident again.

618
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,370
Seeing how she's not
even answering our calls

619
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,950
I don't think she's going
to show up for the book launch.

620
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,360
Do you think it's best to postpone it?

621
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,190
Just proceed as we planned.

622
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,580
<i>Anchor Cha Ki Young.
The book launching party is tomorrow.</i>

623
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:56,090
<i>We can expect that you'll be there, yes?
It's two o'clock at the press center and</i>

624
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,480
<i>I'll call you tomorrow to confirm.</i>

625
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,530
You scared me!

626
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,200
Oh, you're real. I thought
you were a mannequin.

627
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,140
There are rumors
going around that

628
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,990
you've been setting a mannequin
in that seat lately.

629
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:22,270
There are also rumors going around that
your soul is stuck right in that seat

630
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,400
because of your grudge against the
people who wants to kick you out.

631
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,980
You know what I'm talking about, right?
A living ghost.

632
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,820
If feelings of hatred are extremely
strong from a living person

633
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:37,050
Those emotions separate itself from
the person and manifests into a ghost!

634
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,680
I'm scared!

635
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,410
Hey, why is it so cold
inside the studio lately?

636
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,420
Are you... a ghost or a person?

637
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,870
- Are you going home?
- I'm going to the restroom.

638
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,150
Hey! What are you doing?

639
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,090
Do want to see Father collapse?

640
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,440
Don't you know that he
absolutely detests you cooking?

641
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,320
I hear you've been going on blind dates.

642
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,970
So, did you find a woman that you like?

643
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,650
I like all of them, but I
don't know who to choose.

644
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,810
The book is out.

645
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,150
It's nice.

646
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,430
The book launch is tomorrow.
You're going to come, right?

647
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,450
- No.
- Why? Is it because of Cha Ki Young?

648
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,640
Why are you avoiding her?
You did nothing wrong.

649
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,060
Frankly, you're the one who
wrote this book, not her.

650
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,580
That's enough.
I'll cover you, so come tomorrow.

651
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,990
- I told you not to mess around with this!
- Father!

652
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,060
- Father!
- You bastard!

653
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,080
Are you trying to play house, you bastard?

654
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,260
Father, no! That's a new book!

655
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:13,840
That's a new book! Father!

656
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,010
You're here.

657
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,830
Yoo Ri.

658
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,400
Yeah? What is it?

659
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,830
Is it okay if I spend
the night at your house?

660
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,700
Why? Are the reporters camping
out in front of your place again?

661
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,580
My mom is waiting for me so we
could go to Damyang tomorrow.

662
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,790
She made an appointment with an
obstetrician. To abort the baby.

663
00:50:54,790 --> 00:51:00,320
Sure. It's easier trying to convince people
who talk ill of you than your own parents.

664
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,360
There's no where to go.

<i>[Hyun Myung Yi]</i>

666
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,130
Hey.

667
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:42,830
<i>Tae Yun, it's me.
Can you come and pick me up?</i>

668
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:46,900
<i>Besides, I always went to you.</i>

669
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,660
<i>- Come to me just for today.
- Where are you?</i>

670
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,690
You came.

671
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,190
I got my wish.

672
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,590
Why is a young lady drinking
alone this late at night?

673
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,590
I'm not a young lady anymore.

674
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:21,440
I was before I slept with you,
but I'm not anymore.

675
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,280
Don't lie!

676
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,760
I have something to say to you.

677
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,000
That's why I asked you to come.

678
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,620
I wanted to talk to you face to face.

679
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,550
I was so happy that I slept with you.

680
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:51,240
Even if you don't like me and
your heart lies with Cha Ki Young

681
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:59,410
for a moment... I was able to
be by your side, and I was happy.

682
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:09,570
Of all the guys I've seen...
you're the best, Tae Yun.

683
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,410
I am so sick and tired of you women.

684
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,300
Let's go.

685
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:32,660
There's no reason for you to break up
with me since we haven't started anything.

686
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,340
But, I'm going to end it with you today.

687
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,740
Forever.

688
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:59,080
It hurts so much that I want to end it.

689
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,550
Thank you for everything.

690
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,630
I won't call you from now on.

691
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,480
Please don't call me.

692
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,560
Do you have some time tomorrow?

693
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,620
Why?

694
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,250
The launching party for
'Talk and Taste' is tomorrow.

695
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,390
Come to the event. You helped
me out, so you should come.

696
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,220
No, thank you.

697
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,040
Mom, I'm sorry.

698
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,990
Just... go by yourself tomorrow.

699
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,100
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

700
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,040
I'm not going to get rid of the baby.

701
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:08,370
Mom, I'll call you again.
Have a safe trip tomorrow.

702
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,060
- You must feel terrible right now.
- Yeah.

703
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,570
Besides dying first, disobeying your
parents is probably the next worst thing.

704
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,550
So, you do know.

705
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,970
What about Il Jong?

706
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,980
An obstetrician is on standby
twenty-four hours a day.

707
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,900
Seriously, who is baby's father?

708
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,130
I'll tell you later.

709
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,000
Honestly, if I was
courageous like you...

710
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,080
I would've just had a
baby and not get married.

711
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,080
Why? Il Jong is a thoughtful husband.

712
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,680
People are different than what
they actually appear to be.

713
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,640
All married couples have issues
that people have no idea about.

714
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,500
Married women have to take care of all the
housework, the children, and the in-laws.

715
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,240
We have to wash our husband's
clothes and cook for them.

716
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,140
Your situation is far more favorable
if you think about those things.

717
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,200
People say the institution
of marriage is going

718
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,030
to collapse and disappear
in fifty years.

719
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,600
I should've been born fifty years later.

720
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:33,770
You came.

721
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,550
Eun Cha, don't ask me to do these errands
for you. I could get fired for this.

722
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,030
Prosecutor Park. Whether you get fired
because you didn't listen to me or

723
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:45,200
you get fired because you got
caught running an errand.

724
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,750
Isn't that the same thing?

725
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,170
Thank you.

726
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,300
Put this over there and...

727
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,160
- get more staff in here.
- Yes, Ma'am.

Is Cha Ki Young really coming?

729
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,610
No way. She's been avoiding
the reporters like the plague.

730
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,190
You think she's going to show up?

It's Cha Ki Young!

Miss Cha Ki Young!

733
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,060
Anchor Cha Ki Young, what did you mean
by declaring yourself a single mother?

734
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,440

decided to receive a sperm donation.

child and not a marriage?

736
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,130
Anchor Cha, please say a word.

- Yes.

Ah, just a moment please.
Excuse me, thank you.

741
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,000
The book is to die for.
I actually paid for it.

742
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,280
To receive a masterpiece like this
for free would be disrespectful.

743
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,160
Who should I get a signature from?

744
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,830
Ah, it splattered this way.

745
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,560
As usual, I've always liked women the best.
