00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,877
<i>Episode 20</i>

2
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:22,261
In order to cure my daughter Laobusi's illness, I concocted eight herbal tablets.

3
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:30,293
I never thought you would steal them and eat them!

4
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:33,849
Your daughter's name is Laobusi (never-die)?

5
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:35,520
She will never die, even when she's old!

6
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:38,443
Isn't it a lucky name?

7
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,809
Can't you even comprehend that?

8
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:41,923
Sorry,

9
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:45,010
I didn't know those pills were for your daughter.

10
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,641
How about this? You can get the famous Dr. Ping to cure your daughter's illness.

11
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,714
I don't need you to tell me that.

12
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:54,474
I know that better than you!

13
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,842
So that Ping Yizhi would cure my daughter's illness,

14
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,156
I ran to his home and killed 5 people!

15
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:09,399
Only then, Ping Yizhi had no choice but to help diagnose my daughter.

16
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,724
He found that my daughter has had this illness since she was in the womb.

17
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:20,765
So, he gave me a prescription for the eight herbal life-extending tablets.

18
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:23,716
Otherwise, how would I know how to make pills?!

19
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:28,205
You killed five people in his family, and he still helped you?

20
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,761
Why are you so stupid?

21
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,888
Do I have to spell it out for you?!

22
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:40,038
Ping Yizhi doesn't have many enemies.

23
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:44,971
His patients have already killed off most of them for him.

24
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,870
Do you know who Ping Yizhi hates the most in his life?

25
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,307
His mother-in-law.

26
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:56,390
But Ping Yizhi is scared of his wife

27
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,471
and couldn't do it himself.

28
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:02,200
So I killed his mother-in-law

29
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:04,241
for him.

30
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,121
Afterwards, Ping Yizhi was super happy

31
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:12,161
and agreed to help treat my daughter's illness.

32
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,684
So that's what happened.

33
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:24,516
No matter what is said, you've already drank my medicine so now I'm in a desperate siuation

34
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,842
Since you just drank the medicine, it's still in your blood.

35
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:31,239
Drinking your blood is just the same.

36
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:40,345
Father, who is that person?

37
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,520
He's not a person.

38
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,515
He's your medicine!

39
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:48,160
Medicine?

40
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:49,678
Right.

41
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,204
Father's eight herbal life-extending tablets are extremely potent.

42
00:04:55,237 --> 00:05:00,474
He drank the tablets, so we're going to take his blood.

43
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,254
Don't, father.

44
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:06,593
Why not?

45
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:11,362
Father, he's a person. It will really hurt him.

46
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:15,395
No, he's not a person.

47
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:17,535
He's your medicine.

48
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,596
He won't hurt.

49
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,277
Father, don't.

50
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:33,591
Did you know, daughter? For you, for your illness, for an early cure to your illness,

51
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,871
do you know how I've spent the past decade?

52
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,550
The eight herbal tablets

53
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:46,351
are the result of my painstaking efforts!

54
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:50,847
Father

55
00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:01,080
No matter what, even if this is wrong, I have to do it!

56
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,536
- No, don't, father!<br>- Be quiet!

57
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:05,955
You will get better.

58
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,201
You will get better.

59
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,873
Don't, don't, father.

60
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:22,681
My daughter,

61
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,096
even if this is wrong, Father must do this.

62
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:36,199
Kid, to save my daughter, I will take your blood to treat her. Are you afraid?

63
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,070
If you want to kill me or slice me, then do it! Cut the crap!

64
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,332
Good, a tough guy.

65
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,748
Don't, don't father.

66
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:48,873
Even if I'm wrong, I don't care!

67
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:50,605
Stop!

68
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,914
Zu Qianqiu?

69
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:56,525
You have the face to show up here?

70
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,282
You can't hurt Linghu.

71
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:05,635
If I don't take his blood, my daughter has no hope!

72
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,982
Old man, listen to me.

73
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:10,276
Speak.

74
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:25,076
Mr. Linghu, I am muddleheaded.

75
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:29,265
If Heavens didn't have eyes and send Zu Qianqiu here,

76
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:35,525
even if I died 1,000 times or 10,000 times, it wouldn't atone for my crime.

77
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,046
You...

78
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,349
What are you guys up to?

79
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,120
I was really too muddleheaded.

80
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:52,033
I didn't know you were such close friends with our savior.

81
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:57,760
If I had known, I wouldn't dare take a single drop of your blood

82
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,862
to cure my daughter.

83
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:01,950
Old man, really.

84
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:05,222
Fortunately this Mr. Linghu is the bigger person.

85
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:11,677
But I really hope your tablets will benefit his health.

86
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:14,273
Then you would have done a meritorious deed.

87
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,923
Your deed is greater than mine.

88
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,303
Ok ok I know I'm wrong.

89
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:21,963
I shouldn't have stolen your eight herbal tablets.

90
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,592
But, look.

91
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:28,129
I found lots of ginseng at the nearby pharmacy.

92
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:32,430
Caterpillar fungus, reishi mushrooms, and more. I think you will find them useful.

93
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,115
Better than nothing.

94
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,781
You two are known as the "Yellow River Ancestors", right?<br>Yes

95
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:43,246
Although you have good intentions to treat my injuries,

96
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,510
but you lied to me!

97
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:49,576
Then you acted recklessly!

98
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:53,574
Hero Linghu is indeed righteous and noble

99
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,314
Thanks, it's nothing

100
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:57,771
Actually, you can have my forgiveness.

101
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,036
But I have a question

102
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,484
which you must answer truthfully.

103
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:03,597
Of course, of course.

104
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,116
Please ask your question.

105
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,926
Who exactly ordered you to give me this royal treatment?

106
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,717
You really don't know?

107
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,743
How would I know?

108
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,237
Mr. Linghu, you don't know...?

109
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:18,871
Then we can't say anymore.

110
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,106
No we can't.

111
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,986
Really, even if you killed us, we wouldn't dare say.

112
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:26,666
Is that so? Then pardon my offense.

113
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:38,992
What are you going to do?

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,038
Don't be like this!

115
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:46,442
- I'll be like this if I want to!<br>- And I thought Linghu Chong was a gentleman!

116
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:50,038
I never thought he would force himself on girls!

117
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:53,915
Yue Buqun, do something about your disciple! Yue Buqun!

118
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,119
I'm telling you, don't move!

119
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,556
If you move around, I might kill you with my blade.

120
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:03,396
No...no...!

121
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:07,002
- Don't force me!<br>- Yue Buqun, what is your disciple doing over there?

122
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:11,362
That girl...is he forcing her to marry him?

123
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:15,208
Rather than her, why doesn't he marry me?

124
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,242
Miss, what a coincidence! We meet again!

125
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:26,602
Looks like you're in a great mood.

126
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:28,770
Ugly freak of nature!

127
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:32,885
...Handsome man, I came here looking for you.

128
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:37,049
But I got caught in a trap. Hurry, help me down!

129
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,946
You just called me ugly freak of nature.

130
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:44,106
If I were to let you down then wouldn't that mean I'm easy?

131
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,346
I'm not letting you down.

132
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:46,466
No,

133
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:48,593
to hit and scold means you love someone.

134
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,275
I only said that because I like you.

135
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:52,910
What did you say?

136
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,906
I only said that because I like you.

137
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,555
- No no no, the line before<br>- To hit and scold means love

138
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:02,032
To hit and scold means love.

139
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:06,592
Then I really want to express my love for you!

140
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:09,755
Is that expression of love enough?

141
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,083
Let me down!

142
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,163
That woman out there...

143
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:28,726
Who did this?

144
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,170
- Linghu...<br>- Father!

145
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:33,475
Your precious daughter!

146
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,954
Don't, don't look!

147
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,965
If you don't want to humiliate me, then stay out of this!

148
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,215
- Old man!<br>- Father!

149
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:44,801
- Daughter! <br>- Stay calm!

150
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,959
This...

151
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:56,459
Here, be careful with your wound.

152
00:11:56,525 --> 00:12:01,993
- Daughter...<br>- Father, he lost a lot of blood.

153
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,439
He already forced me to drink two bowls of his blood.

154
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,320
He was going to make me drink more.

155
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,088
Mr. Linghu!

156
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:14,593
Old man has nothing to repay you with!

157
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,454
Ok ok stop crying.

158
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,168
Let's help him outside.

159
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:22,635
Here, slowly.

160
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,727
Is it Chief Yue of Huashan Sect who has arrived?

161
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,473
Please show yourself.

162
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:37,595
Yue Buqun, someone's looking for you! Come out!

163
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:46,029
Mr. Yue, your disciple Linghu Chong is seriously wounded. Please come with me inside to rescue and treat him.

164
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:52,363
May I please ask for your name.

165
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:54,929
I am Ji Wu Shi.

166
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:57,982
So you are the night owl Ji Wu Shi.

167
00:12:57,982 --> 00:12:59,523
That's right.

168
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:02,839
Mr. Yue, saving his life is critical. Inside please.

169
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,006
Hey, handsome man, come over! Come over quick!

170
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,326
Quickly!

171
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:09,760
Let me ask you, how did Linghu Chong get wounded so bad?

172
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,180
Just now, didn't you say you only liked me?

173
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:16,438
How can you start asking about another man's injuries so soon?

174
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:18,994
Are you a slut?

175
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:23,016
No no. That Linghu Chong owes me a lot of money.

176
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:25,966
I just want him to be healthy, so he can pay me back.

177
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,314
Then I can marry you.

178
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:29,994
Really?

179
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,917
You're adorable!

180
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:37,599
I really want to express my love for you again!

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,837
Hey, what are you going to do?

182
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,760
I already said, I want to love you again.

183
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,163
Chief Yue, please.

184
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:48,964
Ji Wu Shi, let me down!

185
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,329
Mr. Linghu

186
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:54,727
Mr. Linghu

187
00:13:56,067 --> 00:14:02,568
Surely enough, Huashan Sect's Violet Mist Divine Skill lives up to its reputation!

188
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:05,397
Master, you're here?

189
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:08,389
Chong'er, since you're wounded, you may dispense with the formalities.

190
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,046
You risked your life to save my daughter.

191
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:18,960
Even my own life is not enough to repay you.

192
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,139
Don't say that.

193
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,479
My internal injuries can't be cured by most medicines.

194
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:25,800
I took your eight herbal life-extending pills by accident.

195
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,492
It is truly an insult to your miracle drug.

196
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:33,462
I hope that after this girl drinks my blood, her illness will take a turn for the better.

197
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:36,179
Consider it my way of making it up to her.

198
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:41,751
Look how open-minded and righteous Mr. Linghu is.

199
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,678
Even Sacred...

200
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,195
Even saints fall short of our Mr. Linghu.

201
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:57,435
Thank you all for treating my disciple kindly. We should be leaving now.

202
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:03,308
Hero Yue, since we brought Mr. Linghu here,

203
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:06,905
I think we should take him back.

204
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,467
Yes yes yes.

205
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,281
Ji Wu Shi! Let me down!

206
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,999
I won't call you freak anymore from now on!

207
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:17,518
She's my friend.

208
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:20,916
We will release her immediately! Immediately!

209
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:39,074
Chong'er, how do you feel?

210
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:42,175
Much better, thanks.

211
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:46,079
Tomorrow morning, I will definitely come with you to Five Hegemon Hill.

212
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,920
Five Hegemon Hill?

213
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,513
Linghu...

214
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,676
We're only passing through.

215
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:06,046
I don't know if we've offended the Wulin people here.

216
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:11,238
My daughter and a disciple named Lin were taken away by two people dressed in black and white.

217
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,276
Do you happen to know anything about this?

218
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,217
This...

219
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,529
You three...

220
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,131
Mr. Linghu, is anything the matter?

221
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:31,201
If you know anything, please tell them

222
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:35,520
to release my junior sister and brother, ok?

223
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:39,910
We will definitely obey.

224
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,108
Please take the trouble.

225
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:42,476
Rest well.

226
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,951
We're leaving now.

227
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:51,348
- Heroine Ning, we will be leaving.<br>- Goodbye.

228
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:00,940
Blue Maiden

229
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,307
Blue Maiden, what do you want?

230
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:07,593
- I...<br>- What?

231
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:09,834
I'm serious...

232
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,721
What? Serious about what?

233
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:16,377
Serious about loving you.

234
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,515
Maiden

235
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,525
I admit it was my fault for hitting you

236
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,322
but I really have no interest in you, at all.

237
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,245
You're lying!

238
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,920
I'm not lying!

239
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:35,520
To hit and scold is to love. You hit me twice!

240
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:36,889
You must love me.

241
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:39,240
Yes.

242
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:44,346
This is the most important thing to me.

243
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,227
I want to give it to you.

244
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:50,509
If you accept, then I will follow you to the ends of the earth.

245
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:56,346
But if you throw it away, then from now on I will break all ties with you!

246
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:06,589
Maiden, you said so yourself.

247
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:10,233
As long as I throw this away or smash it,

248
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,676
then from now on we go our separate ways. You can't latch onto me anymore!

249
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:16,563
You wouldn't really smash it?

250
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:19,718
I...

251
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:22,794
You really smashed it!

252
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:28,731
I smashed it! Yes, I did!

253
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,524
Maiden, you said so yourself.

254
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:35,061
As long as I throw this away, you won't latch onto me anymore.

255
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:36,902
Of course!

256
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:40,028
From now on, I won't latch onto you anymore.

257
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:45,073
But you should at least open it up and see what's inside.

258
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:48,114
Right right right, you should look.

259
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,756
Open and take a look.

260
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:57,379
- Qianqiu! This..<br>- This is my jade cup!

261
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:00,877
From Northern Song!

262
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:05,598
Ji Wushi, you bastard!

263
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,309
How could you just smash it?!

264
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,387
I didn't do it on purpose.

265
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:11,871
Pay for my loss!

266
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:14,740
Pay for my loss!

267
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:15,908
- Don't run!<br>- I didn't do it on purpose!

268
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,878
Qianqiu!

269
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:23,240
To mess with me, you're still too inexperienced!

270
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:27,879
Actually, Sister Lan, to love someone...

271
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,278
Remember,

272
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:42,749
all beautiful women have tempers.

273
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,786
Father, mother!

274
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:54,598
Master, master's wife.

275
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:55,995
Shan'er, are you alright?

276
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,639
They were so mean!

277
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,879
They beat us and scolded us.

278
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,047
They said lots of bad things about senior brother.

279
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,117
Mother, they even said they would steam and eat me.

280
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:11,879
Silly girl, they were just scaring you.

281
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,849
No, they're really cannibals.

282
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:16,918
Last night, the black monk had a plate of meat and asked me if I wanted some.

283
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,916
I saw clearly it was a human hand.

284
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,016
Then why didn't you tell me?

285
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,084
I didn't want to scare you.

286
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,401
They must have been the "Desert North Duo"

287
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:28,319
They're bandits from the desert north of the Great Wall.

288
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:30,146
One is called White Bear, the other is Black Bear.

289
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:34,107
They rob peoples' houses, and exclusively eat human meat.

290
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:37,946
Then did you eat it?

291
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,312
Ok, don't talk about this anymore.

292
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,525
Let's hurry on our way to Fuzhou.

293
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,679
What do you want?

294
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,330
As long as you hand over the Bixie Swordplay Manual, we'll let you live.

295
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:55,766
That manual doesn't belong to you.

296
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:58,003
You've had it for so long, you must have memorized it by now.

297
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,808
Why do you still hold onto it?

298
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,438
I already told you! I don't have the manual!

299
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,648
Stop talking! Just kill him.

300
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:06,602
Stop.

301
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:09,876
You're fighting two against one. That's really unfair.

302
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:11,394
Interfering in our business?

303
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:12,835
What's your relation to Yu Canghai?

304
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:14,342
He's my enemy.

305
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:16,478
I have an irreconcilable vengeance against him.

306
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,482
I must kill him myself!

307
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:24,442
Who's this little boy? You want to kill Yu Canghai?

308
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:27,999
I am Huashan Sect disciple, Lin Pingzhi.

309
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:30,601
You're from Huashan Sect?

310
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,322
Then where is Linghu Chong?

311
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,609
I am Linghu Chong.

312
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:39,014
Do you have some business with me?

313
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,368
Mr. Linghu!

314
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,762
Guests, please enjoy.

315
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,309
- Here<br>- Thanks

316
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:58,721
We've heard many jianghu friends mention your name

317
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,919
so we have great respect for you.

318
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,382
We traveled here night and day

319
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:05,524
to have a glimpse at your presence.

320
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:08,478
We didn't expect to meet you here. This is great.

321
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,235
You're too polite. Let me toast you.

322
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,916
Our jianghu friends have already arranged

323
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,199
to meet you tomorrow at Five Hegemon Hill.

324
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,126
It will be a lot of fun.

325
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:23,492
Mr. Linghu, you have to come.

326
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,165
I might not be able to make it.

327
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,001
Why?

328
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,678
Because I have to go to Fuzhou with my master.

329
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:32,226
Chief Yue is also here?

330
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,955
Yes, he's sitting right next to us.

331
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:36,155
Thanks.

332
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:42,277
This elder must be Chief Yue?

333
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,485
I don't deserve this.

334
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,482
Chief Yue, I heard that lately, you injured many formidable opponents with just one stroke of the sword.

335
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,310
Your name shakes the jianghu!

336
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,396
Humble junior bows in admiration.

337
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,790
Hey, why are you saying so much rubbish?

338
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,996
Mr. Linghu won't go to Five Hegemon Hill.

339
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,611
Mr. Linghu, you must come tomorrow.

340
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:08,642
As far as I've heard there will be many different leaders and heroes of the pugilistic world going in order to greet you

341
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,470
You show such great hospitality in inviting me. What exactly is this for?

342
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,459
We prepared some miracle drugs for Hero Linghu.

343
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:18,382
We plan to present them to you.

344
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,257
Just go!

345
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,508
Is that so?

346
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:24,678
Actually, I'm just a nobody.

347
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:26,751
You treat me so well, I feel guilty.

348
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:30,071
But I'd really like to know on who's behalf you're doing this.

349
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,024
Can you tell me?

350
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:39,386
Hero Linghu, you will find out when you go to Five Hegemon Hill tomorrow.

351
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:44,572
Hero Linghu, if you don't go, everyone will feel really bad.

352
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:46,152
No, I...

353
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,812
Linghu Chong! It would be ungracious to refuse.

354
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:50,453
Not going would be improper<br>I...

355
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:53,604
So many jianghu people will be present. I'm going too.

356
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:56,243
Go! Just go!

357
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:00,559
Ok ok, then I accept.

358
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:02,613
Ok?

359
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:07,318
Then we will be waiting for your arrival tomorrow at Five Hegemon Hill.

360
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,477
See you tomorrow.

361
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,224
Stop here

362
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:15,672
They came

363
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:17,982
Come on

364
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:26,707
Hero Linghu, I'm here to escort you to Five Hegemon Hill.

365
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:30,083
Really? I still haven't thanked Brother Sima for those jars of fine wine.

366
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,028
You're too polite.

367
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,063
It's just wine. Don't mention it.

368
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:35,825
It's almost time. Please get on the carriage.

369
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,026
Brother Sima, please wait a moment.

370
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:40,002
I'll be right back.

371
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:46,237
Are there any good-looking guys at Five Hegemon Hill?

372
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:47,966
What do you need good-looking guys for?

373
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:52,638
Look at me, I'm so beautiful, if I were to remain unwed

374
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:54,243
Then that would be so tragic

375
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:57,783
Which is why I must find my Mr Right so that we can live happily ever after

376
00:24:58,676 --> 00:24:59,597
I see.

377
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:03,239
The saying goes "everyone has different tastes"

378
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,283
All the heroes will be there.

379
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:08,127
I don't know what type you like.

380
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:09,168
But you'll find out once you get there.

381
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,682
I will go pick the best one!

382
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:13,941
Chong'er I think it's best you don't go

383
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,873
Whether it's a blessing or a curse is unknown

384
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,769
With an uncertain moral alignment

385
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,878
Your master's already upset that you're friends with those people.

386
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:28,197
But master-wife, I don't think they have any ill intentions.

387
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,147
And I really want to know who's behind them.

388
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:32,744
Master-wife, please relax

389
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:39,365
Master, I will be back very soon.

390
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:07,435
Senior

391
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,722
It can't be predicted what this event will bring for Chong'er

392
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,730
This time, all the evil heretic sects are gathering at Five Hegemon Hill.

393
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,516
Who knows if they're plotting something detrimental to our Huashan sect.

394
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:21,674
I think we should go with him to check it out.

395
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:29,042
Denuo, you three go to Fuzhou first

396
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,081
Your master-wife and I will arrive shortly

397
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:32,366
Yes, Master

398
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,571
Be careful<br>-Yes, Master-wife

399
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,918
Open!

400
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:54,004
Big!

401
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:59,312
Good!

402
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:03,238
Six! You lost!

403
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:04,510
Drink!

404
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,222
Hero Linghu has arrived!

405
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:13,962
Go!

406
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,963
Go!

407
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:23,086
Greetings Hero Linghu!

408
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:26,687
Friend Linghu <br> Greetings everyone, this is Linghu Chong

409
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,481
Here are all the brothers of Five Hegemon Hill.

410
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,647
Hero Linghu, we have prepared the best wine

411
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,610
We're prepared to drink with you for three days and nights!

412
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:41,329
It's so hot outside. How about we go rest inside the tent?

413
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,430
Everyone, please wait a moment.

414
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,859
Master<br>-Chong'er, look at this place

415
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,956
These are not upright people.

416
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,833
I think you should leave now.

417
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,320
Master, they've treated us with respect.

418
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:57,749
I don't think they have any malicious intentions.

419
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:01,627
I don't think they have any good intentions!

420
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,471
They just want you to join their heretic demon sect!

421
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:07,597
Chong'er your master has a point

422
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:13,197
If you don't turn around before it's too late, you will bring ruin and shame upon yourself, and be eternally doomed!

423
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:17,480
Sect leader Yue, Hero Linghu, let's talk inside.

424
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:21,391
Hero Linghu, all the brothers want to pay their respects to you.

425
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,434
We also prepared a miracle drug for you.

426
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,469
Brothers! Show Hero Linghu the way!

427
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,717
Please! Let's go.

428
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,955
Master, master-wife, I'll be right back!

429
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:36,910
Don't worry!

430
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,111
Let's drink!

431
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:45,935
Junior-wife, seems like we should find a hideout to keep a close watch on them.

432
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:49,588
See what they're really up to. Let's go.

433
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:51,963
Everyone toast!

434
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:56,879
Dear friends, I am just a nobody.

435
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:59,203
I really have no way of repaying your kindness to me.

436
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,326
Cheers everyone! From now on, we share our fortunes and misfortunes together!

437
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:04,966
Excellent!

438
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,755
Don't drink!

439
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:15,475
What are you people doing?

440
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:18,076
Forcing Hero Linghu to drink...

441
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,519
you want him to die sooner?

442
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:23,658
Dr. Ping <br> Sit down

443
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:26,388
Sit sit sit.

444
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:33,103
Dr Ping, this...To live or die is decided by the heavens<br>You've already been troubled twice because of me

445
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:34,588
You really don't need to bother with me anymore.

446
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:40,960
Master, within one day you consumed numerous potent supplementary tonics

447
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,753
Old man, you gave Hero Linghu the eight herbal tablets.

448
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,321
Are you trying to kill him?!

449
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,349
I...

450
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:51,167
Dr. Ping, don't blame him.

451
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:52,523
I took it by accident myself.

452
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:58,107
The eight herbal tablets are for women born with vital energy deficiencies and anemia!

453
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:01,661
You have no vital energy deficiencies. In fact, you have too many energies!

454
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:04,362
Then on top of that you took potent supplementaries

455
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:10,751
Just think, the river is already overflowing, and you want to pour in more water!

456
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,430
How can it not turn into disaster?!

457
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:17,759
I deserve to die.

458
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,081
I deserve to die.

459
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,045
Old man, don't say that. This has nothing to do with you.

460
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,329
It's my fault, all my fault.

461
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,242
I deserve to die!

462
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:28,902
This is all my fault!

463
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,484
Stop blaming yourselves, ok?

464
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:32,399
Consuming supplementary tonics is one thing...

465
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:39,070
Now tell me, how are you supposed to battle anyone ever again?

466
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:40,787
You also lost a lot of blood.

467
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:43,433
Such a show of bravery

468
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:45,402
How will this benefit your life?

469
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,920
Others hold you with such high regard yet you don't even know how to love yourself

470
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,687
For a gentleman to beget revenge after a decade it's not too late

471
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,462
Why the need to be so hasty?

472
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:54,659
Ping Yizhi!

473
00:30:55,642 --> 00:30:58,081
No, no, no. I didn't mean anything.

474
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:03,717
Look, what I mean to say is that this has nothing to do with Hero Linghu.

475
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,670
It's all my fault.

476
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:07,315
I deserve to die.

477
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:08,787
What's wrong with you? Saying that again?

478
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,706
This has nothing to do with you!

479
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:12,750
I caused this!

480
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,184
I caused this!

481
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:16,026
- No, I deserve to die.<br>- You two!

482
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:17,563
Shut up!

483
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:20,117
Dr. Ping!

484
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:24,317
Then just tell us what we can do to heal his injuries!

485
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:28,171
If he only took pills by accident, I might have a way to save him,

486
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,599
but unfortunately...

487
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:31,961
What?

488
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:42,189
Last time I took your pulse, although your injuries were very severe, your heart was full of vitality.

489
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,437
But why are you now disheartened?

490
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,241
You don't want to live anymore?

491
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:54,480
Based on your pulse, this has something to do with love.

492
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:58,648
Hero, you're usually carefree and uninhibited,

493
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:00,899
why get hung up on love?

494
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,838
Your condition has taken a turn for the worse.

495
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,369
Even the immortal Daluo Jinxian can't help you.

496
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:15,402
But to extend your life by a few months, or even a few years,

497
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:16,808
I have a way.

498
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:18,601
But you have to do as I say!

499
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,841
First, give up drinking.

500
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,913
Second, don't be so restless and frisky.<br>No women!

501
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,356
Third, give up fighting.

502
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:29,394
No drinking, no women, no fighting.

503
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,335
Then you can live a few more years.

504
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,327
Life is already hard enough as it is.

505
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:40,425
If I can't drink, look at women, or fight back when I'm bullied,

506
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,477
then what's the point in living? I'd rather die!

507
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:43,676
You!

508
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:48,213
But if I can't treat you, my reputation will be ruined!

509
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,312
Dr. Ping, I know you're an excellent doctor,

510
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:51,792
but I'm bound to die!

511
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:53,231
It's perfectly normal if you can't cure me!

512
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:55,434
Linghu Chong!

513
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:57,122
Dr. Ping?

514
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:58,712
Your illness must be cured!

515
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:00,074
Then let's all drink!

516
00:33:00,774 --> 00:33:01,641
He's incurable.

517
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:03,077
What?

518
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:04,604
Dr. Ping, you're the renowned killer doctor.

519
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,764
If you can't cure him, you're destroying your own reputation!

520
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:08,601
Don't talk nonsense.

521
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,162
Renowned killer doctor?

522
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:14,293
If I can't cure...

523
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:18,601
if I can't cure him...

524
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,397
if I can't cure him...

525
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:32,402
Dr. Ping!

526
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:35,069
He ran away just like that?

527
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,990
Chase after him!

528
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:38,962
Why should I take orders from you?

529
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,786
Did you forget? Dr. Ping said so.

530
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,210
If anything happens to Dr. Ping, I will hold you responsible!

531
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:46,519
I only listened to you because Dr. Ping told me to.

532
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,238
Now that he's gone, why should I listen to you?

533
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:51,348
Aren't you afraid of your face turning ugly again?

534
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,108
Look out for cute guys for me.

535
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:56,367
I'll be back.

536
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,763
Sorry about that.

537
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:03,684
Let's forget all about what just happened.

538
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:08,775
Life is short. I'm going to die sooner or later anyways.

539
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:10,882
Might as well drink to our hearts' content today!

540
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,138
Til we get drunk!

541
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:15,397
Good!

542
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:16,429
- Bad news<br>- What is it?

543
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,312
How much did he drink?!

544
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:44,190
We were having fun drinking

545
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:48,389
but...Sacred Lady had to throw a fit.

546
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:52,871
Actually, all we wanted was for Hero Linghu to recover soon

547
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,230
so he can be a perfect couple with Sacred Lady.

548
00:34:56,936 --> 00:35:01,116
I really don't understand why Sacred Lady would be so furious!

549
00:35:01,552 --> 00:35:02,553
You don't understand?

550
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:08,952
We did go overboard at Five Hegemon Hill.

551
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,875
Actually, it's very normal for man and woman to be in love

552
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:23,875
Only a beautiful woman like Sacred Lady would be good enough for the dashing, chivalrous Hero Linghu.

553
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:33,901
But what's puzzling is...why would the extraordinary Sacred Lady act shy and embarrassed like an ordinary girl?

554
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:40,101
She clearly likes him, but won't allow others to mention it.

555
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:41,548
Or see it!

556
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:44,321
I really don't understand.

557
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:55,800
Although Sacred Lady is an extraordinary lady from Black Wood Cliff, she is after all still a young girl.

558
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:59,663
She likes a man for the first time

559
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:06,115
and is too embarrassed to say it. That's perfectly natural.

560
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:09,317
Makes sense.

561
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:17,032
Do you know why our plan to suck up to Sacred Lady totally failed?

562
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:23,647
- Let's hear it<br>- Because we're a bunch of boorish men!

563
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,521
We don't understand a young girl's heart.

564
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,694
Pity!

565
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:39,800
There were quite a few women at Five Hegemon Hill

566
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:45,283
but they were all like men!

567
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:53,532
At the gatherings of the heroes on Five Hegemon Hill, all the flattering and the Sacred Lady's anger...

568
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,560
If word of these were to spread, wouldn't it have become a laughing stock to those orthodox sect dastards?

569
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,403
Laughing stock?

570
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,200
What's there to laugh at?

571
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:07,400
Sacred Lady is our savior.

572
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,109
We have to repay her kindness

573
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:15,718
All we need to remember is to wish for her lover's speedy recovery

574
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:22,425
A true man should live in conscience and clearly distinguish kindness and hatred

575
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,901
We pay our debts, for the kindness or grudges

576
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:26,845
What's wrong with that?!

577
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:27,921
What's wrong with that?!

578
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:35,288
If anyone in the jianghu dares laugh at us,

579
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,847
I will break his bones

580
00:37:39,886 --> 00:37:41,322
and rip out his skin and tendons!

581
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,183
Well said old man.

582
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:47,906
We're indebted to the Sacred Lady

583
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:54,239
If we can get them together and make her happy ever after, even if we have to die, there's nothing more to regret

584
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,824
So what if we were snubbed at Five Hegemon Hill?

585
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:04,682
What I'm worried about is...Hero Linghu is Huashan Sect's eldest disciple.

586
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:07,712
They have irreconcilable differences with Black Wood Cliff.

587
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,395
I'm afraid...

588
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:15,601
I'm afraid this union will be extremely difficult.

589
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:18,601
What are you reckless guys talking about behind my back?

590
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,461
Greetings Sacred Lady

591
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:24,878
Sacred Lady, we were just talking nonsense.

592
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:26,159
Please don't take it seriously.

593
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,720
Yes, we've already decided

594
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,620
we're heading west tomorrow. We will never come back to the central plains again.

595
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:35,598
Yes, we will disappear from your sight.

596
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:38,052
Who told you to go west?

597
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:41,839
I won't look any further into the incident today.

598
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,667
But I need you to do something for me.

599
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,756
Sacred Lady, please give us your command. We subordinates will spare no effort.

600
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:11,676
Sacred Lady, please give us your command.

601
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,670
I want to kill someone

602
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:20,910
Spread the word. If anyone in the jianghu can kill this person for me,

603
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:22,750
I will reward him generously.

604
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,281
Sacred Lady is our savior

605
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,078
We wouldn't dare accept any reward.

606
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:33,852
If Sacred Lady wants this person's life, we will chase to the ends of the earth to find him.

607
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:36,913
But...who is this criminal

608
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:40,250
who risks universal condemnation to offend Sacred Lady?

609
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:43,928
It's not enough to rely only on the few of you

610
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,875
Immediately pass the word

611
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:47,959
onto everyone.

612
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:50,438
Yes

613
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:52,817
Hurry

614
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:58,449
We still don't know who it is Sacred Lady wants to kill.

615
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,162
The person's family name is Linghu, surname is Chong

616
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:04,602
He's HuaShan Sect's eldest disciple

617
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,481
His existence tarnishes my clean reputation.

618
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:17,723
Everyone thinks I like him, I want to prove that I don't

619
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:22,797
If you help me kill him, you will help me vent my anger.

620
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:25,466
Sacred lady

621
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:28,520
I dont know where this Linghu Chong has gone

622
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,239
Take your time

623
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:33,519
But you have to spread the word first, understand?

624
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:38,370
We will do as you ordered

625
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:39,709
Let's go

626
00:40:55,147 --> 00:40:57,547
This is all your fault

627
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,787
that everyone in the jianghu is laughing at me.

628
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:03,832
As if no one wants to marry me

629
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:06,238
and I'm so desperate to be with you.

630
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:09,613
What's so great about you?

631
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:11,692
Now I'm ashamed to show my face in front of others.

632
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:32,280
I only told Zu Qianqiu &amp; Co. to spread the word so that you will stay with me forever,

633
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:34,350
and never leave me.

634
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,816
Everyone, Brother Linghu is benevolent and righteous

635
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,279
but Sacred Lady ordered us to kill him.

636
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,631
What should we do?

637
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:56,723
Yeah! What should we do?

638
00:41:57,466 --> 00:41:59,737
Hero Linghu treats me so well

639
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,942
I cannot kill him

640
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,198
But Sacred Lady ordered us

641
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:04,542
I dare not disobey!

642
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,161
What are we supposed to do?

643
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:10,479
Alright, I have a good plan

644
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:16,686
After I kill Hero Linghu, I will commit suicide

645
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,518
Don't do it <br> What now?

646
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:22,461
It's useless. Latouzi, you better not commit suicide

647
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,320
Why's that?

648
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,274
Think about it, Linghu Chong was sitting right next to Sacred Lady.

649
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,825
Why would she say she can't find him?

650
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:37,679
How would I know?

651
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,151
Your numb skull is really stupid.

652
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,860
Sacred Lady doesn't really want to kill Linghu.

653
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:49,879
Clearly, she likes him but is too shy.

654
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,593
So she orders us to tell everyone she wants him killed.

655
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:56,970
That way, it will seem like there's nothing between them.

656
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:58,723
You're right!

657
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:05,653
This Sacred Lady of ours is just too proud to admit that she has fallen for him

658
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,125
The more she tries to conceal it, the more obvious it is

659
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:13,168
Everyone, just pass on the message as she ordered.

660
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:15,056
But we will have it seasoned with some extra details

661
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:20,067
In this way, everybody gets the point while we can also save the Sacred Lady from embarrassment

662
00:43:20,193 --> 00:43:21,765
It will be easier for us to report to her too

663
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:25,586
This is an excellent plan.

664
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:32,861
But what if some dumb person doesn't understand the complex meaning of this message,

665
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:35,471
and actually kills Hero Linghu?

666
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,210
Don't worry, even you understood it.

667
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:42,973
Who else could be dumb enough to risk their life doing something foolish?

668
00:43:50,703 --> 00:43:53,347
What! What does that mean?!

669
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:05,426
Junior-wife, can you see Chong'er

670
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:08,866
There's too many people, I can't see clearly

671
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:11,120
Lets follow them

672
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:12,609
We'll find out later

673
00:44:52,399 --> 00:45:03,113
<br>
