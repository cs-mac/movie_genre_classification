1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,480
<i>Garbage.</i>

2
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,360
<i>All I've been thinking about all week
is garbage. I can't stop thinking about it.</i>

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,840
<i>What kind of thoughts about garbage?</i>

4
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,840
<i>I just... I've gotten real concerned over
what's gonna happen with all the garbage.</i>

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,120
<i>I mean, we've got so much of it.</i>

6
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,280
<i>You know? I mean, we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually.</i>

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,400
The last time... I started feelin' this way
is when that barge was stranded

8
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
and, you know, it was goin' around
the island and nobody would claim it.

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,040
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,800
<i>Do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern?</i>

11
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

12
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,040
You see, the other night
John was taking out the garbage,

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,000
and he kept spilling things
out of the container,

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,800
and that made me...

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,280
I started imagining, like,
a garbage can that produces garbage.

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,640
And it doesn't stop, it keeps producing
garbage. And it keeps overflowing.

17
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,120
And, you know, what would you do
to try to stop something like that?

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,880
<i>- Ann, do you see any pattern here?
- What do you mean?</i>

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,320
<i>Well, last week we were talking about</i>

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
<i>your obsession with
the families of airline fatalities.</i>

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,240
<i>Now we're talking about your
concern over the garbage problem.</i>

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,320
<i>Yeah... So?</i>

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,760
Well, if you think about it, I think
you'll see the object of your obsession

24
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,440
is invariably something negative
which you have no control over.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,760
Yeah, but how many people do you think

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,120
run around obsessing over
how great and how happy things are?

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,920
You know, I mean, maybe they do,
but I don't think they're in therapy.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,560
Anyway... bein' happy isn't all that great.

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,520
I mean, the last time
I was really happy, I got so fat.

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,280
I must've put on 25 pounds.

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
I thought John was gonna have a stroke.

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,680
<i>- So, what are you worried about?
- What am I looking at here?</i>

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
<i>- Is this a mistake?
- Depends on your point of view.</i>

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,520
I don't think so. In fact,
I'm gonna tell you a little secret.

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,240
As soon as you get a ring on your finger,
you start getting spectacular attention

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
<i>- from the opposite gender.
- That's bullshit!</i>

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,440
Seriously. I wish I had
Super Bowl seats for every time

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,560
some filly had come up and talked to me
without the slightest provocation.

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,040
<i>- It's just marvellous.
- That happened before you got married.</i>

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,840
No, no, no.
It never happened before I got married.

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,360
If I'd known, I'd have bought a ring
when I was 18 and saved myself...

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,960
<i>Yeah, right!</i>

43
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
...a lot of time and money.

44
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,160
No, I wish somebody'd clued me in.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,480
I'm tellin' you.

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,840
It's too weird.
Oh, shit, I gotta be someplace.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
<i>- So, racquetball Thursday, right?
- How about 7.30?</i>

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,440
<i>- Yeah, fine. See you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,640
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Janet.</i>

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Reschedule Kirkland for, uh, Friday, 1.30.

51
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,760
<i>- Yes, sir.
- All right.</i>

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,640
<i>Are you still
keeping these thoughts from John?</i>

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,680
<i>Yeah.</i>

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,480
<i>Are you afraid of his finding you silly
at thinking these things?</i>

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,720
<i>No, it's not that. It's just...</i>

56
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
<i>- I'm really angry at him right now.
- Why?</i>

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,960
<i>He invited this college friend of his to
stay at our house and didn't even ask me.</i>

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm gonna say yes, of course, but...

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,480
you know, it just would've
been nice to have been asked.

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
What upsets you about that?

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,720
I guess it makes me angry
because I can't justify bein' angry.

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,560
It's his house. He pays the mortgage.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,880
Yes, but he asked you to quit your job,
and you do have housework.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,320
Yeah. I have housework. That's true.

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,000
This unexpected guest notwithstanding,
how are things with John?

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,080
Oh, they're fine.

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,440
Except for I'm going through this thing
where I don't want him to touch me, but...

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,720
<i>When did you begin having this feeling?</i>

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,440
<i>Well... last week.</i>

70
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
<i>I don't know, I just... I got this
really strange feelin', and... ugh...</i>

71
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,440
<i>just didn't want him to touch me.</i>

72
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,880
<i>Prior to this feeling, were you
comfortable with contact with John?</i>

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
<i>Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah.</i>

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>Except for... well...</i>

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,480
<i>I've never really been that much into sex.</i>

76
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,320
<i>I mean, I like it and everything, but...</i>

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,720
<i>You know, I just don't think
it's such a big deal, and...</i>

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,640
<i>I wouldn't miss it, you know, kinda thing.</i>

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,680
<i>But lately I've just... been kinda curious
about how things have slacked off.</i>

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,920
<i>Perhaps he senses
your hesitance at being touched.</i>

81
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,480
<i>But that's the weird thing,
because he started not touching me</i>

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080
<i>before I started feelin' like that.</i>

83
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
<i>Ah.</i>

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,120
<i>I mean, I'm sure he probably wishes
that I would initiate things once in a while,</i>

85
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,040
<i>and I would, except for
it just never occurs to me, and...</i>

86
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,840
<i>well, the few times
I have felt like it I was by myself.</i>

87
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,680
<i>Did you do anything?</i>

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,320
<i>What do you mean?</i>

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
<i>Did you masturbate?</i>

90
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,360
Oh!

91
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
Oh. Oh.

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,120
God, no.

93
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,200
No. Mm-mm.

94
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,480
I take it from your response
that you never masturbate.

95
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,120
Well... I tried once.

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,640
It just seems so stupid!

97
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,920
I don't know! It just seemed like
a dumb thing to do, and...

98
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,680
God, and then I started worrying that my
dead grandfather was watching me, and...

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,360
It seemed so stupid, especially when you
don't know what to do with the garbage.

100
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Oh, so it was recently
when you tried this?

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh, well, it was kind of recently,
but not... real recently.

102
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,840
I am just not up to
havin' a guest in the house.

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,760
I gotta go. I gotta go to the office.
I gotta get back to the office.

104
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,080
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.

105
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,080
I already skipped one meeting.
I gotta get back.

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,480
Look, John, if you wanna leave, leave.

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,560
My life doesn't revolve around these
little get-togethers. Don't flatter yourself.

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
Don't feel like you gotta treat me with
kid gloves. Tell me how you really feel.

109
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,920
Listen, I got a friend comin' into town,
an old friend I haven't seen in years.

110
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,400
From what I can tell,
I think he's a little lost.

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,280
I think I may have
to spend a little time with him.

112
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Mm-hm.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for a while?

113
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
I wish you'd quit
that bartending job of yours.

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
Why?

116
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,920
I hate the thought
of all those guys hittin' on you.

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,280
<i>I can handle it.</i>

118
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,080
I'm sure.

119
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
Besides, the money is good,
and some of the guys are cute.

120
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
And you are in no position to be jealous.

121
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Who said I was jealous?

122
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,480
I did.

123
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,480
You know, I'd like to do it
at your house sometime.

124
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,920
I must admit, the idea of doin' it in my
sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,640
I wish I could just come right out
and tell everyone Ann's a lousy lay.

126
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,960
The beautiful, the popular
Ann Bishop Millaney.

127
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,080
- Could be risky.
- How about I just start a rumour, then?

128
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,640
- No, no, I mean doin' it at my house.
- Afraid of gettin' caught?

129
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
Yeah!

130
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,600
You should be.

131
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
- Can I meet this friend of yours?
- Who, Graham?

132
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,600
I gotta tell you, we were very close
many years ago, but I...

133
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,040
I think we're very different now.

134
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,760
- Yes?
- Ann? Uh, my name is Graham Dalton.

135
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,640
- Oh! Yeah, sure.
- May I use your bathroom?

136
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,960
Uh-huh. Come on in.

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,200
- Where is it?
- Oh, back there to the left. I'm sorry.

138
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,520
Do you like strawberries?
I brought you some.

139
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,600
Thank you. That's real sweet.

140
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,160
Hi. Um, John Millaney, please.
This is his wife.

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,800
That's all right. Thank you.

142
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,000
Well.

143
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,280
- That was quick.
- False alarm.

144
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,360
Have a seat.

145
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm sorry, we don't let people
smoke in the house.

146
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,520
- But if you'd like to, we could go outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. I...

147
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,720
I can wait. I'm...

148
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,400
- Do you have any other things?
- Yes.

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,960
Oh, you mean to bring in? No.
I do have some other things, but I don't...

150
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,480
This is all I need to stay here.

151
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,680
Have you ever been on television?

152
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,600
Television? No, no.

153
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,160
Why?

154
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
I was just curious.

155
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,560
Graham. That's an unusual name.

156
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh... I guess it is.

157
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,520
My mother is a complete Anglophile.

158
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,360
Anything British
makes her drool like a baby.

159
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,960
So she, you know, I think she heard
the name in a movie or something.

160
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,200
She's a prisoner of public television now.

161
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,160
How do you like being married?

162
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
I like it just fine.

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,120
What about it do you like? I...

164
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,600
- I don't mean to be critical. I'm curious.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK. Uh...

165
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,720
Well... you know the cliché
about the security of it?

166
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,800
Well, that's true.

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,400
And, um, we own this house.

168
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,360
It's a nice house. And...

169
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,120
John was just made junior partner,
and I really like that.

170
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,840
You know, I like the fact that he's just not,
you know, freelance or whatever.

171
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,600
Yes.

172
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,800
So, how long has it been
since you've seen John?

173
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,360
- Nine years.
- Nine years?

174
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah. I was surprised he invited me
to stay here until I found a place.

175
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,320
- Didn't you know him very well?
- Oh, no, I knew him very well.

176
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,040
John and I...

177
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
were very much alike.

178
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Really?

179
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,600
That's kinda hard to believe.
I mean, you just seem so different now.

180
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah. Well, I would imagine
we are pretty different now.

181
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,720
- I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
- OK.

182
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,920
Graham. I gotta tell you, I almost
called the cops when I saw you today.

183
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,840
I thought to myself
"This couldn't possibly be the same guy

184
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
that once held private services in
the back of the chapel on a weekly basis."

185
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,000
- You did that?
- Everybody has a past. That's mine, so...

186
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,240
So, what's with the get-up?

187
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,720
<i>- Somebody die, or...?
- John!</i>

188
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,360
- I'm sorry. Did...? I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

189
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
Nobody died.

190
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
- So...
- I mean...

191
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,840
what do you think the Greeks'd
think of this rather sombre attire?

192
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,120
I don't know.

193
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,400
- Dinner was very good.
- Yeah, it wasn't bad, honey.

194
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,160
Usually Ann achieves a kinda critical
mass with the salt, but, uh, tonight was...

195
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,080
I always tell her, you can always
add more, but you can't take it away.

196
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,760
Yeah, you say that, don't you?

197
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,200
- So, do you have family here?
- Mm.

198
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
Mother, father, my sister.

199
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,120
- Sister older or younger?
- Younger.

200
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,520
Are you close?

201
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,680
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm prying again. I'm sorry.

202
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,960
Were you prying before?

203
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,360
I was grilling Ann about your marriage.

204
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,680
- How'd it go?
- Well, I... Very well. Uh...

205
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,760
So, I was asking about your sister.

206
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Yeah. Well...

207
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,040
We get along all right, it's just that, uh...

208
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,920
Well, I think she's an extrovert.

209
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,600
I just think she's loud.
She probably wouldn't agree.

210
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,600
No, I mean, definitely wouldn't agree.

211
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,120
So, listen, are you gonna
see Elizabeth while you're here?

212
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,880
Uh... I don't know.

213
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,400
- Who's Elizabeth?
- A girl Graham dated in school.

214
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,960
Well after the chapel episodes.

215
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,240
She still lives here,
to the best of my knowledge.

216
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
So Graham and I
were talking about apartments,

217
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,160
and I told him that they've got lovely
little apartments in the Garden District.

218
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,120
- And they got nice garage apartments...
- There's critical crime in that district.

219
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
- Oh, John, come on, that is not true.
- No. There are...

220
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,480
I don't know what kind of place you're
lookin' for. There's plenty of apartments...

221
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,320
...in any one place.
- I'm sorry?

222
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,960
No, I just... Right now I have one key,
you know, everything I own is in the car.

223
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,120
I like that.
If I get an apartment, that's two keys.

224
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,120
If I get a job, you know, I might have
to open or close. That's more keys.

225
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,360
I buy some stuff, I'm afraid it's gonna
get ripped off, and I get more keys.

226
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,000
- I just like having the one key. It's clean.
- You don't have to worry about losin' 'em.

227
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,240
Get rid of the car when you get
the apartment. Still one key.

228
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,320
I like having the car. You know?
The car's important. You gotta be mobile.

229
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,240
In case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry?

230
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,960
Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry.

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Excuse me.

232
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,240
- Do you want some help?
- No, no, really, I'm fine.

233
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,640
There's not that much to do.

234
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,800
Graham, do you pay taxes?

235
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,960
Yeah, I pay taxes.
Yeah, I pay taxes. What do you mean?

236
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,360
You don't pay taxes, you're a liar.
I'm not a liar.

237
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,680
Liars are the second-lowest form
of human being on the planet.

238
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,320
<i>- What's the first?
- Lawyers.</i>

239
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,880
Oh. That's you, honey.

240
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,920
Annie, why don't you go with Graham
to hunt for apartments?

241
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
Show him how the city's changed.

242
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,560
- Would you mind, Graham?
- No, I'd love that.

243
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,400
- I'd like that, too. Let's do that.
- All right. How about tomorrow?

244
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
- That'd be great.
- Good.

245
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,640
One key, huh?

246
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
<i>Great idea.</i>

247
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
<i>- Yeah.
- Cynthia, John.</i>

248
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,040
<i>Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.</i>

249
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,440
You are scum.

250
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,520
I'll be there.

251
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,040
As you can see,
there's plenty of room for two.

252
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,800
No, it'll just be me.

253
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,360
- Are you a student?
- No.

254
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,240
You can hang
a shower curtain in the bath.

255
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,160
Make sure you put somethin'
in the tub so you won't fall.

256
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,120
You said about 350?

257
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah. And, uh, plus
the first and the last months' rent.

258
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,120
- All right. Will you lease month to month?
- Not for 350.

259
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,720
How about 400?

260
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,520
I could live with that.
I could live with that.

261
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,360
- OK. It's a deal.
- All right.

262
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,440
- Ready?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,720
- John?
- In here.

264
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,920
Well, ain't you a picture?

265
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,680
Well, do you like it?

266
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,920
It's lovely. Is it for me?

267
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,480
Yeah, it's for you.

268
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,120
Is that for me?

269
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,360
Yeah, that's for you.

270
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,000
You're amazing, dear.

271
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>Can I tell you something personal?</i>

272
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,200
<i>It's up to you.
Can I tell you something personal?</i>

273
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,240
Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,440
Well, you gotta go first.

275
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,320
OK.

276
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,840
I think that, um...

277
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,360
I think that sex is overrated.

278
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,800
I think that people place
far too much importance on it.

279
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,880
And I think that stuff about women
wantin' it just as bad as men is crap.

280
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,160
I think they want it, I just don't think they
want it for the reason men think they do.

281
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm getting confused.

282
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,680
- Do you understand what I'm...?
- Yeah.

283
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah, I remember reading somewhere

285
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,960
that men learn to love
the person that they're attracted to,

286
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,200
and that women become more and more
attracted to the person that they love.

287
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,160
God, that's... that's beautiful.

288
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,680
That's really beautiful. I like that.

289
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,800
Oh, I'm just quoting.

290
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,640
So, are you gonna
tell me something personal?

291
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,480
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

292
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,440
I don't want it to be
something gross, about some scar.

293
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,840
I want it to be something
really personal, about yourself.

294
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,000
All right. OK.

295
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,160
- I'm impotent.
- You're what?

296
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,520
<i>- Impotent.
- You are?</i>

297
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah. I mean, like, well, I can't...

298
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,200
I can't get an erection...
in the presence of another person.

299
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,360
So, for all practical purposes,
I'm impotent.

300
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,160
Does that bother you?

301
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,320
No.

302
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,600
Does it make you feel self-conscious?

303
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,400
Not usually.

304
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,640
No. Uh...

305
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,880
Yeah, I'm self-conscious.

306
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,320
Not in the same way
that you are, though.

307
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,040
- Me? Me? You think I'm self-conscious?
- Well...

308
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,000
I been watching you. I watch you eat,
you know, I watch you speak,

309
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,520
watch you move, and I see somebody

310
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,080
who is extremely aware
of people looking at you.

311
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,120
- My therapist...
- You're in therapy?

312
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,240
Aren't you?

313
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,360
No. I... No, I'm not.

314
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,080
I was a miserable failure in therapy.

315
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,760
- So you don't believe in therapy?
- No, I believe in it for some people.

316
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,600
I don't know, it was,
you know, silly for me.

317
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,560
I was confused going in.

318
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,560
So I just formed my own theory

319
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,400
that you should never take advice

320
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
from someone
that doesn't know you intimately.

321
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,920
Well, I know my therapist intimately.

322
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,800
- You've had sex with your therapist?
- No!

323
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,920
- No. No.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's what I meant.

324
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,720
Somebody you've had sex with.

325
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh.

326
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm... I don't understand.

327
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
I mean, how would you know?

328
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,520
- I mean, you know. How...?
- Oh, no. I wasn't always impotent.

329
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,640
Oh. Oh, OK.

330
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,800
So, let me see. You said, um...

331
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,760
you said that I should never take advice

332
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,360
from someone that
I haven't had sex with, right?

333
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,400
- Basically.
- Right.

334
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,040
And, uh, we haven't had sex.

335
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,000
- Right?
- No.

336
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,280
So I guess from your own advice,
I shouldn't take your advice.

337
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,560
- I wouldn't.
- You wouldn't? OK.

338
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,200
<i>All right.</i>

339
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,320
- Drive safely.
- Yeah, right.

340
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,360
<i>- How was your weekend?
- It was OK.</i>

341
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,680
- Did you confront John about the visitor?
- The visitor?

342
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,840
The friend of John's
that was staying at your house.

343
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,320
- Graham.
- Graham.

344
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,720
Yeah. I mean... no.

345
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,800
That actually
turned out to be interesting.

346
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,720
You know, I was expecting him
to be just like John.

347
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,280
You know, cos they went
to school together and everything.

348
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,880
You know, talking about getting drunk
together and secret handshakes and...

349
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,840
He turned out to be
really this... character.

350
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,800
He's kind of arty.

351
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
But OK.

352
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,400
Is he still at your house?

353
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,760
No. No. No. He's gone.

354
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,320
So where's he from?

355
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,760
I don't know. He, uh, used to live
in New York and Philadelphia.

356
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,800
I think he just kinda travels around.

357
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,680
Must be nice.
So, what's he like? Is he like John?

358
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,320
No. I don't think John likes him any more.

359
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,520
Says he thinks he's gotten kinda strange.

360
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,680
Is he? Strange, I mean?

361
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,760
No. I mean, if I saw him
on the street I might think so,

362
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,120
but after talkin' to him,
I'd just say he's kinda unusual.

363
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,800
Mm-hm. So, what's he look like?

364
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,840
Why?

365
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,120
- I just wanna know, is all.
- Why, so you can go after him?

366
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,320
Jesus, Ann, get a life.
I just asked what he looked like.

367
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,280
Besides, even if I decide
to fuck his brains out,

368
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,680
what business is that of yours?

369
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,200
- Why do you have to say that?
- Say what?

370
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,800
You know what.
You say it just to irritate me.

371
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,480
I say it because it's descriptive.

372
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,240
He doesn't strike me as a person
who would go in for that kinda thing.

373
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,800
- Ann, you always underestimate me.
- I wonder why.

374
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,440
I think you're afraid to put us in the same
room. You're afraid he'd be drawn to me.

375
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,720
Really, Cynthia,
I don't think he's your type.

376
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,000
My type?
How would you know what my type is?

377
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,600
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

378
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,440
Ann, you don't have a clue.

379
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,960
Look, I don't even know
why we're discussin' this.

380
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,160
I mean, I'll just go over
and call him myself.

381
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,760
He doesn't have a phone.

382
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,360
Well, I'll call him when he does.

383
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
He won't.

384
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
What are you talkin' about?

385
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,920
He doesn't like to talk on the phone.
He's not getting a phone.

386
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, please.

387
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,840
OK, so give me the Zen master's address.
I'll think of a reason to stop by.

388
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,240
Please, just let me talk to him first.

389
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,560
Why? Just gimme the address.
You won't even have to be involved.

390
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,520
I don't feel right just giving you the
address so you can go over there and...

391
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,840
- And what?
- Do whatever it is you do.

392
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,800
"Do whatever it is you do"?
Listen to the way you talk.

393
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,160
- I talk fine.
- Thank you, I was still smoking that.

394
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,120
What'd you lose?

395
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,240
That goddamn pearl earring.

396
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,160
It cost me a fucking fortune.

397
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,400
I must've left it somewhere.

398
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So, what are you
gettin' Momma for her birthday?

399
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,560
I don't know.
I'll get her a card or somethin'.

400
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,880
- A card for her 50th birthday?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

401
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,680
Well, the woman gave birth to you.
I think you might be givin' her...

402
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Will you stop? Jesus.

403
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,360
- I just thought that, you know, maybe...
- OK, Ann. OK.

404
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,160
How about this?

405
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,640
You get her something nice,
and I'll pay for half.

406
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,360
- All right?
- Fine. Fine.

407
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,160
Fine. OK. Now, if you'll pardon me,
I have to go to work.

408
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,840
<i>What is the most unusual
location you've ever masturbated in?</i>

409
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,120
<i>Well...</i>

410
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,840
<i>I, um...</i>

411
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,880
<i>One time I was flying from
Los Angeles to, um, to New York.</i>

412
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,320
<i>And I was... You know,
it was a really crowded flight and I was...</i>

413
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,280
<i>I was sitting in the middle.
I didn't get a window, I didn't get an aisle.</i>

414
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,640
<i>It was really funny,
and I was... I was just bored.</i>

415
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,000
<i>My magazines were just boring.
I think I had, like, a woman's magazine.</i>

416
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,760
<i>And they touch on a lot of sexual issues
and stuff. And I was thinking to myself</i>

417
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,920
<i>"God, that's what I need. I need a little...
something to take my mind off this trip. "</i>

418
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,880
<i>So, I was just, you know,
just thinking away, and then I just...</i>

419
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,480
<i>I just did it on the plane.
Just between these two people.</i>

420
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,680
<i>Nobody knew.</i>

421
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,520
<i>How were you able
to not betray what was going on</i>

422
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,800
<i>to the people around you?</i>

423
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,520
<i>Well, you know,
I have really strong muscles.</i>

424
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,640
It's open!

425
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,120
- Hi!
- Hello, Ann.

426
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,680
- I hope I'm not botherin' you.
- No, no.

427
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,520
- I would've phoned. You busy?
- No, no. I can finish later.

428
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,440
I just wanted to see what
the apartment looked like with furniture.

429
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,680
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
there's not much to see.

430
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,680
I'm sort of cultivating
this minimalist vibe.

431
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,480
- You could use a bookshelf.
- Yeah? Yeah, you think so?

432
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,280
They're... you know,
they're all library books.

433
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,000
- What are these?
- Uh, those are videotapes.

434
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,960
I can see that. Of what?

435
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
It's a personal project
I've been workin' on.

436
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,920
What kind of personal project?

437
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,400
- What?
- What kind of personal project?

438
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,680
Uh, a personal project
like anyone else's personal project.

439
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,360
Mine's just a little more...
personal, I guess.

440
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,360
Who's Donna?

441
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,840
- What?
- Donna. It says "Donna" here on the tape.

442
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,720
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.

443
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,160
Oh, you went out with her?

444
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,440
No, not really.

445
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,280
Why do these tapes
all have women's names on 'em?

446
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,840
Well, I enjoy interviewing
women more than men.

447
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,400
- It's iced tea.
- Thanks.

448
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,280
- I'm sorry, do you want some lemon?
- No, this is perfect.

449
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,080
So, all of these are... are interviews, huh?

450
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,760
- Uh, yes.
- Can we watch one?

451
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,880
No, I'd... No.

452
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,960
Why not?

453
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,640
Well, I promised each of the subjects

454
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,280
that no one would
see the videotapes except for me.

455
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,240
What are the interviews about?

456
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,360
The interviews are about sex.

457
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
Sex?

458
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,040
What about sex?

459
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,040
Uh, everything about sex.

460
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,960
Like what?

461
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,040
What they've done, what they do,

462
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,720
what they want to do but are afraid to ask
for, what they wouldn't do even if asked.

463
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,480
Anything I can think of. Oh, your ice.

464
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,920
- You just ask them questions?
- Yes.

465
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,080
And they answer 'em?

466
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
Yeah. Uh...

467
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,120
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

468
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,200
- To you?
- No, uh... for the camera.

469
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,360
- Graham, this is just so...
- I'm sorry this came up.

470
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,760
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry this came up, and...

471
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,440
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- Here, I'll take it.

472
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,440
- OK. Yeah. All right.
- Bye.

473
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,680
He doesn't want you to come over.

474
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,280
<i>What do you mean?
Did you tell him about me?</i>

475
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
<i>- No, I didn't.
- Why not?</i>

476
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,120
<i>- Look, Cynthia, I didn't have time.
- Well, why?</i>

477
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,560
John's right. He's strange and you
don't wanna get involved with him.

478
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,480
<i>What happened over there?</i>

479
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,720
<i>- Did he make a pass at you?
- No.</i>

480
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,000
<i>Well, what's this "strange" bullshit
all of a sudden? Is he drownin' puppies?</i>

481
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,280
It's nothin' like that, OK?

482
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,760
<i>- Well, what? Is he dangerous?
- No. Not physically.</i>

483
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,520
<i>- Well, what, then?
- I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

484
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,920
<i>- Then why did you call me?
- I don't know.</i>

485
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,240
<i>- Hello?
- Cynthia, John.</i>

486
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,560
Not today. I've got other plans.

487
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,000
<i>Oh. Well, when, then?</i>

488
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,760
How about inviting me over to dinner?

489
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,280
<i>- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.</i>

490
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,520
It's open.

491
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,000
- Hi.
- Hello.

492
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,080
- Can I help you?
- I'm Cynthia Bishop.

493
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,720
- Do I know you? I don't...
- I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

494
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,080
The extrovert.

495
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,600
She must have been in a good mood.
She usually calls me loud.

496
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,160
Yeah, she called you that, too.

497
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,640
So, uh, what are you doin' here?

498
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,760
- You want me to leave?
- No, I just wanna know why you're here.

499
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,720
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister.
Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.

500
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,160
No, I think it's probably better
if I don't characterise that conversation

501
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,320
that I didn't hear.

502
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:44,040
I don't have any idea, really, what you
or Ann said about me or anything else.

503
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,720
- Do you want some iced tea?
- Sure.

504
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,440
I don't have any lemons.

505
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:59,120
The last time I saw Ann she left here
very confused, I'd say, and upset.

506
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,040
She still is.

507
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,400
So, are you here to make me feel bad
for makin' her feel bad?

508
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,000
No.

509
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,400
- She didn't tell you why she was upset?
- No.

510
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,760
Thanks.

511
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,200
So, I don't understand
what made you wanna come here.

512
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,920
I can't imagine Ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me.

513
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,360
Yeah, well, see, um, I don't really
listen to Ann when it comes to men.

514
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,440
I mean, look at John, for Christ's sake.

515
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,200
But then, you went to school
with him, didn't you?

516
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,600
You're probably friends or somethin'.

517
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,280
No.

518
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,680
No, I think John is a liar.

519
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,000
I think you're right.

520
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,560
So come on, I came all the way over here
to find out what got Ann so spooked.

521
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
Why don't you tell me what happened?

522
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,680
"Spooked"? The videotapes
are what got Ann so spooked.

523
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,920
Oh.

524
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,520
I think I get it.

525
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,160
Oh, yeah? What do you get?

526
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,720
If Ann got freaked out by these,
they must be somethin' sexual.

527
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,520
Are these tapes of you
havin' sex with these girls?

528
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,960
- No, not exactly.
- Either you are or you aren't. Which is it?

529
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,040
- Why don't you let me tape you?
- Doin' what?

530
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
- Talking.
- About what?

531
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,200
About sex. Your sexual history,
sexual preferences.

532
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,320
- What makes you think I'd discuss that?
- Nothing.

533
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,360
- And you just wanna ask me questions?
- I just wanna ask you questions.

534
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,440
- That's all?
- That's all.

535
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,440
Is this how you get off? Tapin' women
talkin' about their sexual experiences?

536
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,440
- Yes.
- Would anyone else see the tape?

537
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Absolutely not. Nobody else
sees the tapes except for me.

538
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,280
How long will it take?

539
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,240
Well, that depends on you.
One woman used up only three minutes.

540
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,520
And another used three two-hour tapes.

541
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,520
How do we start?

542
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,600
I turn on the camera and you start talking.

543
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Do I sit or stand?

544
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,720
- What do you prefer?
- I'd prefer to sit.

545
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,440
Are you ready?

546
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,360
OK, I'm recording.

547
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,880
- So tell me your name.
- Cynthia... Patrice... Bishop.

548
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,600
- You can speak in a normal voice.
- OK.

549
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,480
So, describe for me
your first sexual experience.

550
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,160
Um...

551
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,120
First sexual experience
or first time I had intercourse?

552
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,760
<i>- First sexual experience.
- Sexual experience.</i>

553
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,200
I was... uh... eight.

554
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,720
And, uh...
Is this the kinda thing that...? Yeah, OK.

555
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,240
I was eight years old, and, um,
Michael Green, who was also eight,

556
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,640
asked if he could watch me take a pee.

557
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,720
And I said he could
if I could watch him take one, too.

558
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,440
So we went to the woods
behind my house.

559
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,680
And I got this feeling he was chickenin'
out cos he kept sayin' "Ladies first!"

560
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,880
So I pulled down
my little panties and urinated,

561
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,960
and he ran away before I even finished.

562
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,600
Was it a topic of conversation
between you after that?

563
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,680
No! He kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer,

564
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,360
and then his family moved away.

565
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,160
To Cleveland, actually.

566
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,240
What a shame.

567
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,560
When did you finally see a penis?

568
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,760
When I was 14.

569
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,680
So, what'd you think?

570
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,160
Was it what you expected it to be?

571
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,960
No. Not really. I...

572
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,320
I didn't... I sorta pictured it, um...

573
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,680
I didn't think it would have
veins or ridges or anything.

574
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,040
I just thought it would be smooth,
like a test tube.

575
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,200
It's weird, thinking about it now.

576
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:52,080
The... organ itself seemed like
a separate thing, a separate entity to me.

577
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,920
I mean, when he finally pulled it out
and I could look at it and touch it,

578
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,560
I forgot that there was a guy attached to it.

579
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,400
I remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me.

580
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,560
- What did he say?
- He said my hand felt good.

581
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,440
Then what happened?

582
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,440
And...

583
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,720
Then I started movin' my hand,
and then he stopped talkin'.

584
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
<i>- Yeah?
- John, Cynthia.</i>

585
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,600
<i>- How'd you get through?
- I told Janet I was Ann.</i>

586
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
Ah. She bought it?

587
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,120
<i>Well, obviously.</i>

588
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,320
<i>Look... I want to see you.</i>

589
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,480
<i>- Ah. When?
- Right now.</i>

590
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,080
I don't know if I can do that.
I got a client waiting.

591
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,640
I've already rescheduled him once.
I'd have to do some heavy- duty juggling.

592
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,840
<i>Then get those balls in the air
and get your butt over here.</i>

593
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,120
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Janet.</i>

594
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,240
Listen, I want you to reschedule Kirkland.
I know, I know.

595
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,200
See if he can come in Monday, any time.

596
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,760
Tell him, uh... Tell him, uh...

597
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,680
<i>- Family crisis. Family crisis.
- OK.</i>

598
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,760
<i>- I'll slip out the back.
- Yes, sir.</i>

599
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,840
All right. Bye.

600
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,440
<i>Would you like me to take my skirt off?</i>

601
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,680
<i>If you wish.</i>

602
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,680
<i>You're not wearing any underwear.</i>

603
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,880
<i>Do you like the way I look?</i>

604
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,000
<i>Yes.</i>

605
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,400
<i>Do you think I'm pretty?</i>

606
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,800
<i>Yes.</i>

607
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,040
<i>Prettier than Ann?</i>

608
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,120
<i>Different.</i>

609
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,800
<i>John and Ann don't have sex any more.</i>

610
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,440
<i>Is that what he tells you?</i>

611
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,840
<i>He doesn't have to tell me.</i>

612
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,400
You're on fire today.

613
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,560
Yes.

614
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,640
You can go now.

615
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,400
What kind of questions?

616
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,200
<i>Questions... about... sex.</i>

617
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,400
Well, what did he ask, exactly?

618
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,680
<i>Well, I don't wanna tell you, exactly.</i>

619
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,440
You let a total stranger record your sexual
life, but you won't tell your own sister?

620
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,800
<i>- Apparently.
- Did he ask you to take your clothes off?</i>

621
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,560
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
No, he didn't.

622
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,640
<i>- Did you take your clothes off?
- Yes.</i>

623
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,040
<i>- Cynthia!
- What?</i>

624
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,200
<i>- Why did you do that?
- Because I wanted to.</i>

625
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,360
<i>- But why did you want to?
- Because I wanted him to see me.</i>

626
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,800
You're crazy. He could be
bouncin' it off some satellite.

627
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,520
<i>- Some horny old men could be watchin'.
- Ann! He wouldn't do that.</i>

628
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,640
<i>- You don't know that for sure.
- Well, it's too late now, isn't it?</i>

629
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,000
<i>- Did he touch you?
- No.</i>

630
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,240
<i>- Did you touch him?
- No.</i>

631
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,280
<i>Did anybody touch anybody?</i>

632
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,840
Well, yes.

633
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,360
Don't tell me.

634
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,920
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. You didn't.

635
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,160
<i>- I did.
- You didn't.</i>

636
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,840
- I did!
- Oh, my God. Cynthia!

637
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,160
You're in trouble.

638
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,520
Listen to you. You sound like Momma.
What are you talkin' about?

639
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,920
God, Cynthia.

640
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,680
<i>- I couldn't do that in front of John.
- You couldn't do it, period.</i>

641
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,160
<i>- I mean, you don't even know him.
- I feel like I do.</i>

642
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,840
You don't.
You can't trust him. He's perverted.

643
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,960
I don't understand why
this freaks you out so much.

644
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,880
You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't
bother me, why should it bother you?

645
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,400
<i>- I don't wanna talk about it.
- OK, then, don't.</i>

646
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,440
Are... are you an assassin?

647
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,760
- Excuse me?
- You're just an errand boy,

648
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,640
sent by the grocer to collect the bill.

649
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,400
It's my Brando. That's pretty good,
isn't it? Marlon Brando.

650
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,840
It's great. Pardon me.

651
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,720
OK. I was thinkin' we needed time apart.
Maybe you should be there for a while.

652
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,920
Hi. So, why don't you get
an answering machine?

653
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,800
- There's a phone here.
- It's busy.

654
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,720
Well, why don't you keep tryin'?

655
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,880
OK.

656
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,640
- Well, here it is.
- What is it?

657
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,800
- It's a sundress.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

658
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,000
- It does not.
- Why would she want a sundress?

659
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,840
She's got spots on her shoulders
and varicose veins.

660
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,520
- Well, missy thing, so will you someday.
- When I do, I won't wear sundresses.

661
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,320
- God, Cynthia...
- Hold on.

662
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,760
<i>- Bayou.
- Cynthia, John.</i>

663
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,560
<i>- Would you like to speak with your wife?
- What's she doin' there?</i>

664
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,960
Showing me a present
she and I are buying your mother- in-law.

665
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,440
<i>Oh. Great. So, when can I see you?</i>

666
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,960
I don't know. I'm not sure I can
duplicate the intensity I had the other day.

667
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,320
<i>Nothin' wrong with trying.</i>

668
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,920
I don't think my sister would agree.

669
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,040
<i>Do you want me to stop calling?</i>

670
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,640
<i>- Look, I'll call you. OK?
- Roger.</i>

671
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,240
This is too much. I'm wearing red, you're
wearing red. That's quite a coincidence...

672
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,080
- Look, I'm married.
- Really?

673
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,160
Are you very married?

674
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,960
- Married enough.
- Oh. Oh.

675
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,920
- I see. Well, that shouldn't stop us...
- I'm just here to see my sister. OK?

676
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,320
Oh, really?
Who's your sister? Is she married?

677
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,600
So, um, what's my share of the dress?

678
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,280
- 32.50.
- It's a nice dress.

679
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,120
- Thanks. I thought so, too.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

680
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,680
Keep the change. And, Ann, don't worry
about the dress. I'm sure she'll like it.

681
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,880
Yeah. I think it'll...
Oh, you have to go? OK. Goodbye.

682
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,360
I'll see you later. I'll call you!

683
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,560
Bye.

684
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,800
John?

685
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,360
Mm?

686
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,280
John?

687
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,640
I called you last Monday at 3.30
and they said you weren't in.

688
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,440
Do you remember where you were?

689
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,120
On Monday?

690
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,760
<i>Uh... Last Monday?</i>

691
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,840
<i>Oh, I had a late lunch.</i>

692
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,280
<i>So, who'd you have lunch with?</i>

693
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,680
I ate by myself.

694
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,240
Come on.

695
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,160
- Is there somethin' wrong?
- Are you havin' an affair?

696
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,760
Jesus Christ!

697
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,280
I have a late lunch by myself
and now I'm fuckin' somebody?

698
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,680
- Well, are you?
- No, I'm not.

699
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,840
God, I'm offended
at the accusation. Come on.

700
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,720
If I'm right, I wanna know.

701
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,880
I don't want you to lie. I'd be upset,
but I'd be more upset if you lied to me.

702
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,560
Well, there's nothin' to know.

703
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,560
I can't tell you
how upset I'll be if you lie to me.

704
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,920
This is paranoia.

705
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,920
I mean... if anybody
should be paranoid, I should be.

706
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,160
Here, every time I try to touch you,
you act as if I'm dipped in shit.

707
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,360
I think there are a lot of women
out there that'd be glad to have

708
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,920
a young, straight male
makin' a pretty good living

709
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,200
beside 'em in bed with a... with a hard-on.

710
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,680
- My sister, for one.
- For God's sake, Ann.

711
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,200
- Is that who it is?
- Ann, I'm not fucking your sister.

712
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,360
I don't find her that attractive,
for one thing.

713
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,400
- Is that supposed to comfort me?
- No, I'm just saying.

714
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,320
I'm just saying I didn't get paranoid
when you didn't wanna make love to me.

715
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,800
I could have assumed that you didn't want
to because you were having an affair.

716
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,840
- I'm not.
- Well, I'm not either. Now, come on.

717
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,080
- Then why don't I believe you?
- Oh, look. This is ridiculous.

718
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,000
- Maybe when you have evidence...
- There's evidence?

719
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,680
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just
saying that we shouldn't not ever talk,

720
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,560
just don't give me
conjecture and intuition.

721
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
- Always a lawyer.
- Goddamn right.

722
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,200
I mean, can you imagine? "Your Honour,
I'm positive the man is guilty."

723
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,880
- "I can't place him at the scene..."
- All right.

724
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,720
- "But I have this strong feeling..."
- All right. You made your point. OK.

725
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,800
All right.

726
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,360
I'm sorry.

727
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,080
I'm sorry.

728
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,320
I'm just under a lot of pressure
with this... this Kirkland thing.

729
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,920
I mean, you know
it's my first big case as junior partner.

730
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,480
I work all day and I come home.

731
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,080
I look forward to seeing you.

732
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,440
It hurts that you'd accuse me like that.

733
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,640
I'm sorry.

734
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,600
What? Come on.

735
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,160
I've just got all this time
on my hands, and I just sit around

736
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,520
and start inventing these,
like, intricate scenarios.

737
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,880
And then I don't want to have wasted
all my time, so I wanna believe 'em.

738
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,240
- Isn't therapy helpin' at all?
- Oh, John, I don't know.

739
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,680
I just feel so stupid sittin'
talkin' about my little problems

740
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,800
when I know
those poor children are starving.

741
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,920
Well...

742
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,040
Quitting your therapy's not gonna...
not gonna feed the children in Ethiopia.

743
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,240
I know.

744
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,680
You never used to say the word "fucking".

745
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,920
Fuck.

746
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,720
It's so stupid, I have a hard time
believing you did it.

747
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,360
- What's so stupid about it?
- Well, you...

748
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,520
- You don't even know the guy.
- Well, you know him.

749
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,520
He's a friend of yours.
Do you think he can be trusted?

750
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,040
I don't know.

751
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,920
I don't know.
From what you've told me, I don't know.

752
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,280
I shoulda known when
he showed up dressed like

753
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,360
some undertaker for the art world.

754
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,520
I like the way he dresses.

755
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,840
What if this tape
gets into the wrong hands?

756
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,000
"The wrong hands"? John, we are not
talking about military secrets here.

757
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:37,520
They're just tapes he makes
so he can sit around and get off.

758
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,480
And he doesn't have sex
with any of them? They just talk?

759
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,800
They just sit around and talk.

760
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,000
I could almost understand it
if he had sex with them. I mean, almost.

761
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,960
Why doesn't he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or somethin'?

762
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,600
Doesn't work. He has to know the people.
He has to be able to interact with them.

763
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,760
Interact?

764
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,880
Whatever that means.

765
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,440
Did you have to masturbate
in front of him?

766
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,200
I felt like it. Goddamn. You and Ann
make such a big deal out of this.

767
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,720
- You told Ann about this?
- She is my sister.

768
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,400
- I tell her almost everything.
- I wish you hadn't.

769
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,080
It's just something I'd prefer
she didn't have to know about.

770
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,680
- She's a grown-up. She can handle it.
- Ann...

771
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,840
- Ann is just very...
- Hung up.

772
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,760
- It just wasn't a smart thing to do.
- Oh, God!

773
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,160
Did you sign any sort of paper,
or did he have a contract with you

774
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,360
saying that he wouldn't
broadcast these things?

775
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,480
No, sir.

776
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,160
You realise you have no recourse legally?

777
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,880
It's not funny. It's not funny, Cynthia.

778
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,520
These tapes could show up anywhere.

779
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,000
They won't. I trust him.

780
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,840
You trust him? That's funny.

781
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,480
Yeah, I do.
A hell of a lot more than I trust you.

782
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,040
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

783
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,680
I'd trust him before I'd trust you.

784
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,880
- It hurts that you say that to me.
- You're fucking your wife's sister.

785
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,000
You're a liar. But at least I know that.

786
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,880
I know, I know. Second-lowest form
of human being. And the first.

787
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,160
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. You're lying to Ann, too.

788
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:39,040
Yeah, right, but I didn't take a vow in front
of God and everyone to be faithful to Ann.

789
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,560
Look, are we gonna do it or not?

790
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,960
Actually... no. I've changed my mind.
I shouldn't have called.

791
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:00,480
Well, I'm here now.
I need to do somethin'.

792
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,000
Would you like
to help me straighten up?

793
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,440
Jesus!

794
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,520
Is there one chair
in this place that works?

795
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,800
Well, why don't you
go sit somewhere else?

796
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,240
Come on, John. You should be happy.

797
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,160
We've gone this far without Ann findin'
out. I'm makin' it real easy on you.

798
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,960
- Just walk out of here.
- Did he put you up to this?

799
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,040
- Who?
- Graham.

800
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,200
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus,
I don't need people to tell me what to do.

801
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,640
I've just been thinkin', that's all.
Now just... leave.

802
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,880
Maybe I don't wanna leave.

803
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,320
Maybe I wanna talk.

804
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,720
John, we don't have
anything to talk about.

805
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,080
Yeah, you're right.

806
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,680
Things are gettin' complicated.

807
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,080
No, they're gettin' real simple.

808
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,640
It's open!

809
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,560
Hello.

810
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,040
Want something to drink?

811
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,280
Yeah, thanks.

812
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,120
I'm sorry, I don't have any iced tea left.

813
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,080
Thank you.

814
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,680
John and Cynthia have been... fucking.

815
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,200
Yes, I know.

816
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,600
- You know?
- Yes.

817
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,080
How did you know?

818
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,280
She said it on her tape.

819
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,320
Thanks for telling me.
I really appreciate it.

820
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,560
Well, I... I haven't seen you.

821
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,600
And I don't think I would've told you
even if I had seen you.

822
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,680
Why not?

823
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,560
Because it's not really my place.

824
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,840
My life is shit.

825
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,280
It's just shit.

826
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,680
Nothing's what I thought it was.

827
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,200
John's a bastard.

828
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,360
Let's make a videotape.

829
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,440
No, I...

830
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,920
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

831
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,800
Because I don't think it's a choice that
you'd make in a normal frame of mind.

832
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,760
And what would you know
about a normal frame of mind?

833
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,760
That's a good question.

834
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,800
- So, what do you have to do to get ready?
- Uh...

835
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,360
Load a tape and turn on the camera.

836
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,720
Do it.

837
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,360
So, where do you get your money from,

838
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,680
for rent, and tapes, and stuff like that?

839
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,440
Underneath my mattress.

840
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,880
And what are you gonna do
when this money runs out?

841
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,960
It won't.

842
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,720
Are you comfortable there?

843
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,000
Yeah, I'm comfortable.

844
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,800
OK, I'm recording.

845
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,880
Tell me your name.

846
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,480
Ann Bishop Millaney.

847
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,720
Margaret. Hi, it's John. Fine.
Listen, have you seen Ann at all today?

848
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,760
This afternoon?

849
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,680
Uh... Well, no, I just...

850
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,280
She's home. Bye-bye.
Everything's fine. Thanks. Bye.

851
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,120
Thank God. You had me worried sick.

852
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,720
I come home,
the door is open, the car is gone.

853
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,920
I thought you'd been
abducted by some mad fucker.

854
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,280
- Are you all right?
- I want out of this marriage.

855
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,520
What?

856
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,080
I... want... out... of this marriage.

857
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,640
Why?

858
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,880
Why?

859
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,320
You're asking me why?

860
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,840
I'm married to you
and you want out of this marriage.

861
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,920
I think you could tell me that.

862
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,000
Fuck you. Fuck you.

863
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,120
All right.

864
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,560
- Can you tell me where you went?
- I drove around.

865
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,240
- Then I went over to Graham's.
- Graham's?

866
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,600
Graham.

867
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,120
Goddamn that son of a bitch!

868
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,280
The backstabbin' son of a...
Oh, Mr Honesty, huh?

869
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,360
Mr Apostle of Truth!

870
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,720
Well, I know you didn't fuck him.

871
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,760
Did you make one of
these goddamn videotapes?

872
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,280
Annie... answer me, goddammit.

873
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,760
Goddammit, answer me. Did you?

874
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,040
- Yes, I did.
- Ah!

875
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,480
God!

876
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,280
Don't you touch him!

877
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,560
OK. I'm gonna...

878
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,160
What?

879
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,600
Hello?

880
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,200
John? What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing?

881
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,560
<i>OK, I'm recording.</i>

882
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,680
<i>Tell me your name.</i>

883
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,560
<i>Ann... Bishop... Millaney.</i>

884
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,200
<i>So, what do you wanna talk about?</i>

885
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,520
<i>- What do you usually talk about?
- Sex.</i>

886
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,040
<i>OK. Let's talk about sex.</i>

887
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,720
<i>Do you have sex?</i>

888
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,240
<i>Not very often, no.</i>

889
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,760
<i>When you do, who usually initiates it?</i>

890
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,880
<i>He does.</i>

891
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,960
<i>Is the sex satisfying?</i>

892
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,080
<i>I don't know.</i>

893
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,640
<i>I don't know. I don't know what you mean.</i>

894
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,880
<i>Do you have orgasms?</i>

895
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,200
<i>I don't think so.</i>

896
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,560
<i>I mean, I guess, since I'm not sure,
that I've never had one.</i>

897
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,520
<i>Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?</i>

898
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,120
Here we go.

899
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,960
Here we go.

900
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,120
<i>- Why don't we stop?
- No.</i>

901
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,320
<i>I don't wanna stop.</i>

902
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,120
<i>Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?</i>

903
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,400
<i>I've thought about it.</i>

904
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,480
- Did you act on it?
- No.

905
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,280
Why not?

906
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:13,680
Because that's how Cynthia thinks.
I hate it when I have feelings that she has.

907
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:21,400
It bothers me when I think about men,
because I know that's the way she thinks.

908
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,440
What other men have you thought about?

909
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,520
I thought about you.

910
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,280
- Have you thought about me?
- Yes.

911
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
What did you think?

912
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,200
I thought about what you would
look like having an orgasm.

913
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,680
I'd like to know
what I look like havin' an orgasm.

914
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,040
Can you do that?
Give a woman an orgasm?

915
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,720
Yes.

916
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,840
Could you do that for me?

917
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,520
- No.
- Why not?

918
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,800
Because I can't.

919
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,920
- Can't or won't?
- I can't because I won't.

920
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:47,240
- You said you weren't always impotent.
- No. Yeah, that's correct.

921
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,520
- So you have had sex.
- Yes.

922
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,680
So, what happened?
Was it so bad it turned you off, or...?

923
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,960
- No, that wasn't the problem.
- What was the problem?

924
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,040
I was the problem. I was a...

925
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,880
I was a pathological liar.

926
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,800
Or I am, I should say.

927
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,280
The lying is...

928
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:24,720
Lying is like alcoholism,
you're continually recovering.

929
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,760
So that's it?

930
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,360
You lied?

931
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,440
- That was part of it.
- So, what else happened?

932
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,880
Well, at that time, uh... I...

933
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,080
I used to express my feelings nonverbally,

934
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,160
and often scared people

935
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,200
that were close to me.

936
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,720
Are you still like that?

937
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,520
No.

938
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,640
No.

939
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,920
So you're never gonna make love again?

940
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,280
I don't... I haven't made any plans, so...

941
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,400
- If you were in love with me, would you?
- I'm not in love with you.

942
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,040
- But if you were?
- I can't answer that.

943
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,840
- Why not?
- I told you.

944
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,920
- But I don't understand.
- Ann, forget about the sex, you know? I...

945
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,600
I'm not the same person that I was...
even remotely, you know.

946
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,280
I'm different in so many ways.

947
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:52,240
It'd have a profound effect on the way that
I relate to other people, communicate.

948
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:57,120
This, for instance. The way she and I are
talking, it could never have been possible.

949
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,680
"She"? "The way she...
she and I are talking"?

950
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,440
- "She"? Who's "she"?
- I'm sorry, I was...

951
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,520
- That isn't what I was...
- She's Elizabeth? Is that who it is?

952
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,800
Is that the girl that John
talked about? Is that who it is?

953
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:26,040
- I guess. I... I'm sorry.
- So, you're still in contact with her?

954
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,040
- With Elizabeth?
- No. I'm...

955
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,400
What do you think Elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes?

956
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,280
I can't imagine her
bein' too understanding.

957
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,520
But you're gonna tell her about them,
right, since you don't lie any more?

958
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:50,440
As I said, I don't know
what I'm gonna do, exactly.

959
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,960
I mean... perhaps I won't do anything.

960
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,760
So, you just came back here
so that you could think about it?

961
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,560
No, I moved back here for some...

962
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,320
A sense of closure, you know?

963
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,480
Resolution of some sort.

964
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:27,080
I wanted somebody who was very
important to me to understand that.

965
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,480
That's... That's pathetic.

966
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,920
I mean, you can't just...
Oh, my God, Graham.

967
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,200
You just can't walk up to her
and show her you've changed

968
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,720
like it's some gift or somethin'.

969
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,080
And look what you've changed into.

970
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,800
Nine years. Nine years.
And this is what you come up with.

971
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,720
Is this what you wanna be
the rest of your life?

972
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,960
Why are you doin' this?

973
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,360
Can you tell me that?
Why are you doin' this to yourself?

974
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,000
- Are you gonna answer me?
- Please, don't do that.

975
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,920
- Why not?
- Don't do that.

976
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,520
I wanna ask a few questions, like why
do you tape women talkin' about sex?

977
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,280
Why do you do that?
Can you tell me why?

978
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,720
Come on. I'm just gonna keep askin'.

979
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,520
I don't find turning the tables
very interesting.

980
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,560
Well, I do. Tell me why, Graham.

981
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,360
- Why?
- What?

982
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,280
What? What do you want me to tell you?
"Tell me why?" Why?

983
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,400
Ann, you don't even know who I am. You
don't have the slightest idea who I am.

984
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:56,280
Am I supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment

985
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,040
and just hope that it's coherent,
that it makes some sort of sense to you?

986
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,760
It doesn't make any sense to me.
You know, I was there.

987
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,880
I don't have the slightest idea who I am,

988
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,160
and I'm supposed
to be able to explain it to you?

989
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,360
And why? You tell me why.

990
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,240
Why do I have to explain myself to you?

991
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,760
Because maybe I can help you.

992
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,440
- Help me with what?
- Your problem.

993
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,280
My problem? Do I have a problem?

994
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,960
I look around me in this town and I see
John and Cynthia and you, and I...

995
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,960
I feel comparatively healthy.

996
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,480
You've got a problem.

997
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,400
You're right.

998
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,120
I've got a lot of problems.

999
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,080
But they belong to me.

1000
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,120
You think they're yours, but they're not.

1001
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:17,360
Everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem.

1002
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,640
Anybody that comes in contact with you.

1003
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,440
I didn't wanna be
part of your problem, but I am.

1004
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,680
I'm leavin' my husband,

1005
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,960
and maybe I would have anyway,
but the fact is that I'm doin' it now.

1006
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,960
And part of it's because of you.

1007
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,880
You've had an effect on my life.

1008
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,240
This isn't supposed to happen.

1009
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:03,360
I've spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didn't happen.

1010
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,120
You know, I never told you this,
cos I knew it'd crush you.

1011
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,560
But now...

1012
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,600
I fucked Elizabeth.

1013
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,720
Before you broke up.
Before you were havin' trouble, even.

1014
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,280
She's no saint.

1015
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,560
She was good in bed.

1016
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,600
She could keep a secret.

1017
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,920
That's about all I can say about her.

1018
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,400
<i>- I gotta make a call.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

1019
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,360
<i>- Kirkland's office.
- John Millaney for Brian Kirkland.</i>

1020
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,560
<i>- Just one moment, please.
- All right.</i>

1021
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,880
Anyway, as I've always said,
work is critical.

1022
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:35,000
I can be happy without a marriage, but if
you take away my work, that's different.

1023
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,040
And if Ann can't handle that...

1024
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,240
<i>- Well, that's her problem.
- Mr Millaney?</i>

1025
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,680
<i>- Yeah.
- Mr DeForest would like to see you.</i>

1026
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,080
All right. In a minute. I'm on with a client.

1027
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:53,160
<i>- He said immediately.
- All right. Jesus.</i>

1028
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,880
<i>- Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?</i>

1029
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,080
<i>Mr Kirkland asked me to inform you
he's obtained representation elsewhere,</i>

1030
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,400
<i>and that if you have a message
for Mr Kirkland to leave it with me.</i>

1031
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,480
Thank you. Um...

1032
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,120
<i>- No message.
- All right, Mr Millaney.</i>

1033
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,240
Thank you.

1034
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,920
Fool!

1035
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,400
Hope he knows what he's doin'.

1036
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,320
<i>- Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?</i>

1037
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:21,520
<i>- Mr DeForest is waiting.
- All right. Tell him I'll be in in a minute.</i>

1038
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,200
Jesus, the old man thinks that
the world revolves around a game of golf.

1039
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:29,600
I'll catch up to you at the courts.
I'd better go talk to DeForest.

1040
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,000
Sure.

1041
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,080
OK.

1042
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,800
Fuck.

1043
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,960
Oh, no, just one's fine, thanks.

1044
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,120
This is my favourite part.

1045
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,440
You know, I was thinking we should
name our first child Rusty.

1046
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,920
What do you think of that name?

1047
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:27,480
OK. You know, I spend a lot of money in
here. I should at least know your name.

1048
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

1049
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,960
I brought you this.
I knew it was your birthday.

1050
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:39,160
- Thanks.
- It's a nice plant. Looks like a tablecloth.

1051
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,720
Look, I can't stay. I gotta go.

1052
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:51,000
- Can I call you?
- Do you have my work number?

1053
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,240
No.

1054
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,200
Got a pen?

1055
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,640
OK, now, you're wearing blue,
I'm wearing blue.

1056
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,400
Is this some sort of weird coincidence?

1057
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,680
I don't think so.
I think it's something more.

1058
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,160
- Do you live here?
- No. I'm just passing through.

1059
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,560
Look, don't call between three and five,
cos I get real busy, OK?

1060
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,720
<i>- OK.
- OK.</i>

1061
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,440
See ya.

1062
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,560
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

1063
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,560
I like her.
She's a very nice girl. Very nice.

1064
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

1065
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,080
I think it's gonna rain.

1066
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,360
It is raining.

1067
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,960
Yeah.
