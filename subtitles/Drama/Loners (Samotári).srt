LONERS

5
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:20,206
When I was a kid I thought
cats were female dogs.

6
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:27,713
And I thought turtle-doves
were female pigeons.

7
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,969
And I thought
weasels were female badgers.

8
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,724
You're insane.

9
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:43,813
And I thought men and women
were two different species.

Directed by

21
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,510
- So you were in Bangkok?
- Yup. -Tell me about it.

22
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,807
- What do you want to know?
- I hear whores are in aquariums.

23
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:06,979
- Yup, and they're usually naked.
- How much do they go for?

24
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,817
A blow job is 500 Thai bahts.
That's the same in Czech crowns.

25
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:17,072
A fuck is 500 or 1000. Sometimes
you can get both for a grand.

26
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,826
- What about kissing?
- Kissing?

27
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:27,750
That's most expensive of all.
It'll run you at least 2500.

28
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,463
- You didn't know that?
- I guess I forgot.

29
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,928
Tell me about this girl.

30
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:43,140
The girl you're about to meet
is absolutely one of a kind.

31
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,812
She's modest, intelligent, but
mostly she's self-sacrificing.

32
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,150
- A pretty rare combination.
- Is she seeing anyone now?

33
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,571
Every girl's seeing someone
unless she's seeing you.

34
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,866
Or should I say, me.

35
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,996
You've had a girlfriend
for three years. I don't get...

36
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,583
- why you want to meet this girl.
- 'Cause our relationship's shaky.

37
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,837
This might be worth filming.

38
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,136
- It was a joke. -A stupid one.
- Okay if I film you arguing?

39
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:25,224
- We're not going to argue.
- Are you mental? -Hang on.

40
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,603
I thought you said
your relationship was shaky.

41
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:34,316
- I did not. -Think that's funny?
- You're really pushing it.

42
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,069
Wait a minute.

43
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:43,158
All I did was help you realize
you've come to a dead-end.

44
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,368
Thanks.

45
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,831
My consciously acting like
a swine has cleansed you.

46
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,084
I've pointed out
how ridiculous your lives are.

47
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,962
- Next time we need something...
- We'll definitely let you know.

48
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,936
You wanted to know if she was
the right girl for you.

49
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,522
That means I'm not.

50
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:18,485
- Then let's do something.
- Like what?

51
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:25,576
- All we can do is flip a coin.
- What are you talking about?

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,124
You heard me. Heads we stay
together, tails we break up.

53
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,590
Okay. I'll flip.

54
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,475
- You mean you'd actually do it?
- It was your idea.

55
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,520
Isn't it odd
for two grown people to decide

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,191
whether or not to break up
by flipping a coin?

57
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,486
Yeah, I guess it is.

58
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,040
Come on in.

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,009
Awesome pad.

60
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,974
Don't turn it off.

61
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,604
Awesome tune. What is it?

62
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,610
- The national anthem, bonehead.
- Oh, yeah.

63
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,949
I haven't heard the instrumental
version lately, so I forgot it.

64
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,287
- Is there something you want?
- Huh?

65
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,874
- You want something?
- Yeah, of course.

66
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,926
It's in my car.

67
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,226
Do you know they got monkeys
dealing drugs in Thailand?

68
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,728
- What kind of monkeys?
- Gibbons.

69
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,524
- How could they do that?
- Like anyone else.

70
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,903
They deliver packages and
collect money just like you do.

71
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,989
Hang on.

72
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,326
Are you implying I'm a monkey?

73
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:38,709
Let me tell you something, pal.
You're a total burn-out.

74
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,214
- You're thirty years old...
- I'm twenty-nine. -Who cares?

75
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:50,345
You're a loser. You quit school,
you work as a moving man...

76
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,642
You're constantly stoned, and
you hardly know your own name.

77
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,313
Hey, you're right. I am thirty.

78
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,532
Meanwhile you could be
the master of your own destiny.

79
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,369
You could play an active role
in the story of your life.

80
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:23,253
You keep smoking weed and
you'll be a basket case by 35.

81
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,091
Or you come to your senses,
and take hold of your destiny.

82
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:35,307
- There is some truth to that.
- It's entirely up to you.

83
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,561
What do you think I should do?

84
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,981
Cocaine.

85
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,071
- Holy shit!
- Promise you'll think about it.

86
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,283
I can do that.

87
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,079
What do I want you to do?

88
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,915
Think about it!

89
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:07,464
Okay. I'll think about it.

90
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,404
- Are you serious about me?
- You bet.

91
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,533
- Sure this isn't just about sex?
- Excuse me?

92
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,370
We just met.
I don't even know your sign.

93
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,544
- What is your sign?
- Does it matter?

94
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,339
- Would you be a Capricorn?
- Why?

95
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,968
They don't like saying
what sign they are.

96
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,889
- Then I'm a Capricorn.
- You are? That's good.

97
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:03,729
- What can I get you?
- A Rapid and...

98
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,944
A regular shot for 55
or a "body shot" for 155?

99
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,032
- A regular shot.
- Wait. What's a body shot?

100
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:24,291
You put salt behind your ear,
lemon... I'd have to show you.

101
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,628
Then show us.

102
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,173
I'd have to demonstrate...

103
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,926
- ...on her.
- Go ahead, then.

104
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,767
I'm no guinea pig.
Find someone else, okay?

105
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,888
Yuck! I'm all sticky!

106
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,478
- What time do you get off work?
- You two will be asleep by then.

107
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,522
That's my sister.

108
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,698
Dear friends,
back in prep school...

109
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,578
Back in high school...

110
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,250
Would you mind
if we had a few people over?

111
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,796
Of course not. Who?

112
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:58,260
- Travel agency clients.
- Czechs?

113
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:05,934
- No, more like Japanese.
- Japanese again!

114
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,147
They want to see how
a typical Czech family lives.

115
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,654
How do you envision this?
Will we have to wear costumes?

116
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,283
Will I have to act like a fool
or dress up as a plumber?

117
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,162
Why would you have to dress up
as a plumber?

118
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,122
I don't know.

119
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,960
- Did I say, "as a plumber?"
- Yes, you did.

120
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,757
That was just one way
I could make a fool of myself.

121
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,552
You won't have to do that.

122
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:46,224
They'll come over. They'll
watch us eat, walk the dog...

123
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,770
Do we have a dog?

124
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,815
We could borrow one.

125
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,365
Nothing against the Japanese,
but our family is sacred to me.

126
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:09,414
I respect what we've built.
Our family is a private matter.

127
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:14,878
- I don't want tourists eyeing us.
- Very nicely put.

128
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,968
Dear friends...

129
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,309
Some years ago...
Excellent. That's it.

130
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,938
Some years ago...

131
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,756
A break-up?

132
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:08,056
You leave a piece of your soul
with everyone you break up with.

133
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,434
The missing piece is what hurts.

134
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,938
Because it's not with you.

135
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,401
Eventually it comes back to you,
but it takes a long time.

136
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,739
Sometimes I see
blue lights on people.

137
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:30,871
They're pieces of the souls
of people who used to love you.

138
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:36,251
Sometimes they're the hopes
your parents had for you.

139
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,088
That's the second kind.

140
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,801
Everyone's covered with lights.

141
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,434
Really. The Japanese have even
invented a way to measure it.

142
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,730
- The Japanese, huh?
- They know how to measure it.

143
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:03,403
- Why don't I drive instead?
- Why? I'm fine. -Really?

144
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,457
No pressure. I understand.

145
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,628
It can mess up
your short-term memory.

146
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,548
But it can help
your long-term one.

147
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,179
Holy shit!

148
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,739
Don't move him!
His spine could be messed up.

149
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:52,577
- He's pinned in here.
- Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

150
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,914
- I used to drive an ambulance.
- Really? -Really.

151
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,752
- We're not moving him, right?
- Of course not.

152
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,922
I'm just looking
at the way he's pinned in there.

153
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,550
- We're not moving him, right?
- No.

154
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,845
His spine could be messed up.

155
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,009
Some years ago
my girlfriend left me.

156
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:54,973
I was so upset that I would have
done anything just to see her.

157
00:16:55,557 --> 00:17:00,311
I even dressed up as a plumber
to get into her apartment.

158
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:06,151
For two years I followed her
around and walked by her house.

159
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,323
- I left flowers on her doorstep.
- His idea of an atypical speech.

160
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:18,496
Yet I knew something complex
and mysterious was guiding me.

161
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:24,753
My brain. So instead of
devoting my life to that girl,

162
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:32,135
I devoted it to the human brain.
Thank you. Thank you, Professor.

163
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,607
Tonight proves you didn't
make such a bad choice.

164
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,154
- Excuse me, I have an emergency.
- I understand.

165
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,326
Such is the life
of a neurosurgeon.

166
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,997
In recent years neurosurgery
has made great strides...

167
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:13,301
We can move my stuff tomorrow,
Jakub. Will you come pick me up?

168
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,807
Now we'll apply...

169
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,692
- Do you have that?
- Yes, I do.

170
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:04,978
This is Petr. This band
will be coming to Prague...

171
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:10,066
And now for a new contest
called "Record Your Mother."

172
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:17,407
Send me tapes of your mothers
for all our listeners to hear.

173
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,871
Now for something
I think is really good.

174
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:34,924
We never see you. You go to bars
and you look like a druggie.

175
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:40,138
It's that lifestyle of yours.
And those friends of yours...

176
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,191
You got sick of her
so you sent her packing.

177
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,902
- Some boyfriend you are!
- That's not him.

178
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,573
- He's just helping me move.
- Then go on in.

179
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:04,579
- I've never met your friends.
- It was Petr. You know him.

180
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,665
Petr? That Petr?

181
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,462
I knew he'd send you packing
from the minute I saw him.

182
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,049
Why isn't Petr helping you
if he sent you packing?

183
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,843
He didn't send me packing.
We just broke up.

184
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,304
Some life you lead.

185
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,975
Listen to that cough. It's
that lifestyle of yours again.

186
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,272
- It's from the air here.
- Where? At our house?

187
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,194
- No, the Prague air.
- It's that lifestyle of yours!

188
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:41,115
And those friends of yours,
for Christ's sake.

189
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:55,463
Keep your hands off her!
You let everyone touch you.

190
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,802
- Goodbye.
- I'll just be staying for a few nights.

191
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,680
- No problem. Hi!
- Hi, Dad.

192
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,766
- We're glad you're here.
- I don't get it.

193
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:11,229
Why are you like this
when Dad and I are so happy?

194
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,983
- I'm not all that happy.
- Yes, you are.

195
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,487
Happy is what she will never be!

196
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,791
- Have his relatives been by?
- No. Strangers brought him in.

197
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,379
Let me see that.

198
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,009
Are these their names?

199
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,305
- Yes. Do you know them?
- No, why?

200
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,142
Never heard of them.
On the contrary.

201
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,313
Doctor?

202
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,568
I'm sorry.

203
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,327
- This apartment looks fine.
- It's too luxurious.

204
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,623
- And the lady in South Prague?
- She lives alone.

205
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:17,378
It's sad to say, but yours is
the only typical family around.

206
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:23,009
Sorry, but my family is sacred.
We will not perform for anyone.

207
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,597
This doesn't belong here,
but this girl is interesting.

208
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:32,268
- Could they go to her house?
- No, to her parents' house.

209
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,730
She has excellent parents.
Her mother's especially crazed.

210
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,733
And they'd go for it.

211
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,408
Listen, I've got to go.
Take it easy.

212
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,118
Bye!

213
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,913
- Hi, Ondrej!
- What a coincidence! Hanka!

214
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,835
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting.

215
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:43,089
- What are you up to?
- I'm in school. -Great!

216
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:48,177
- How about your boyfriend?
- We're still together.

217
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,221
I'm glad to hear that.

218
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,974
- I heard him on the radio.
- Really?

219
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,936
I listen to him
on the radio sometimes.

220
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,897
Can I give you a hug?

221
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,235
- A hug?
- Just as friends.

222
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,280
Sure.

223
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:20,835
Some time ago I made
a private agreement with God.

224
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:26,007
That I'd become
a doctor on account of you.

225
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:31,762
And once I'd saved enough lives,
God would give you back to me.

226
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,433
Oh...

227
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:40,938
Last night I operated
on the man you brought in.

228
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,442
- Did you? How is he?
- Fine.

229
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,738
- And it was a sign.
- What kind of sign?

230
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,533
I don't know yet,
but it seemed like a sign.

231
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,412
I operated on the same person
you brought to the hospital.

232
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:02,418
- That surely is a sign!
- A sign we should live together.

233
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,048
- Come off it!
- I'm sorry. It was just a joke.

234
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:13,262
I wasn't really serious.
I just wanted to...

235
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:17,183
- I have to go. -Fine.
- Take it easy, bye. -Bye!

236
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,150
That was not good.

237
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,823
I should've left God out of it.

238
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,701
That was not good.

239
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,372
So you want me to pretend
I'm your girlfriend?

240
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,873
Exactly.

241
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:46,754
Mom would be really happy.
She's really attached to me.

242
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:53,219
- It wouldn't be right.
- She wants me to live well.

243
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,224
- Don't you live well?
- I live like a pig. -A pig?

244
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,979
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- Nope.

245
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,983
Couldn't someone else do this?

246
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:13,114
The point is that I look good.
I'm faithful to you.

247
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:16,742
We know each other well.
You respect me. Get it?

248
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,454
Do I say we're getting married?

249
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:25,960
That you can leave out. You can
say you liked my screenplay.

250
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,131
- You wrote a screenplay?
- Not yet, but you can say that.

251
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,093
Hi, patient!

252
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:43,519
So this is Mom,
and this is Vesna.

253
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,272
- Hello.
- She's my girlfriend.

254
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:50,568
I'm faithful to her.
We love each other.

255
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:55,865
- Does he still drink a lot?
- Not anymore. He's improved.

256
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:01,662
Are you still a Buddhist?
Why haven't you visited me?

257
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:06,125
- I was in Bangkok. -Where?
- In Bangkok. -It's in Thailand.

258
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:10,379
- Did you sleep with prostitutes?
- No, I was writing a screenplay.

259
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,342
- A screenplay?
- It's very good.

260
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,262
Really?

261
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,225
See? He never
lets me read anything.

262
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:29,065
- Did he smoke marijuana there?
- No, he quit.

263
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:34,987
- He always says no when I offer.
- You offer it to him?

264
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,828
Not anymore. I quit, too.
He's a good influence on me.

265
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,331
And on everyone else.

266
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,628
Can I use the bathroom?

267
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,348
- What's this supposed to mean?
- I needed a way to pick her up.

268
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,893
I said I wanted to cheer you up.
And she's enjoying it.

269
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,776
- Aren't you pleased that
I'm so playful? -Not really.

270
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:19,031
But I get my inability to take
things seriously from you.

271
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:26,247
It didn't bother you at all
when we used to cry as kids.

272
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:31,752
You told us to cry, that tears
are a good oral disinfectant.

273
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,591
- Must you always joke around?
- You're the one who's joking.

274
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:42,430
- You aren't really sick.
- Will you ever love me?

275
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,936
How can you expect to succeed
if nothing is sacred to you?

276
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,734
- Find a steady relationship.
- I'm thinking of buying a dog.

277
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:03,033
Gary Gilmore was a mass murderer
who received the death penalty.

278
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:09,665
He was also an organ donor,
so strangers got his organs.

279
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:15,337
This song's about the guy
who was given Gary's eyes.

280
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:19,592
He had to look at life
through Gary Gilmore's eyes.

281
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,184
No, thanks. I'm not interested.

282
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,191
Hello.

283
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,948
- Do you have a lighter?
- Yeah, I think so.

284
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,577
- Can I have a light?
- Hang on. I have to find it.

285
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,245
Here it is.

286
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,375
Hey, I have the same one!

287
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,047
- Goodbye.
- Do you want to go somewhere?

288
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,717
- Like where?
- Out for a drink? -No, I don't.

289
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,532
- Can I kiss you?
- Yup.

290
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:29,954
- Isn't there an extra charge?
- For what?

291
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,708
I thought kissing was
the most expensive.

292
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,669
I have no idea.

293
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,507
I guess that's just in Bangkok.

294
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,469
- You were in Bangkok?
- You bet.

295
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,805
- Really?
- Yup.

296
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:57,064
- Tell me about it.
- The whores are in aquariums.

297
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:04,321
Cool. How much do girls
charge for tricks?

298
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,658
- Fellatio's 500.
- What?

299
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:14,248
A blow job. Intercourse
costs 500 or maybe 1000.

300
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,378
Sometimes you can get
both for 1000 bahts.

301
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:26,427
That's the same in Czech crowns.
And kissing costs the most.

302
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,263
It's at least 2500.

303
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,226
- 2500?
- You didn't know that?

304
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,479
Nope. Did you?

305
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,738
Let's not waste time chatting.

306
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:52,244
That's intense. Slow down.

307
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,875
That's harsh. Unbelievable...

308
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,508
None of my friends
could ever be President.

309
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,304
- Are those people your friends?
- Yup.

310
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,806
- Ice?
- Nope.

311
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:19,563
They're all my friends,
and they're all living a lie.

312
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,068
They're lucky I'm around
to point that out to them.

313
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,112
That's my project.

314
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:33,494
- Who's that girl?
- A friend. Why?

315
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:39,583
- Do you know her family?
- Yeah. Pretty loony.

316
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:44,171
- Her mom's especially crazed.
- In what way?

317
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,092
She acts like my mom. Why?

318
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,471
So you all know each other here.

319
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,311
Why are you in this country?

320
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,487
On account of UFOs.

321
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,574
- UFOs.
- Yup.

322
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:17,496
The soil here is good,
so they can fly low.

323
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:22,001
- Can't they do that
anywhere else? -Nope.

324
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,963
You're insane!

325
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:30,801
I've never asked a girl this
before, but what's your sign?

326
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,280
I was walking down an odd street...

327
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:00,998
and I had the feeling I was in
a foreign city like Tokyo, Japan

328
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:09,381
I've never been to Tokyo,
but I imagine it's a cold place.

329
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:16,388
- And that's how I feel today.
- Gee, what happened?

330
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:21,435
This song's about
what's inside me today.

331
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:30,277
- Are you coming to bed?
- You can turn off the light.

332
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:41,288
I broke up with my girlfriend
because...

333
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:47,795
We just broke up... Because
we're both looking for someone

334
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,173
who won't go looking
for somebody else.

335
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,093
And until we find that person,

336
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:58,305
we'll keep looking on our own.

337
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,770
It's pretty complex.
I guess there's no solution.

338
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:08,273
But that doesn't matter.

339
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:17,282
That doesn't matter...

340
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:42,015
What? My back hurts,
so I'm working out the kinks...

341
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,589
You really scared us, you fool.

342
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,594
It's a miracle you're alive,
but the doctors here are good.

343
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,607
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Morning.

344
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,860
- Thanks on behalf of my brother.
- I don't have a brother.

345
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,238
I said, my brother.
You operated on him yesterday.

346
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:43,035
- How can I ever repay you?
- That's quite all right.

347
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,539
- Medicine fascinates me.
- It's just a job like any other.

348
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,960
- What do you do?
- I'm a magician. -Really?

349
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,882
- I can show you a trick.
- This is not the right place.

350
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,551
It'll only take a second.
What's in your pocket?

351
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,350
- Here.
- Watch closely.

352
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,197
Stop moving your hands around.

353
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,173
Goodness, I've got to run.

354
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,511
Doctor? This is for you.

355
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:49,184
That's my card.
Come see my magic show.

356
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,187
Thank you.

357
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,769
Hey! Hi!

358
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,649
- What a coincidence.
- It certainly is.

359
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,569
- What're you doing here?
- I was at the library.

360
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:45,198
How are you? I heard you
and your boyfriend broke up.

361
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:49,244
- Where'd you hear that?
- On the radio.

362
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,458
We might get back together.

363
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,630
It was wise you lied to me.

364
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,593
You thought I'd go bananas again

365
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:09,389
like when I used to put on
disguises and follow you around.

366
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,226
I was thinking more of the time
you almost set us on fire.

367
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:19,691
- On fire? What do you mean?
- You heard me!

368
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:25,447
Oh, that.
That was just a joke.

369
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,367
That was no joke!
Don't you remember?

370
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,705
Do you think I'd really
set you on fire? I'm not insane.

371
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,208
I think you are!

372
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,421
Wait! Can I give you a hug?

373
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,715
No, you'd better not.

374
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:49,429
- We must stop seeing each other.
- I was thinking that myself.

375
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:54,226
- Even "by chance."
- You can say that again.

376
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:59,773
Call me if you need help moving.
Sorry, bad idea. I take it back.

377
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,985
- Anything else you want? -No.
- Then I'm off. -Bye...

378
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:19,126
Vesna isn't just a great girl
who knows how to summon UFOs.

379
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,173
More importantly, she's a master
of the body shot. Show him!

380
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,011
- That's not a good idea.
- I agree.

381
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:36,560
- I'm more interested in UFOs.
- Body shots are better.

382
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,356
You're a DJ, and you don't
know what a body shot is?

383
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:45,318
- I don't have to know everything.
- Lie down.

384
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,281
Put salt behind your ear,
tequila in your belly button.

385
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,160
Put lemon in your mouth,
and then Vesna will drink it.

386
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,209
Quit looking at each other!
I thought you were curious.

387
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:07,257
I am, but Hanka's on her way.
This is not a good idea.

388
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,301
Okay, you're right.

389
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,331
Hanka! Wait!

390
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,252
Sorry. We were just drinking
tequila like they do in Mexico.

391
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,589
- In Mexico, huh?
- They drink it like that there.

392
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,384
- It comes from cactuses.
- Why did you ask me here?

393
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:56,431
It occurred to me that the guy
you took to the hospital...

394
00:41:56,431 --> 00:42:01,061
- ...could've been a sign.
- What kind of sign?

395
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,313
I don't know.

396
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:07,776
But it's odd you found him
the night you moved out.

397
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,987
That is odd.

398
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,617
Maybe it was a sign that
we should've stayed together.

399
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,870
Or that we shouldn't have.

400
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,708
Or that we shouldn't have.

401
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:54,531
A tequila sunrise
and a body shot of tequila.

402
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,159
Do you know what a body shot is?

403
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:46,124
It'd make me happy. Honest.
I collect this stuff.

404
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:50,795
- You collect guitar picks?
- I collect all sorts of stuff.

405
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,881
Will you go with me?

406
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:58,595
He'll be more likely to give
you the pick if you're alone.

407
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,931
Anyway, he kept looking at you.

408
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,729
- I'll wait here for you, okay?
- So, a guitar pick, right?

409
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,483
- And I want it autographed.
- Fine.

410
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,036
Hi.

411
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,962
On a guitar pick.

412
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,844
What time do you get off work?

413
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:03,743
- Everyone's covered with lights.
- Lights?

414
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,415
Me, too?

415
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:14,045
Well...
To be honest, not really.

416
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,675
That's good.

417
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,057
Isn't it?

418
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,604
It means that no one loves you.

419
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,029
Your cell phone's ringing.
Why don't you answer it?

420
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,533
But I don't have a cell phone.

421
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,163
Hello?

422
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,880
You bet. I wanted to go,
but it slipped my mind.

423
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:02,010
A guitar pick.
Sure I'll bring one. See you.

424
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,620
If I understand correctly, Vesna
promised her boyfriend a pick.

425
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,080
That's why who's here?

426
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,337
That's why I'm here. Because
what do I know how to do?

427
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:41,841
Forge a famous guitarist's
autograph. Is that correct?

428
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,593
Yup.

429
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:20,255
- Did I do a good job?
- It looks great. Thanks.

430
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,590
My pleasure.

431
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,468
What do I owe you?

432
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,229
- The guys said you're
interested in UFOs. -Yup.

433
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:43,903
- Do you think they land here?
- No, but they fly close to here.

434
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,947
Do they?

435
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:50,368
If you hear about anything,
I'd love to go with you.

436
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,787
- I'm not sure.
- Why not?

437
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:57,292
People go to Africa
to watch dolphins from boats.

438
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,669
They go to Asia to watch
rhinos on elephant-back.

439
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:03,006
Why couldn't people watch UFOs
from a delivery truck here?

440
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,843
A travel agency, get it?
See Old Town in the morning,

441
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,596
Prague Castle in the afternoon,
and UFOs at night.

442
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,144
- Want me to wait for you?
- No, you don't have to.

443
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,813
Thanks for offering.

444
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,994
- Hi!
- Hi!

445
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,914
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

446
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,959
I wanted to introduce
you two, anyway. Monika!

447
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:44,339
Bartender Monika,
meet bartender Vesna.

448
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:48,885
- Is she your sister?
- No.

449
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,846
Does she look like my sister?

450
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:57,101
You're disgusting.

451
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:03,316
No, I'm not. I like you,
but everyone does this.

452
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:08,321
- This is what you do.
- This is just life. -Your life.

453
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:14,202
We all fuck each other here.
There's nothing sad about it.

454
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,079
Vesna!

455
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,335
I have to get this on film.

456
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,800
- Relax...
- You're an idiot!

457
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:31,928
Hang on...

458
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:43,708
Czechs are nasty to each other
because Czech language is nasty.

459
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:49,130
Czech is stupid. The sounds
are harsh, and it's complicated.

460
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:54,969
- It's all "perhaps," "if"...
- "Could" and "would."

461
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,723
No one knows how
to say what they like to say.

462
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:03,686
- Would like to say.
- Would like to say.

463
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:10,568
- And everyone tells lies.
- They don't smoke enough pot.

464
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:17,241
- Do you think that's why?
- If they did, they'd lie less.

465
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:22,455
Maybe they'd break up less.

466
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:26,334
Getting high isn't
part of our culture yet.

467
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:34,634
Maybe you're right. I just know
this country is fucked up.

468
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:41,599
That's for sure.
Then again, every country is.

469
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,609
- You can leave your shoes on.
- Really?

470
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:57,115
- Hello! -Did Hanka send you?
- No, this was my idea.

471
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,660
- Did you hear what Petr did?
- No.

472
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,871
- He sent her packing.
- Did he?

473
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,750
- Pretty cruel of him.
- I'd say so.

474
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,420
- May I videotape your house?
- Of course.

475
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,383
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

476
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,010
I'll just turn this on...

477
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,437
- Is this for television?
- No.

478
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:32,525
I'm from a travel agency.
We specialize in Japan.

479
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,778
Japanese tourists want to see
how typical Czechs live.

480
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:41,617
- Would they come to our house?
- Yes, with an interpreter.

481
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:51,502
If you're interested
we can go upstairs. Follow me.

482
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:00,094
- Do you talk?
- Who? The two of us?

483
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,555
Do you talk during meals?

484
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:08,102
- Yes, a little.
- We talk a lot.

485
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:16,068
We've had some quiet applicants.
That's not what we want.

486
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,864
Actually we talk
all the time. Right, Dad?

487
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:24,619
- Do you have a dog?
- No. -No problem.

488
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:30,166
We'll provide one. Get small dog
that doesn't shed much.

489
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:35,755
Hanka's staying in this bedroom
now. And here's the bathroom.

490
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:42,720
Excellent. You could walk
the dog, watch some TV.

491
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,640
We could do that.

492
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:51,520
- But the focus will be on food.
- What do you mean?

493
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,815
- I'd say we're going to eat.
- Exactly.

494
00:53:55,149 --> 00:54:00,446
The Japanese want to know how
typical Czechs act during meals.

495
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,996
Come in.

496
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:16,712
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all. Come in.

497
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,927
At the hospital
you offered to pay me back.

498
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:28,015
- And the offer still stands.
- Now there is something I need.

499
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,768
What is it?

500
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,361
No, I'm sorry.
How would I do that?

501
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,578
No, that wouldn't work.

502
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:04,135
For my next trick I need
a volunteer from the audience.

503
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:09,682
Sir, why don't you
come up here? Don't worry.

504
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,936
Come right up.

505
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,236
Get inside.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

506
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:25,990
You'll be fine... Perhaps.

507
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,119
This is...

508
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,372
I'll shut the door.

509
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,868
- Am I to believe he disappeared?
- It sounds silly, doesn't it?

510
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:15,748
- It sure does. -But it's true.
- This is a very bad joke.

511
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:19,377
Ondrej has never pulled
silly stunts like this.

512
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:23,798
I am not leaving until
you give me my husband back.

513
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:32,676
Good afternoon.

514
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:35,930
- May I help you?
- Are you Mrs. Cerna? -Yes.

515
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:39,892
I've come to inspect
your gas appliances.

516
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:42,645
- Come in. The gate's open.
- Thank you, ma'am.

517
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,781
Stop making those awful faces!

518
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:59,495
Are they even going
to watch me shave?

519
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,206
We can still cancel out.

520
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:09,004
When you think about it,
we could prevent wars.

521
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:13,467
- In Kosovo, say?
- Doubtful.

522
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:18,430
But if the Americans
had visited Vietnamese families,

523
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:24,228
- there wouldn't have been a war.
- Wars break my heart.

524
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:29,275
I can't bear to see
those children and poor people.

525
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,944
And meanwhile we are so happy.

526
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,908
- I'm not all that happy.
- Yes, you are.

527
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,496
Happy is what
those people will never be.

528
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,529
- Is everything all right? -Yes.
- I didn't even offer you a drink.

529
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:19,199
- Do I owe you anything?
- No, these inspections are free.

530
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,076
- Fine. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

531
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:28,876
- Did we have company?
- No.

532
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:33,714
- How do you explain the flowers
in my room? -Which flowers?

533
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:39,511
- I don't believe it.
- Actually, the gas man was here.

534
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,223
- What did he want?
- He came to inspect the stove.

535
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,769
But we don't have a gas stove.

536
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:51,398
Hello?

537
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,068
Ondrej?

538
01:00:56,153 --> 01:01:00,616
Not having a gas stove is
no reason to get hysterical.

539
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,001
"Record Your Mother."

540
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:18,842
Back to our contest. A friend
of mine likes surprising me.

541
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:24,348
Sometimes it's quite unpleasant,
but now I'll surpise him.

542
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:28,143
Recently he gave me
a tape of his mother.

543
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:34,733
So, Robert. A big hello
to you and your mom!

544
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,241
I've improved.

545
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:49,081
For example, I go by garbage
cans without taking anything.

546
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,792
- I had a mess tin here.
- Really?

547
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:58,799
Last time someone threw away
a high power vacuum cleaner.

548
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,427
- Are you recording this?
- Yup.

549
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,184
- That's good.
- Do you have anything to drink?

550
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,687
Otherwise I wouldn't try...

551
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,816
I left a high power
vacuum cleaner there.

552
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:18,819
- I see.
- I didn't even look at it.

553
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:21,655
How do you know
it was a high power vacuum?

554
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,325
- There was a grinder here.
- Where's the wine?

555
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:28,871
- Did you see the grinder?
- Nope.

556
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:34,501
It was in a box and there were
some new boots on top of it.

557
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:37,546
Brand new.

558
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:43,761
That's how
I knew the vacuum was good.

559
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:48,015
And I didn't look at it
or the boots.

560
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,978
Because I knew God
was just tempting me.

561
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:58,317
- Move over.
- Why do you collect this junk?

562
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,029
My son is a disappointment

563
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:06,033
and I want
to be remembered for something.

564
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,077
You're such a klutz.

565
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:29,741
Would you go with them?
I'll shoot the breeze with them.

566
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:34,454
But I'm not going anywhere.
It's awesome here.

567
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,500
- Think so?
- You bet.

568
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:44,339
There are forty-two
civilizations in the universe,

569
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:47,426
and we're in last place.

570
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,847
Measured by what?

571
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,559
- Moral maturity...
- Yeah.

572
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,688
We're also the only planet

573
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:05,485
where procreation
requires only two beings.

574
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:09,448
So on the other planets
you need three beings?

575
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:14,286
No, seven. Of various sexes.

576
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,165
There are three of us.

577
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:23,420
So we'd need four more beings
of totally different sexes.

578
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:25,589
Right.

579
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:29,343
Then maybe I will go.

580
01:05:57,204 --> 01:06:00,666
Why are we here, anyway?

581
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,384
- I guess we're waiting for UFOs.
- Right.

582
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,971
I forgot something in the car.

583
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,862
Why are we here, anyway?

584
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,077
You don't really
believe in UFOs.

585
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:41,081
- Maybe not.
- Then why are you in Prague?

586
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:46,211
I came here to see Dad.

587
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:53,218
- Dad? Your Dad?
- Yup. -Is he in this country?

588
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:55,512
Yup.

589
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:59,641
- Does he know about you?
- Nope.

590
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,730
Want to tell me about it?

591
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,816
Nope.

592
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:15,574
And I don't want to start
anything until I see him.

593
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,829
Even though I like you.
Understand?

594
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,706
Of course.

595
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:28,712
At times it's easier
to see a UFO than your own dad.

596
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:58,867
So the Macedonian beauty
came here to look for her dad.

597
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:03,246
He's from the Czech Republic,
and she's never seen him before.

598
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:07,751
So now I'm going to play
some Macedonian music.

599
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,342
Because at times it's easier
to see a UFO than to live

600
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:18,804
with the kind of girl
I lived with for three years.

601
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:52,254
Why did you live with me
if it was that horrible?

602
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:57,300
- Sorry, we were stoned.
- You can't always make excuses.

603
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,512
- I'm not.
- Know what your problem is?

604
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:03,098
You've never done
anything for anyone.

605
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:06,518
You've never given up
anything you like for anyone.

606
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:11,773
Would you get
a degree for someone?

607
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:15,068
- For you? -This isn't about me.
- Then who is this about?

608
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:18,196
- Would you give up
anything at all? -Of course.

609
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,199
Something really important?

610
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:25,954
Do you want me
to jump off a bridge for you?

611
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:31,126
No, I just wanted you
to be brave about our break-up.

612
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:35,255
So I'd have a reason to respect
you so I could come back to you.

613
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:39,968
So you wanted to come back to me
because I broke up with you?

614
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,470
- Yeah.
- That's great.

615
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:46,808
You're just like your mother.

616
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:04,784
What?

617
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:30,894
As Station Manager I am
responsible for what you play.

618
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,857
I don't care about your break-up
or your contest. No one does.

619
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,444
Tell me why you play this stuff.

620
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:47,452
My mother is ten times worse
than what you've been playing.

621
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,039
Radio is no private matter.

622
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:56,586
If I hear this stuff again,
you can pack it in. Get it?

623
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:57,879
Yes.

624
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,306
I was afraid
we'd never meet again.

625
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:14,145
Nah, I knew we would.

626
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:17,691
How did you know that?

627
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:22,529
Because the guy
pinned in the car was a sign.

628
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,532
A sign?

629
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:32,455
We find a guy pinned in his car
the first time we meet.

630
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:37,335
He was pinned
in a car he'd rolled.

631
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,839
Didn't that seem
like a sign to you?

632
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,718
Yeah, I guess so.

633
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:52,809
It's a clear sign that
something's going on between us.

634
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:02,986
The fact that you're high is
a sign you shouldn't be driving.

635
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:09,784
Get a load of these buildings.

636
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,912
Aren't they awesome?

637
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:18,418
What city is this? Dubrovnik?

638
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:26,259
- This is Prague, you moron.
- I know. I was just testing you.

639
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,847
This is where I was born.
This is where I live.

640
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:37,812
But today it seems new.
It's really nice.

641
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:49,574
Tourists flip out
over these buildings.

642
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:58,208
You can rip me off
just like you do to tourists.

643
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,002
It sounds like
you're saying he steals.

644
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,840
- So you really steal, huh?
- Knock it off.

645
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,720
Why? Let him steal.
It's awesome.

646
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:19,938
Where's he going? How can
he drive from out there?

647
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:30,824
Ouch!

648
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,371
The Golden Age of Moving
is coming.

649
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:22,876
More and more people are moving
to more and more new places.

650
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,754
I'm afraid of how it'll turn out.

651
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:32,844
But I'm not getting in the way.
I want to move with the times!

652
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:37,474
- What do you want to be?
- A mover.

653
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:44,898
- You already are one.
- Awesome. Then I'll keep my job!

654
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,894
My sincere condolences...

655
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,671
Wow! Awesome hose.

656
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,184
- My condolences.
- Do I know you?

657
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:07,021
I'm Ondrej.

658
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:19,450
Of course, Lenka's husband.
She's looking for you.

659
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:24,038
Come in.
Look at all the junk Mom had.

660
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:26,791
It's that psychopath again.

661
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:33,506
He keeps following me around.

662
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:38,177
- Then we'll get him stoned.
- He doesn't smoke.

663
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:43,308
- Does he eat?
- Why wouldn't he?

664
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,477
Then I'll put it in some food.

665
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,022
This is my sister Julie.

666
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,859
This is Ondrej. He's a doctor.

667
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:57,113
I don't have to introduce you.
This is Jakub, a great musician.

668
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,991
- Hi, I'm Jakub.
- Do you want something to drink?

669
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:02,702
- Tea? Coffee?
- No, thanks.

670
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:08,374
Do you have any pastry or cake?

671
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,210
Isn't cake more for weddings?

672
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,131
Do you have any mixes?

673
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,759
We must.

674
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,055
I want to bake something.

675
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:30,355
Ondrej, I don't know how
to get through to you.

676
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:44,744
Look. You've made a mess
of your life, haven't you?

677
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,539
I'm offering you a way out.

678
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,417
What way?

679
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:58,591
What can you offer me?
You're a psychopath!

680
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,262
Don't touch me!
You're an addicted psychopath!

681
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:12,146
Life with a psychopath
might be your only way out.

682
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:16,025
Or are you looking for someone
who'll leave you in a year?

683
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,406
Let's live together! Please!

684
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:23,366
I love you more than anything.

685
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:31,332
I know I act like an idiot.
That's because of you.

686
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:37,422
I think of you when I'm walking
down the street, at work...

687
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:45,513
...for Lenka. I can't help it.

688
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:52,395
I think of you in so many places
that I can't even name them all.

689
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,276
I went to medical school
so you would be proud of me.

690
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:03,281
I sometimes wish you'd fracture
your thigh in a car accident...

691
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,075
- Don't touch me!
- Please!

692
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:11,372
- Don't touch me!
- Hanka, I'm begging you!

693
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:17,462
That's heavy stuff.

694
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:30,183
I understand you.
I'm a wreck, too.

695
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,693
Can I give you a hug?

696
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,538
- Me?
- Just as friends.

697
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,152
What are you staring at?

698
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,533
It wasn't that big a deal.

699
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:32,203
I always stare like this.

700
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,917
Don't look at me. He asked.

701
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:44,173
- I wanted to answer him.
- But you were looking at me.

702
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:47,176
So I was looking at you
instead of at him.

703
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,096
Whatever.

704
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:54,350
- What did you bake?
- Some excellent pastry.

705
01:20:56,811 --> 01:21:00,147
I don't want any pastry.
I just want to sit down.

706
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:03,359
Some party.

707
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:09,282
- I'd like something to drink.
- We have some excellent pastry.

708
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,617
- What is this?
- Nothing.

709
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,288
- Did you set us on fire?
- No, I didn't.

710
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:06,542
- But we're burning!
- No, you aren't.

711
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,879
Everything's just fine.

712
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:15,968
- Have a seat. It's all right.
- Holy shit! This is warped!

713
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,100
Holy shit!

714
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:28,439
This is unreal!

715
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,407
That was warped. Wasn't it?

716
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:07,056
Please...

717
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:10,434
I love you.

718
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:14,063
I think of you in so many places

719
01:27:14,063 --> 01:27:17,608
that I can't even name them all.

720
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,739
I love you more than anything.

721
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,245
Why did you film this?

722
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:34,208
I don't know.
I found it interesting.

723
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:37,086
Interesting?

724
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:39,129
Yup.

725
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:48,555
- It seems sad to me.
- It is sad.

726
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:56,689
Maybe that's my problem.
I find sad things fascinating.

727
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:02,361
Without sadness I feel nothing,
and I can't change.

728
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:07,950
- That's quite sad, isn't it?
- Yes, but it's also fascinating.

729
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,249
You are a real idiot.

730
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:24,049
"I'm sorry, Hanka"

731
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,379
Scram!

732
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:08,385
We all need relationships.
Someone who loves you.

733
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,764
Someone who'll
caress you when you're down.

734
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:17,978
The world might be awesome,
but sometimes it stinks.

735
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:24,777
And Hanka's sensitive.
She's totally awesome.

736
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:29,573
I told her I love her
and I want to live with her.

737
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:33,243
Live with her?
You already have a girlfriend.

738
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:39,458
- Say what?
- C'mon, Alice.

739
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:42,836
- Alice who?
- You tell me.

740
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:49,426
I wouldn't...
Oh yeah, Alice. But we broke up.

741
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:52,096
No, you didn't.

742
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:56,809
But we saw her off
at the train station.

743
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:01,397
She just went
to Germany to see her aunt.

744
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,942
You're a total waste case.

745
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:07,820
You can't even remember
who you're going out with.

746
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:12,199
Do you even know your own name?
Listen, quit smoking pot.

747
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:18,455
Do you want me to go schizo?

748
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,644
"I'll wait for you"

749
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:57,494
I have to tell you something.

750
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,415
I thought we'd start going out,

751
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:06,503
but the guys said
I already had a girlfriend.

752
01:31:07,838 --> 01:31:09,798
- Which guys?
- From the band.

753
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,844
Then it all came back to me.

754
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:17,931
I'd totally forgotten about her.

755
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:28,066
- You're joking, right?
- No, I'm not. I know it's awful.

756
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,572
I'm sorry,
but put yourself in my place.

757
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:38,118
Life's a bitch. Everything
has turned against us.

758
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:45,959
I want to cry. I love you,
but I promised to stay with her.

759
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,547
I remember making that decision.

760
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:58,514
- I don't want to hurt anyone.
- You don't want to hurt anyone?

761
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:03,519
- I'm sorry.
- It's all that pot you smoke!

762
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:06,021
It's that lifestyle of yours!

763
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,324
This is the last thing
I'm gonna play for you.

764
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:20,911
This is also the last tape
I have of my girlfriend.

765
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:25,290
This is her cough
from March 3, 1997.

766
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:29,002
You can see how long
we were together.

767
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:34,841
I guess we hurt each other.
But in any event...

768
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:42,224
Here's a beautiful cough.

769
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:52,169
Where have you been?
We started without you.

770
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,795
Where have you been?

771
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,924
We started without you.

772
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:03,138
Come on.

773
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:06,892
Sit down.

774
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:14,441
- What is this?
- Beef. -With cranberries.

775
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:17,903
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

776
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:22,324
This is beef.
Have some more dumplings.

777
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:28,080
They want to see how we eat.
Isn't this in the contract?

778
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:35,379
- Can I talk to you in private?
- Later, okay?

779
01:34:35,504 --> 01:34:38,882
The father is indicating
that they can talk later.

780
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:42,886
What the hell is this?
What's she saying?

781
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,722
- Watch your language!
- Stop snapping at me!

782
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:49,768
The daughter is surprised
by the unusual situation.

783
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,980
I'm not afraid to slap you!

784
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:59,236
I came to see you because I feel
awful and I need to talk to you.

785
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,200
Yet what do I find here?

786
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:11,790
Do you know why you feel awful?
It's that lifestyle of yours.

787
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,418
The daughter wants advice on how

788
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:21,425
to deal with the fact that

789
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:25,846
a married man is stalking her.

790
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:29,558
- It those friends of yours.
- You don't even know them.

791
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,518
Seeing them is enough.

792
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:36,356
Isn't it odd for a girl
your age to move all the time?

793
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,233
Quiet!

794
01:35:38,859 --> 01:35:43,822
- Seeing you breaks my heart.
- You break my heart too, Mom.

795
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:45,198
Stop it!

796
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:53,790
This is unbearable.

797
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:58,336
The parents object to having
this kind of discussion today.

798
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:02,632
Kindly realize that
life isn't that easy.

799
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,551
- I see.
- What?

800
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:10,056
You have an obligation.
We've had to make sacrifices.

801
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:13,560
Well I have, out of love!

802
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:19,733
You don't even know what that
means because your friends...

803
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:24,321
- ... never make sacrifices for you.
- I don't want them to!

804
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:28,992
And they don't!
You people don't live life.

805
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:30,577
You just slice it!

806
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:38,251
The mother thinks the daughter
is to blame for her own problems.

807
01:38:56,765 --> 01:38:59,351
I like women as people.

808
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,021
I'm just not going
to sleep with them anymore.

809
01:39:03,021 --> 01:39:07,692
If I ever do meet a girl,
for the first 146 days

810
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:10,445
we're just going to talk.

811
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:13,615
146 days. That's important.
It can't be less than that.

812
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:19,829
Then maybe I'll give her a kiss.

813
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:26,169
But until I find that kind
of girl I'm going to be alone.

814
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:32,175
Not everyone has the chance
to be alone like I have.

815
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:42,227
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

816
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:45,939
Have you already started?

817
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,483
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

818
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:59,327
- I saw the video.
- Which video?

819
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:04,499
From Robert's party.
I was quite shocked.

820
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:08,336
It was just an ordinary party.

821
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:12,841
You have a few drinks,
and then act crazy.

822
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:18,221
You dance and laugh.
Should I pack my things?

823
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,684
Of course not.
Have a seat.

824
01:40:25,895 --> 01:40:28,273
I think we have
a good relationship.

825
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:31,818
- Do you?
- Of course.

826
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:38,324
You buy us nice Christmas gifts.
You don't smoke or drink.

827
01:40:39,034 --> 01:40:41,953
You're faithful to me, reliable.

828
01:40:43,413 --> 01:40:45,081
And you love us.

829
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:50,462
- Do you think so?
- Of course you love us.

830
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:58,803
- Did you think you loved her?
- Yes, I did.

831
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:04,893
Sometimes it's hard to figure
out what you want on your own.

832
01:41:04,893 --> 01:41:08,563
You think you want
to live with someone else.

833
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:14,903
Yet what you really want
is to dress up as a plumber.

834
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:18,740
Why, that's me.

835
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:25,997
I didn't know the problem was
your attraction to overalls.

836
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,628
You can wear them at home.

837
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:43,515
Thanks, but I don't think
that's the main problem.

838
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:47,560
Perhaps the hospital would
even let you wear them to work.

839
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:57,237
- No. Well, maybe.
- But promise you'll think about it.

840
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:03,451
Fine, I'll think about it.

841
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:07,163
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

842
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:10,625
Bon appetit!

843
01:42:12,377 --> 01:42:17,298
I get high because the world
is cruel and people are lonely.

844
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:23,596
I work so I can buy drugs
that make people seem kind,

845
01:42:24,097 --> 01:42:28,059
friendly, free, and beautiful.

846
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:36,276
Trouble is these drugs probably
caused me to hurt someone.

847
01:42:37,694 --> 01:42:41,823
So it doesn't make sense
for me to do them anymore.

848
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:47,620
I've had it with drugs.
I'm giving up weed.

849
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:52,792
This is my last joint.

850
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:56,963
I'm not even going to finish it.

851
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:43,635
- What's she like?
- She's a bit selfish and tough,

852
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:47,222
and she never gives up
without a fight.

853
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:52,018
- Is it even worth the effort?
- Yeah. Give it a try.

854
01:44:13,206 --> 01:44:14,415
- Hi!
- Hi!

855
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:17,710
Pretty good, huh?

856
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:25,510
It occurred to me that the guy
I took to the hospital...

857
01:44:25,969 --> 01:44:29,639
- ...really could've been a sign.
- What kind of sign?

858
