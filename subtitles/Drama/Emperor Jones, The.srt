1
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:19,218 
Leave me. Prepare for war!

2
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:08,818 
Stop! I am not harmed!

3
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:18,818 
We attack tonight!

4
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,818 
I have too much to do for one lifetime.

5
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,818 
Your Majesty...

6
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,818 
Rise up.

7
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:00,818 
I do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...

8
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:04,818 
...but I know where to find it.

9
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,118 
General...

10 
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,818 
No man is to touch her.

11 
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:14,818 
She is mine.

12
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,818 
This is a key.

13
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,818 
You have served me well.

14
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:39,818 
I will grant you anything you desire.

15
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:44,818 
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

16
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,818 
Of course.

17
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:49,818 
Read

18
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:22,118 
I feel your spell working.

19
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:28,818 
I am now immortal.

20
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,918 
Come, I want to show you something.


21
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:52,618 
Become my queen 
and I will let him live.

22
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,818 
Do what he says! Save yourself!

23
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,118 
You will never keep your word.

24
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,118 
You are right.

25
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:22,218 
Now, join General Ming in Hell.

26
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:39,818 
What did you do to me?

27
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,518 
I cursed you and your army.

28
00:08:57,807 --> 00:08:59,418 
Surround the Palace!

29
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,818 
The Emperor is in trouble!

30
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,118 
Don't worry. We'll find the entrance today.

31
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:27,118 
Li Tung, what's for lunch?

32
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,218 
Noodle soup.

33
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:30,218 
Very good.

34
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:33,118 
We found it! We found the door!

35
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,730
Ok, stay together.

36
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,500
The O'Connell's are in Shanghai.

37
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,999
Do they have the Eye of Shangri'La?

38
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,350
Our spy says they do.

39
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,500
Good.

40
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,800
Assemble the men.

41
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,880
Yes Sir!

42
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Soldiers!

43
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,830
Soon all our training and sacrifice....

44
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,900
will bring great honor.

45
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,430
It's now time to wake
the Emperor from his tomb.

46
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,000
Only he can bring order out of this chaos.

47
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,670
Soldiers!

48
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,870
Our greatest battle begins!

49
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:26,108 
I am your servant forever. 

50
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,603 
We shall see. 

51
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,100
Hurry!

52
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

53
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,900
Why did you wake me?

54
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,500
I love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.

55
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,530
What is in it for you?

56
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,900
I want to rule as your general.

57
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
The last general I trusted...

58
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,670
betrayed me!

59
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,030
I will not make that mistake.

60
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:58,270
I cannot conquer this world
until I am immortal.

61
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,100
General.

62
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,200
I understand, my Lord.

63
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,200
We must go find the Pool of Eternal Life.

64
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,570
This will point the way.

65
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

66
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,900
Prove yourself to me.

67
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,170
Setup a crossfire!

68
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:17,030
Move it!

69
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,350
Please, I need your help!

70
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,670
These soldiers are evil!

71
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,300
Shoot! Kill them!

72
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Shangri'La.

73
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,770
Mother.

74
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
My sweet daughter.

75
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,600
I beg you...

76
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
My father is dying.

77
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,670
They are my friends.

78
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,000
Where are you going General?
Our destiny awaits.

79
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:40,000
I was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

80
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
No, mother.

81
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,330
I would do anything for you.

82
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,130
You look tired. You should rest.

83
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,970
I'll stay.

84
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:00,330
Fate is about to deal it's final hand.

85
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,830
It is mine to defeat the Emperor.

86
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,500
I must ask for one more sacrifice.

87
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,900
Anything, mother.

88
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:15,700
Your immortality.

89
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,730
General Ming's daughter.

90
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,870
Her death will be mine.

91
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,830
Grab her!

92
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:02,930
Guard her with your life.

93
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,600
Arise!!

94
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:09,270
Today your world awoke..

95
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,370
In the grip of chaos and confusion.

96
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I will restore order..

97
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:22,870
I will retake what is mine.

98
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:26,330
I will crush any idea of freedom.

99
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I will show no mercy.

100
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,300
I will conquer without compassion.

101
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,100
I will lead you beyond the Great Wall.

102
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:47,070
Once you bathe you will be indestructible.

103
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,800
I command you to go forward...

104
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,400
and enforce my will on the entire world!

105
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,530
All hail Emporer!

106
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,500
Zi Juan.

107
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,000
Everyone wake up!

108
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:46,130
Follow General Ming!

109
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:53,130
Ready for attack!

110
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,730
Charge!

111
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,800
Ready up! Ready up! Ready up!

112
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:52,900
Archers. Ready!

113
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,770
Fire!

114
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:34,470
Formations march!

115
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:40,070
Attack!

116
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:11,000
Attack Emperor Han!

117
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,270
You are no longer Immortal.

118
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Get in!

119
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,100
The O'Connells are going after the Emperor!

120
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,500
I dug you up...

121
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,900
And I'm gonna put you down.

122
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,700
Let go!

123
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,100
Never!

124
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,970
The Emperor is dead.

125
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:11,330
The Emperor is dead!

126
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:40,330
