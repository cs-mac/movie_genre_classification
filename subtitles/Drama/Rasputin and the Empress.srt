1
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:57,258
Almighty lord of hosts,

2
00:02:57,326 --> 00:03:00,228
preserver of holy Russia,

3
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:03,197
300 years this day

4
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,168
have the Romanoffs
reigned over us.

5
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,712
Grant unto them thy servants

6
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,117
a peaceful life, length of days.

7
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:36,133
¶ Emperor NikolaI Aleksandrovitch ¶

8
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:51,615
¶ bless all-pious ¶

9
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:58,956
¶ Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna ¶

10
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:03,896
¶ protect with thy mercy ¶

11
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:08,133
¶ Alexis Nikolaievitch ¶

12
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:12,370
¶ anointed by God ¶

13
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,443
¶ to protect the throne ¶

14
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:37,098
¶ Amen ¶

15
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:49,611
almighty lord of hosts,

16
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:51,613
king of kings,

17
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,750
bless all of these my people.

18
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,753
Fill thou their lamps with oil

19
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,255
and give them from on high

20
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:01,723
the dew of heaven

21
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,693
and all the fullness
of the earth below.

22
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,196
Grant them mutual love

23
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,698
in the bond of peace,

24
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,700
and may the grace

25
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,703
of our lord Jesus christ...

26
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,906
be with us ever.

27
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,410
Amen.

28
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:28,351
¶ Amen ¶

29
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:34,258
your highness,

30
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,261
I regret to inform you

31
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,763
your brother will not be present.

32
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,731
Why not?

33
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,733
There's been an accident.

34
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,735
He is dead?

35
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,737
Yes, your highness.

36
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,739
Assassinated?

37
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,942
Yes, your highness.

38
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,079
God rest his soul.

39
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,848
What has been done?

40
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,217
A number of suspects
have been arrested.

41
00:05:58,285 --> 00:05:59,751
Shoot them-- all of them.

42
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,220
Without trial?

43
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,355
They did not give
my brother a trial.

44
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:06,358
We'll show them what a real killing
can be like.

45
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:07,860
Your highness, another wholesale
execution--

46
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,361
you've had your orders.

47
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,531
But, sir, I can't obey such orders.

48
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,733
Shh. Natasha.

49
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:16,369
Uncle Igor...

50
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:17,871
Paul...

51
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,207
is it true about my father?

52
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:21,708
Natasha.

53
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,409
Yes.

54
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:28,181
Your fiance seems to sympathize
with the assassins.

55
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,184
Darling, because they murdered,

56
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:32,186
we can't murder back.

57
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:35,389
It's the first thing
your father would have said.

58
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:36,991
Take me to him.

59
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,726
Natasha, your place is here.

60
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,194
The empress' lady-in-waiting

61
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:42,696
does not leave for any reason,
prince Chegodieff.

62
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,233
But, your highness--

63
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,767
Paul.

64
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,840
His imperial highness
the archduke Ferdinand

65
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,376
of Austria-Hungary.

66
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,228
Ferdinand, what an angel you are
to come so far.

67
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,730
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything. Your majesty.

68
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,032
Ferdinand.

69
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,599
And Alix.

70
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,738
Your imperial highnesses.

71
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,740
If the emperor had been well,

72
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,242
he would have been here himself.

73
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,245
Oh, he would not bother
about us parvenus.

74
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,148
What is 300 years to a Hapsburg?

75
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,184
We are feeling our years, 
though, hmm?

76
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,186
In celebration of your anniversary,

77
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:10,190
the emperor has asked me to confer

78
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,025
the order of the iron crown

79
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,593
on his little highness.

80
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,696
Oh, how beautiful.

81
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,700
No, no, at the top.

82
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,539
Well, Aloysha,
what do you say?

83
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,642
Will your highness honor me

84
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,845
by expressing
to his imperial majesty

85
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:33,414
our sincere gratitude
for this great honor?

86
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:36,517
That's a beautiful speech.

87
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:38,019
What a soldier.

88
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,021
If we ever have a war,

89
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,191
will you promise me
to fight for austria?

90
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:43,658
Yes, your highness.

91
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,394
Good.

92
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,197
He will stay home.

93
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,165
Oh, well.
Ha ha ha!

94
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,700
Your imperial majesties,

95
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:55,170
I wish to extend
the sympathy of france

96
00:08:55,238 --> 00:09:05,414
in your terrible loss.

97
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,150
The grand duke, sir,
he was fond of my country.

98
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:08,651
Paul.

99
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,120
Your majesty.

100
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:11,654
Sergei--Sergei?

101
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:13,156
Yes, your majesty.

102
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:16,626
I was laughing and talking 
with him only this morning.

103
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:19,630
Your majesties, I'm so sorry
I brought the news.

104
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:22,866
Excellency, we should
have heard soon.

105
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,170
Cancel the audience.

106
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:28,005
Aloysha, go with your sisters.

107
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,250
Oh, take this away.
My head aches.

108
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,684
Yes, majesty.

109
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:41,686
Do you want the doctor, 
my dear?

110
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,855
Oh, no, Nicky. It's nothing.
I'm all right.

111
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:45,524
I can't help thinking of Sergei.

112
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:48,660
He was so full of life,
so strong.

113
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:51,697
Do you remember that rose garden
at bialystok

114
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,199
and the marble stairs

115
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,701
he never let me climb?

116
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,205
Once he tried to carry us both.

117
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:02,208
Why didn't we stay there, Nicky?

118
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:04,710
We were happy-- human beings.

119
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,215
Nobody wanted to kill us there.

120
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,717
There were no soldiers then.

121
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,187
This is our destiny, my dear.

122
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:15,222
I know.

123
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,225
What have we done to 
these people of yours, Nicky,

124
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,227
they should hate us so?

125
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:21,728
Nothing, Alix.

126
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:24,232
Everybody loves you.
You know that.

127
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,234
No...

128
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,736
but you love me, Nicky.

129
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,439
That's enough for any empress.

130
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,721
We die gladly!

131
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:49,258
Our names will be remembered
when your end comes!

132
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:52,261
Comrade, stand up!

133
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,513
Wait!

134
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:11,981
As you were!

135
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,685
Lieutenant Karpov, who detailed
the chevalier guards

136
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:16,187
to the firing squad?

137
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,389
His imperial highness
the grand duke Igor, prince.

138
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:20,057
Oh, he did?

139
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,233
What do you mean by interfering
with my orders?

140
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,736
Your highness, this is not
your regiment.

141
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,205
I will take all responsibility.

142
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:34,739
Fortunately, I've already done so.

143
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,242
We chevalier guards
have on our helmets

144
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,244
for faith and courage,
not murder.

145
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,745
I commanded this court-martial!

146
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,214
Nobody commands my regiment

147
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:43,882
but the empress herself.

148
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:46,017
Aah! You want to shoot us
yourself, you judas!

149
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:48,254
And I know their majesties
would wish

150
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:50,723
these people to have
a fair trial.

151
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,258
You are under arrest.

152
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:53,726
Any such order, your highness,

153
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:55,928
must come directly from
their majesties.

154
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:59,232
Left face, forward!
March!

155
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,766
Left face, forward, march!

156
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,669
Follow me to the emperor
at once.

157
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:04,705
Gladly, your highness.
We'll use my car.

158
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:06,707
Go on, finish your dirty work.

159
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:08,209
Shoot us all.
Get it over!

160
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,678
Oh, be quiet.
No one's going to hurt you.

161
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,714
Wait!

162
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,916
That's your thanks,
Chegodieff.

163
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:23,725
Well, it, uh...

164
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,893
it isn't blood.

165
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,231
Take her away.

166
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:30,732
You ready, your highness?

167
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,087
Yes.

168
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,590
Igor, we're so sorry.
You got our message?

169
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,059
Thank you.

170
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,594
Uncle Igor, tomorrow we'll meet

171
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:59,095
with the minister  of justice

172
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,064
and decide what's to be done.

173
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,299
Oh, tomorrow.

174
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,434
Nicky, how long
do I have to stand

175
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,969
insolence and insubordination

176
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,437
from your court favorites?

177
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:08,972
Well, who is it this time?

178
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,173
Prince Chegodieff.

179
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,709
Should I leave, Nicky?

180
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,678
No, no, my dear.
And what's he done?

181
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,713
He has been insolent,
disobeyed orders,

182
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,214
and grossly insubordinate

183
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:18,616
in the presence of others!

184
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,718
All right. I'll punish him.

185
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,387
That's what you said last time.

186
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:24,054
I know he's your little pet,

187
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:26,557
but if I'm to remain
governor general of Moscow,

188
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,560
I'll not be made a fool of

189
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,562
by a colonel in 
her majesty's guards.

190
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,897
And where is he now?

191
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:33,064
He's here.

192
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,366
Call him in.

193
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,436
Colonel Chegodieff.

194
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,244
Yes, your majesty.

195
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:48,114
If I hear one more criticism
of your behavior,

196
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:50,750
I'm going to relieve you
of your command.

197
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:52,385
You must realize you're a soldier

198
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:53,920
subject to your superiors.

199
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:55,755
May I explain, your majesty?

200
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:57,791
No. You can apologize.

201
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,028
As colonel of her majesty's
chevalier guards,

202
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,699
I offer my apologies
for insubordination

203
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,534
while your imperial highness

204
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,169
assumed the duties
of public execution.

205
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:10,705
I demand his arrest.

206
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,840
Wait a minute.
What's this about executions?

207
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,875
For the assassination
of my brother--your uncle.

208
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,712
It's for me to decide 
what action should be taken.

209
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,214
This calls for immediate action.

210
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,216
Under martial law,
I acted within my rights.

211
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,718
How many are dead?

212
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,219
I don't know.

213
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:25,721
12, 15,
your majesty--

214
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:27,222
4 of them women.

215
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,191
After--after all our promises
of reform...

216
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,227
Nicky, they started the killing.

217
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,729
Paul left me alone.

218
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,231
Your grandfather did not hesitate.

219
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:37,734
There were no assassinations
during his reign.

220
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,201
This is another century, Igor.

221
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,704
What you have done
has put us back 20 years

222
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,205
in the eyes of europe.

223
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:46,242
My dear empress-- or would you 
rather be called Kaiserin?

224
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,744
Igor!

225
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:50,713
The last empress germany
gave us--Catherine--

226
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:53,717
was usually called "the great."

227
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,719
I meant no disrespect,
majesty,

228
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,721
but you have never understood

229
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,222
the Russian temperament.

230
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,258
Moderation might be all right
in germany,

231
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,159
but here it would be fatal.

232
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,696
It has never been tried here.

233
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:07,698
What if, instead of my brother,

234
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,401
it had been your son?

235
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,739
You really are
a very cruel man, Igor.

236
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,210
Igor, please.

237
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,178
We must do something at once--

238
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:23,014
something that will
reach the people

239
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:24,549
before the news of these executions.

240
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,720
Yes.

241
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,688
Your majesty.

242
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,724
I'm glad I found you,
Igor.

243
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,726
Do you realize what's going on
out there?

244
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:35,060
You mean the crowd?

245
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,429
They're merely celebrating,
your highness.

246
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:38,531
Weren't they told
the ceremonies are over?

247
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:40,866
They're demanding
the Czarevitch!

248
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:43,670
It seems they were told he'd appear.

249
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:45,038
He will not appear.

250
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:46,907
But they're getting ugly!
It's the only way

251
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:48,742
we'll be able to get rid of them.

252
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,411
Do you think I'll wave my son
in front of that mob

253
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,746
after what happened to Sergei?

254
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:54,047
Alix!

255
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:57,216
Alix. Alix.

256
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:58,685
Nicky, Nicky, dear,

257
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:00,220
we're always holding him

258
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:02,389
between us and the crowd.

259
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,692
Why can't you find
someone bigger

260
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,193
to hide behind?

261
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:07,695
He's not a sacred image.

262
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:09,196
He's my son--

263
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:10,665
the heir to the throne!

264
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,700
Dearest Alix, we're not
sending him out.

265
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:14,201
Of course not.

266
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:16,537
May I ask your permission
to disperse them

267
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,707
as I see fit?
They're getting ugly.

268
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,776
I'll disperse them
if your majesty orders.

269
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:24,580
It's perfectly simple for a few 
thousand soldiers to ride down a mob,

270
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,215
but how long can you go on, sir?

271
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:29,184
You can't shoot 160 million people,

272
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,719
and God help the dynasty

273
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:33,221
if they ever learn
to hate you, your majesty.

274
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,724
You haven't enough soldiers

275
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,726
or enough walls
to keep them back.

276
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,227
Paul!

277
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:41,230
Your majesty, punish my impertinence
with death if you will,

278
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,199
but you're on a volcano
day and night.

279
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:44,901
Your only bulwark,
your only security

280
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,070
is the love your people
have for you and Aloysha,

281
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,240
but that love could be
killed by violence,

282
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,977
and anyone who proposes it
now--anyone--

283
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:56,013
is a traitor to you and Russia
and the Russian people.

284
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,181
Nicky, why do you tolerate
such impudence?

285
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,684
There are women and children
out there, your majesty.

286
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:03,420
Women and children
have no business in a mob!

287
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,555
Igor!

288
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,356
Wait!

289
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,192
Wait.

290
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,704
Igor, I am a woman.
I have a child.

291
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,205
Alix.

292
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,542
Nicky, I can't bear to think

293
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,045
that someone will tell Aloysha
when he's grown up

294
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,713
that his safety was ever held

295
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,549
above the lives of his people.

296
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,219
Tell the Czarevitch they're waiting.

297
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,388
No! I'll go.

298
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,240
Thank you, darling.

299
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:58,242
Some for you, Maria?

300
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,846
Mamushka, look. It's Maria.

301
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,151
I think it's charming.

302
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,352
Paul!

303
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,354
Paul, where have you been?

304
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:10,789
Your majesties.

305
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,291
Paul, how long are you
going to be here?

306
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,294
You should ask your father. 
I'm here at his command.

307
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,863
I received your summons, sir.

308
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,364
Yes, Paul. I'm weary.

309
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:21,533
The task of governing
millions of people

310
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,069
is getting beyond my strength.

311
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:25,772
I want to share
the burden of government
with my people.

312
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,775
I want to form a duma, Paul,

313
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:30,877
along the lines 
of the british parliament

314
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,511
or the german reichstag.

315
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,513
I want men elected to that duma

316
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,683
by popular vote--
leaders who would help me,

317
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,152
who'll represent my people.

318
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,687
Such a duma, sir,

319
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:41,855
would put us on an equal footing

320
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:43,523
with any nation in the world.

321
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,625
I want you to help me form it.

322
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,260
Oh, your majesty.

323
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,929
These reforms take
years to accomplish

324
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,430
the good that's intended.

325
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:52,599
Let's hope we live to see it.

326
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,467
Aloysha will, at any rate.

327
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:55,870
Your majesty.

328
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,206
We can go over the groundwork
in my study.

329
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,241
Oh, Nicky, the duma
can wait one other day.

330
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:01,710
You promised me this afternoon.

331
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:03,244
Is the photographer here?

332
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,713
Yes, your majesty.

333
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,247
Oh, Alix.

334
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:08,382
Nicky, if
I let you off again,

335
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,085
a whole year will slip by.

336
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,553
Show him in.

337
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:14,590
Oh, Alix, I'd rather play bridge
with cousin Wilhelm.

338
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:17,760
Ha ha! Remember,
we are his first royal clients.

339
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:21,030
Paul, do me a favor.
Don't watch this.

340
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:24,767
Ha ha ha! Natasha,
let's go and discuss my vices.

341
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:27,269
I have to look after
the empress' letters.

342
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:29,773
Your majesty,
may i, uh, help her?

343
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:32,275
I think you'll be 
a tremendous help, Paul.

344
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:33,777
I'll do my best.

345
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,678
Come along, my brood!

346
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:38,715
Come here, Natasha.

347
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,717
But I have to see
about those letters.

348
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,219
My dear child, you know,

349
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:44,721
this letter-writing's a menace. 
I mean, you write them.

350
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,691
Some poor wretch has to read them. 
He writes you back again.

351
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,194
You have to answer it.
I mean, where are you?

352
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,662
I mean, the whole thing's
interminable.

353
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,197
It doesn't mean anything.

354
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,166
Natasha, will you marry me?

355
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm going to!

356
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,668
I mean now.

357
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,203
Paul--

358
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:00,704
listen, darling.

359
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:02,407
It doesn't help the dead any

360
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:04,743
to stop living just because
they're gone.

361
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,746
You don't know how I feel
about these things.

362
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:10,749
I know, sweetheart. I suppose 
religion's a wonderful thing.

363
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:12,251
Yes, I presume it is,

364
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,586
but I mean, it can be overdone.

365
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:17,256
It's helped you through
a terrible time, I know,

366
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:18,723
but it's changed you, too.

367
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:20,760
I can't explain, Paul.

368
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:22,728
It--it's peace, happiness.

369
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,832
If you could talk to him,
you'd understand.

370
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,233
Talk him?

371
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,768
Father Rasputin.

372
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,270
Oh, is he a priest?

373
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:33,239
You don't have to be a priest
to have the power of God.

374
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,908
Oh, really?

375
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:38,412
If you talked to him, you couldn't help 
feeling the greatness of his soul.

376
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,915
I think the saints
must have been like him.

377
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:42,749
Well, if he's helped you,

378
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,019
I'm very grateful to him, darling,

379
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:48,055
but--but it seems I've lost you.

380
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:49,924
There's something I can't see--

381
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,992
something I can't fight.

382
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:54,996
Paul.

383
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,665
You'll never lose me...

384
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,135
if that's what you still want.

385
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,070
Oh, darling, of course it is...

386
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:04,572
only let the halo slip a little,

387
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,076
like it used to be--
over one eye.

388
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:10,246
I will be a good wife, Paul.

389
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:12,215
I don't want a good wife...

390
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:15,952
until I'm so old
I have to be good myself.

391
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:20,756
Oh! Ha ha!
Look at Paul and Natasha!

392
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:22,758
Oh, Mamushka!

393
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:25,261
I saw you, Paul!

394
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,730
I saw you!

395
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:28,765
Aloysha, under certain conditions,

396
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,767
one officer never sees another.

397
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,736
Pull his hair, Maria.

398
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:34,371
Ha ha ha!

399
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,306
Ha ha ha!

400
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:38,342
Hey, Aloysha, come on!

401
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:40,443
Aloysha.

402
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,646
Mamushka, he's bleeding.

403
00:22:44,616 --> 00:22:46,251
Aloysha.

404
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,152
Paul, send for Remezov at once.

405
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,687
Yes, your majesty.

406
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:51,489
Aloysha. Aloysha.

407
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:57,061
But, doctor, it's only 
a slight fall.

408
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:58,596
It's more serious than that.

409
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:00,266
Hello, operator,
I want to talk

410
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,234
to dr. Franz wolfe in Vienna.

411
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:03,735
Yes, please.

412
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,737
Did you ever hear of hemophilia?

413
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:08,207
Yes. The empress' uncle died of it.

414
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,741
And her grandfather.

415
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,743
It's the heritage of her house.

416
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:13,745
That's impossible.

417
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,747
Well, they're all so healthy.

418
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:17,217
The girls, yes.

419
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:18,751
It can only be transmitted

420
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:20,220
from mother to son.

421
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:22,255
There's an element
lacking in the blood.

422
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:23,656
It doesn't--
it doesn't coagulate.

423
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:24,925
The slightest injury

424
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:26,960
may cause them to bleed to death.

425
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,561
Herr doktor?
Herr doktor Wolfe?

426
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:12,408
Majesty.

427
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:25,255
Thank God. Paul has found 
dr. Wolfe.

428
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:26,756
Where are they?

429
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:29,759
At the frontier.  
They'll be here in the morning.

430
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,462
I must tell Nicholas.

431
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,140
Nicky, dear.

432
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:46,478
He's the greatest
physician in europe.

433
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:54,752
He's still bleeding.

434
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,787
Shh, heart.

435
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:58,790
I know, but...

436
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,759
but...

437
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:02,728
Nicky...

438
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:06,499
you must have the track
cleared for that train.

439
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,068
Of course.

440
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:26,686
Mama...

441
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,589
Mamushka...

442
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:31,758
will you say my prayers?

443
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:34,962
I can't remember them.

444
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:42,270
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,

445
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:45,739
look upon the little child.

446
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,775
Is that the one?

447
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,778
Yes.

448
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:52,281
Pity my simplicity...

449
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:56,085
there's some more.

450
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,986
Suffer me...

451
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:01,090
to come to thee...

452
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:05,227
and ask him

453
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:09,432
not to make it hurt anymore.

454
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,239
Don't, Mamushka.
Don't.

455
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,740
No, Mamushka...

456
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,775
is only laughing.

457
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,779
Only laughing.

458
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,150
That's right, 
your imperial highness.

459
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,751
Your mother is happy

460
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,620
because you're doing so well.

461
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,199
Your majesty,
for your own sake--

462
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,767
for the boy's sake.

463
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,269
I know. I'm sorry.

464
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,970
She must have some sleep.

465
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,340
Remezov.

466
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,774
Yes, your majesty.

467
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,109
The doctor from Vienna

468
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,611
will be here in the morning.

469
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:53,745
Splendid, your majesty.

470
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,781
Do you think this man 
can cure my son?

471
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,284
If anyone can, he can.

472
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,724
"If." "If."

473
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,693
That's all they ever say.

474
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:10,229
Your majesty,
God won't let him die.

475
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,400
Majesty!

476
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,754
Father.

477
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:35,456
Come in.

478
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,242
Where is the boy?

479
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,244
Who is this man?

480
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:56,445
Rasputin.

481
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:57,680
Who?

482
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:00,182
GrIgory Rasputin.
He is a man of God.

483
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,618
He can cure him.
He has cured many.

484
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,087
There was woman called Nirushkin.

485
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:06,155
She was dying,
wasn't she, father?

486
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,091
And the child run down
by horses.

487
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:10,093
He has healed them.
He can heal Aloysha.

488
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,662
The doctors have admitted
they're helpless.

489
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,232
He has the power of God.

490
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,834
Let me pray with your son.

491
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:20,903
All the priests in Russia 
are praying, father.

492
00:28:20,972 --> 00:28:24,408
I am no priest.
I am a simple man

493
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:26,244
who believes God answers prayers.

494
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:29,780
We are grateful for everyone's
prayers.

495
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:34,252
Go to the cathedral.
They're all there.

496
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,255
The cathedral of God is here.

497
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:41,260
Why, if you could believe
like a little child,

498
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:44,763
you'd say to me,
"my son is getting well

499
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,267
because I've asked God
to make him so,"

500
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:52,771
and then God would know that you 
trusted him and raise him up.

501
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:56,643
You trust doctors.

502
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,380
Don't you believe God
can do more than they can?

503
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,516
If only he could be spared that.

504
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:06,686
There are no ifs, my daughter.

505
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:09,021
I can heal him.

506
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,359
Won't you believe?

507
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:17,731
Say after me,
"my son will live."

508
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,233
My son will live.

509
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,803
Rejoice, my daughter.

510
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,673
Your son will live.

511
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,243
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

512
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,812
I've come to take care of the boy.

513
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:32,347
Who let you in here?

514
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:33,848
The Czaritza.

515
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:38,286
Your majesty, permit me to forget 
that you are my sovereign.

516
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:41,489
You're a woman. This is your child.
I am his doctor.

517
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:44,192
I'm going to the Czar and demand

518
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,863
that you be kept away from him. 
This madman is the last straw.

519
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:49,264
Send him away.

520
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,203
You will go.

521
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,740
You and the other nurses

522
00:29:57,808 --> 00:30:00,443
report at once
to your headquarters.

523
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:03,079
Imperial majesty,
your physician in ordinary

524
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:06,282
begs to be relieved of his duties.

525
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,485
He is already relieved.

526
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,313
Mamushka.

527
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:38,250
Now, there's no use calling her.

528
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:40,318
She's gone.

529
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,320
What color are your eyes?

530
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,322
Where did she go?

531
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:48,827
She went to get a beautiful
white elephant for you

532
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:53,298
with purple eyes and a shiny 
golden house on his back.

533
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,834
I want her.

534
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:59,839
But she's gone all the way 
to the zoo to get it, Aloysha.

535
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,841
That'll take a long time.

536
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:04,977
Aloysha, look. Look here.
Look at my watch.

537
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,747
Isn't that pretty?

538
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:11,285
A man gave that to me once

539
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,287
for making him well.

540
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:17,792
He was a great deal sicker
than you are, Aloysha.

541
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,227
Look at it glitter. Look.

542
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,331
See how it glitters?
Look at it turn.

543
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,768
Mamushka.

544
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:31,807
We're going to ride in that 
golden house, Aloysha,

545
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:36,812
on your elephant through the black,
dark forest,

546
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:43,117
and yellow tigers are going 
to be hiding in the trees,

547
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:49,325
and we're going over beautiful 
blue rivers in the snow

548
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:52,294
filled with silver fish.

549
00:31:52,362 --> 00:31:56,833
We'll ride on that elephant
of yours, Aloysha,

550
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,336
all the way to the moon, Aloysha.

551
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:02,773
All the way to the moon.

552
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:04,775
Mamushka.

553
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:06,677
Look at me, Aloysha.

554
00:32:06,744 --> 00:32:09,780
Look in my eyes.

555
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:12,749
That's a good boy.

556
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:18,289
Hear the bell?
Isn't that pretty?

557
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:21,826
Keep looking in my eyes now.

558
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:24,762
Keep looking in my eyes.

559
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,298
That's a good boy.

560
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:30,802
Keep looking in my eyes, Aloysha.

561
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,404
That's a good boy.

562
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,775
You don't feel badly now, 
do you?

563
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:39,311
You have no pain.

564
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:42,815
It's gone out of your body,

565
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:46,284
down your arms, through your hands,

566
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:49,522
and out of your fingers.

567
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:54,828
Now it's going
out of the window,

568
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:57,330
way up into the sky,

569
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:00,299
and you are going to sleep.

570
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:01,768
No.

571
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:03,770
Yes, you are.

572
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:05,772
You're going to sleep.

573
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,275
Your eyes are getting heavy.

574
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:09,777
No.

575
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:11,478
Yes, they are.

576
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:15,282
Good night, Aloysha.

577
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,985
You're going to sleep.

578
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:24,459
Lift up your hand.

579
00:33:28,364 --> 00:33:29,965
Drop it.

580
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:35,136
That's a good little boy.

581
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:39,007
Who was it you were
asking for a minute ago?

582
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:42,144
Who was it you wanted to speak to?

583
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:43,646
I don't know.

584
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:46,115
I don't know.

585
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:50,653
Aw, isn't that too bad?
He doesn't know.

586
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:54,857
Well, we don't care, 
because he's going to sleep.

587
00:33:56,227 --> 00:34:00,363
Dear little boy
is going to sleep.

588
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,795
It's been a miracle, doctor,
a great miracle.

589
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:32,297
It's amazing.

590
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,800
I shall be the first
to admit it...

591
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:37,003
after I make a slight examination.

592
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:44,977
What do you want?

593
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:47,346
Oh, several things.

594
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,852
Have you any pain,
your highness?

595
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:58,324
Have you any pain, Aloysha?

596
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:02,395
No.

597
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:04,097
Anything more?

598
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,967
Yes.

599
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,271
I'm not going to hurt you.

600
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:12,273
Doctor, I'm an old friend
of his.

601
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,775
Possibly, I can--

602
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:15,476
well, lieutenant--

603
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:19,580
I'm sorry, old mate.

604
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:22,017
He's not quite himself
yet, Paul.

605
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,420
Could you sit up, your highness,
just a little bit?

606
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:26,789
He'll staup.

607
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,290
He'll run around the room.

608
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:29,758
Come, Aloysha.

609
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,794
Show them what you can do.

610
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:35,297
Don't, your highness. 
No exertion, please. Your majesty--

611
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:39,001
don't you believe he's cured? 
Let go!

612
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:43,306
Please let go.

613
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:46,475
Come, Aloysha. Come to me.

614
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,512
Come to me, Aloysha.

615
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:57,321
We'll show them
what two days has done.

616
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,257
Come on. Come to me.

617
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,459
Come. Ah!

618
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,964
Ah! Don't touch it!

619
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,498
Ah, hey. Hey.

620
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,967
Ha ha ha!

621
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,969
Now laugh at the doctor.

622
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:13,504
Laugh at him!

623
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:16,808
Laugh! Laugh at the doctor!
Laugh at him!

624
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,977
Are you sure the diagnosis
was correct?

625
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:21,179
You saw the result
of the blood tests.

626
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,181
I should like to take another.

627
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:26,785
Your majesties, may I be alone
with the patient?

628
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,586
No!

629
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:31,690
The way to lose God's power

630
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,192
is to doubt his power.

631
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,194
Do you want the boy to die?

632
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,696
Even you should know better 
than to talk like that.

633
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:38,931
Get out!

634
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:42,401
You doctors have had your chance
with the boy.

635
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:44,436
You know what you did,

636
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:47,440
and you've seen what God
has done.

637
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,877
Now, which will you choose?

638
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:51,311
No, no.
It isn't that, father.

639
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:53,480
Which will you choose?

640
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,315
We've already chosen,
father.

641
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:56,817
You've raised our son

642
00:36:56,885 --> 00:37:00,821
when none of you doctors
have given us any hope.

643
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,758
He's alive.
I hold him in my arms.

644
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:06,127
Who do you suppose
I would believe in?

645
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:09,264
Who do you suppose
I would have faith in?

646
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:12,967
My daughter, your faith has
made him whole.

647
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,982
Grishka, show them. Here's the hand
that shook the Czar's.

648
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,018
The Czar shook hands with him.

649
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:30,986
Did he really do that, Grishka?

650
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:33,488
What does he call you,
Grishka? Tell them.

651
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:35,024
"His friend."

652
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:37,527
You mean, he talked to you?

653
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:39,930
Well, what's so marvelous
about that?

654
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:42,398
He's just an ordinary
human being.

655
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,400
Does he really smoke cigarettes?

656
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,902
Yeah. Yeah.

657
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,371
Here. I got one for you.

658
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:49,906
Oh, that's wonderful!

659
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:52,408
One of the Czar's own cigarettes.

660
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,378
Look what else he brought!

661
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:56,914
Aw, don't be showing those things.

662
00:37:56,982 --> 00:38:00,451
Aw, they won't tell.
Look! Look at the eagles.

663
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:03,754
Solid gold!

664
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,256
Are you going back?

665
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,758
Yes. I've got to go
to the palace every day.

666
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,760
This will make
your fortune, Grishka.

667
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,263
How much did he give you?

668
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,764
He didn't give him anything.

669
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,266
He didn't give him a thing!

670
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,736
What difference does that make, 
you old sheep's head?

671
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:20,772
These aristocrats don't think 
anything about money.

672
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,276
It wouldn't surprise me
if I got 200 rubles.

673
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,245
Ha ha! 200 rubles!

674
00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:28,647
Ha ha! 200 rubles!

675
00:38:28,715 --> 00:38:31,284
I might get 500 rubles!

676
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:36,789
Yeah! I saved his son's life,
didn't I?

677
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:42,628
Oh, Grishka, you're just such 
a sweet little thing, you are.

678
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:45,465
Ah, you're just making up to me

679
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,768
because I'm an important man now.

680
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:52,306
No. I love you. I've always loved you,
Grishka. You know that.

681
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,807
Give me one--

682
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,776
ah, go on now! No.

683
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:57,311
Oh, Grishka.

684
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:58,812
Go on.

685
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,315
Grishka! It's the chief

686
00:39:00,383 --> 00:39:01,716
of the secret police!

687
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:05,220
Here. Put those things
away, will you?

688
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:08,256
Don't worry, my friends.
Go on and eat.

689
00:39:08,324 --> 00:39:10,725
Go on. Be happy. It's nothing.

690
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:14,095
Grishka, I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?

691
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,596
Are you sure you didn't go 
too far with that boy?

692
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:16,632
Shh!

693
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,766
Are you sure you didn't
make him crazy

694
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:18,867
like the boy in Kazan?

695
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:19,969
Quiet.

696
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:21,938
If he's gone mad, too,
they'll kill you.

697
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:23,940
Look. You can go out that door.

698
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:26,442
I haven't anything
to be afraid of.

699
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:28,911
I've done nothing.
The boy is all right.

700
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:30,879
Get out of the way.

701
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,149
Go on over there.

702
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,689
Father Rasputin?

703
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:41,658
Your excellency.

704
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:45,128
I have just come from the palace.

705
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:46,964
Congratulations.

706
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:48,966
Thank you.

707
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,338
May I, uh...

708
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:55,739
oh, you're asking permission?

709
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,209
Your modesty is almost convincing.

710
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:03,147
You know, father,
it has just occurred to me

711
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:07,986
that we might be able to help 
each other, you and i.

712
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:10,322
Really?
How can I help you?

713
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,326
Well, my department has been subject
to a little criticism

714
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:17,329
since the death
of the grand duke Sergei.

715
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:20,265
Oh, I see. Your post is in danger.

716
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,733
We all have enemies.
Of course.

717
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:24,736
And the Czar being grateful
to you at the moment,

718
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,772
I thought you might drop a word.

719
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,775
What makes you think that 
I can influence the Czar?

720
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:31,277
Oh, come, come, father.

721
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,780
You know you're the most important 
man in Russia at the moment.

722
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:36,782
Ah, I'm beginning to understand.

723
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,585
What is there in it for me?

724
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:44,691
Your record, father,

725
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:47,194
as far back as Tobolsk.

726
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:49,397
There are one or two 
little items there

727
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:51,899
that I'm sure you wouldn't like
to have known

728
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,901
now that you're where you are.

729
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:55,936
My record, huh?

730
00:40:56,004 --> 00:40:57,905
It's not enough.

731
00:40:57,973 --> 00:41:01,876
You just said I was the most 
important man in Russia.

732
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:04,346
You don't go to an important man

733
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:07,882
and ask him to save your post
for a ruble.

734
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,152
What do you want?

735
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,687
Hmm. Let me think.

736
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:18,294
Do you keep your hat on
in your own house?

737
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:20,696
I beg your pardon,
father.

738
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:31,374
I'd almost forgotten
about her.

739
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:35,079
Have you got these things
about everybody?

740
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:37,081
Everybody of consequence.

741
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:39,049
Information of this kind

742
00:41:39,117 --> 00:41:42,586
would be very valuable to
an intelligent man.

743
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:46,490
As someone once said,
knowledge is power.

744
00:41:46,558 --> 00:41:48,992
I'll save your post for you.

745
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:50,428
Thank you, father.

746
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:55,100
Yes, but I must look through some
of your files.

747
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:59,804
Yes. I'm going to be more important
than even you think.

748
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:02,840
I won't tolerate
this meddling in my department.

749
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:04,809
I'm going to tell the Czar.

750
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:08,481
All right. Tell him
of the 2 million kronen

751
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,149
you received from Austria

752
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:12,284
and what it was for.

753
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:15,787
Tell him who planned
general Sablin's murder

754
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:21,327
and why you're going to meet 
the minister of the interior tonight

755
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:24,831
at general Gadya's house.

756
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:30,036
I think you can afford to take 
orders from me, your excellency.

757
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:35,142
Ah, you want your husband
promoted, don't you?

758
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:37,710
Yes, yes.

759
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:40,348
Yes.

760
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:43,017
Have you done anything
about general Karloff?

761
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:44,185
There's nothing to be done.

762
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:45,353
Have you offered him
money?

763
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,854
He can't be bought.

764
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:50,858
Hmm. You know,
God has given me a power

765
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:53,861
to read the hearts of men.

766
00:42:53,928 --> 00:42:57,365
It wouldn't surprise me
if this fellow

767
00:42:57,433 --> 00:43:00,869
had been selling plans
of our fortifications

768
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:03,305
to, well, let's say Turkey.

769
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:07,809
The Czar would be horrified 
to find anything like that out.

770
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,280
Now, you take some
of our most important plans

771
00:43:11,348 --> 00:43:13,783
and put them in his portfolio.

772
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,986
Then I'll tell the Czar
of my premonition.

773
00:43:18,622 --> 00:43:19,822
How did you know, father?

774
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,824
Of myself, I know nothing.

775
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:27,029
A power has been given me to read
the hearts of men.

776
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:34,037
If it has helped Russia,
I thank God.

777
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:09,709
I hope you're not angry

778
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:11,611
with father Rasputin for not coming.

779
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:14,113
Of course not, darling.
As a matter of fact,

780
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,315
I very seldom attend
dinners given to me.

781
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:19,985
But I usually notify my host.

782
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:21,955
He didn't mean to be rude,

783
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:24,958
but he lives in such
a world of his own

784
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:28,462
that people and time and dinners 
don't mean anything to him.

785
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:31,498
I see. Well,
always remember I asked him.

786
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:32,999
At least that's over.

787
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:35,001
Was it such an ordeal,

788
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:36,970
after all he's done for Aloysha?

789
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:39,474
Darling,
if a witch doctor had healed Aloysha,

790
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:42,477
he could have everything I've got
in the world,

791
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:44,011
but I don't like him,

792
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,480
and I never shall.

793
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:46,981
You never tried to.

794
00:44:47,048 --> 00:44:50,017
It isn't that.
There's something clammy about him.

795
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:51,486
I can't explain it.

796
00:44:51,553 --> 00:44:53,521
I've had the same feeling

797
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,525
brushing against something
on a dark night.

798
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,527
I don't know
what he's after,

799
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,464
but I get a sort of feeling 
of a man waiting his chance.

800
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,932
Paul!

801
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,967
You dragged it out of me, d
arling.

802
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:07,736
Have you ever watched him
with people?

803
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:12,474
He goes as far as he dares, 
even with the empress.

804
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,778
You don't like him
because he's so outspoken.

805
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,480
You don't like his manners.
Isn't that it?

806
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,482
No, that's not it.

807
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,351
It's-- it's his smile.

808
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,486
It's like a man-eating shark

809
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,488
with a bible under his fin.

810
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,990
Paul, I've never
seen you like this before.

811
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,460
Darling,
I can't help it.

812
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:32,496
Paul, I believe in him,

813
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,466
in his sincerity, his divine power.

814
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:38,469
No one can shake my faith in him,

815
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:40,705
not even you.

816
00:45:42,374 --> 00:45:47,345
I know it, and I hate 
your belief in him. I hate it.

817
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:51,049
Everything that's come between us
I blame on him.

818
00:45:53,386 --> 00:45:55,854
Ah, well, darling...

819
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,623
let's have some more champagne.

820
00:45:58,691 --> 00:46:02,026
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin.

821
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,529
Hmm. There he is.

822
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:06,532
Paul, nothing has come
between us.

823
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,001
Please be nice to him.

824
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:13,539
Of course, darling.
I'll be a pearl among hosts.

825
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,508
Excuse me.
Pardon me, general.

826
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,813
We were worried about you.

827
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:21,314
Why?

828
00:46:21,383 --> 00:46:23,817
Dinner was at 8:00. 
We waited until 10:00.

829
00:46:23,885 --> 00:46:26,286
Perhaps I can get you something
on a tray.

830
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,323
No, thank you.
I just had some wonderful borscht.

831
00:46:30,392 --> 00:46:32,526
Little friend of mine makes it.

832
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:37,164
Who are all these people?

833
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:38,633
I'm about to present you.

834
00:46:38,701 --> 00:46:40,635
I'll tell you who I want to know.

835
00:46:40,703 --> 00:46:42,136
Oh, very well.

836
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:45,673
Well, my dear child,
you look very beautiful.

837
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:48,175
Is this the famous father Rasputin?

838
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:49,644
Am I?

839
00:46:49,712 --> 00:46:51,679
You're all anyone talks about.

840
00:46:51,748 --> 00:46:54,182
All of us came here
just to see you.

841
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,151
I gave up a trip to London.

842
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:59,154
You see, I've been an invalid
for nearly 12 years.

843
00:46:59,222 --> 00:47:01,189
Oh? What's the matter with you?

844
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:04,126
None of the doctors
seem to know. I've had them all.

845
00:47:04,193 --> 00:47:05,628
Well, I'll tell you.

846
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:06,629
Yes?

847
00:47:06,696 --> 00:47:08,597
You're a lazy, spoiled woman.

848
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:12,135
If you were to scrape some
of that rouge off your face

849
00:47:12,202 --> 00:47:13,603
and get behind a washtub,

850
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,772
you'd be all right in a week.

851
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,307
Sir!

852
00:47:17,374 --> 00:47:20,310
He's wonderful!
A washtub! How divine!

853
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:22,278
I warned you.

854
00:47:22,346 --> 00:47:25,315
Who is that man?
I like his face.

855
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:27,819
That's Kropotkin.
He's a brilliant creature.

856
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,354
He's helping me restore the duma.

857
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:31,789
Come and meet him.

858
00:47:31,857 --> 00:47:34,291
Professor Kropotkin,
university of St. Petersburg.

859
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:36,828
General Linoff, 
our minister of war.

860
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,330
And his excellency
the german ambassador,

861
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:40,832
Count Cartales.

862
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,334
Father Rasputin.

863
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,337
Oh, I am delighted
to see you, indeed.

864
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,038
Thank you.

865
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,509
So you're Kropotkin, huh?

866
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,310
I'm afraid so.

867
00:47:52,378 --> 00:47:54,813
Oh! Tobolsk cakes!

868
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:56,915
Where did they come from?

869
00:47:56,983 --> 00:47:59,417
Natasha said you liked them, sir.

870
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,523
No! Did you remember that?

871
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:06,392
Well, that's very sweet,
my daughter.

872
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,927
Natasha.

873
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:11,364
General Linoff is awfully bored.

874
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,132
Go and flatter him a little.

875
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,300
But, Paul, I--

876
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:15,434
please.

877
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:17,304
Aw, don't take her away.

878
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:18,472
Sorry.

879
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,840
Excuse me.

880
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:24,578
Ah, Kropotkin...

881
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:27,080
I was talking to the Czar

882
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:28,616
about you this morning.

883
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:30,117
Oh, you were?

884
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:34,622
Look here, why do you want
to hand out rights

885
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,526
to a lot of slobbering peasants?

886
00:48:37,593 --> 00:48:39,594
Have you forgotten
the french revolution?

887
00:48:39,662 --> 00:48:42,163
Don't you think 
the peasant has any rights?

888
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:45,500
No. It's one of the luxuries
of the rich

889
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:48,302
to feel sorry for the common herd,

890
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:49,839
but I know them.

891
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:52,241
They're born to the lath.
Let them have it.

892
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:54,610
This is the will
of God.

893
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,646
Will you pardon us
a moment, sir?

894
00:48:56,713 --> 00:48:59,148
Father Rasputin and I have 
something to discuss alone.

895
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:02,084
I don't go
behind closed doors.

896
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:04,086
But I want to ask your advice

897
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:05,588
about the situation
in the baltic.

898
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:09,593
You can ask my advice
about anything right here.

899
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:12,596
Perhaps we're, uh, disturbing
the ladies.

900
00:49:12,664 --> 00:49:16,600
Oh, excuse my peasant manners.

901
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:19,102
This way, father, please.

902
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,315
What's this cock-and-bull story
about the baltic?

903
00:49:31,383 --> 00:49:32,984
Sit down.

904
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,521
Have a cigar.

905
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,633
I trust you didn't think
it was rude of me

906
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,668
to take you away from those
delightful people.

907
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,170
Ha ha!
Delightful people!

908
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:54,172
You see, father, you're by way

909
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,675
of being a stranger at court,
aren't you?

910
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,844
Yeah.

911
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:00,346
And although you've made 
a very great success

912
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,848
with the royal family,

913
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,850
you might want a little advice.

914
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,351
Advice? About what?

915
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,854
Well, a man in your position--

916
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,856
yesterday nobody, today a hero,

917
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,858
trusted by her majesty,

918
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,426
almost worshipped.

919
00:50:13,495 --> 00:50:16,430
Such a man might--
I won't say he would--

920
00:50:16,498 --> 00:50:17,832
but he might let success

921
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:19,834
go to his head, mightn't he?

922
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:22,837
Hmm. Come to the point.
Say what you want.

923
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:24,872
Well, if you're wise,

924
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,843
you won't meddle in matters 
that do not concern you.

925
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,377
Such as?

926
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:32,380
The duma, my friend.

927
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:34,049
Duma?

928
00:50:36,252 --> 00:50:40,088
The duma concerns me
very much.

929
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,894
Someday, I'm going to run
this country.

930
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:48,897
I don't want to have
my toes stepped on

931
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:50,900
by a lot of ignorant peasants

932
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,368
with political ideas.

933
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:54,403
Oh, that's it, is it?

934
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,873
The power behind the throne, eh?

935
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,844
Yes. You might as well know it 
now as any other time.

936
00:51:01,912 --> 00:51:04,346
Get used to it, prince.

937
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:08,852
Just, uh, where did you pick up 
these delusions of grandeur?

938
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,354
You think I'm dirt,
don't you?

939
00:51:11,422 --> 00:51:12,823
Hmm.

940
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:14,357
Just an ignorant priest

941
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:16,827
to kneel before for a miracle.

942
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:20,363
Well, you never made
a greater mistake.

943
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:22,801
I know my destiny.

944
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:25,369
I know my power.

945
00:51:25,437 --> 00:51:27,371
It's growing,

946
00:51:27,439 --> 00:51:30,374
growing every minute.

947
00:51:30,442 --> 00:51:36,380
As long as the life of that boy 
depends on my will,

948
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:39,884
it'll go on growing
and growing

949
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:43,388
until this court of yours rots.

950
00:51:43,456 --> 00:51:46,892
The Russian people and their rights!

951
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,494
Why, you pampered fool!

952
00:51:49,562 --> 00:51:54,033
Inside of a year,
in less than a year,

953
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:56,737
I will be Russia!

954
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:59,572
Do you hear that?

955
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,342
I! Rasputin!

956
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:05,345
You know, people with ambitions
like yours,

957
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:07,347
my dear father,

958
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:09,315
are sometimes rather unlucky.

959
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:10,851
Ah, indeed?

960
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,355
Yes. There was a general 
not long ago

961
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,358
who shot himself in the back.

962
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,862
No one could understand
quite how he did it.

963
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:24,698
Ah, you think I'm frightened 
by threats of murder?

964
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:28,236
Oh, murder. That's
such an ugly word.

965
00:52:29,705 --> 00:52:34,877
When the rights of 160 million 
people are at stake...

966
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,079
they call it progress.

967
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:55,731
Your highness, once more please.

968
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:03,774
Your highness, please give me
your attention.

969
00:53:03,842 --> 00:53:06,243
Now, please repeat after me.

970
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,778
Nach Frankreich...

971
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:09,346
nach...nach...

972
00:53:09,414 --> 00:53:11,348
please pay attention
to me, your highness.

973
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,716
Let him alone.

974
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:14,351
Ach, du lieber gott.

975
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:16,353
But his highness
is forgetting all his german.

976
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,322
Good! If God wanted
him to learn german,

977
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,358
he'd have been born in Germany.

978
00:53:20,426 --> 00:53:22,360
But her majesty is very much
concerned.

979
00:53:22,428 --> 00:53:24,696
Who's in charge of the boy? 
You or me?

980
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:26,998
I am in charge of his highness'
german lessons.

981
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,266
Clear out!

982
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:30,768
And I shall report this
to her majesty.

983
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:34,472
Get out, you krauthead,
you dried-up sausage.

984
00:53:36,944 --> 00:53:39,212
Your highness.

985
00:53:39,279 --> 00:53:41,714
German monkey.

986
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:48,387
What can a squirt like that
teach you, huh?

987
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:51,557
Now, where is
that thing of Remezov's

988
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:54,594
that we were looking
through the other day

989
00:53:54,662 --> 00:53:57,397
when we were watching the spider?

990
00:53:57,465 --> 00:53:59,366
The microscope?

991
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:02,836
Ha ha! Now we'll see something.

992
00:54:02,904 --> 00:54:04,838
I--I don't want to!

993
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:06,539
Come here!

994
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,880
Sit down.

995
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:15,049
Sit down.

996
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,690
Now, today we have something better 
than the spider, Aloysha--

997
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:25,659
a big fat fly.

998
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:28,163
Oh! No. It's an ant.

999
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,066
Look at him try to get away,

1000
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,869
but he can't.

1001
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,173
Now, we could kill him
just like that,

1002
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,477
but we won't.
Give me the box.

1003
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,547
Close it up.

1004
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,217
Now...

1005
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,852
here's the fly,

1006
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:54,357
a nice big fat one.
Look at him.

1007
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:58,728
He looks almost like a general,
doesn't he, Aloysha?

1008
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:04,335
All noise and patent leather,

1009
00:55:04,403 --> 00:55:06,037
open it.

1010
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:10,007
Close it. Put it there.

1011
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:17,148
Now, suppose those two
should start in fighting.

1012
00:55:17,216 --> 00:55:19,151
I don't want
to watch them fight.

1013
00:55:19,218 --> 00:55:20,485
Yes, you do.

1014
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:25,123
You're going to watch and learn.

1015
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:26,825
Look.

1016
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:32,797
Who do you think will win?

1017
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:35,368
You'd say the fly,

1018
00:55:35,436 --> 00:55:37,937
big general fly,

1019
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,473
but that little ant has power,

1020
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,476
and he knows how to use it.

1021
00:55:43,543 --> 00:55:48,014
Power is the only thing
in the world,

1022
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:52,485
but you must know
how to use it.

1023
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:54,488
Let me look at it.

1024
00:55:58,593 --> 00:56:00,995
Look. Ha ha!

1025
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:04,031
Look at the big juicy fly,

1026
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:07,101
the stupid aristocrat.
Oh, no, no, no.

1027
00:56:07,169 --> 00:56:11,139
But the ant has him.
Look.

1028
00:56:11,207 --> 00:56:14,042
See how he's moving up on the fly?

1029
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,978
The general is in for it now.

1030
00:56:17,046 --> 00:56:19,414
That's it! Look!
Look! Look! Look!

1031
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:23,918
He's fighting, but it's not going
to do him any good,

1032
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:27,423
because the ant knows
how to use power,

1033
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:30,893
and he doesn't.
Poor general.

1034
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,463
First cripple and then destroy.

1035
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:36,932
I don't want to watch!

1036
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,468
You'll watch and learn.

1037
00:56:39,536 --> 00:56:41,137
Now...

1038
00:56:41,205 --> 00:56:44,241
look! Look! Look!
He's got his wing.

1039
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:46,076
He's got the aristocrat.

1040
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:48,345
He's got the general now.

1041
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:51,048
Here. Let me look.

1042
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:53,250
He's taking him apart.

1043
00:56:53,317 --> 00:56:55,419
He's eating him up.

1044
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:59,523
Ha ha!

1045
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:04,028
That's the kind of power 
we can have, you and I,

1046
00:57:04,096 --> 00:57:07,031
if you do as I tell you.

1047
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:09,033
We can have Russia!

1048
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,535
You'll remember that?

1049
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:12,002
Yes.

1050
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:14,372
That's a good boy,

1051
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,708
a very good boy.

1052
00:57:16,776 --> 00:57:18,877
We'll have Russia,

1053
00:57:18,945 --> 00:57:21,180
you and I, Aloysha.

1054
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:26,218
You know, you're the fly,
and I'm the ant,

1055
00:57:26,286 --> 00:57:29,221
but I'll always be your friend.

1056
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:32,023
Now, let's see.
Where is Russia?

1057
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:36,729
I don't seem to be able to find it.
Where is it, Aloysha?

1058
00:57:36,797 --> 00:57:38,198
This is it!

1059
00:57:38,265 --> 00:57:39,932
Ha ha! That's it!

1060
00:57:44,638 --> 00:57:47,407
Spin it! Ha ha! Russia!

1061
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:52,746
What do you want?

1062
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:55,749
Thought I'd find out
what was so amusing.

1063
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:58,051
We were laughing about the duma.

1064
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,653
What's happened about it?

1065
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:02,656
I thought it was
to be signed today.

1066
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:06,026
Never mind that.
This is more important.

1067
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:07,729
Hello, Aloysha.

1068
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:12,334
Little lieutenant.

1069
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:14,503
Look at me.

1070
00:58:17,173 --> 00:58:20,842
Aloysha, it's Paul.

1071
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:23,246
Aloysha!

1072
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:34,557
What damnable thing is this?

1073
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:38,194
It isn't my fault
that he doesn't like you.

1074
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:41,698
You've done something to his mind.

1075
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:45,235
Aloysha, what's he done to you?

1076
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:47,737
Tell me.

1077
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:49,739
We'll go to your mother.

1078
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:52,442
Do you think she'd believe you?

1079
00:58:54,813 --> 00:58:57,682
You filthy swine!

1080
00:58:57,749 --> 00:59:01,686
Meddling in politics
is one thing...

1081
00:59:01,753 --> 00:59:04,656
but if you've tampered
with this boy's soul--

1082
00:59:04,723 --> 00:59:05,956
let me alone.

1083
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:08,025
What have you done to him?!

1084
00:59:08,093 --> 00:59:09,060
Paul!

1085
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:14,165
Majesty, Aloysha--
look at him!

1086
00:59:14,234 --> 00:59:16,202
What's the matter with him?

1087
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:17,703
Ah, he's frightened,
naturally.

1088
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,205
It's all right, my boy.

1089
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:20,706
Go to your mother.

1090
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:23,209
Don't be afraid. 
He won't hurt me.

1091
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:24,710
Look at his eyes.

1092
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:26,712
What's the matter with his eyes?

1093
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:29,715
Is it because he wasn't glad
to see you?

1094
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:32,419
What do you say to your mother,
Aloysha?

1095
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,355
I love you, Mamushka.

1096
00:59:35,423 --> 00:59:36,856
I love you, darling.

1097
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:39,892
Majesty, a moment ago, he was 
different, shockingly different!

1098
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,762
Is it because he didn't want
you to maul him?

1099
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,264
He hurt me!
Aloysha!

1100
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:45,765
Then he said he'd kill

1101
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,101
father Grishka.

1102
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,603
Aloysha, that isn't true!

1103
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:51,138
He didn't mean it.
I knew that.

1104
00:59:51,206 --> 00:59:52,607
Paul, you didn't say that!

1105
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,609
Majesty, may I say one thing?

1106
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:56,143
Paul...

1107
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:59,079
there is nothing to be said.

1108
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:01,282
Please leave us.

1109
01:00:20,437 --> 01:00:22,004
Is this father Rasputin's flat?

1110
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:24,340
Come in. Sit down.
I'll get to you later.

1111
01:00:24,408 --> 01:00:25,541
Tonia.

1112
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:27,209
I've sent him word,
your honor.

1113
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:29,211
He said he can't make
a minister out of a miser.

1114
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,713
If he will just read--

1115
01:00:30,781 --> 01:00:32,214
take your turn, colonel.

1116
01:00:32,283 --> 01:00:35,217
My lady would like to see father
Rasputin at once.

1117
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:38,220
Yes. Would she? So would a lot 
of other pretty squabs.

1118
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,724
Listen here, then.
My mistress is Natalia,

1119
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,693
lady-in-waiting to the empress.

1120
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,728
Why didn't you tell me? Pardon.

1121
01:00:44,796 --> 01:00:46,196
Your highness.

1122
01:00:46,264 --> 01:00:49,232
There are so many of the other 
kind come here.

1123
01:00:49,301 --> 01:00:50,734
I didn't know.

1124
01:00:50,802 --> 01:00:53,236
Come inside, your highness,
and I'll tell him.

1125
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:55,206
I won't be a moment.

1126
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:58,142
Father was going to get 
my brother out of jail.

1127
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,679
He'll take care of that. 
Come inside, your highness.

1128
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:02,046
Tonia, please!

1129
01:01:08,387 --> 01:01:10,188
Father, let me touch--

1130
01:01:10,256 --> 01:01:12,191
Natalia's here.

1131
01:01:12,258 --> 01:01:14,159
My daughter.

1132
01:01:17,263 --> 01:01:18,831
What's she doing here? 

1133
01:01:18,898 --> 01:01:20,265
My daughter.

1134
01:01:20,334 --> 01:01:23,001
This way, my daughter.

1135
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:26,205
Blessed among women,
this is the way of holiness!

1136
01:01:26,273 --> 01:01:28,208
Children happy in their faith.

1137
01:01:28,275 --> 01:01:30,444
Father, I must talk to you.

1138
01:01:30,511 --> 01:01:34,548
There's something troubling me 
that I must know now.

1139
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:37,551
Why do you always bless
the young and pretty ones?

1140
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:41,355
Listen to me. If you keep this up, 
I'll break your thick skull.

1141
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,227
Father!

1142
01:01:46,294 --> 01:01:49,731
I hope you weren't upset by 
those simple people.

1143
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:52,099
You look anxious, my daughter.

1144
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:58,373
Father, I'm sorry to intrude on you
like this, but--

1145
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,675
no, thank you.
I have to warn you.

1146
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:02,478
Your life may be in danger.

1147
01:02:02,545 --> 01:02:04,179
My life?

1148
01:02:04,247 --> 01:02:06,281
Chegodieff.

1149
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:07,883
Yes, but don't tell him.

1150
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,185
It's because I love him
that I came here, so that
nothing will happen.

1151
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:13,021
Nothing is going to happen,
my daughter.

1152
01:02:13,089 --> 01:02:15,023
Let me take your coat.

1153
01:02:15,091 --> 01:02:16,658
You're going to get cold.

1154
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,194
No, really, I--

1155
01:02:18,262 --> 01:02:21,197
oh, I see.
My home is too humble.

1156
01:02:21,265 --> 01:02:22,699
Oh, please.

1157
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:24,200
That's better.

1158
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:26,202
I've been so terribly worried.

1159
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,704
Well, don't be.

1160
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:31,207
They've had many a go at me--
these aristocrats.

1161
01:02:31,275 --> 01:02:34,677
They can't stomach
the power God has given me.

1162
01:02:34,746 --> 01:02:37,715
I see through them
and their little schemes.

1163
01:02:37,783 --> 01:02:40,718
But it isn't Paul's fault. They've 
poisoned his mind against you.

1164
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:42,720
He was never like this before.

1165
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:45,723
Who is it?

1166
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:47,224
Tonia.

1167
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:49,226
He'll see eventually,
but be careful.

1168
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:50,728
Yes. Don't worry.

1169
01:02:50,797 --> 01:02:53,231
Nobody's going to kill me.
Nobody can.

1170
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:57,969
Excuse me. I'll see what
it is she wants.

1171
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:03,174
What are you pounding
on the door for?

1172
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,677
Grishka,
prince Chegodieff.

1173
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:07,145
What about him?

1174
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:09,181
He insists on seeing you.

1175
01:03:09,249 --> 01:03:11,317
Grishka,
he means trouble.

1176
01:03:11,384 --> 01:03:14,554
Take him up the back way
to the kitchen.

1177
01:03:17,257 --> 01:03:19,425
Hey. Psst. 
You there in the corner.

1178
01:03:19,493 --> 01:03:21,894
I can see you.

1179
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:32,205
Can you see all right?

1180
01:03:32,273 --> 01:03:33,907
Yes, thank you.

1181
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:40,213
It isn't much like your house,
is it, prince?

1182
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:42,215
Smells a little differently.

1183
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:44,185
This way, your excellency.

1184
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:46,220
This way.

1185
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:56,230
You know, my neck is black and blue
where you choked me.

1186
01:03:56,298 --> 01:03:58,265
Ha ha!

1187
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,671
You want to shake hands?

1188
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,139
I'm willing.

1189
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,842
Sorry. I haven't my gloves on.

1190
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:13,682
Oh, still, you must 
have some reason

1191
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:17,686
for honoring my humble flat.

1192
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:25,061
Are you looking for someone?

1193
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:29,766
You.

1194
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:31,200
Do you remember--

1195
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:34,037
I told you once something about
progress?

1196
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:35,540
I meant it.

1197
01:04:37,976 --> 01:04:39,276
This is for Russia.

1198
01:04:39,344 --> 01:04:40,411
Grab him!

1199
01:04:43,448 --> 01:04:45,082
I couldn't have missed him.

1200
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,685
What's that shooting?
What has happened?

1201
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,720
He tried to kill me,

1202
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:52,724
but there's a power
watching over me

1203
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,593
stronger than any bullet.

1204
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:57,128
That power won't
help you next time.

1205
01:04:57,196 --> 01:04:59,297
I'll aim at your head.

1206
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,501
Tell your superiors
they can find me

1207
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,137
at the barracks 
of the chevalier guards.

1208
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:09,609
Next time.

1209
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,686
Go back,
my children. Go back.

1210
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:21,688
I want to be alone.

1211
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:24,691
Go back.
Go back. Go back.

1212
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,660
Never mind him.

1213
01:05:26,728 --> 01:05:28,696
A miracle has been performed.

1214
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:30,130
Alleluia!

1215
01:05:30,198 --> 01:05:31,699
A miracle.

1216
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:34,668
Has he gone?

1217
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:35,869
Yes.

1218
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:37,370
A great miracle.

1219
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:40,841
Look here, I'll report 
this little affair, not you.

1220
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,376
You understand?

1221
01:05:42,444 --> 01:05:43,745
Yes.

1222
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,583
Go on. Get out.

1223
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:56,791
There he goes, Tonia.

1224
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,729
That fella Chegodieff isn't
afraid of anything.

1225
01:05:59,796 --> 01:06:02,197
I've got to get rid of him.

1226
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:04,734
Are you sure you're not hurt,
Grishka?

1227
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:07,236
No. This was a good idea, though.

1228
01:06:07,303 --> 01:06:10,239
That first bullet almost knocked 
the wind out of me.

1229
01:06:10,306 --> 01:06:12,241
It might have killed you.

1230
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:13,743
It might, indeed.

1231
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:16,246
I couldn't have died now, Tonia,

1232
01:06:16,313 --> 01:06:18,749
just as I'm within
reach of everything.

1233
01:06:18,816 --> 01:06:20,717
There's going to be a war.

1234
01:06:20,785 --> 01:06:23,219
Do you realize that,
old cabbage-face?

1235
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:25,255
There's going to be a war.

1236
01:06:25,322 --> 01:06:28,258
Napoleon needed a war.
Well, I've got one.

1237
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:32,362
I wonder if you know what a great 
man you're with, Tonia.

1238
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:35,767
Why don't you go
to the Czar right now?

1239
01:06:35,834 --> 01:06:39,270
Oh, one thing at a time,
old cabbage-face.

1240
01:06:39,337 --> 01:06:41,739
This whole little story here

1241
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:44,976
will fit a much better occasion.

1242
01:06:56,022 --> 01:06:57,656
Keep them up.

1243
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:01,060
I heard a shot.

1244
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:02,561
Yes, my daughter.

1245
01:07:02,628 --> 01:07:04,229
It was Paul.

1246
01:07:49,678 --> 01:07:51,079
My daughter...

1247
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:54,783
this concerns Aloysha.

1248
01:07:54,852 --> 01:07:57,720
His life may depend on it.

1249
01:07:59,123 --> 01:08:00,757
Come with me.

1250
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:05,225
Continue the review until the end.

1251
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:08,028
General staff will follow me.

1252
01:09:16,904 --> 01:09:18,404
Nicky, what is it?

1253
01:09:18,473 --> 01:09:21,742
Our cousin Wilhelm has ordered me 
to demobilize under penalty of war.

1254
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,744
What are you going to do?

1255
01:09:23,812 --> 01:09:26,714
Everything in my power to save
Europe from this insanity.

1256
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,249
God grant you wisdom.

1257
01:09:28,317 --> 01:09:29,717
Amen.

1258
01:09:29,784 --> 01:09:33,287
I'll do all I can
with honor.

1259
01:09:33,355 --> 01:09:35,089
I'll meet the general staff
in my study.

1260
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:41,897
I've just spoken
with the ambassador.

1261
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:44,532
He's sure that England will be 
in accord but can make no promises.

1262
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,269
El pankore will be at sea
for two more days.

1263
01:09:47,337 --> 01:09:49,771
The Kaiser has chosen an awkward 
moment for his ultimatum.

1264
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,406
Gentlemen.

1265
01:09:51,475 --> 01:09:53,276
Germany demands that we demobilize.

1266
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:55,778
Our refusal may lead to war.

1267
01:09:55,846 --> 01:09:58,714
We have a terrible
responsibility to face.

1268
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:03,219
I beg you not to let passion or mistaken 
patriotism color your judgment.

1269
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,189
The peace of europe rests with us.

1270
01:10:06,257 --> 01:10:09,225
I have preserved it for 30 years.

1271
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:11,428
We must keep it now.

1272
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:14,698
Your majesty, may I suggest

1273
01:10:14,766 --> 01:10:17,734
that the best way to preserve peace
at this present moment

1274
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:20,737
is to show germany that we are 
ready to enforce peace?

1275
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:22,739
I agree with the minister of war.

1276
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:24,375
So do I.

1277
01:10:24,442 --> 01:10:27,611
If we demobilize, Austria will 
take  it as a sign that we're

1278
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,747
going to stand weakly by while
she crushes Serbia.

1279
01:10:29,815 --> 01:10:31,749
Instead of preventing a war,
we cause one.

1280
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:36,254
But if we demobilize, it  might remove 
all the tension from the situation.

1281
01:10:36,322 --> 01:10:40,225
It may move this crisis back to 
the balkans, where it belongs.

1282
01:10:40,293 --> 01:10:42,260
Serbia's case could be arbitrated.

1283
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:43,729
No, your majesty.

1284
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:47,766
It is quite obvious what your 
inferior cousin is doing.

1285
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:49,735
Germany is holding Austria's coat

1286
01:10:49,803 --> 01:10:51,437
while Serbia is destroyed.

1287
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:53,772
This impudent ultimatum is a bluff 
to keep us from interfering

1288
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,374
with the murder of a nation.

1289
01:10:55,442 --> 01:10:57,276
The Kaiser's not inclined to bluff.

1290
01:10:57,344 --> 01:11:00,212
It will cost us a million men
to find that out.

1291
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,216
Now you're overrating
the germans a bit.

1292
01:11:03,284 --> 01:11:06,586
If I remember rightly, you, at one 
time underrated the japanese.

1293
01:11:06,654 --> 01:11:09,222
Berlin is on the telephone now,
awaiting our decision.

1294
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,024
What possible choice have we?

1295
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:14,561
Your majesty, I don't see how 
we can turn our backs now.

1296
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:16,563
We are pledged to protect serbia.

1297
01:11:16,631 --> 01:11:17,932
Surely.

1298
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,234
We're also pledged to protect Russia,
your excellency.

1299
01:11:20,302 --> 01:11:22,203
I have seen germany's army.

1300
01:11:22,271 --> 01:11:25,573
With all respect to your ministry,
sir,

1301
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,175
we are not prepared.

1302
01:11:30,612 --> 01:11:34,615
You're not in the best position
to know, colonel.

1303
01:11:36,652 --> 01:11:40,755
Gentlemen, the consequences
of whatever we may decide here

1304
01:11:40,823 --> 01:11:45,227
are more than I can face
without the help of God.

1305
01:11:45,295 --> 01:11:48,497
I wish to be alone for a moment.

1306
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:21,232
My son...

1307
01:12:21,299 --> 01:12:25,903
I know everything that's
in your heart.

1308
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:28,907
It is very heavy.

1309
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:31,910
Because you're not
in the will of God.

1310
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:35,780
Why do you want to
bow to the Kaiser?

1311
01:12:37,316 --> 01:12:39,217
Why do you say that?

1312
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:41,253
Your eyes are full of it.

1313
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:43,756
My son, if you
follow this course,

1314
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:46,225
it will be the end of Russia.

1315
01:12:46,293 --> 01:12:48,761
You know the Kaiser's
ambitions in the east.

1316
01:12:48,828 --> 01:12:50,763
This is the first step.

1317
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,766
The next, the turks will
close up the black sea.

1318
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:56,902
Father, I need your spiritual advice 
more than your political opinions.

1319
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:58,872
But you yourself have told me,

1320
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,709
a gun is pointing toward Russia.

1321
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:06,213
I felt that something
led me here.

1322
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:12,219
Besides healing Aloysha, I've been 
ordained to save his throne.

1323
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:16,223
Be firm, and it will endure forever.

1324
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:20,695
Tell the Kaiser that you remain 
the protector of the weak,

1325
01:13:20,762 --> 01:13:23,698
that you are still the Czar.

1326
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:25,900
Out of the way.

1327
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:30,238
Forgive this interruption,
your majesty,

1328
01:13:30,307 --> 01:13:31,740
but circumstances justify it.

1329
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:34,243
Your foreign minister has
just received

1330
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:35,711
another demand from berlin,

1331
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,746
and you are with the man

1332
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:39,748
whose advice has created
the situation,

1333
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:42,251
the man that was undermining
your government.

1334
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:44,253
What is the meaning of this?

1335
01:13:44,321 --> 01:13:47,223
Your majesty, this man wishes
Russia to go to war.

1336
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,726
This means the destruction
of your country,

1337
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:51,761
the end of your dynasty.

1338
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:53,730
Your advisers will
tell you otherwise

1339
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:56,266
because they no longer are
your advisers.

1340
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,201
All the people devoted to you,

1341
01:13:58,269 --> 01:14:00,703
all the people
loyal to you are gone.

1342
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:02,672
These men are his creatures.

1343
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,707
There are limits to my friendship,
prince.

1344
01:14:04,776 --> 01:14:07,711
No, no, my son.
You must hear him out.

1345
01:14:07,779 --> 01:14:11,715
If I am all he accuses me of being, 
I don't deserve your trust.

1346
01:14:11,783 --> 01:14:13,851
Let us have the truth.

1347
01:14:13,918 --> 01:14:17,221
I say that he is
plunging us into war,

1348
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:19,223
but you must decide.

1349
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:22,726
By what right do you burst in here 
with these reckless accusations?

1350
01:14:22,795 --> 01:14:26,231
By the same right, sir, that I went 
to his flat last night

1351
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:28,233
and tried to kill him,

1352
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:31,203
the right every man
has to protect his country

1353
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:32,737
against her enemies.

1354
01:14:32,805 --> 01:14:34,239
You did what?!

1355
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:37,242
Sir, I was hoping today you'd 
be signing my death warrant,

1356
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:39,744
that I'd be dead, but so would he,

1357
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:43,716
and the nightmare of this holy 
leech would be over forever.

1358
01:14:43,784 --> 01:14:46,219
Yes. Yes, he tried to kill me.

1359
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:48,254
Why didn't you come to me?

1360
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:49,722
With all your burdens?

1361
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,725
If God sent me here
to save Aloysha,

1362
01:14:52,793 --> 01:14:54,760
surely he can protect me.

1363
01:14:54,829 --> 01:15:02,203
You knew Aloysha's life 
depended on him.

1364
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:05,206
And they could play their 
little game undisturbed.

1365
01:15:05,273 --> 01:15:06,674
Isn't that it?

1366
01:15:06,741 --> 01:15:09,210
Sir, you know I love Aloysha.

1367
01:15:09,277 --> 01:15:12,213
Why do you want him to die?

1368
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:13,715
I don't,

1369
01:15:13,782 --> 01:15:18,220
but I'd rather see him dead 
than what you've made him.

1370
01:15:18,287 --> 01:15:20,722
Above everything on earth,

1371
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:22,924
I love my son.

1372
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,728
I thought you did.

1373
01:15:26,795 --> 01:15:29,264
Oh, sir, in all sincerity,

1374
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:31,734
it was as much for Aloysha
as for Russia.

1375
01:15:31,801 --> 01:15:34,036
I have never questioned
your sincerity.

1376
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:35,571
I do, your sanity.

1377
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:38,073
I have been swayed 
by many influences,

1378
01:15:38,141 --> 01:15:41,043
but one influence has never swayed me--

1379
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:44,747
attempts to assassinate my advisers, 
my family, or myself.

1380
01:15:44,814 --> 01:15:48,150
Your resignation is accepted.

1381
01:15:48,219 --> 01:15:50,954
Well, what are you
waiting for?

1382
01:16:10,342 --> 01:16:13,778
God moves in a mysterious way.

1383
01:16:13,845 --> 01:16:16,281
You wouldn't have believed me.

1384
01:16:16,348 --> 01:16:19,784
He had to reveal himself.

1385
01:16:19,852 --> 01:16:22,788
Now you know your enemies.

1386
01:16:22,855 --> 01:16:24,757
Go, my son.

1387
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:27,326
Protect holy Russia.

1388
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:16,110
Chevalier guards.

1389
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:08,466
Attention!

1390
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:20,780
Alix, am I right in going?

1391
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:22,247
Yes, my dear.

1392
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:25,785
Yes, but taking over
the entire command--

1393
01:18:25,852 --> 01:18:28,287
the responsibility frightens me.

1394
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:31,757
Others are better
trained for war.

1395
01:18:31,825 --> 01:18:34,760
I have no stomach for the slaughter.

1396
01:18:34,829 --> 01:18:37,798
But you must remember what 
father Rasputin said.

1397
01:18:37,865 --> 01:18:42,068
It is only you who can give
Russia courage.

1398
01:18:44,872 --> 01:18:46,506
Yes.

1399
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:51,778
You'll write to me when you can?

1400
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:53,514
Every day.

1401
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:57,452
Look out for metchnikoff.

1402
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,456
Our friend doesn't trust him.

1403
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:07,394
I used to think all the men 
around me were loyal...

1404
01:19:07,464 --> 01:19:09,431
before he opened my eyes.

1405
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:11,433
Had to be done,
Nicky.

1406
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:13,401
I know.

1407
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:17,773
Ever since, I haven't
liked the taste of my heart.

1408
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:24,513
Yes?

1409
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:28,284
It's 9:30,
your majesty.

1410
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,653
I'm coming immediately.

1411
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:38,461
Good-bye, beloved.

1412
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:40,497
Not yet, Alix.

1413
01:19:49,207 --> 01:19:51,642
Fight well, my emperor.

1414
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,611
Alix dear.

1415
01:19:53,678 --> 01:19:55,312
Fear God...

1416
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,114
and no one else.

1417
01:20:05,658 --> 01:20:07,291
Hurry back to me.

1418
01:20:39,226 --> 01:20:42,796
Tell me, Aloysha, how does 
your father sit in this chair?

1419
01:20:42,864 --> 01:20:45,265
Does he put his elbows on it,

1420
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:47,300
or does he sit like this?

1421
01:20:47,368 --> 01:20:50,470
You better not let papa 
know you sat in his chair.

1422
01:20:50,539 --> 01:20:52,139
He'd be terribly upset.

1423
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:55,309
There are a lot of people
in Tobolsk

1424
01:20:55,377 --> 01:20:57,745
who'd like to see me now.

1425
01:20:57,813 --> 01:21:00,615
I was hungry and cold there.

1426
01:21:03,986 --> 01:21:06,120
Come here, my child.

1427
01:21:07,824 --> 01:21:09,191
Come here.

1428
01:21:09,258 --> 01:21:10,926
Come here.

1429
01:21:18,101 --> 01:21:22,004
You seem afraid of me lately. Why?

1430
01:21:23,474 --> 01:21:26,977
Aloysha, go and find your sister.

1431
01:21:28,512 --> 01:21:32,115
Take--take Anastasia with you.

1432
01:21:32,182 --> 01:21:34,618
I want to see Olga, too.

1433
01:21:34,685 --> 01:21:38,454
No, no. There's something I have
to tell you first.

1434
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,659
Well, go on!

1435
01:21:47,365 --> 01:21:49,333
What is it, father?

1436
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:54,304
I heard you went
to the hospital the other day.

1437
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:55,773
Yes, father.

1438
01:21:55,842 --> 01:21:57,743
What did you see there?

1439
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,746
Mother and I talked to a boy.

1440
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:04,716
The first day he was at the front, 
he lost both his hands.

1441
01:22:04,784 --> 01:22:06,885
Oh.

1442
01:22:06,953 --> 01:22:10,122
And he was so brave and beautiful.

1443
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,128
Do you like beautiful boys?

1444
01:22:15,195 --> 01:22:17,864
I don't know what you mean.

1445
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:19,265
That's all right.

1446
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:23,469
It's perfectly natural for a girl
to think of boys.

1447
01:22:25,472 --> 01:22:29,175
You must never be
ashamed of life, my dear.

1448
01:22:29,243 --> 01:22:31,779
Never.

1449
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,782
I don't want to be rude, father,

1450
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,284
but I haven't done my lessons,

1451
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:40,253
so if you have
anything to tell me--

1452
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:44,158
I've got something
for you...

1453
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,794
a little locket...

1454
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,298
a holy image

1455
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:52,801
to wear around your neck.

1456
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:55,670
Father, I don't know if I should.

1457
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:58,740
Ah, you see, you
are afraid of me.

1458
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:00,241
No, father.

1459
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:03,244
Yes, you are,
and you mustn't be.

1460
01:23:03,313 --> 01:23:06,248
Your mother wouldn't like
that, would she?

1461
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:07,750
No.

1462
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:12,254
No. Well, then you must be
a lot nicer to me.

1463
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:13,756
Now...

1464
01:23:13,824 --> 01:23:16,625
you put this around your neck...

1465
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:23,766
and every day you wear it,
you'll be blessed.

1466
01:23:23,835 --> 01:23:28,772
Wear it next to your warm
little heart.

1467
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,776
It's beating so fast.

1468
01:23:32,844 --> 01:23:34,778
You know...

1469
01:23:34,846 --> 01:23:37,781
it reminds me of a little bird

1470
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,785
I once held in my hand.

1471
01:23:40,853 --> 01:23:43,788
It was so afraid I'd hurt it,

1472
01:23:43,856 --> 01:23:45,790
but I didn't.

1473
01:23:48,326 --> 01:23:52,296
That's all I wanted to say to you.

1474
01:23:52,364 --> 01:23:54,265
Thank you, father.

1475
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:56,769
Maria, it's your bedtime.

1476
01:24:08,314 --> 01:24:10,249
Good night, father.

1477
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:12,952
Good night, my little doves.

1478
01:24:53,662 --> 01:24:55,797
Aah!

1479
01:24:58,034 --> 01:24:59,734
Maria.

1480
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:02,237
Darling, what is it?

1481
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,739
Oh, Natasha.

1482
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,708
My darling, what's the matter?

1483
01:25:05,775 --> 01:25:07,243
I don't know.

1484
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:10,779
I felt as if
someone touched me.

1485
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:12,915
What was it?

1486
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:15,417
Nothing. It was just a bad dream.

1487
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,886
You look so frightened.

1488
01:25:16,954 --> 01:25:19,388
No. You go to sleep again.

1489
01:25:19,457 --> 01:25:20,991
Close your eyes.

1490
01:25:21,059 --> 01:25:23,260
I'll be here if you want me.

1491
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,761
Good night, my lamb.

1492
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:26,230
Good night, Tasha.

1493
01:25:26,297 --> 01:25:27,764
I love you.

1494
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:29,466
I love you.

1495
01:25:56,562 --> 01:25:58,130
Get out!

1496
01:26:03,536 --> 01:26:04,970
Where are you going?

1497
01:26:05,038 --> 01:26:06,438
The empress!

1498
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:31,132
Open your eyes!

1499
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,834
Now...can you hear me?

1500
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:36,170
Can you hear me?

1501
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:38,672
You're so far away, Natasha.

1502
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:41,342
You are so far away.

1503
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:45,779
You're whirling
up in the sky, Natasha.

1504
01:26:45,848 --> 01:26:48,383
Up in the sky!

1505
01:26:48,451 --> 01:26:51,820
And there's nothing
to remember anymore.

1506
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:54,656
Nothing to remember.

1507
01:26:54,723 --> 01:26:57,459
Look, Natasha.

1508
01:26:57,526 --> 01:26:58,994
Look!

1509
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:07,470
There's only one star left
in all that black sky.

1510
01:27:07,537 --> 01:27:11,474
It's getting bigger
and bigger.

1511
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:13,843
It's going to hit us!

1512
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:18,849
Now it's going away,

1513
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:24,488
millions and millions
of miles away,

1514
01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:27,324
and you're floating after.

1515
01:27:27,392 --> 01:27:29,759
Keep following it, Natasha.

1516
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,396
Keep following it,

1517
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:37,002
or you'll float forever
in the cold.

1518
01:27:37,069 --> 01:27:39,337
Keep looking, Natasha.

1519
01:27:39,405 --> 01:27:41,973
I must leave you now.

1520
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:47,645
Keep looking, or you'll be 
lost forever in the dark.

1521
01:27:49,249 --> 01:27:52,051
Keep looking at the star, 
Natasha.

1522
01:27:52,119 --> 01:27:55,988
Keep looking.
Keep looking.

1523
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,476
Father, you frightened me.

1524
01:28:16,544 --> 01:28:19,312
I was, uh...

1525
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,814
talking to Natasha,

1526
01:28:21,882 --> 01:28:24,384
and she fell asleep.

1527
01:28:28,023 --> 01:28:30,525
What is the candelabra
doing on the floor?

1528
01:28:30,592 --> 01:28:31,926
Oh.

1529
01:28:31,993 --> 01:28:36,664
Um, back in Siberia on the night 
of the feast of St. John,

1530
01:28:36,731 --> 01:28:39,667
we used to light fires
in the forest

1531
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:41,335
and jump over them

1532
01:28:41,404 --> 01:28:47,008
so that our praises would rise 
to heaven on wings of flame.

1533
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:49,511
I was showing Natasha.

1534
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:52,514
If we could only
worship as simply.

1535
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:56,318
Poor child. She's done 10 women's 
work in the hospital.

1536
01:28:56,386 --> 01:28:58,753
Yes. Did the Czar get off all right?

1537
01:28:58,822 --> 01:29:00,256
Yes. He's worried.

1538
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:03,359
Ah. That's what's going to save
Russia--the Czar.

1539
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:05,928
One authority.
One responsibility.

1540
01:29:05,996 --> 01:29:08,965
And one blame. But he won't fail.

1541
01:29:09,032 --> 01:29:11,601
No, no.
Of course he won't.

1542
01:29:11,668 --> 01:29:14,804
Why don't you get some sleep,
my daughter?

1543
01:29:14,872 --> 01:29:17,641
You look tired.

1544
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:19,610
I am tired, father.

1545
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:21,845
Good night, my daughter.

1546
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:25,249
I wouldn't disturb her.

1547
01:29:25,317 --> 01:29:26,783
But she can't stay here.

1548
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:30,954
I'll watch her.
It's dangerous to awaken
anyone by candlelight.

1549
01:29:31,023 --> 01:29:33,158
Her eyes are open.

1550
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:34,792
She's rigid!

1551
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,629
It's just a deep sleep,
that's all.

1552
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:38,663
Something's the matter.

1553
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:40,665
No, no.
Nothing the matter.

1554
01:29:40,733 --> 01:29:42,000
Nothing the matter.

1555
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:43,335
Going to the empress.

1556
01:29:43,402 --> 01:29:45,337
Are you dreaming, my child?

1557
01:29:45,404 --> 01:29:46,571
I'm going to the--

1558
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,006
I'm here.

1559
01:29:55,215 --> 01:29:56,516
Majesty!

1560
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:57,916
Natasha,
my child.

1561
01:29:57,984 --> 01:29:59,452
What's the matter?

1562
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,954
He...

1563
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,789
he was going
into Maria's room.

1564
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:04,823
What?

1565
01:30:04,892 --> 01:30:05,959
I found him.

1566
01:30:06,027 --> 01:30:06,960
Natasha!

1567
01:30:07,028 --> 01:30:08,262
He went to Maria's room.
I saw him!

1568
01:30:08,329 --> 01:30:09,396
That's a lie.

1569
01:30:09,464 --> 01:30:10,797
Natasha has never lied.

1570
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:14,968
Majesty, on my honor.
I'll kill him! I will!

1571
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,537
Natasha!

1572
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:25,346
Well?

1573
01:30:30,819 --> 01:30:32,487
Forgive me.

1574
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:42,464
Once I saw you watching the Czar.

1575
01:30:42,532 --> 01:30:44,567
I should have known.

1576
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:52,675
One moment.

1577
01:30:52,742 --> 01:30:57,446
Before you call your guards,
listen to me.

1578
01:30:57,515 --> 01:30:59,115
Stand aside.

1579
01:30:59,183 --> 01:31:01,618
All right! Call them.

1580
01:31:01,686 --> 01:31:07,624
I'd like to see your face the 1st time 
one of your faithful palace guards

1581
01:31:07,692 --> 01:31:11,194
dares to disobey you.

1582
01:31:11,262 --> 01:31:15,798
Then you'll find out
why put lubov in command,

1583
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:19,403
why Sturmer is my foreign minister.

1584
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:23,140
Valenka and Vassiliev
and baron Krassin

1585
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:26,244
and all the rest of them
got their posts through me.

1586
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:29,813
Send off a telegram to the Czar. 
Ha!

1587
01:31:29,882 --> 01:31:31,650
He won't get it.

1588
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:35,654
Try to go out yourself
and see what happens.

1589
01:31:35,722 --> 01:31:40,992
I've got Russia just where 
I want her.

1590
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:42,994
Do you hear me?

1591
01:31:43,062 --> 01:31:46,998
I am the Czar of all the Russias.

1592
01:31:47,067 --> 01:31:49,335
Get out of here.

1593
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,371
Gladly.

1594
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,643
My flat is the royal palace,

1595
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:59,812
and it has been for 6 months.

1596
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:06,953
If you want any little favors,
call on me.

1597
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,790
Good night, your majesty.

1598
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:11,458
Sleep well.

1599
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,841
Paul.

1600
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,279
We must find Paul.

1601
01:32:47,096 --> 01:32:48,664
Maria, look!

1602
01:32:48,732 --> 01:32:49,632
Oh, Paul.

1603
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,633
Why, Paul!

1604
01:32:50,701 --> 01:32:53,001
Oh, I'm glad to see you.

1605
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,504
We all are.

1606
01:32:54,572 --> 01:32:56,172
Thank you, sir.

1607
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,607
Where's Natasha?

1608
01:32:57,675 --> 01:32:58,742
I'll get her for you.

1609
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:00,777
Wait, your highness.

1610
01:33:00,845 --> 01:33:02,979
We have plenty to do here.

1611
01:33:13,992 --> 01:33:15,926
Natasha.

1612
01:33:15,994 --> 01:33:18,629
Oh, I'm sorry.

1613
01:33:18,697 --> 01:33:20,965
I've just finished.

1614
01:33:21,032 --> 01:33:22,967
Are you all right now?

1615
01:33:23,034 --> 01:33:26,571
May I take her away from you
a minute, old man?

1616
01:33:39,218 --> 01:33:40,486
Oh, Natasha.

1617
01:33:40,553 --> 01:33:43,288
There's no one else in the world 
here but us.

1618
01:33:43,357 --> 01:33:44,824
When you sent for me,

1619
01:33:44,892 --> 01:33:46,325
I felt as if a cold stone

1620
01:33:46,394 --> 01:33:47,994
had been rolled from my heart.

1621
01:33:48,061 --> 01:33:49,496
My brain stopped aching.

1622
01:33:49,563 --> 01:33:50,997
I could breathe again.

1623
01:33:51,064 --> 01:33:52,866
I...

1624
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:54,868
I didn't send for you.

1625
01:33:54,935 --> 01:33:56,836
They said you wanted to see me.

1626
01:33:56,904 --> 01:33:58,237
It was the empress.

1627
01:33:58,305 --> 01:34:00,106
Oh.

1628
01:34:00,174 --> 01:34:01,442
Natasha!

1629
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:04,111
How long is this thing
going on between us--

1630
01:34:04,178 --> 01:34:06,447
this thing that's tearing
our hearts apart?

1631
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:08,449
Please don't, Paul.

1632
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:11,251
Listen, dear,
I'm going away.

1633
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:12,753
Where?

1634
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:14,622
Now, you see?
You do love me.

1635
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:17,124
Listen, darling,
there are lots of other armies.

1636
01:34:17,192 --> 01:34:19,327
I can still be fighting
for Russia,

1637
01:34:19,395 --> 01:34:21,129
and we'll be together.

1638
01:34:21,196 --> 01:34:22,464
No.

1639
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:24,466
You did love me, Natasha.

1640
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:26,835
Don't you love me anymore?

1641
01:34:26,903 --> 01:34:28,336
I do, Paul.

1642
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:30,104
Then come with me.

1643
01:34:30,172 --> 01:34:31,473
No.

1644
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,608
Is it something I've done?

1645
01:34:33,677 --> 01:34:35,144
No.

1646
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,946
Please don't ask me anymore.

1647
01:34:37,013 --> 01:34:40,817
Then what is it?
I have a right to know.

1648
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:43,820
You told me what he was.

1649
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,155
I should have known.

1650
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:50,793
I thought you were persecuting
a man of God...

1651
01:34:50,862 --> 01:34:52,529
but I found out.

1652
01:35:02,674 --> 01:35:05,976
Go back to the empress now.
She needs you.

1653
01:35:07,513 --> 01:35:08,947
I must go back.

1654
01:35:27,534 --> 01:35:28,667
Come in.

1655
01:35:31,371 --> 01:35:32,738
Paul!

1656
01:35:32,806 --> 01:35:35,774
I never was so glad
to see anyone.

1657
01:35:35,842 --> 01:35:36,809
Majesty.

1658
01:35:36,877 --> 01:35:38,343
Sit down.

1659
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,981
I need you.

1660
01:35:42,049 --> 01:35:43,650
Yes, your majesty?

1661
01:35:43,718 --> 01:35:45,151
I've injured you,

1662
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:47,153
but I've injured
Russia more.

1663
01:35:47,221 --> 01:35:51,491
Your majesty,
I know how much you love Russia.

1664
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:53,693
Everything in your heart,

1665
01:35:53,761 --> 01:35:56,329
everything that you've done--

1666
01:35:56,397 --> 01:35:58,999
you thought was
for Russia's good.

1667
01:35:59,067 --> 01:36:02,537
My heart...
is broken.

1668
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,373
What are we to do?

1669
01:36:09,578 --> 01:36:12,179
I think I know...

1670
01:36:12,247 --> 01:36:15,349
precisely what to do,

1671
01:36:15,418 --> 01:36:17,052
your majesty.

1672
01:36:24,427 --> 01:36:25,861
Aloysha.

1673
01:36:25,929 --> 01:36:28,329
I can't believe
that Aloysha's life

1674
01:36:28,397 --> 01:36:31,066
is the price of Russia's freedom.

1675
01:36:32,235 --> 01:36:37,040
If Aloysha dies,
I die.

1676
01:36:37,107 --> 01:36:39,075
But Russia must live.

1677
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:43,846
God bless you...

1678
01:36:43,914 --> 01:36:45,748
for your courage.

1679
01:37:16,248 --> 01:37:20,685
Hey, bring me
that Tobolsk cake!

1680
01:37:20,753 --> 01:37:22,887
Bring me that cake.

1681
01:37:29,195 --> 01:37:31,563
I know it's theirs,
but can't I have the clock?

1682
01:37:31,632 --> 01:37:34,566
No, no, my babushka.
Don't be selfish.

1683
01:37:34,635 --> 01:37:37,970
If Maria found it first,
let her have it.

1684
01:37:44,245 --> 01:37:45,211
Did he eat any more?

1685
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:46,680
Two, sir.

1686
01:37:46,748 --> 01:37:49,182
Two? There's enough poison in one 
of those cakes to kill 5 men.

1687
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,051
This is nerve-racking.
Isn't the man human?

1688
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,352
I can't understand it!

1689
01:37:52,419 --> 01:37:53,553
All right.
Go back.

1690
01:37:53,621 --> 01:37:55,155
Yes, sir.

1691
01:38:06,234 --> 01:38:08,736
Isn't anyone drinking but me?

1692
01:38:08,804 --> 01:38:10,738
Here. Give it to him.

1693
01:38:10,806 --> 01:38:12,339
No, no. Please.

1694
01:38:12,407 --> 01:38:14,842
I'm afraid it's beyond my talents.

1695
01:38:14,911 --> 01:38:16,845
Beyond your talents?

1696
01:38:16,913 --> 01:38:19,848
You want to get into my government,
don't you?

1697
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:23,351
And you stick at a little bit
of champagne.

1698
01:38:23,419 --> 01:38:25,320
I want men around me

1699
01:38:25,388 --> 01:38:27,823
who know how to drink.

1700
01:38:27,891 --> 01:38:31,026
I'm going to make it a rule.

1701
01:38:31,095 --> 01:38:35,031
Here. I'll show you the way 
we do it in Tobolsk.

1702
01:38:47,946 --> 01:38:51,048
That's the way
you swill it down.

1703
01:38:52,951 --> 01:38:59,056
If you could do that,
I'd make you prime minister.

1704
01:38:59,124 --> 01:39:00,858
I'll try.

1705
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,996
I'll tell you a secret.

1706
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:07,999
If you want to drink,
keep on eating.

1707
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:10,335
It'll sop it up.

1708
01:39:10,402 --> 01:39:13,671
Come on with those
Tobolsk cakes!

1709
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,173
Here you are, sir.

1710
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,674
Sir?

1711
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:20,511
"Excellency," you
white-bellied pig.

1712
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,014
Yes, your excellency.

1713
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,515
That's better.

1714
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:24,984
Should have some of them.

1715
01:39:25,052 --> 01:39:27,486
The chocolate-coated
ones are the best.

1716
01:39:27,554 --> 01:39:29,355
Thanks. I think I'd prefer 
one of these.

1717
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,358
You think you'd prefer 
one of these.

1718
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:36,195
You prefer anything
to the thing I tell you to do.

1719
01:39:36,263 --> 01:39:37,396
I--

1720
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:43,070
I've seen you before somewhere.

1721
01:39:44,572 --> 01:39:47,007
Where have I seen you before?

1722
01:39:47,075 --> 01:39:48,776
I don't know, your excellency.

1723
01:39:48,843 --> 01:39:50,477
I've worked other places.

1724
01:39:53,414 --> 01:39:55,415
No.

1725
01:40:02,724 --> 01:40:04,625
It was here.

1726
01:40:04,693 --> 01:40:07,162
Right here in this room!

1727
01:40:07,229 --> 01:40:08,296
Where am I?

1728
01:40:08,363 --> 01:40:09,998
Grishka. Grishka.

1729
01:40:10,065 --> 01:40:11,465
Where am I?!

1730
01:40:11,534 --> 01:40:13,169
I told you. In the house
of a friend of mine.

1731
01:40:13,236 --> 01:40:14,670
A friend?

1732
01:40:14,737 --> 01:40:16,505
Chegodieff.

1733
01:40:16,572 --> 01:40:19,508
Guards! Guards!

1734
01:40:19,575 --> 01:40:21,510
Grishka!

1735
01:40:21,577 --> 01:40:25,181
There's a trick here.
There's a trick here!

1736
01:40:25,248 --> 01:40:27,183
That was a fine business,

1737
01:40:27,251 --> 01:40:31,154
trying to wheedle me
and get into my government.

1738
01:40:31,222 --> 01:40:32,122
Find him!

1739
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,156
But who, Grishka?

1740
01:40:33,224 --> 01:40:36,626
Chegodieff, you blockheads!

1741
01:40:36,694 --> 01:40:39,296
Hey! Hold him,

1742
01:40:39,363 --> 01:40:42,065
and if anything happens,
shoot them both.

1743
01:40:53,411 --> 01:40:54,345
Everything's all right.

1744
01:40:54,412 --> 01:40:55,346
We've captured all
the servants.

1745
01:40:55,413 --> 01:40:57,815
What do I care
about the servants?

1746
01:40:57,883 --> 01:41:00,684
Find Chegodieff!
Chegodieff!

1747
01:41:00,752 --> 01:41:04,755
Find him.
Get his gun!

1748
01:41:04,824 --> 01:41:06,491
I've got it.

1749
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:20,940
Ohh. You, too, eh?

1750
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:25,011
Well, this is very interesting.

1751
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:29,515
Where have you been hiding 
yourself during our party?

1752
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:32,651
Hiding? I was merely attending
to my hospitality.

1753
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,855
I trust you're getting 
sufficient refreshment.

1754
01:41:35,924 --> 01:41:38,625
Don't stop playing.
There's nothing the matter.

1755
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:41,128
This is a very clever trap.

1756
01:41:41,196 --> 01:41:43,998
It's no trap.
I merely wanted to talk to you.

1757
01:41:44,065 --> 01:41:46,666
You're rather a difficult man
to see.

1758
01:41:46,734 --> 01:41:51,705
You'll find me more difficult 
to see than ever in a minute.

1759
01:41:51,774 --> 01:41:53,208
Give me that gun!

1760
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:56,544
Don't do that!

1761
01:41:56,612 --> 01:41:59,147
I'm going to blow a hole
through him!

1762
01:41:59,215 --> 01:42:01,482
I ought to have done it
long ago.

1763
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:03,785
Grishka! There are 50 people
in this room.

1764
01:42:03,852 --> 01:42:05,820
Get lubov!
He can talk to him.

1765
01:42:05,888 --> 01:42:07,322
Grishka,
let loose of it.

1766
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,323
Aah!

1767
01:42:08,392 --> 01:42:10,559
He wanted a killing.

1768
01:42:10,627 --> 01:42:12,028
I'm not going to disappoint him.

1769
01:42:12,095 --> 01:42:14,163
Come on, Grishka.
Give him the gun.

1770
01:42:14,231 --> 01:42:15,664
Rasputin, a scandal like this

1771
01:42:15,732 --> 01:42:17,133
would ruin you.

1772
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,634
Yes! It would ruin us all.

1773
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:21,137
I've always hated
that arrogant swine!

1774
01:42:21,204 --> 01:42:22,338
Get him out of here!

1775
01:42:22,406 --> 01:42:24,006
Lubov, can't you do something?

1776
01:42:24,074 --> 01:42:25,674
Get out of the way!

1777
01:42:25,743 --> 01:42:27,311
All right, then. Watch!

1778
01:42:27,378 --> 01:42:28,511
No, Grishka!

1779
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:30,847
I'm your very best friend.
Listen to me!

1780
01:42:30,915 --> 01:42:32,882
I'm going to kill a dog.

1781
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:34,384
But I'm thinking of you!

1782
01:42:34,452 --> 01:42:37,520
Yes? And I'm thinking of myself!

1783
01:42:37,588 --> 01:42:39,856
It's either that man or me.

1784
01:42:39,924 --> 01:42:41,724
Oh, Grishka.

1785
01:42:47,933 --> 01:42:51,169
Ha! That's a good idea.

1786
01:42:51,236 --> 01:42:53,704
That's a fine idea.

1787
01:42:55,441 --> 01:42:57,208
Now look here.

1788
01:42:57,276 --> 01:43:03,281
You once told me not... to disturb 
the ladies of your party.

1789
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:07,252
I think we owe the same
consideration here.

1790
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,989
Hold those men here!

1791
01:43:10,056 --> 01:43:14,593
I'll see that they get a fair
and impartial trial.

1792
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:17,496
Just one thing.
Tonight was entirely my idea.

1793
01:43:17,564 --> 01:43:19,832
An excellent idea it was, too.

1794
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,834
Ha ha ha!

1795
01:43:21,902 --> 01:43:23,503
Go on. Lead on.

1796
01:43:27,574 --> 01:43:30,243
Go on there!
More music.

1797
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:31,744
The louder the better.

1798
01:43:40,922 --> 01:43:42,856
What are you smiling at?

1799
01:43:42,924 --> 01:43:44,725
Nothing.

1800
01:43:45,927 --> 01:43:49,230
You're not afraid
of anything, are you?

1801
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,807
Oh, sir! Oh, sir!

1802
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:01,910
Let me go!

1803
01:44:03,712 --> 01:44:05,813
How well did you search him?

1804
01:44:05,881 --> 01:44:07,482
We got everything.

1805
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:08,617
Anyone down there?

1806
01:44:08,685 --> 01:44:10,486
No.

1807
01:44:10,554 --> 01:44:14,457
Now we're going to have
that little talk you spoke of.

1808
01:44:14,525 --> 01:44:16,325
Must we talk in the cellar?

1809
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:19,995
The cellar is a perfectly
good place...for a rat.

1810
01:44:20,064 --> 01:44:20,996
Hee hee hee!

1811
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:22,998
Hey! Come here.

1812
01:44:23,068 --> 01:44:27,337
This is a pleasure
I promised myself.

1813
01:44:27,405 --> 01:44:29,540
After you, prince.

1814
01:45:03,543 --> 01:45:05,677
Keep on going.

1815
01:45:10,717 --> 01:45:13,552
Ha ha ha!
That's right.

1816
01:45:13,621 --> 01:45:16,490
Over by the fireplace.

1817
01:45:16,557 --> 01:45:20,994
You're going to be coals
before long.

1818
01:45:21,061 --> 01:45:23,330
Still smiling, eh?

1819
01:45:23,397 --> 01:45:24,631
Yes.

1820
01:45:24,698 --> 01:45:27,834
You're a liar.

1821
01:45:27,901 --> 01:45:31,304
You're sweating
underneath that smirk.

1822
01:45:33,074 --> 01:45:34,642
Why don't you admit it?

1823
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:37,645
I might shoot you in the head,

1824
01:45:37,712 --> 01:45:40,181
and then you'd be dead right away. 

1825
01:45:40,249 --> 01:45:42,883
Oh. Is this going to
take a long while?

1826
01:45:42,951 --> 01:45:46,887
Yes, you grinning snob.

1827
01:45:46,955 --> 01:45:48,523
I'm delighted.

1828
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:51,660
You're delighted, are you?

1829
01:45:51,727 --> 01:45:55,030
You're delighted.

1830
01:45:55,097 --> 01:45:57,899
Delighted.

1831
01:46:01,437 --> 01:46:03,672
That's the beginning.

1832
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:06,041
It's just a nip.

1833
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:15,685
I'm saving the last one
to put between your eyes.

1834
01:46:15,752 --> 01:46:18,954
Why don't you smile now, hmm?

1835
01:46:19,022 --> 01:46:23,393
Ha ha! Life can be very sweet.

1836
01:46:28,933 --> 01:46:30,867
Oh, you don't like that, eh?

1837
01:46:30,935 --> 01:46:34,505
That isn't so funny now, eh?

1838
01:46:38,644 --> 01:46:43,981
Ahh, that's a beautiful song
to die to.

1839
01:46:44,049 --> 01:46:46,951
Nights of love.

1840
01:46:47,019 --> 01:46:49,087
Ha ha!

1841
01:46:49,154 --> 01:46:52,424
There's death in there, too.

1842
01:46:52,491 --> 01:46:58,196
Life and death and love.

1843
01:47:02,902 --> 01:47:04,704
What are you laughing at?

1844
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:07,607
You. You're full of poison,
you fool.

1845
01:47:07,674 --> 01:47:08,874
Don't you believe me?
Look at your eyes.

1846
01:47:08,942 --> 01:47:10,610
They're like red jelly.

1847
01:47:10,677 --> 01:47:13,279
Didn't you eat too many cakes,
holy father?

1848
01:47:13,348 --> 01:47:14,281
Aah!

1849
01:47:14,349 --> 01:47:15,382
They were loaded with poison,

1850
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:18,017
and now you stuffed them down,
you swine.

1851
01:47:18,085 --> 01:47:19,553
It's the same music.

1852
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:22,689
Life and love and death.

1853
01:47:22,757 --> 01:47:25,292
Are you getting cold, holy father?
It's the first sign!

1854
01:47:44,613 --> 01:47:47,415
Ha ha! It's too late for that.

1855
01:47:47,484 --> 01:47:48,517
Lubov!

1856
01:47:48,585 --> 01:47:49,918
He's with his girl!

1857
01:47:49,986 --> 01:47:51,853
That's where you'll be,
holy father.

1858
01:47:51,921 --> 01:47:55,658
You'll be with yours. The little 
children that believed in you--

1859
01:47:55,725 --> 01:48:00,596
you'll see them all now!

1860
01:48:00,664 --> 01:48:02,364
Liar!

1861
01:48:04,067 --> 01:48:06,803
Hey there!

1862
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:10,573
Tell them to come in!
Tell them to hurry.

1863
01:48:10,641 --> 01:48:11,608
It's Rasputin!

1864
01:48:11,676 --> 01:48:16,313
Help me.
Help! Help!

1865
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:22,119
You can't kill me!

1866
01:48:22,187 --> 01:48:25,255
You can't! You can't.

1867
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:31,495
You can't kill me.

1868
01:48:31,563 --> 01:48:34,031
You can't kill me.

1869
01:48:34,098 --> 01:48:38,902
If I die, Russia dies.

1870
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,405
Do you hear that?

1871
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:43,408
She'd be dragged down...

1872
01:48:43,476 --> 01:48:47,912
down to the bottomless pit.

1873
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:49,648
I tell you that.

1874
01:48:49,716 --> 01:48:53,585
The poison's working.
You're turning blue, father.

1875
01:48:53,654 --> 01:48:55,321
Aah!

1876
01:49:00,728 --> 01:49:03,195
Why don't you die?!

1877
01:49:39,101 --> 01:49:41,903
Babylon has fallen.

1878
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:44,906
Fallen.

1879
01:49:44,974 --> 01:49:48,444
The great day of wrath is come.

1880
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:49,445
Stop it!

1881
01:49:49,513 --> 01:49:51,079
The Czar anoints her.

1882
01:49:51,147 --> 01:49:59,422
All of them will go. I see their 
bodies dying in the snow.

1883
01:50:26,985 --> 01:50:28,686
Antichrist!

1884
01:50:28,754 --> 01:50:30,721
Drown in the lake of hell!

1885
01:50:30,789 --> 01:50:33,524
Antichrist!

1886
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,183
Mamushka.

1887
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:59,218
Aloysha.

1888
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:08,060
Come in.

1889
01:51:09,664 --> 01:51:13,200
The adjutant general on duty and 
prince Chegodieff, your majesty.

1890
01:51:13,267 --> 01:51:15,068
Send them in.

1891
01:51:22,777 --> 01:51:24,177
Your majesty.

1892
01:51:24,246 --> 01:51:26,848
Wait, general. I want you
to see that this order

1893
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:29,718
pertaining to prince Chegodieff
is properly executed.

1894
01:51:29,785 --> 01:51:31,720
There is no justification
for murder, prince.

1895
01:51:31,787 --> 01:51:34,355
My ministers have suggested that 
you be punished with death,

1896
01:51:34,423 --> 01:51:39,060
but I cannot take a life that has been
so devoted in the past to my service.

1897
01:51:39,128 --> 01:51:42,564
I have therefore ordered that 
your punishment be exile.

1898
01:51:42,633 --> 01:51:44,534
Who else is implicated in this?

1899
01:51:44,601 --> 01:51:46,068
No one, your majesty.

1900
01:51:46,136 --> 01:51:47,269
Leave us, general.

1901
01:51:53,476 --> 01:51:55,110
Paul.

1902
01:51:58,482 --> 01:52:01,418
Paul, this is how we reward
your devotion.

1903
01:52:01,485 --> 01:52:03,353
It had to be done, Paul,
or precipitate a crisis.

1904
01:52:03,421 --> 01:52:05,488
All of Rasputin's creatures 
are still in power.

1905
01:52:05,557 --> 01:52:07,024
I know, sir.

1906
01:52:07,091 --> 01:52:08,825
I'm returning to the front
to remove Valenka.

1907
01:52:08,893 --> 01:52:12,362
Krassin will go next, and all 
the rest when I know who they are.

1908
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:14,497
But a country at war
will have to go slowly.

1909
01:52:14,567 --> 01:52:16,500
I wish I could help you,
your majesty.

1910
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:18,536
You'll serve your country
more by leaving.

1911
01:52:18,604 --> 01:52:21,039
When I've cleared them all out,
I'll send for you.

1912
01:52:21,106 --> 01:52:22,206
As soon as you can, sir.

1913
01:52:23,676 --> 01:52:25,142
Paul, where will you go?

1914
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,844
To england. I've been offered 
a commission in the line.

1915
01:52:26,912 --> 01:52:28,112
How's that, lieutenant?

1916
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:30,014
Paul, take Natasha with you.

1917
01:52:30,082 --> 01:52:33,885
Do as you're told.
She deserves to be happy.

1918
01:52:33,954 --> 01:52:35,220
Oh, your majesty.

1919
01:52:35,288 --> 01:52:36,521
Take care of her, Paul.

1920
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:38,057
I shall, sir.

1921
01:52:39,325 --> 01:52:40,525
Yes?

1922
01:52:40,594 --> 01:52:42,294
Compliments of general Laudai,
your majesty.

1923
01:52:42,361 --> 01:52:44,730
If you want to reach the front in 
daylight, you'll have to leave now.

1924
01:52:44,798 --> 01:52:45,898
Very well.

1925
01:52:48,669 --> 01:52:51,071
We must leave you here,
Paul. Au revoir.

1926
01:52:51,138 --> 01:52:53,073
Russia's going to need you
when this is over.

1927
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,208
This time, all our plans
are going through.

1928
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:56,876
I hope so, sir.

1929
01:53:11,126 --> 01:53:13,661
Your majesty!

1930
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:15,529
Your majesty.

1931
01:53:15,597 --> 01:53:19,000
I--I never believed
that madman before,

1932
01:53:19,067 --> 01:53:22,036
but one thing he said is roaring
in my brain.

1933
01:53:22,105 --> 01:53:25,641
He said when he died,
Russia died.

1934
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:28,810
I'm afraid the cancer's been
removed too late.

1935
01:53:28,878 --> 01:53:30,345
We're already destroyed.

1936
01:53:30,412 --> 01:53:35,250
No, Paul. Russia is too great 
to be destroyed by any one man.

1937
01:53:35,317 --> 01:53:40,488
Paul, here is Russia.
And here.

1938
01:53:40,557 --> 01:53:42,391
At least wouldn't it be wise

1939
01:53:42,459 --> 01:53:44,393
to send her majesty out
with the children

1940
01:53:44,461 --> 01:53:47,396
until the storm blows over?

1941
01:53:47,464 --> 01:53:49,398
We have never injured
our people, Paul.

1942
01:53:49,466 --> 01:53:51,267
They will never injure us.

1943
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:05,012
Get out of my way!

1944
01:55:06,749 --> 01:55:09,083
Oh, how do you do,
comrade general?

1945
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:10,351
Do they know where
we're taking them?

1946
01:55:10,418 --> 01:55:11,853
She does.

1947
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,387
What makes you think so?

1948
01:55:13,455 --> 01:55:15,857
She asked me to tell the Czar

1949
01:55:15,924 --> 01:55:18,860
that we were taking him 
to Moscow for his safety.

1950
01:55:18,927 --> 01:55:20,394
Ha ha ha!

1951
01:55:20,463 --> 01:55:23,331
He'll be safe, all right,
but not the way he thinks.

1952
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:25,567
Attention!

1953
01:55:29,405 --> 01:55:31,373
He restoreth my soul.

1954
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:34,042
He leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness

1955
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:36,478
for his name's sake.

1956
01:55:36,545 --> 01:55:41,716
Yea, though I walk through 
the valley  of the shadow of death,

1957
01:55:41,786 --> 01:55:45,721
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1958
01:55:45,790 --> 01:55:49,092
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1959
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:51,027
Thou preparest
a table before me

1960
01:55:51,095 --> 01:55:52,862
in the presence of mine enemies.

1961
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:55,799
Thou anointest my head with oil.

1962
01:55:55,867 --> 01:55:58,402
My cup runneth over.

1963
01:55:58,469 --> 01:56:04,875
Surely goodness and mercy shall 
follow me all the days of my life,

1964
01:56:04,943 --> 01:56:10,380
and I will dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

1965
01:56:10,449 --> 01:56:11,582
Amen.

1966
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:12,918
Amen.     
Amen.

1967
01:56:21,493 --> 01:56:22,593
We are ready.

1968
01:56:22,661 --> 01:56:23,895
Is that everything

1969
01:56:23,963 --> 01:56:25,430
you're taking with you?

1970
01:56:25,497 --> 01:56:27,432
We have everything
we need at Moscow.

1971
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,435
You'll want more than--

1972
01:56:29,502 --> 01:56:31,270
that's right.

1973
01:56:31,338 --> 01:56:33,272
Well, let's get started,
comrade.

1974
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,240
Yes.

1975
01:56:34,308 --> 01:56:36,909
What's that? Gold?

1976
01:56:36,977 --> 01:56:38,444
May I have it?

1977
01:56:38,511 --> 01:56:41,613
You see, it's my last 
anniversary present.

1978
01:56:41,681 --> 01:56:43,316
Our 23rd.

1979
01:56:44,785 --> 01:56:47,955
My orders are that nothing 
valuable leave the palace.

1980
01:56:48,022 --> 01:56:50,157
The picture's all we want.

1981
01:56:51,625 --> 01:56:53,093
We have been happy, Nicky.

1982
01:56:53,161 --> 01:56:56,330
Yes. We shall always have that
to remember.

1983
01:56:57,798 --> 01:57:00,567
There's very little time 
for that, comrade.

1984
01:57:00,634 --> 01:57:02,569
Ready, children?

1985
01:57:02,637 --> 01:57:03,571
Yes, Mamushka.

1986
01:57:03,638 --> 01:57:06,074
We're ready, too.

1987
01:57:06,141 --> 01:57:08,910
Oh, dear, don't you think 
we'd better leave him here?

1988
01:57:08,978 --> 01:57:10,378
Why, Mamushka?

1989
01:57:10,445 --> 01:57:12,247
He might get cold on the way.

1990
01:57:12,314 --> 01:57:15,716
And we can always send for him,
can't we?

1991
01:57:15,784 --> 01:57:18,219
Yes. Yes.
Come on, please.

1992
01:57:18,288 --> 01:57:20,089
At once. Maria?

1993
01:57:20,156 --> 01:57:22,291
Whatever you say, Mamushka.

1994
01:57:26,662 --> 01:57:29,331
I saw you feeding him once.

1995
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:33,568
I'll take good care of him.

1996
01:57:33,636 --> 01:57:36,471
Come, my brood.

1997
01:57:38,509 --> 01:57:41,444
You've dressed warmly, children?

1998
01:57:43,647 --> 01:57:45,115
What's that?

1999
01:57:45,182 --> 01:57:49,252
All the reforms ever proposed 
for Russia in the last 10 years.

2000
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,486
Some of them are bad.

2001
01:57:50,554 --> 01:57:52,622
Some of them are excellent.

2002
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:55,092
Even your revolutionary ideas
are there.

2003
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,261
Well, what do I want
with them?

2004
01:57:57,329 --> 01:57:59,696
I was thinking that 
if you could get them

2005
01:57:59,764 --> 01:58:03,034
to some of the people of the 
government, sincere people--

2006
01:58:03,101 --> 01:58:05,569
there must be many of them--

2007
01:58:05,637 --> 01:58:09,073
it would save them tragic mistakes.

2008
01:58:09,142 --> 01:58:11,076
All the needs of Russia

2009
01:58:11,144 --> 01:58:13,045
are so clearly outlined there.

2010
01:58:13,112 --> 01:58:16,248
They might find a bridge
between revolution

2011
01:58:16,316 --> 01:58:19,751
and the kind of government
they're after.

2012
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:24,056
I think we can get along without 
any suggestions from you.

2013
01:58:24,123 --> 01:58:27,092
You will, yes.

2014
01:58:27,161 --> 01:58:29,595
I was thinking of Russia.

2015
01:58:50,352 --> 01:58:51,285
Shut up!
