{7459}{7585}ln 1845, Poe wrote his|most famous piece, ''The Raven''...
{7590}{7690}...a poem he wrote while strung out|on coke and obsessed with death.

{7751}{7844}There's a team obsessed with death.|Always get their ass kicked.
{7853}{7963}Baltimore Ravens, only pro football|team named after a classic poem.

{8119}{8198}While l pondered, weak and weary....''
{8239}{8282}Jamal, how about it?

{8668}{8669}Yo, man, my dad saw The Window, man.
{8669}{8715}Yo, man, my dad saw The Window, man.
{8720}{8752}About 20 years ago.
{8756}{8836}Just like a ghost, like the ones|that be in our science books.
{8841}{8890}-Just like that.|-So, what, he was white?
{8895}{8921}Ain't milk white?

{8998}{9068}l heard he killed somebody.|That's why he stays inside.
{9073}{9121}You gotta kill an army to hide here.
{9126}{9159}-True.|-Y'all play too much.
{9164}{9195}Remember Shurrita?
{9200}{9253}She used to live below The Window?
{9257}{9366}She calls me up this one night,|bugging, dog. Bugging.
{9371}{9472}Saying she heard this tapping|from upstairs by The Window's place.
{9479}{9505}Tap...
{9510}{9538}...tap...
{9543}{9571}...tap.
{9596}{9673}While she was on the phone,|she started screaming, dog.
{9678}{9771}Because now the tapping made|its way down the stairs somehow.
{9776}{9800}Tap...
{9819}{9890}-...tap, tap.|-Listen to him, fool.
{9894}{9967}And now it was on|the other side of her door, dog.
{9972}{10058}She could tell there was some|type of knife he was tapping with.
{10063}{10133}Before she can even hang up,|the phone disconnected.
{10137}{10235}-That's the last time we seen her.|-Shurrita from across the street?
{10240}{10307}Come on, man, yo.|You know that girl is a crack ho.

{13599}{13626}Thank you.
{13655}{13682}Okay.
{13699}{13759}We got Jamal's test scores|back this week.
{13764}{13818}-Test scores?|-Assessment tests.
{13822}{13906}The state education department|requires all kids to take them.
{13918}{13950}He didn't tell you?
{14014}{14089}Mrs. Wallace,|Jamal maintains a C average.
{14094}{14201}Which means he does just enough|to get by without standing out.
{14206}{14325}Now, what makes Jamal's case|unusual are his test results.
{14466}{14525}Oh, my God.
{14531}{14592}l see him reading all|these books all the time.
{14597}{14669}Books l never read.|Some l never even heard of.
{14674}{14757}And he's always writing|in his notebooks.
{14762}{14817}Ever since his father left.
{14821}{14872}But that's what l see.
{14881}{14964}All he ever talks about is basketball.
{14974}{15034}Basketball is where|he gets his acceptance.
{15039}{15105}Kids don't care about|what he puts down on paper.
{15110}{15181}Let's go! Between the yellow lines!|Let's go!
{15186}{15214}Yo, T.
{15219}{15242}What up, Fly?

{15623}{15717}The Yanks and Sox tickets, they damn|near been sold out almost a month.
{15722}{15755}All right, Mr. Fly?
{15760}{15837}And by the way, why don't you go|tell Camry boy over there...
{15842}{15911}...that he need to back up|his little cheap-ass bumper...
{15916}{15951}...on that Mercedes there.
{15956}{16040}Go handle that.|Let's go, Fly! Let's go!
{16069}{16125}What the hell, Jamal? Moms called.
{16139}{16198}Tell me about the test.|What's up with that?
{16203}{16260}-Nothing, man.|-What do you mean, nothing?
{16270}{16312}This in the way of your plans?
{16317}{16372}Remember, it was your plan first, T.
{16391}{16449}Yeah, l know.|A little college ball and all.
{16454}{16548}Then start signing checks,|solving everybody else's problems.
{16553}{16578}Look at me, though.
{16644}{16687}Whoa, hold a minute.
{16739}{16773}Hold on to these.
{16815}{16863}l guess this makes it our plan now.
{16895}{16958}-One thing.|-What up?
{16963}{17022}Don't say nothing|about them test scores.
{17026}{17075}Don't worry, l'm your brother, dog.
{17080}{17156}Whatever me and you discuss,|it stays between me and you.
{17170}{17220}-Right.|-Love you, dog. All right?
{17225}{17276}Make sure you keep one thing in mind:
{17281}{17375}Moms knows when the game ends,|so take your ass straight home.
{17380}{17421}-Okay.|-Don't get into no trouble.
{17426}{17479}Be careful. Stay safe, all right?
{17484}{17534}-Love, dog.|-All right, T. Good looking.
{17539}{17585}All right, Jamal. Be careful.
{17599}{17650}Stink in here.
{17660}{17696}J, you see that window?
{17701}{17749}He keeps that one cracked sometime.
{17754}{17808}Yo, light's been out|for two hours, dog.
{17813}{17842}You sure he asleep?
{17847}{17958}That Methuselah's like a thousand|years old. That's all they ever do.
{17964}{18044}Yo, J, man. For the reals, son,|l don't know about this.
{18049}{18120}-l know.|-l think l'm-- Oh, shit!
{18154}{18203}l think l'm gonna pull the call, yo.
{18208}{18259}-No, yo, l got this one.|-Rats.
{18272}{18311}All right. Yo, Fly.
{18316}{18378}Keep it.|You gotta bring something out.
{18392}{18458}Yo, man, you hear us,|drop down, all right?

{18514}{18558}Don't stay in there too long.
{18579}{18611}Got you.
{18654}{18700}Damn, this thing's rickety.
{20600}{20640}Lucy Chapman around?
{20755}{20794}Last stool on the other end.
{20919}{20957}Lucy Chapman?
{20988}{21071}-Yeah.|-l'm Bannion, Homicide.
{21076}{21168}With this band playing, you need|megaphones to talk at the bar.
{21173}{21220}-We can sit in a booth.|-All right.
{23038}{23075}-Yo, look, look!|-Oh, shit!
{23080}{23140}-Yo, yo, got something?|-Oh, shit!
{23145}{23211}-Yo, what happened?|-You son of a bitch!
{23220}{23263}Dickheads, he wasn't asleep.
{23268}{23337}-Yo, did you see him?|-No, not for long, yo.
{23449}{23528}Jamal, would you stop bouncing|that damn ball in the house?
{23533}{23614}l got Michael Jordan's name|written in dirt all over my floor.
{23619}{23655}Don't worry, l'll clean it.
{23660}{23728}l got a better chance|of Michael Jordan cleaning it.
{23733}{23823}lf you're thinking of a shower,|the hot water's taking a few minutes.
{23828}{23908}-l wasn't thinking about it.|-Hey! Hey, where's your pack?
{23960}{24024}-l don't know.|-Don't know?
{24035}{24085}What do you mean, you don't know?
{24090}{24165}We wanted you to bring something,|not leave something.
{24170}{24210}Leave this one alone, man.
{24218}{24267}What was in your bag anyway?
{24287}{24348}l'm not talking about the damn bag.
{24362}{24402}Bet you ain't, man.
{24408}{24479}Let me teach you something.|Now watch the eyes.
{24484}{24535}He's probably watching you right now.
{24573}{24621}Stop. Stop. See?
{24628}{24668}You don't know about that, man.
{24683}{24713}Here's how you do it.
{26106}{26166}l'm not gonna do anything|to your car, man.
{26171}{26199}l'm sorry?
{26204}{26258}You look worried,|like l'll do something.
{26263}{26333}No, l worry about this car|everywhere, not just here.
{26338}{26395}-Don't take it personally.|-lt's just a car.
{26400}{26490}No, it's not just a car. lt's a BMW.
{26495}{26550}Those who know anything|about that company...
{26555}{26626}...know that it's more|than just a car.
{26631}{26718}Oh, those who know. So l wouldn't|know anything like that, right?
{26723}{26762}No, that's not what l meant.
{26806}{26852}Last thing l knew about BMW...
{26857}{26927}...is, they made plane engines|when they first started.
{26942}{27006}A guy by the name of Franz Popp|started it all.
{27025}{27098}Franz Popp. l like that name.
{27111}{27177}Made this one engine before 1 920.
{27183}{27232}lt flew six miles up.
{27238}{27311}Well, Popp and his boys were|just getting started, man.
{27316}{27379}Made this one engine,|the 801 , World War ll...
{27384}{27507}...14 cylinders,|2300 horsepower, seven miles up.
{27549}{27627}With more time, they would have|bombed the shit out of England...
{27632}{27676}...and maybe even won the war.
{27697}{27739}That's where this comes from.
{27763}{27826}White propeller zipping|around a blue sky.
{27854}{27931}After the war, they couldn't|make plane engines anymore.
{27936}{28050}And that's when BMW gave some|serious thought to making cars.
{28056}{28095}Kind of like this one.
{28117}{28180}But you probably knew all that,|since you lease one.
{28193}{28239}Thanks for the history lesson.
{28260}{28295}No problem, man.
{30180}{30234}Messing with my stuff, man.
{31560}{31584}Hey....
{31607}{31647}The other night was--
{31652}{31726}lt was just this dare thing|me and my boys do.
{32136}{32236}Well, l was wondering maybe l could|bring you some more of my stuff...
{32241}{32292}...or maybe l could|write something else.
{32297}{32425}How about 5000 words on why you'll|stay the fuck out of my home?!
{33430}{33494}Come on, man, l know you in there.
{33591}{33664}Take your goddamn hand off my door!
{33683}{33801}l just came to drop off|that thing you asked me for.
{33806}{33837}What thing?
{33854}{33943}The 5000 words on why you wanted me|to stay out of your place.
{33948}{33992}That's kind of the way you said it.
{33997}{34100}Well, try remembering it|exactly as l said it.
{34780}{34819}Come on in, Jamal.
{34824}{34856}Hi, honey.
{34873}{34907}lt's okay.
{34944}{34970}Sit down.
{35003}{35093}Mrs. Wallace, Jamal. When we got|your recent test scores...
{35098}{35176}...we figured there may be some|interest from private schools.
{35185}{35261}Well, it turns out we were right.
{35276}{35301}Mr. Bradley.
{35306}{35380}Jamal, Mrs. Wallace,|my name's David Bradley.
{35385}{35434}l'm with the Mailor School|in Manhattan.
{35439}{35522}-Mailor? Mailor-Callow?|-That's right. You familiar with us?
{35539}{35568}Yeah.
{35575}{35661}Jamal, Mailor-Callow is not only|the best prep school in the city...
{35666}{35736}...it's one of the finest|private schools in the East.
{35741}{35773}Only the best go there.
{35781}{35844}You may know we're a few weeks|into our fall term...
{35849}{35897}...but every year|we hold some openings...
{35902}{35959}...while we wait|for test scores to come in.
{35978}{36025}Jamal, your test scores...
{36030}{36098}...to put it mildly,|caught our attention.
{36123}{36209}l'm here to see if you'd be|interested in attending our school.
{36258}{36340}Jamal, we know leaving|for another school...
{36353}{36424}...especially a private school,|is not gonna be easy.
{36437}{36512}But this isn't the right place|for you anymore.
{36519}{36574}Jamal, it's not a difficult choice.
{36579}{36616}Mr. Bradley...
{36655}{36715}...there's no way|that we could pay for this.
{36720}{36769}We're not asking you to.
{36790}{36855}When Dr. Simon said,|''Only the best go to Mailor''...
{36860}{36902}...he neglected to mention...
{36907}{36974}...that our excellence extends beyond|the classroom.
{36979}{37004}l figured that.
{37009}{37044}We thought you might.
{37054}{37159}Mrs. Wallace, about 40 of our students|have gone on to play college ball.
{37164}{37225}Three have made it|to the professional level.
{37232}{37289}We evaluated your play last year.
{37294}{37348}While this is strictly|an academic offer...
{37353}{37421}...we won't be disappointed|if you choose to play.
{37426}{37522}All we ask is you come out for a|few days, take a look, think it over.
{37533}{37577}-Okay.|-Mrs. Wallace.
{37582}{37622}-Thank you.|-Jamal.
{37648}{37674}Goodbye.
{37679}{37712}We'll be in touch.
{38880}{38955}-l didn't knock this time, man.|-To whom were you speaking?
{38960}{39035}l'll tell you that|when l get my 5000 words back.
{40009}{40048}Bolt the door...
{40053}{40082}...if you're coming in.
{40251}{40291}The man in the car?
{40423}{40474}He was from this private school.
{40499}{40541}They want me to go there.
{40629}{40679}We don't have to pay anything, though.
{40726}{40792}We live a couple blocks from here,|me and my mom.
{40824}{40911}Well, my brother was there|a couple of years ago...
{40916}{40970}...but he left after my dad left.
{41356}{41448}My mom got tired of waiting|for my dad to get himself clean.
{41462}{41525}And my dad got tired of trying.
{41563}{41611}But that's when l started writing.
{41616}{41649}What's your name?
{41661}{41699}Jamal Wallace.
{41710}{41770}Sounds like some kind of marmalade.
{41786}{41820}How old are you?
{41845}{41880}l'm 1 6.
{41885}{41927}Sixteen!
{41948}{41971}And you're black!
{42061}{42115}-lt's remarkable.|-Remarkable? What?
{42142}{42198}lt's remarkable that l'm black?
{42202}{42271}What does me being black|got to do with anything, man?
{42386}{42445}You don't know what to do|right now, do you?
{42457}{42506}lf you say what you|really want to say...
{42511}{42569}...l might not read any more of this.
{42582}{42676}But if you let me run you down|with this racist bullshit...
{42718}{42779}...what does that make you?
{42871}{42912}l'm not playing this game, man.
{42917}{43002}Oh, l say you are playing it.
{43007}{43086}An expression is worth|a thousand words.
{43106}{43202}But perhaps in your case just two.
{43340}{43369}Here.
{43777}{43813}What an asshole.
{43973}{44068}One hand to give, one hand to receive.|As we eat together in unity...
{44073}{44163}...may our minds, bodies|and spirits grow strong...
{44168}{44224}...and congratulations to Jamal.
{44228}{44264}Amen.

{44562}{44651}You'll be fine, big bro, because|Mommy don't make nothing but soldiers.
{44656}{44704}You could have done the same thing.
{44710}{44793}l work at a parking lot. And l ain't|no regular parking attendant.
{44798}{44868}l am the supervisor|of all the parking attendants.
{44873}{44943}You don't know how much|you'll make from week to week.
{44948}{45000}One week it's $50,|one week it's $1 00.
{45005}{45054}-That's not a real job.|-Leave him alone.
{45059}{45142}Ma, look, l rap, l get busy.|You know l got my rap thing going.

{46663}{46703}Jamal Wallace?
{46720}{46779}Hi, l'm Claire Spence.
{46831}{46892}Bradley asked me to show you around.
{46905}{46934}All right.
{47026}{47050}Come on.
{47184}{47253}Don't worry about answering|any questions or anything.
{47257}{47308}Not till you decide|what you're gonna do.
{47314}{47378}Besides, the teachers here...
{47383}{47450}...aren't all that into|student participation.
{47455}{47506}They're busy listening|to themselves talk.
{47511}{47564}-What do you mean?|-You'll see.
{47575}{47669}This morning we begin our third|required reading of the semester...
{47674}{47729}...the study of a novel|that offers everything...
{47734}{47798}...and an author who could|have offered much more.
{47905}{47950}That's Robert Crawford.
{47955}{48007}Been here as long|as most of the buildings.
{48012}{48095}When William Forrester was 23,|in 1 953...
{48100}{48160}...he set out to write his first book.
{48173}{48279}Many aspiring authors talk about|writing the great 20th-century novel...
{48284}{48346}...well, William Forrester did it.
{48364}{48401}On his first try.
{48406}{48439}Have you read this?
{48466}{48497}Yeah, you?
{48504}{48558}Only about a dozen times.
{48563}{48626}This was the only one|he chose to publish.
{48631}{48701}For all we know it was the only one|he chose to write.
{48706}{48749}Your job over the next week--
{48754}{48847}Your job over the next week|is to read it and tell me why.
{48852}{48879}So...
{48901}{48947}...you gonna be back tomorrow?
{48952}{49015}Yeah, they want me to spend|some time on the court.
{49020}{49054}Yeah, l heard.
{49059}{49150}Graduation was a little rough|on last year's team, that's all.
{49155}{49216}But it's just like college, right?
{49226}{49307}You get an education,|and they get what they want.
{49314}{49356}Maybe you both get what you want.
{49361}{49393}Yeah, maybe.
{49442}{49493}lt was very nice meeting you, Jamal.
{49513}{49580}You too, Claire. You gonna|be around tomorrow?
{49585}{49626}Not where you'll be...
{49650}{49708}...but you might be able|to find me for lunch.
{49893}{49934}l didn't say those two words.
{49939}{49977}Why didn't you?
{49998}{50057}Because l want you to read|more of my stuff.
{50151}{50215}You know, they talk a lot|about you out there.
{50238}{50284}All this ''legend'' bullshit.
{50289}{50334}They got some stories, though.
{50339}{50388}People wonder if you killed somebody.
{50393}{50450}That, and wondering|why you been in here so long.
{50455}{50516}l wouldn't move, though.|l'd stay for the quiet.
{50521}{50566}You don't hear nothing in here.
{50578}{50630}Our place got these noisy neighbors.
{50635}{50707}Their kid's always yelling|because he's only a year old.
{50712}{50777}Or pops is yelling|because the kid's making noise.
{50782}{50821}Then mom's yelling--
{50826}{50861}But that's a different yelling...
{50866}{50953}...because that's when the old man's|playing the tunes for her...
{50958}{51021}...and she got her head|banging up against the wall.
{51026}{51057}She be screaming like....
{51073}{51133}-Then she--|-You better stir that soup.
{51146}{51170}What?
{51200}{51246}Stir the soup before it foams up.
{51427}{51478}How come ours never|gets anything on it?
{51483}{51541}Come on. Come on. Closer.
{51581}{51602}Now.
{51607}{51710}-You got somebody doing that yelling?|-What l have here is an adult male...
{51715}{51762}...quite pretty...
{51785}{51849}...probably strayed from the park.
{51961}{52008}A Connecticut Warbler.
{52025}{52088}You ever go outside to do any of this?
{52108}{52171}You should have stayed|with the soup question.
{52176}{52269}The object of a question is to obtain|information that matters to us...
{52274}{52324}...and to no one else.
{52362}{52431}You were wondering why|your soup doesn't foam up?
{52436}{52506}Probably because your mother|was brought up in a house...
{52510}{52579}...that never thought|about wasting milk in soup.
{52584}{52638}Now that question was a good one.
{52653}{52744}ln contrast to,|''Do l ever go outside?''
{52749}{52796}Which fails to meet|the basic criteria...
{52801}{52863}...of obtaining information|that matters to you.
{52868}{52902}All right, man.
{52907}{52964}Guess l don't have|any more soup questions.
{52996}{53022}No?
{53027}{53090}Why did you say that stuff|about me being black?
{53095}{53156}lt had nothing to do|with you being black.
{53161}{53268}lt had to do with me finding out just|how much bullshit you'd put up with.
{53273}{53302}You knew l'd come back.
{53307}{53373}Yes, just like l know|you'll go to this new school.
{53382}{53408}How you know that?
{53413}{53474}Because there's a question|in your writing...
{53479}{53541}...suggesting what is it|you wish to do with your life.
{53546}{53643}And that is a question your present|school cannot answer for you.
{53746}{53811}Let's match up.|Wallace, you take Hartwell.
{53895}{53926}What's up, man? l'm Jamal.
{53953}{53989}Just check it, all right?
{54074}{54118}-Check the ball.|-Let's go, guys.
{54123}{54150}Come on now.
{54227}{54261}Ball's in.
{54306}{54332}Come on!
{54342}{54389}-Cover Danson! Get on him!|-Let's go.
{54424}{54467}Play him tough, play him tough.
{54475}{54508}Here, Johnny, inside!
{54548}{54590}Way to go. Way to go, gang.
{54671}{54707}Let's go, D up.
{54712}{54749}-Let's go, garbage.|-Come on.
{54754}{54800}-Come on.|-Step up. Step up.
{54805}{54829}Head's up.
{54944}{55002}Leave the trash-talking|back home, all right?
{55023}{55048}What?
{55061}{55108}Get that goofy look off your face.
{55113}{55160}-l'm gonna make you my son.|-Right.
{55165}{55206}-You gonna be my son.|-Come on.
{55414}{55441}Let's go.
{55513}{55558}-Come on, man.|-What?
{55563}{55609}-You're too small.|-What?
{55652}{55689}Nice handle.
{55748}{55811}Hartwell, a little defense|would be real nice.
{55816}{55876}Coach is right. A little defense.|Let's go.
{55888}{55933}-Try and get it past the line.|-What?
{55938}{55980}l said, get it past the line.
{56002}{56052}ls this too much? Pressure.
{56136}{56182}Too much.
{56284}{56315}l need some help!
{56330}{56384}Ten seconds. Let's go,|the other way.
{56750}{56777}l'm taking your spot?
{56782}{56808}-Taking what?|-Your spot.
{56813}{56860}Taking nothing. Come on.
{57195}{57237}My court, man. My court.
{57375}{57413}That's how we play down here.
{57418}{57444}That's right.
{57521}{57553}Hartwell's just a rich kid...
{57558}{57643}...who wants as much of the spotlight|as he can get his senior year.
{57648}{57673}That's all it is.
{57678}{57739}They take things real serious|around here.
{57744}{57802}Well, it's a serious place.
{57807}{57878}Serious enough l usually end up|here, getting lunch on my books.
{57914}{57946}What are you working on?
{57996}{58033}Forrester's book.
{58038}{58078}l thought you read it.
{58083}{58130}l know, but look at this.
{58135}{58182}My dad got it for me.
{58187}{58223}lt's an early printing.
{58386}{58413}Listen, l gotta go.
{58418}{58448}But you just got here.
{58453}{58483}l know, but...
{58488}{58520}...l forgot something.
{58525}{58575}l gotta check up on something.
{58581}{58622}l'll see you later.
{59113}{59157}''Born 1 930.
{59169}{59210}ln Scotland.''
{59404}{59501}''Moved to New York with his family|in his late teens.
{59518}{59586}Mr. Forrester was unavailable|for comment.''
{59617}{59656}Yeah, l bet he was.
{59661}{59662}Are we now planning|to make these visits a habit?
{59662}{59728}Are we now planning|to make these visits a habit?
{59783}{59885}-You said you knew l'd be coming back.|-Yes, but l thought you meant once.
{59893}{59952}l need some help with|this thing at school.
{59957}{60031}Ah, yes, this thing at school.
{60036}{60111}And what ''thing'' are we|talking about now?
{60242}{60292}You ever read that?
{60394}{60433}l'm trying, man.
{60438}{60515}l just can't seem to get past|the first 1 0 pages.
{60548}{60624}As l recall...
{60653}{60715}...l took a while|to get past those pages myself.
{60800}{60862}Oh, Christ, you've|dog-eared one of them.
{60867}{60927}Show a little respect|for the author, huh?
{61063}{61106}That's you, isn't it?
{61135}{61173}You're the author.
{61238}{61305}l read the whole thing.|lt's not bad. Especially--
{61310}{61339}Hey...
{61358}{61392}...l know what it is.
{61397}{61493}l don't need another person|telling me what they think it is.
{61498}{61529}l wasn't gonna say that.
{61534}{61570}What were you gonna say?
{61575}{61622}l should tell you everything about me?
{61628}{61660}l told you about me.
{61665}{61726}You could learn|a little something about...
{61731}{61774}...holding back.
{62560}{62650}lf l ask you not to say|anything to anybody...
{62662}{62729}...about here, us...
{62754}{62803}...is that something|l can trust you on?
{62934}{62963}Yeah.
{62983}{63007}l promise.
{63032}{63065}Fine.
{63101}{63166}And if l ask you to keep helping|me with my writing?
{63542}{63577}There'll be no questions...
{63582}{63647}...about me, my family...
{63652}{63703}...or why there was only one book.
{63708}{63748}Then l won't ask.
{63773}{63808}Good.
{63818}{63854}And good night.
{64110}{64137}What's it feel like?
{64167}{64190}What?
{64195}{64251}Writing something the way you did.
{64298}{64346}Perhaps you'll find out.
{64763}{64803}Listen, you 5-foot-nothing.
{64882}{64935}He's probably still|sleeping in the crib.
{64991}{65028}Kenzo, how old are you again?
{65033}{65063}Why?
{65068}{65141}Look at your face!|Did your mom do that to you?
{65146}{65175}She started you young.
{65180}{65256}You know where that starts from?|Eating too much cookie.
{65319}{65372}Teresa told me. She told me.
{65378}{65429}l like them big. You got a problem?
{65434}{65468}l like them big.
{65492}{65519}That big?
{65524}{65623}lt's like when l'm with|all three of your mothers.
{65628}{65706}-You're not talking about my mother.|-Hold on, Oscar Mayer wiener.
{65721}{65793}Stop playing. You got beat|like Tina in school one day.
{65798}{65843}l seen Duke smack you up.
{65848}{65888}Listen, throw it at your mama.
{65893}{65933}Everything tilts towards your mama.
{65963}{66021}Your mama. Stop throwing your mama.
{66092}{66126}Why you laughing?
{66131}{66193}Yo, man, your glasses|are like Coke bottles.
{66238}{66263}Classics.
{66319}{66386}-You ever met somebody famous?|-How famous?
{66391}{66432}Like, l don't know...
{66476}{66524}...somebody people would know.
{66536}{66597}Nobody like that|comes around here, man.
{66699}{66744}So, you here for good now?
{66767}{66824}Yeah, l'm just trying to get started.
{66922}{66969}Well, at least they look good.
{66973}{67004}Right?
{67275}{67354}This year's writing competition|has now been scheduled.
{67371}{67449}For those who choose to take part,|entries must be turned in...
{67454}{67486}...before spring break.
{67491}{67562}Meaning, you still have|a few months of procrastination.
{67599}{67703}Feel free to experiment with|a more proactive approach. The--
{67767}{67803}Mr. Wallace!
{67822}{67848}Please.
{67904}{67940}l had a chance this morning...
{67945}{68022}...to review the files sent over|by your former school.
{68057}{68107}Test scores, impressive.
{68112}{68154}Actual classroom work...
{68171}{68205}...not so impressive.
{68219}{68255}ls this...
{68260}{68331}...the level of work|l should anticipate, Mr. Wallace?
{68431}{68491}Because if it is...
{68501}{68593}...it will help me determine whether|l should treat you as a student...
{68598}{68651}...or as someone here|simply to pursue--
{68656}{68684}How should l put it?
{68706}{68747}Other endeavors?
{68780}{68861}Of course your work will give you|ample opportunity to respond.
{68921}{68953}Good day, Mr. Wallace.
{69117}{69200}Just so you know,|you handled that the right way.
{69205}{69237}How's that?
{69246}{69283}You didn't say anything.
{69288}{69347}lt's the ones that do|that run into trouble.
{69353}{69408}-John Coleridge.|-Jamal Wallace.
{69487}{69547}So how many people do say something?
{69556}{69615}And actually stay in Crawford's class?
{69619}{69655}Not many.
{69683}{69723}l missed what you said.
{69758}{69798}l didn't say anything.
{69912}{69948}You read all these?
{69954}{70045}No, l just keep them|to impress all my visitors.
{70078}{70125}All your visitors.
{70138}{70192}We talk about your book at school.
{70196}{70254}People have been talking|about it for years.
{70259}{70316}They just haven't been|saying anything.
{70328}{70373}Yeah, l think l got it down, though.
{70378}{70453}l figure you were writing|about how life never works out.
{70458}{70557}Oh, really? You had to|read a book to figure that out?
{70575}{70653}Yeah, but Crawford's|messed up on it anyhow.
{70658}{70733}Says the guy having trouble|after the war is really you.
{70738}{70845}Some symbolism shit for the problems|you were having with everybody.
{70850}{70892}Robert Crawford?
{70907}{70957}Yeah, l think it's bullshit, though.
{70962}{71023}l think there really was|somebody else.
{71183}{71226}Mr. Johannsen?
{71240}{71265}Here.
{71276}{71376}Mr. Massie! Another trip|to your favorite destination.
{71381}{71443}l've got four bags today.|l can leave them.
{71448}{71473}Oh, no, no.
{71539}{71571}Come right in.
{71588}{71632}How you doing, Mr. Johannsen?
{71640}{71711}At least a half-hour|before the sun goes down.
{71717}{71805}Then you can begin your|panic-driven quest back to Manhattan.
{71810}{71862}This should last you till next week.
{71872}{71910}Your mail is in...
{71916}{71939}...this one.
{71944}{71989}-Mr. Johannsen?|-Essentials are in--
{71994}{72033}Essentials?
{72043}{72146}l took care of your bills, and|l put all the copies in this one.
{72150}{72215}The phone company wonders|if you still want service...
{72220}{72290}...as you haven't had a call in six--|Okay.
{72295}{72362}l got your socks|for the next couple weeks...
{72367}{72404}...which are in this one.
{72412}{72485}And l have your latest check|from accounting.
{72490}{72552}They wanted to know if you|cashed the last one.
{72557}{72603}lt's still showing up outstanding.
{72608}{72677}Not as outstanding as it once was.
{72791}{72858}l'm sorry, l didn't realize|you had company.
{72863}{72934}Oh, yes. We were just|having a discussion...
{72938}{73012}...on German automobile history.
{73017}{73090}-Care to join us?|-No, l'm in a tow-away.
{73095}{73120}Of course you are.
{73125}{73155}See you next week?
{73160}{73203}Not if l'm lucky.
{73331}{73405}Why not give that guy a break|and do your own shopping?
{73416}{73512}-And why are your socks inside out?|-Because socks are badly designed.
{73517}{73597}The seams are on the inside.|Hurt the toes.
{73611}{73718}ln some cultures, it's considered good|luck to wear something inside out.
{73723}{73753}And you believe that?
{73758}{73805}No, but it's like praying.
{73810}{73841}What do you risk?
{73846}{73893}And l do go outside.
{73898}{73958}How do you think those windows|get cleaned?
{74014}{74061}Now, about this...
{74066}{74103}...professor of yours.
{74108}{74208}How did it feel having him|tell you what you can't do?
{74213}{74331}-Like he knew he was better than me.|-Then let's show him what you can do.
{74363}{74418}Why are the words we write|for ourselves...
{74423}{74514}...always so much better than those|we write for others? Move.
{74599}{74628}Sit.
{74860}{74884}Go ahead.
{74915}{74946}Go ahead and what?
{74953}{74980}Write.
{75043}{75072}What are you doing?
{75077}{75141}l'm writing. Like you'll be...
{75146}{75193}...when you start punching those keys.
{75322}{75352}ls there a problem?
{75357}{75388}No, l'm just thinking.
{75393}{75428}No. No thinking.
{75433}{75469}That comes later.
{75569}{75611}You write your first draft...
{75640}{75661}...with your heart...
{75697}{75760}...and you rewrite with your head.
{75854}{75906}The first key to writing...
{75911}{75964}...is to write.
{75991}{76027}Not to think.
{76270}{76311}Jesus!
{77199}{77252}ls there a chance you might sit down?
{77687}{77734}''A Season of Faith's Perfection.''
{77738}{77810}-What's this?|-Start typing that.
{77815}{77876}Sometimes the simple rhythm|of typing...
{77881}{77948}...gets us from page one to page two.
{77958}{78022}And when you begin to feel|your own words...
{78033}{78081}...start typing them.
{78595}{78649}Punch the keys, for God's sake!
{78897}{78932}Yes!
{78971}{79007}Yes!
{79033}{79091}You're the man now, dog!
{80615}{80650}Jamal...
{80666}{80734}...whatever we write|in this apartment...
{80742}{80799}...stays in this apartment.
{80814}{80841}No exceptions.
{81626}{81677}Okay, let's push it, guys. Come on.
{81735}{81781}-Heads up.|-Yo, D!
{81829}{81856}That's a foul, man.
{81861}{81932}-l had the spot.|-You'll know when you got the spot.
{81937}{81969}Hey, hey, gentlemen!
{81974}{82036}-Hey, hey!|-Our season begins in one week.
{82041}{82136}lf l see this one more time, you'll|shoot fouls to see who runs today.
{82141}{82211}ls that understood?|ls that understood?
{82221}{82250}One.
{82397}{82423}Two.
{82522}{82551}Three.
{82644}{82676}Eleven.
{82772}{82806}Twelve.
{82875}{82908}Thirteen.
{82967}{83006}Twenty-nine.
{83206}{83240}Forty-eight.
{83327}{83357}Forty-nine.
{83482}{83511}Hold it.
{83561}{83589}One more.
{83915}{84009}That's one of the most impressive|things l've ever seen on a court.
{84014}{84085}Why do l know it wasn't good|enough for either of you?
{84090}{84136}Shower up and get out of here.
{84211}{84281}You may think we're the same.|We're not.
{84463}{84495}Oh, Mr. Wallace.
{84547}{84578}Mr. Wallace!
{84593}{84676}-Professor Crawford.|-The latest paper you turned in....
{84725}{84801}lt showed quite a bit of improvement|from your earlier work.
{84816}{84850}-Thank you.|-Yes.
{84854}{84936}-How long did it take you to write it?|-l wrote it last night.
{84941}{84974}Last night!
{85005}{85077}Well, l have some things|to finish up here.
{85082}{85115}Good day, Mr. Wallace.
{85320}{85362}That's right. Select again.
{85367}{85429}-''Birds ofa Feather'' for 600.|-Answer:
{85434}{85519}Vibrant in color, its name borrows|from this Vivien Leigh character.
{85524}{85613}-The scarlet tanager.|-lt's, ''What is the scarlet tanager?''
{85618}{85664}What is the scarlet tanager?.
{85669}{85713}Gotta know the rules to play.
{85718}{85792}lt was written by a writer|you have never heard of.
{85816}{85895}''Thy duty, winged flame of spring
{85900}{85986}ls but to love and fly and sing.''
{85991}{86065}He was writing about the song|of the tanager.
{86070}{86177}A song about new seasons, new life.
{86182}{86232}That's James Lowell, man.
{86237}{86283}l know who he is.
{86301}{86389}''l'll stay with 'Poor Assumptions'|for 800, Alex.''
{86413}{86472}You ever see any|scarlet tanagers around here?
{86478}{86545}They don't stray that far|from the park.
{86676}{86781}So your professor wasn't exactly|full of praise this afternoon.
{86798}{86844}No, not exactly.
{86856}{86963}Well, there's something you should|know about Robert Crawford.
{86983}{87055}He wrote a book|a few years after mine.
{87065}{87170}And all the publishers rejected it,|which was the right decision.
{87174}{87252}And instead of writing another one...
{87263}{87370}...he took a job|teaching others how to write.
{87391}{87425}How you know all that?
{87429}{87515}Just keep in mind that|bitterly disappointed teachers...
{87520}{87647}...can be either very effective|or very dangerous.
{88788}{88853}All right, this is|the first step tonight, guys.
{88858}{88901}''Mailor'' on three.
{88906}{88973}One, two, three, Mailor!
{89599}{89631}Gold.
{89636}{89662}Black.
{89694}{89748}Up here, up straight and high.|Not yet.
{90046}{90111}-What up, J?|-What up? You was in there tonight?
{90115}{90141}Twenty-six points.
{90146}{90206}Eight of 1 0 from the floor.|Ten of 1 0 from the line.
{90211}{90274}-l'm supposed to miss that?|-All right, it was hot.
{90278}{90356}You were putting some serious ink|on that stat page, man.

{90792}{90833}-Hi, Fly, l'm Claire.|-How you doing?
{90838}{90881}-You a friend of Jamal's?|-Claire!

{90962}{91036}Don't hold that bus up too long.|Nice meeting you, Fly.
{91061}{91130}All right! What the hell|you working there, man?
{91167}{91211}Shut up, man.
{91242}{91342}Yo, about Red Rose.|l ain't gonna make it.
{91347}{91417}l gotta go to this dude house.|They do it every year.
{91429}{91467}Don't be going off on this.
{91472}{91564}You big time. You best be going.|l don't want to hold your bus up.
{91568}{91605}You around this weekend?
{91610}{91698}Where you think l'm gonna be? ln|the Hamptons?
{92919}{93004}lt was very nice talking with you.|Remember, anything you need...
{93009}{93081}...please give me a call.|Okay? Anything.
{93103}{93127}Okay?
{93265}{93330}Building up a collection|of those things?
{93353}{93388}Yeah, a few.
{93395}{93446}Do you want to get outside|for a while?
{93462}{93518}Yeah. You know this place?
{93546}{93622}l live in this place. Come on.
{93799}{93902}They'll be in there till midnight,|congratulating themselves on your game.
{93907}{93998}Which means l get to cram tomorrow|for this test on Monday.
{94003}{94035}Test on what?
{94040}{94086}lt's on the Sherlock Holmes books.
{94091}{94166}They have us tracking down|all this worthless stuff, like:
{94171}{94221}''Who introduced Watson to Holmes?''
{94226}{94299}They give it to you|to force you to read everything.
{94330}{94377}Looks like it might be a while.
{94389}{94428}Maybe so.
{94433}{94528}So this friend Fly.|How long have you known each other?
{94541}{94620}For a while. He was born there,|and l was born there too.
{94625}{94666}-ln the Bronx?|-Yeah.
{94671}{94706}Must be hard.
{94716}{94739}What?
{94744}{94803}l don't know. New people, new school.
{94834}{94864}lt's not?
{94887}{94945}No, what's hard is growing up|in a place...
{94950}{95019}...where the cops don't|even want to be after dark.
{95050}{95110}What's hard is knowing|that you're safe there...
{95118}{95178}...because the people|you need to worry about...
{95183}{95229}...know you got nothing|to give them.
{95247}{95296}So it's a good thing you're here.
{95340}{95433}Yeah, but these people don't think|l got anything to give them either.
{95448}{95525}Don't let me get by you.|Once l get by you, l'll score.
{95530}{95570}-Okay.|-You ready?
{95575}{95639}-Ready.|-Stay in front of me now.
{95644}{95689}-All right?|-Okay.

{95926}{95964}How do l do that?
{95978}{96045}How do you play--?|l'll show you one right here.
{96081}{96112}Turn around.
{96133}{96170}Turn around.
{96224}{96255}Feel that?
{96266}{96292}l feel it.
{96300}{96389}l know where you'll go because|l can feel where you're gonna move.
{96394}{96440}All right, now try and move left.
{96493}{96588}l'm still here. You can't get around|me because l feel you moving left.
{96593}{96626}Try and go right.
{96688}{96728}See, l'm still here.
{96734}{96818}l feel when you try and go right.|So you can't go there neither.
{96823}{96860}Now try and get by me.
{96910}{96945}Hold on.
{96971}{97012}You gotta dribble first.
{97017}{97044}Dribble.
{97049}{97119}Dribble. Okay. Like this?
{97124}{97154}Yeah.
{97215}{97262}-Sorry.|-Claire.
