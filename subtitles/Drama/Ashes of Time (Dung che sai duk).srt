3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:11,553
Only the council keeps
favoring unanimous voting,

4
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:14,408
and should any proposal
meet your disapproval,

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:18,456
it has always ended up being rejected.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,376
Not only does this impede
our country's development,

7
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:28,147
but, as it is but an expedient to
protect the powerful nobles' interests,

8
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:32,884
I propose voting regulations
for the council of nobles...

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,377
move to a majority vote.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,411
Right!

11
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:39,360
That's right.

12
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,644
What she said is right!

13
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,445
Nine to one?!

14
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,314
{\a6}~ Episode 44 ~

15
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,114
Nine approved,

16
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,980
and only one was against it.

17
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:23,229
But, as the council
favors unanimous voting...

18
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:25,251
It was rejected.

19
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,445
Nine approved?!

20
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,173
Lord Sejong, 
Lord Misaeng, Lord Hajong...

21
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,932
They must be amongst those nine.

22
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:34,405
Yes, Milord.

23
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,540
It is indeed as you suggest.

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,668
Mishil does it again.

25
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,957
Seems like she was behind all this.

26
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:44,992
They certainly could not
let the taxation reform pass,

27
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,549
but they also wanted
to escape any criticism...

28
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,423
their refusal to accept
it would have incurred?!

29
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:53,072
But, Her Highness proposed to
change the council's unanimous vote...

30
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:58,049
to a majority vote, proposal which
is being deliberated upon at the moment.

31
00:01:58,264 --> 00:01:59,408
Majority vote?!

32
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,434
Well... I am sure it will not pass.

33
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:04,952
They could not reach a
unanimous vote on the reform,

34
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:06,453
majority vote?!

35
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,300
Would something like that ever pass?

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,462
It will not pass, but it is
by no means a bad stratagem.

37
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,978
Why?

38
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:23,102
Still, think of how disheartened all the
nobles wishing for those reforms will be.

39
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:29,988
So we must foment even
more disheartenment, you mean?!

40
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:37,205
And that disheartenment
must be directed at the council.

41
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,581
They're quite the fruitless
parade, are they not?

42
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:42,283
- Right?
- Indeed!

43
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,882
Those feelings...

44
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:47,921
"They are of little worth..."

45
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,126
Such feelings is what we must foment.

46
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,024
Make your choice.

47
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,850
Her Highness's proposal to change
our council's voting procedures...

48
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:21,287
was approved by two,

49
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:24,362
and rejected by eight members,

50
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:28,060
therefore leading to its rejection.

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,044
<i>Think this will mean a
triumph for Your Highness?</i>

52
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:09,004
<i>I merely reciprocated,</i>

53
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:10,757
<i>Your Highness.</i>

54
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,055
I ought to...

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,540
Think of how propitious the
passing of that reform would have been.

56
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:31,156
How lamentable.
Nine to one?!

57
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:33,902
I had no expectations on
the matter, none whatsoever.

58
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,321
There was no way it would pass!

59
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:40,221
Then...
What brought you all the way here?

60
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,021
Was not "expectations"
what led you here?

61
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,698
Ohh... that!

62
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:50,347
With all the land those
council members possess,

63
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:54,151
there was no way they would
pass such reform from the start.

64
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,180
From the start...

65
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:00,287
Even knowing that, 
I still had some expectations.

66
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:04,802
But we once again found out, uh?!

67
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,142
As long as unanimous voting
dominates the council,

68
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:10,689
nothing in this country
will ever change!

69
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,399
What are you trying to say?

70
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,760
Did I ever say anything 
about your clan?

71
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:34,194
Is being in possession of
plentiful land and assets a crime?

72
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:37,111
Wangyun Rang was not 
talking about that.

73
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:39,528
The reason certain clans might be
in possession of larger territory...

74
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:42,046
is either because their efforts
led to such expansion,

75
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,021
or because their meritorious
service granted them such benefits.

76
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,537
Is that a crime?

77
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,055
Even petty nobles with very little
land boast the same kind of fealty.

78
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,056
So does this discriminatory
treatment show any fairness?

79
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,844
There is a clear
difference between people,

80
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,846
do we have to equally divide land now?

81
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:02,551
What is wrong with you two?

82
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:07,142
Are you telling me Deokman was
the one proposing for majority vote?

83
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,889
Lord Seohyeon and I did approve,

84
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,292
but as all the other council
members were against it,

85
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,109
the motion was rejected.

86
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,298
Was it not impossible
from the very start?

87
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:22,533
Did not the council use unanimous
voting for the last seven centuries?

88
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:28,552
I am sure Her Highness herself
knew the motion would not pass.

89
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:31,882
Yes... As even that was rejected,

90
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,431
all the lesser nobles who
participated voiced their disapproval.

91
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,214
It is likely that is what
Her Highness wished for.

92
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:45,706
Are you telling me she did this to show
how fruitless the council has become?

93
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,368
It is very likely those
were Her Highness's intentions.

94
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,925
Right...

95
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:54,187
She managed to show that anything
which would go against...

96
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,231
the powerful nobles'
benefit would never pass.

97
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,973
<i>Sire.</i>

98
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,649
<i>Are you all right?</i>

99
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:04,746
<i>Should we escort you to your berth?</i>

100
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,526
I am fine.

101
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,230
Fret not.

102
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:26,689
Are we not mutually engaging
in one subterfuge after another?

103
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:30,880
Majority vote?
What a most discerning move.

104
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:38,843
Yes, as any proposal would find
it arduous to pass with this system.

105
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:42,462
Is not unanimous voting
a seven century-long tradition?

106
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:43,677
However,

107
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:48,831
it is a vestige of the past which
no longer suits our current situation.

108
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:55,290
All it has become is a subterfuge
to favor the powerful nobles' interests.

109
00:07:56,512 --> 00:08:00,989
And that is because no reform
would be approved unanimously by them.

110
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:03,592
That is certainly true.

111
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:05,080
Still.

112
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,613
Still, Your Highness...

113
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:11,218
Do you realize that
same unanimous voting...

114
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:14,169
is also benefiting you?

115
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,589
What?

116
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:25,228
Should the nobles propose a motion
to oust you from any decision making?

117
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,238
With a majority vote,
only six votes of approval...

118
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:36,815
would be required to force you 
out of any further deliberation.

119
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,909
However, since it is
still unanimous voting,

120
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,040
be it Lord Seohyeon or Lord Yongchun,

121
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:47,713
would not a single vote against
the motion cause it to be rejected?

122
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:51,374
And that is why you
continue enjoying your status.

123
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,135
I see.

124
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,838
I was indeed gaining benefits myself.

125
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,175
Our statute and institutions...

126
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:03,775
They are always a perilous
sword with two edges.

127
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:08,161
Not only their foe, but even those
wielding it may injure themselves.

128
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,193
Then,

129
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:15,757
is using such statute and institutions
to contend with your foes...

130
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,858
such immoral behavior?

131
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,688
Statute and institutions...

132
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:28,139
<i>Again... again...</i>

133
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:32,277
I almost risked telling
you everything, once again.

134
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:35,241
How sagacious your sincerity can be.

135
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:38,574
It almost caused me to once again
fall for that trap of yours.

136
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,255
If I may...

137
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,451
Hey! Minions!

138
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,181
Aigoo... What now?!

139
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,371
The council rejected both proposals.

140
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,688
- Uh?!
- Ehh... You pathetic dolts.

141
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,723
You are the true minions...

142
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,194
Wake up, will you?

143
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,421
Looks like expectations
completely floored them?!

144
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,280
They are really angry, uh?!

145
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,231
That is too bad.
What a shame!

146
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,987
You dolt, how much land
does your clan possess?

147
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:25,318
Why are you suddenly
curious about that?

148
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:28,279
<i>{\a6}*1 sok = 15 square meters</i>

149
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:28,279
Aigoo... look at you.
Over five thousand sok*?

150
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:29,809
Uh?!

151
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:33,394
Had this amendment been passed,

152
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,370
your clan's lives
would have been improved!

153
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,846
Ehh... You ignoramus.

154
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,900
He doesn't even realize
what can benefit him.

155
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:44,988
You pathetic dolt...

156
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,062
Tell me about it.

157
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,622
Does he have some issues up there?

158
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,637
Just stay put, uh?!

159
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,391
That's kind of true...

160
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,815
Aigoo... you're so hopeless.

161
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:01,497
Wake up, you dolt.

162
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,118
Let's go.

163
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:06,543
Couldn't smell money
if it was under your nose...

164
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:08,087
Ehh...

165
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,672
I just thought that...

166
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:14,037
Why did you hit me?

167
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,565
Now that I think about it, you dolt,

168
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,868
is that how you address
your direct superior?

169
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:21,105
Well deserved, wasn't it?

170
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,088
You dolt.

171
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,149
So it should have passed, uh?!

172
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:35,936
On second thought, the taxation
reform was not such a bad proposal.

173
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,192
Is that not right, Seokpum Rang?

174
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,422
So...

175
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,982
Are you saying it should
have passed successfully?

176
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:43,428
Why are you suddenly 
raising your voice?

177
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:45,960
It is because of the
drivel you're uttering!

178
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,853
Listen, Seokpum Rang.

179
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:49,741
Had this amendment passed,

180
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,974
it would have meant benefits
for your own clan as well.

181
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:56,907
The same goes for mine.

182
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,905
Don't you realize it is but
a subterfuge by Her Highness...

183
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,784
to make Lady Mishil's followers sway?

184
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:07,779
However, both you and I incurred
heavy losses during the last crops crisis.

185
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,586
It might not mean much
for the powerful nobles,

186
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:19,329
but one of the pillars holding
our clan was lost in the fray.

187
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,262
Nothing I said was uncalled for.

188
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:25,036
Careful with your parlance.

189
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:30,319
The reason we are still here,
and still own any land at all...

190
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,280
It all happened because of
Her Highness Lady Mishil's benevolence.

191
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,441
Have you forgotten?

192
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:40,727
Seokpum Rang!

193
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:42,586
Seokpum Rang!!

194
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,725
I really...

195
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,928
Ever since the princess
came back to Seorabeol,

196
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,730
there has not been
a single day of tranquility.

197
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,476
Why, is anything the matter?

198
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:01,576
All the petty nobles who
participated at the last council...

199
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:04,550
are gathering here and there
and making such a commotion!

200
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,268
From their point of view,
it is understandable.

201
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,943
It makes no sense!

202
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,678
Unanimous voting is a seven
century-long tradition of ours,

203
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:16,225
so how and why would
you suddenly abolish it?

204
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:17,955
No.

205
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,773
In the end,
it must be indeed abolished.

206
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:26,155
No... In truth, the council itself
is a rather fruitless apparatus.

207
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:27,912
Your Highness!

208
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:29,027
What?

209
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:31,216
"Rather fruitless"?!

210
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,563
What is that supposed to mean?

211
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,638
Yes. Should I achieve
my grandiose endeavors,

212
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:39,085
it will be the first thing
I will abolish.

213
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,703
Of course, now is not the time.

214
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,605
What did you just say?

215
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,283
Lord Chunchu!

216
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:01,371
Do what with the council?!

217
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:03,159
Is that not the case?

218
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:07,081
Was I speaking in haste?

219
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:12,029
But in the end, should we not rid
ourselves of the council altogether?

220
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,426
Shouldn't we?

221
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,503
Right... I do think so myself.

222
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,057
However... The council is a
seven century-long tradition of ours.

223
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,389
Abolish it, Your Highness?!

224
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:35,878
Our path shall from now on
be laden with sudden upheavals.

225
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:43,207
Hence... I was indeed thinking
whether we should rid ourselves of it.

226
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:51,176
What our nation needs now
are rapid decisions,

227
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,122
and the ability to rapidly
make plans come into fruition.

228
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:09,473
Yes... So you spent
the night preparing this?

229
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:14,012
No, I just could not catch sleep.

230
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:17,053
I took the time to devise such plans,

231
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,115
may you take a look.

232
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:33,940
What a cowardly
and baseborn artifice...

233
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,073
Yes, it certainly is.

234
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:42,340
"It certainly is"?!

235
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,703
But, it should be much more cowardly,
baseborn and spurious, Milord.

236
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,766
Yes... I shall find the kind
of solution you are looking for.

237
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:07,454
The more ignoble
and squalid, the better.

238
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,433
Enough that anyone reading it
would be disgusted by its vulgarity.

239
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:18,554
But, Mother...
What would that be?

240
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,158
Is it the morrow?

241
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:27,521
Or the day after?

242
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,643
Tomorrow.

243
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,975
What is perturbing you?

244
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,180
Sister...

245
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:01,241
Must we really do this?

246
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,086
Why?

247
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:05,805
Are you feeling uneasy about this?

248
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,120
Why would any of this 
perturb my mind?!

249
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,729
I just...

250
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,314
Just?!

251
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:18,205
I just think this behavior
does not suit you, Sister.

252
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,297
Whatever disdain 
your peers accord you,

253
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:27,660
I believe the annals of history will
consign you to a luminous legacy.

254
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:33,106
However, this can besmirch everything
you have accomplished so far.

255
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,485
It certainly could.

256
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,406
The world does indeed fear you,
and shows you contempt,

257
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:48,193
but never have you acted
against principle.

258
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:59,559
But when it comes to this,
I hardly think it is the case.

259
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:09,588
No... Once...

260
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:13,350
I once did do something
against principle.

261
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:16,782
Sadaham...

262
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:20,590
My devotion for him convinced
me to abandon everything...

263
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,037
and plan to together elope.

264
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:29,802
That was against my every principle.

265
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:32,545
Yes...

266
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:37,924
It was that which moved me
to never repeat such behavior.

267
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,577
So, why do it now, of all times?

268
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,525
I now share the same
sentiments as those days.

269
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:53,430
Quite similar to
what I felt for Sadaham.

270
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:56,684
Similar as in...

271
00:18:56,827 --> 00:19:02,573
Enough that Mishil will abandon
principle to follow her dreams,

272
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,377
and should even failure
be bestowed upon her,

273
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,923
she will go out in style.

274
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,626
Well, to that extent?!

275
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,704
What? Piltan Rang and
Wangyun Rang's fathers?

276
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:30,283
Yes. As they both own less than
five thousand sok of land,

277
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,933
they could have become
recipients of your taxation reforms.

278
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:35,217
That is good to hear.
Where are they?

279
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,320
I shall meet them right away.

280
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,714
The Pungwolju just told me.

281
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:04,576
I am whelmed with
gratitude for your support.

282
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,036
<i>{\a6}~ Lord Jujin ~
(Piltan's father, Sangju commander)</i>

283
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,036
You need not flatter us.

284
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,725
We should rather be the ones to
extend you our sincerest gratitude.

285
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:10,400
<i>Do not even mention it.</i>

286
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:12,272
We can only be in awe at
the concern you have shown...

287
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:16,236
for the lesser nobles
and their situation.

288
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:17,658
No...

289
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,562
It is nobles of purpose
such as yourself...

290
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:26,075
who should aid this country to go
through the reforms it so fervently needs.

291
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:31,003
The council has become
nothing more than a pretext...

292
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,390
for the powerful nobles
to maintain their supremacy.

293
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:37,409
From here on in,
I will need your support.

294
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:40,148
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes. Your Highness.

295
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,907
<i>So, how did she seem?</i>

296
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:55,598
She requested our support
to reform the council of nobles.

297
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,132
Reform the council?!

298
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:00,494
Yes.

299
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:05,614
Saying it has become a mere
pretext to continue your supremacy...

300
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,933
Lord Jujin.

301
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,840
You know, right?

302
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,845
That this is nothing but
a subterfuge by Her Highness...

303
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,191
so that the nobles
will foment dissension.

304
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:22,843
You cannot let this sway you.

305
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,076
There is nothing
that would sway me,

306
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:29,823
but as I am staking my life on this...

307
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:31,742
No.

308
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:37,120
You have a responsibility to
maintain public order in the capital.

309
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,354
How could that ever
go against principle?!

310
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:45,025
I am counting on Your Excellency.

311
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:44,498
Did you come here
yourself, Your Highness?

312
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:47,416
I thought Lord Misaeng would come...

313
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:50,963
It is... our first meeting, I trust?

314
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:55,983
I have heard a lot about you.
Seems like you granted us valuable support?!

315
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,787
And what could I possibly have done?

316
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:03,392
I merely conveyed to Lord Misaeng
talebearing I learned during my journeys.

317
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,513
And that is why I hold your
endeavors in high esteem.

318
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,820
And hope this mutual
respect will continue.

319
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:17,418
I cannot express how grateful
I am to hear that, Your Highness.

320
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:21,437
Any further instructions
you would like to give us?

321
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,956
I hear you and Bidam are close.

322
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:29,904
Take Bidam with you,

323
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:34,924
and leave the capital on an
excursion for the next two days.

324
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:43,406
For excursions, you mean...

325
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,337
Just that.

326
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,592
Find a pleasant spot
up in the mountains,

327
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,817
enjoy fresh water and the
gentle breeze, and then return.

328
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:58,721
But, should Bidam refuse to come?

329
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:00,577
Then...

330
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,825
I suppose you will have to
bring him along against his will?!

331
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,304
<i>A guest is seeking your audience.</i>

332
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:20,562
Lord Seolwon.

333
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:22,507
What brings you...

334
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:26,455
Was paying you a visit a mistake?

335
00:24:29,957 --> 00:24:34,062
Still, I remain your guest.
Will you leave me out here?

336
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,035
Ahh... Well...

337
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:39,766
May you enter.

338
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,359
Is that not right?

339
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:52,194
If it's politics, that is something
my mother and Her Highness worry about.

340
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:55,941
Do we need to foment
ill will amongst in-laws?

341
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:57,670
I certainly concur.

342
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:00,019
- Here...
- Yes.

343
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:02,722
We neglected each
other for way too long.

344
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:06,913
Let us meet frequently,
and freely confabulate!

345
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,730
Yes, we should try...

346
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:16,876
Father, you are here?

347
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,621
Ohh... Right, Yeongmo.

348
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:21,494
Here... Have a seat.

349
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:27,335
What brings you here,
at this belated juncture?

350
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:33,717
I wanted to meet your
father-in-law, you and your spouse!

351
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:37,006
Right... 
When is the child due?

352
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,647
What happened to my Yeongmo?
Uh?!

353
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:55,325
What is perturbing you?

354
00:25:56,283 --> 00:26:00,918
Lord Chunchu is your nephew.

355
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:05,211
And he's our grandson-in-law.

356
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:07,457
And?

357
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:10,675
What are you trying to imply?

358
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:15,045
I do appreciate the fact Lord Chunchu
and I have become in-laws,

359
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:17,529
but it puts me in a
rather awkward position.

360
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:20,332
In regards to Lord Sejong, you mean?

361
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:21,834
Yes.

362
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,410
Even though I had no selfish motives,

363
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:27,071
he still refuses to believe me.

364
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,768
Lord Yongchun.

365
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:46,314
Are you not trying to help
Lord Chunchu to the throne yourself?

366
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:54,456
What are you trying to say?

367
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:59,662
Even though we did not
intend for it to happen,

368
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:02,720
are we not on the same boat anyhow?

369
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:24,278
Ahh... I told you we
can go inside and talk.

370
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,638
Get moving...

371
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,640
What is it?

372
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,662
What do you want?

373
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:40,877
What are you taking me for?

374
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,174
If you have anything to say, do it now.

375
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,697
Ahh... really.

376
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,315
What is it?

377
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,131
What's the matter?

378
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:52,054
Ahh... It's driving me crazy.

379
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:55,560
It'll never work... never.

380
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:58,566
Hey.

381
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,807
Will you leave with me on an
excursion, or keep drinking?

382
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:03,323
What?

383
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:04,882
Would be too cumbersome
to leave, wouldn't it?

384
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:06,585
So let's just drink, uh?

385
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:10,196
I saw you can handle it quite well.

386
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,545
Have a death wish?

387
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:18,291
Start talking.

388
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:22,977
It's just that I don't think
I can do this while sober.

389
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,724
Let's just have a drink...

390
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:29,170
Just one.

391
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:53,187
My apologies.

392
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,235
Ahh... Don't even mention it.

393
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:57,996
But, you sure can handle the bottle.

394
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,857
I am renowned for my drinking prowess,

395
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,788
but it indeed seems like I found a peer.

396
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:04,452
Right... Let us have one more.

397
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,383
Yes, all right.

398
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,695
Here...

399
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:12,251
To the prosperity of our clans,
let us have a toast.

400
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,297
I did hear about it,

401
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,380
but how can I...

402
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,743
It is for Her Highness's sake,

403
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:33,974
and for the sake of our country.

404
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:37,054
Seokpum Rang's dexterity
with the blade is peerless.

405
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,039
Is that not the reason
we are entrusting this to him?

406
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,881
Let us begin.

407
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:01,267
What are you waiting for?

408
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,306
Begin at once!

409
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:25,983
Did you meet Lord Yongchun?

410
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:27,570
Yes.

411
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:30,588
Did you do it?

412
00:30:30,774 --> 00:30:33,091
Yes, I did.

413
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:37,875
Did you bring that?

414
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:46,035
I did bring it...

415
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:49,170
But, why this...

416
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:54,088
Yes.
Give it to me.

417
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:56,476
Your Highness.

418
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:00,767
I always tried to accord
you my understanding,

419
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:02,684
and so I have done all this time.

420
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:06,488
But this is something
I cannot understand.

421
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:08,576
Why would you...

422
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:14,574
The reason I left that behind
was to earn your trust,

423
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:17,863
and to placate your anxiety.

424
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:22,632
So why did you ask me
to bring this only now?

425
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,666
For I now wish for it to placate mine.

426
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:29,841
What are you trying
to say, Your Highness?

427
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:35,920
Could this not end up
in failure, after all?

428
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,131
Then...

429
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,205
Yes.

430
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:44,040
It is Bidam.

431
00:31:56,261 --> 00:32:00,870
This might be a very long night.

432
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:04,844
Just like that night.

433
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,390
It is a summoning for
an urgent council meeting.

434
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,809
I must convey it
directly to His Excellency.

435
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:27,731
He still has not awakened,
so let me do this.

436
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:34,882
May you confirm that
you received the notice.

437
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:48,825
I sent the meeting notice
to Lord Yongchun's abode.

438
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,458
Directly to Lord Yongchun?

439
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:57,163
Ahh... No, as he was inebriated
last night and wished to sleep,

440
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:59,753
I only left it to his servants.

441
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:01,870
Is that so?

442
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:06,761
Was the confirmation signed?

443
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,325
Yes.

444
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:37,566
<i>Lord Seohyeon.</i>

445
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,995
<i>Lord Seohyeon.</i>

446
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:42,906
Milord, you must wake up.

447
00:33:57,346 --> 00:34:01,540
It is a list of all the nobles
who wish to give you support.

448
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:09,048
I met with Piltan Rang's
father, Lord Jujin.

449
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:11,998
He did seem to approve
our taxation reforms,

450
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:13,872
but I still cannot be sure.

451
00:34:13,972 --> 00:34:19,089
Lord Jujin commands elite troops
from the closest post to the capital,

452
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:21,819
so we must make sure
he joins forces with us.

453
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:25,753
He might not be of high nobility,
but considering his long-standing...

454
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:28,384
relationship with Lord Sejong,
we cannot be sure.

455
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:32,179
That is why I plan to
meet Piltan Rang as well.

456
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:37,113
Also, Wolya Rang, make sure
you keep control over...

457
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,061
the restoration movement
sects in this area.

458
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:02,429
Lo...Lord Seohyeon.

459
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:04,739
Lord Seohyeon!

460
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,877
Lord Seohyeon!

461
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:15,258
What is this?

462
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,908
What...

463
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,997
What is this?

464
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,443
What did you fill those drinks with?

465
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:26,102
I...

466
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:32,408
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:34,072
Have a death wish?

468
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:36,485
Keep quiet, will you?

469
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,369
All this is driving me crazy.

470
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,415
Take these off.

471
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:44,836
You crazy bastard...

472
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:46,348
Stop!

473
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,784
Just stay put, uh?

474
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:52,590
Let me think for a moment, uh?

475
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:56,938
You really must be insane.

476
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,712
Why did you tie me?

477
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,364
Calm down.

478
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:05,964
Just calm down.

479
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:09,078
Come here.

480
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,878
Closer... Come closer!

481
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,923
I said come here!

482
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:21,572
They will have a council meeting
to oust Her Highness...

483
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:24,376
from any decision-making process.

484
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:27,494
With me and Lord Yongchun...

485
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:30,269
Why would they do this?

486
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:31,857
Bring my official garments.

487
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:33,344
I must hasten there.

488
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:34,817
Yes.

489
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,415
What is that supposed to mean?

490
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,660
The council will discuss what?

491
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:54,963
Ousting Her Highness from
any further state deliberation.

492
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,994
How could this...

493
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,824
They are discussing it now?

494
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:02,253
Yes, I saw the council members gather.

495
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:07,595
But, the council still
uses unanimous voting.

496
00:38:07,924 --> 00:38:10,356
Lord Yongchun and
Lord Seohyeon will be present,

497
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:12,613
so there is no way it would pass.

498
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,847
<i>Yes...</i>

499
00:38:15,148 --> 00:38:20,025
But how could this happen
right under our noses?

500
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:21,923
No.

501
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:24,740
There is something peculiar about this.

502
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:28,473
The council...

503
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:56,256
Seems like we are not all gathered yet.

504
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:59,660
Lord Yongchun and Lord Seohyeon
are still missing.

505
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:02,521
Is it not time to start
our meeting already?

506
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:06,812
The Sangdaedeung is here,
so let us commence.

507
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,070
What?

508
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:11,961
Should not the council
reach a unanimous vote?

509
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:16,854
Yes, it indeed shall reach one.

510
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,757
Who ever said otherwise?

511
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:25,498
So how can we start without
Lord Yongchun and Lord Seohyeon?

512
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,866
Eight council members are present.

513
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,915
Would not an unanimous vote
amongst the present suffice?

514
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:40,113
H...owever...

515
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:42,187
There is no such precedent,

516
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:43,244
how...

517
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:46,008
Are we going to postpone
such paramount decision...

518
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,874
just because a few members
could not come on time?

519
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:53,758
Not to mention the fact that
they gave us confirmation...

520
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:55,838
that they received our summoning.

521
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,192
<i>From this meeting onwards,</i>

522
00:39:58,593 --> 00:40:03,928
let us seek a unanimous vote
amongst the members present alone.

523
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:05,143
Indeed!

524
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:07,601
Why should we await them?

525
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,046
I concur.

526
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:14,881
There is no code suggesting that
the entire council must be present.

527
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:19,826
Merely that a unanimous vote
is required for a motion to pass.

528
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,400
I concur.

529
00:40:21,744 --> 00:40:23,470
Yes, I agree as well.

530
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:24,747
I agree.

531
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,529
Yes... I concur myself.

532
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:33,165
I agree.

533
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:39,638
Then, we shall hereby
commence this meeting.

534
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,021
What?

535
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:15,449
They started the meeting
with only eight members present?

536
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:19,297
Yes, it is currently taking
place at Yeolseon Hall.

537
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,573
Her Highness's right to deliberate
is the motion discussed?

538
00:41:21,631 --> 00:41:22,475
Yes...

539
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,002
What now?

540
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,095
Does it make any sense?

541
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:29,612
They dare start the meeting without
Lord Seohyeon and Lord Yongchun?!

542
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:32,072
It... cannot be...

543
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:34,911
Pungwolju.

544
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:37,449
I've been told that Lord Seohyeon
spent the eventide...

545
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:38,932
drinking with Lord Hajong.

546
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,376
Is that true?

547
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,628
They cannot have done
so to leave them out,

548
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:48,861
and pass that motion with
only eight members present?

549
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:51,250
Those ignoble cowards!

550
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:55,639
How could Hwarang alumni
display such appalling behavior?

551
00:41:56,076 --> 00:42:00,828
So... So where are Lord Yongchun
and Lord Seohyeon now?

552
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:35,416
Leave on an excursion
far away from the palace?!

553
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,548
Mishil said so?!

554
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:37,850
I told you.

555
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:40,796
She said keeping you away
until the morrow would suffice.

556
00:42:41,697 --> 00:42:45,659
So why did we not leave,
and you tied me here instead?

557
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:48,448
<i>Tell me!</i>

558
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:50,250
Answer at once...

559
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:51,866
What are you trying to scheme?

560
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,926
You are here because I
could not scheme a thing!

561
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:56,286
Should I not make
decisions on my own?

562
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:58,474
Decisions... what decisions?!

563
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:00,732
First... Who are you?

564
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:02,947
Who could you possibly be,
to arouse so much interest in Mishil?

565
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,939
I might have dabbled in that
kind of work once or twice,

566
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:08,257
but it's the first time Mishil
comes forward firsthand.

567
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:13,611
Second...
She said today and the morrow.

568
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,886
It's clear something
is going to happen, uh?

569
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:18,845
What could it be?

570
00:43:20,018 --> 00:43:21,534
It can't be...

571
00:43:21,677 --> 00:43:24,110
Is Mishil going to...

572
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:29,474
Unclasp me...
Do it now!

573
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:33,438
I told you it's not
such a simple matter.

574
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:35,455
You still...

575
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:37,429
It's driving me crazy as well, uh?

576
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,261
Having to tie you up like that
means risking my life,

577
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,277
and letting you go would
make me a foe in Mishil's eyes.

578
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,937
Want me to end
your problems right now?

579
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:48,375
Unclasp me right now!

580
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:53,297
Then, convince me!

581
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:54,670
Convince me that unclasping you...

582
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:58,789
and becoming a foe in her eyes
will be the right decision!

583
00:44:21,766 --> 00:44:23,338
Move out of the way!

584
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:26,017
I must join the meeting.

585
00:44:27,547 --> 00:44:29,435
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

586
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,657
I said move!

587
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:32,991
Move...

588
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,981
I said move!

589
00:44:38,891 --> 00:44:40,093
What is the matter?

590
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:41,902
Are you late as well?

591
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:44,362
They are blocking the way on purpose.

592
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:48,168
Then, are they keeping
us out so they will...

593
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,024
pass the motion all by themselves?

594
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:52,487
Seems so.

595
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,321
We must stop this.

596
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,765
How could they engage
in such coarse subterfuges?!

597
00:44:56,837 --> 00:44:59,426
You knaves!
Move out...

598
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,528
- You knaves!
- Out of the way!

599
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:04,475
I said move, you knaves!

600
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:13,087
Did you gather everyone?

601
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:14,574
Yes.

602
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,327
Is that true?

603
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:24,575
That they made them drink,
and today staged an urgent meeting?

604
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:27,807
Wow... What cowardice...

605
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:32,720
Not to mention that they only
started the meeting with eight members.

606
00:45:32,892 --> 00:45:36,682
As if they were market scoundrels...
It makes no sense.

607
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:39,923
- Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency...

608
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:45,727
Lord Yongchun and Lord Seohyeon
arrived at Yeolseon Hall.

609
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:47,028
Is that so?

610
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:48,530
Forget it, then.

611
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:49,751
No need to go.

612
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:52,411
However, the two are trying
to enter the meeting,

613
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:56,344
but troops are blocking their entrance.

614
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:59,349
<i>Troops?!</i>

615
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,987
Pungwolju, must we keep allowing this?

616
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:07,334
How could we allow
something like this to happen?

617
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,023
Jukbang, Godo.

618
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:12,430
Report all this to
Her Highness immediately,

619
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:13,660
and request further instructions.

620
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:15,234
Yes!

621
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:23,220
Also, Royal Palace Guard,
everyone follow me.

622
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:24,965
Yes!

623
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:28,226
Let's move.

624
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:29,794
Yes!

625
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,790
Isn't their behavior contemptible?

626
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:40,964
How could they leave
Their Excellencies out,

627
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:44,259
and gain their unanimous vote that way?

628
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:50,223
I cannot... believe this.

629
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:55,166
Mishil... Mishil...

630
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:57,855
How could she stoop to this level?!

631
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:00,115
It is impossible.

632
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:04,633
So this is all Mishil could do?

633
00:47:05,246 --> 00:47:08,356
You overestimated her, Your Highness.

634
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:10,845
We should not squander time here.

635
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,191
We must stop them at once!

636
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,066
It is all the better, on the contrary.

637
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,564
With this taxation reform
incident, public fervor...

638
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:25,096
and the support of petty nobles
are moving towards Your Highness.

639
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:28,099
And if you add a grave
affront against procedure,

640
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:31,989
like seeking a unanimous
vote with only eight members,

641
00:47:33,177 --> 00:47:37,479
and even prohibiting the other
two members from participating.

642
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:39,638
What would possibly happen?

643
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:41,111
Yes...

644
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:44,103
Even if this motion might pass,

645
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:48,191
opposition will surpass
everyone's imagination.

646
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,285
Everyone says Mishil
always stresses just cause.

647
00:47:55,471 --> 00:48:00,077
However, Mishil is
just a person like all of us,

648
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:04,697
so anxiety and impatience
led her to do this.

649
00:48:04,911 --> 00:48:07,414
No... It cannot be.

650
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,316
She would never do this.

651
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:13,121
Mishil would never
cause her own downfall.

652
00:48:13,278 --> 00:48:17,754
Princess Deokman sold military
supplies without the council's consent,

653
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:21,744
endangering our nation's defenses.

654
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:23,918
Also,

655
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:30,283
her unfair taxation amendment proposal 
spread unrest amongst the nobles.

656
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:35,017
<i>This is all to render
this council powerless...</i>

657
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:41,010
and eventually abolish it,
an artifice concocted by Her Highness.

658
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:48,032
Hence, we request that
Her Highness be ousted from...

659
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,595
any decision making, and only
concern herself with matters...

660
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:57,072
related to the royal family.

661
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,248
Apprehend them at once!

662
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:38,472
Yes!

663
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:46,022
Her Highness is in danger!

664
00:49:46,136 --> 00:49:48,396
I asked you...
why would she be in danger?

665
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:49,912
Explain it to me.

666
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:53,679
I ought to...
We have no time to waste!

667
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:56,540
I am the only one who can solve this.

668
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:58,313
The only one!

669
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,314
What?!

670
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,660
Yushin, Alcheon, Chunchu!

671
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,628
She must have fooled them all.

672
00:50:03,885 --> 00:50:05,859
I must go, I must!

673
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:10,150
That's why I told you
convincing me would be best.

674
00:50:10,337 --> 00:50:11,758
What is Mishil trying to do?

675
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:15,517
And what is your relationship with her?

676
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:22,307
Now... Unclasp me now.

677
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:25,111
I must go, hasten!

678
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:20,319
Lord Jujin's troops from Sangju
are heading for the capital.

679
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:22,096
What?

680
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:22,894
Fine.

681
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:24,024
Yes.

682
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:27,070
Lord Jujin...

683
00:51:28,702 --> 00:51:32,405
Does not Lord Jujin
command a huge battalion?

684
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:35,437
Why is he suddenly...

685
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:40,887
<i>It can't be...
It can't...</i>

686
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:42,674
<i>Your Highness!</i>

687
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,961
We received a report.

688
00:51:49,054 --> 00:51:50,498
How did it go?

689
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:56,919
Alcheon Rang took the troops,
and forcibly entered Yeolseon Hall.

690
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:02,655
This cannot happen.

691
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,944
We must stop them.

692
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,926
You now understand
what her plans are, don't you?

693
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,729
It's a coup she is preparing!

694
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:17,859
What?!

695
00:52:18,016 --> 00:52:20,848
She will stage an insurrection!

696
00:52:22,629 --> 00:52:24,173
I knew this would happen.

697
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:27,258
I said it would be a coup,
and they did not believe me.

698
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,878
How can they be so foolish...

699
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,795
Wh...Wh...What?

700
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:32,312
I am sure.

701
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:34,572
Sure as anyone can be.

702
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:37,948
Hey! I said unclasp me!

703
00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:40,813
In...In...Insurrection?!

704
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:43,576
A... military coup?!

705
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:49,970
Master, troops from Sangju
are heading for the capital.

706
00:52:51,372 --> 00:52:56,286
You... You... really
were saying the truth...

707
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,196
Unclasp me, you bastard.

708
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,350
Do it now!

709
00:53:05,188 --> 00:53:08,004
<i>~ For ~ Against ~ Against ~ For ~</i>

710
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,024
How do you explain all this?

711
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:32,031
How dare you wield your
weapons inside this sacred place?

712
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:45,204
You knaves!

713
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,322
You dare enter Yeolseon Hall armed?

714
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:50,181
Pungwolju and a
Royal Palace Guard...

715
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:52,856
Your being here is high treason!

716
00:54:09,021 --> 00:54:11,063
They just entered.

717
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:14,353
Yes.

718
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:17,643
Then...
We shall begin.

719
00:54:55,044 --> 00:55:00,090
No armed courtier has ever
entered these sacred walls before.

720
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:07,431
<i>{\a6}*2nd century Shilla Courtier who
staged a failed coup, and escaped to Baekje</i>

721
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:07,431
Also, even traitor Gilseon*...

722
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:10,727
could not violate this council.

723
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:16,856
But you dare wield your swords
and force your way in?

724
00:55:20,648 --> 00:55:25,438
However, as troops were blocking
Their Excellencies' entrance...

725
00:55:25,552 --> 00:55:27,109
You knave.

726
00:55:27,254 --> 00:55:31,559
Did any of them wield a sword?

727
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:54,834
They are traitors who violated
Yeolseon Hall wielding their weapons!

728
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:56,289
Apprehend them all!

729
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,666
Yes!

730
00:56:07,874 --> 00:56:09,962
Drop your weapons!

731
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:24,715
Royal Palace Guard, drop your weapons.

732
00:56:24,886 --> 00:56:27,017
<i>Drop them at once.</i>

733
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:32,381
Your Excellency, we must not let
this escalate into a confrontation.

734
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,477
May you abate your wrath.

735
00:56:39,334 --> 00:56:41,081
Drop your weapons!

736
00:56:41,257 --> 00:56:42,530
Now!

737
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:03,801
Your Excellency,

738
00:57:04,015 --> 00:57:06,175
I shall be responsible
for any misdeed committed.

739
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:10,323
But should we not
solve this impasse first?

740
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:13,727
How dare you speak after what you did?

741
00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:16,788
Yes, I shall accept any punishment.

742
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:19,946
However, I suggest we both
drop our weapons,

743
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,725
and let Their Excellencies
be escorted out of here.

744
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,947
Drop your weapons at once!

745
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:45,064
Drop yours as well.

746
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,886
Your Excellencies,
may you leave the premises.

747
00:58:00,354 --> 00:58:03,586
Here... May you leave.

748
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,166
You knaves!

749
00:58:59,238 --> 00:59:02,371
What are you doing?
Stop at once!

750
00:59:05,103 --> 00:59:06,465
Stop!

751
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,682
Protect Their Excellencies!

752
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:16,155
Follow me, Your Excellency.

753
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:18,363
Protect the council members!

754
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:33,233
Here it is.

755
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,224
Right between the
eighth and ninth rib.

756
00:59:38,353 --> 00:59:42,717
However, it must
not be a deep wound.

757
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:46,248
Yes.

758
00:59:53,915 --> 00:59:55,717
No... No!

759
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,190
Father!

760
00:59:57,276 --> 00:59:59,668
His Excellency has been wounded!

761
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,198
They hit the Sangdaedeung!

762
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:03,914
<i>His Excellency was wounded!</i>

763
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,291
The Sangdaedeung has been stabbed!

764
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:11,581
The Sangdaedeung has been harmed!

765
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:14,256
<i>His Excellency is down!</i>

766
01:00:18,836 --> 01:00:21,711
<i>His Excellency has been wounded!</i>

767
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:32,269
What did I just hear?

768
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:37,447
Th...They wounded...

769
01:00:38,562 --> 01:00:40,875
the Sangdaedeung.

770
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:56,165
His Excellency the Sangdaedeung
was attacked in the capital!

771
01:00:56,494 --> 01:00:58,382
This is an armed insurrection.

772
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:00,713
To stop this coup from happening...

773
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:06,792
Battalion!
Let us march for the capital!

774
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,321
It's a coup.

775
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:44,293
Mishil's coup.

Staging a coup was
her only way to achieve that.

784
01:02:34,075 --> 01:02:38,209
They attempted to murder the

Her Highness instigated it?
