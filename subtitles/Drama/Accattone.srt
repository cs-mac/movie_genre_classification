1
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,707
God's Angel took me up,
and he of hell

2
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,415
Shouted, "O thou of heaven,
why dost thou rob me?

3
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,749
"Thou bearest away
the eternal part of him,

4
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,499
"For one poor little tear,
that takes him from me..."

5
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,165
Well, this is really the end!

6
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,832
Now I can see you.
In daylight for the first time.

7
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,582
Are your women on strike?

8
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,332
You're still alive?
They say work will kill you.

9
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,374
It's an honourable death!

10
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,457
Hey, martyr!
Listen to me, quit working.

11
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,374
Come and join us
at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

12
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,707
What makes you do it?

13
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,124
Sleep at night
instead of playing cards.

14
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,290
It's like a morgue here.

15
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,624
Here's a man who knows Scucchia.
Come here.

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,040
You tell them what happened
to poor Barberone.

17
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,332
Weren't you here when
he decided to make that bet

18
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,249
with The German and Peppe the Nut?

19
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,290
He said that he'd eat
a kilo of potatoes,

20
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,415
a bag of persimmons,
and then swim without any problem.

21
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,582
Yeah, so?

22
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,624
And that Peppe the Nut
wanted him to cross the river

23
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,332
to the other side and back,
not just dip in and out.

24
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,665
- Yes.
- He didn't die of indigestion.

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,874
He was exhausted.
He'd never crossed the river.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,332
You dope!

27
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,374
You can't eat a meal
and then go swimming. You'd die.

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,082
The reaction from heat to cold
stops your digestion,

29
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,040
the blood circulation,
and that's it!

30
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:37,165
I lost my money,
but I still have my ring to bet.

31
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,582
Bet, if you have the nerve.
You're all talk.

32
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:45,290
You're stubborn.
Yeah! I want to kill you, too.

33
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:51,249
What are you alive for anyway?

34
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,624
The cemetery has room
for everybody.

35
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,082
Your brother's courage
would have won the war.

36
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,832
Besides the ring, if I make it,

37
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,124
- I'll spit in your face!
- Save your breath, you'll need it.

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,582
Come on. Maybe your brother'll
make you his substitute.

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,040
- I'm going to work.
- He said a bad word!

40
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,790
And my 1,000 lire?
Before killing yourself, pay me back!

41
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,749
Buy a wreath if I die.

42
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,040
What's 1,000 lire?

43
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:38,040
So give me another 1,000,
take up a collection right now.

44
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,457
Accattone, who are you leaving
your Maddalena to?

45
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,332
The vice squad!

46
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,749
Joking aside, Accattone,

47
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,582
you know, I'm an educated person.
You can trust me.

48
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,040
Can I help you with your funeral?

49
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,665
With my friends laughing,

50
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,790
and if anybody cries,
he pays for the dinner.

51
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,707
And what do we write
on your stone?

52
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,124
"Try it yourself."

53
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,665
You're diving
with all your gold on?

54
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,082
Not taking off
your chain and bracelet?

55
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:32,457
I want to die with all my gold on me,
like the Pharaohs.

56
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,249
Give it to us!

57
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,374
Come and dive for it.

58
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,957
I've got a stiff neck.
Go on and dive!

59
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,540
Okay, let's satisfy the masses.

60
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,332
Hey, lunatic,
you could've warned me!

61
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,915
The digestive tract,

62
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,874
the circulatory reaction...
But Accattone...

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,040
Not even the river
can carry away Accattone.

64
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:21,249
The wise guys,
the Hun and Peppe the Nut.

65
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,040
He did it!

66
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,874
I'm alive.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,415
You wanted to sing
the funeral march.

68
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,790
I've still got to make
lots of people cry.

69
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,374
Saint Barberone protected you.

70
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:42,582
Barberone was like this,
with his eyes wide open,

71
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,790
his belly swollen like a drum.

72
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,874
God, he was ugly!

73
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,124
Who carried off Barberone,
Christ or the Devil?

74
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,582
They're fighting over him.

75
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,999
Let's have a swim.

76
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,415
Let's go, German.

77
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,665
Accattone,
I was supposed to tell you,

78
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,790
Maddalena was hit
by a motorcycle.

79
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:36,082
She's hurt. She's home now,
bandaged like a mummy.

80
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,207
I knew it. Good thing I remembered.
Come on.

81
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,665
- When?
- Two hours ago.

82
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,332
- And I came to look for you.
- Come on.

83
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,790
Well? What happened?

84
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,457
See for yourself. The bastards!

85
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,415
I'd like to know where your head is
when you're walking!

86
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,415
Stay home, then.

87
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,290
What's the use of you going out?

88
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,582
If they hit you,
then I'd be rid of you.

89
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,332
I was going to pay
for the shirt I bought you.

90
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,915
1,000 lire I pay every morning.

91
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,707
And you had yourself
all bandaged up.

92
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,499
Afraid you'll lose your leg?

93
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,624
Did I tell the doctor?
It must've been necessary.

94
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,124
Nannina! Nannina!

95
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,290
Don't let anybody in,
understand?

96
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,457
- Salvatore, how's things?
- I get by.

97
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,415
Milk for the kid.

98
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,249
- You have any?
- Thanks, but don't worry about us.

99
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,332
I'm mad as all hell.

100
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,290
Has your husband written?

101
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,540
I know what jail is.

102
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,874
With so many things on your mind,
you never feel like writing.

103
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,707
Don't worry.

104
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,207
The Madonna sees all
and provides for all.

105
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,124
- Is Accattone at home?
- Should I call him for you?

106
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:45,457
Yeah, I'd like to meet him,
this cardboard man.

107
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,749
A friend of my husband
wants to talk to you.

108
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,499
- Who is it?
- Salvatore, his pal.

109
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,874
My God, what does he want?

110
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,040
Ask him to wait a minute.
He'll be right there.

111
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,874
Be careful now,
he's big buddies with Ciccio.

112
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,707
Ciccio must have sent him.

113
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,249
What do I care?

114
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,415
He's young,
but he's the biggest pimp in Naples.

115
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,790
He'll kill for nothing.
All the time he's done...

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,249
You are Master Accattone, right?

117
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,082
Pleased to meet you,
Salvatore from Torre Annunziata.

118
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,082
- Nice to meet you.
- Sorry to bother you.

119
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,540
I was in the neighbourhood
on personal business,

120
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,915
so I took the opportunity
to make your acquaintance.

121
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,499
So you're Ciccio's young friend?

122
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,249
We're closer than a father and son.

123
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,540
- Poor Ciccio. He's had bad luck.
- To each his own.

124
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,915
I wanted to thank you.
You're big-hearted.

125
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:19,165
You took this girl in
and helped her and her kids,

126
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,374
who were starving to death.

127
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,915
What does it cost me?
A bowl of soup here and there?

128
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,582
- Let's drink on it?
- Why not?

129
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,874
Maddalena, be a good girl.

130
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,082
Let me introduce my friends.

131
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,415
All bums, that's us.

132
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,582
Used-up men.

133
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,749
We're rejects. Only worth something
with 1,000 in our pocket.

134
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,749
If not, we're worth nothing.
They don't even want us in jail.

135
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:26,124
We're through because
we can't manage on our own.

136
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,624
Better be a thief
than do our lousy job.

137
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,707
If I could relive my life,
I'd make a different fate.

138
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,249
You're a good kid.

139
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,707
Don't take it so hard.
It's in God's hands.

140
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,165
I should have met you before.

141
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,374
See what's happened to Ciccio,
your partner,

142
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,499
that could happen to me,
you know that.

143
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,749
Maddalena met me.

144
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,040
"You're a better man than Ciccio,

145
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,249
"your heart is more noble
than Ciccio's."

146
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,457
That's what she kept telling me
to convince me, the bitch.

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,124
And besides, Ciccio had five kids
and he hit me all the time!

148
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,415
So she turned him in.

149
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,790
Poor Ciccio, there he is!

150
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,499
What are all the tears for?
You don't break any hearts.

151
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,415
When you're begging,
you brought tears to the eyes

152
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,665
even of the cops.

153
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,124
Now you're not touching,
you're a mess.

154
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,374
Look, Balilla!
You're through, too!

155
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,332
Come here and drink,
drown your sorrows.

156
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,874
When did he ever suffer?

157
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,165
I'll say he suffered,
16 years in the orphanage.

158
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,540
- Are these your friends?
- Nice to meet you.

159
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,457
- The Honoured Society!
- Poor guys!

160
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,415
Drink.

161
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,457
Damn all women!

162
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,332
They take you up to heaven
and then they drop you.

163
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,957
Up there amid the angels

164
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:28,207
They sang for you alone, Maria

165
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,540
Ah, give me back that angel

166
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:38,874
The fair sex!
When I go home she'll hear me.

167
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,415
She turned in my friend's pal,
a fine man, to be with me.

168
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,207
To ruin me, too, the prostitute!

169
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,915
Curse her! May she never have
a moment's peace.

170
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:55,124
Don't worry, Ciccio's in good hands
with the custodians of order.

171
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,999
You should see the pretty girls we've
brought from Naples to Torre Annunziata.

172
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:05,374
One more stacked than the other.
If you don't believe me, ask my friends.

173
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,415
Classy stuff, chic goods.

174
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,957
Little girls, 18 years old. Special!

175
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,874
Accattone, you should've been
with us last night.

176
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,582
There was me,
Tintura and Il Droga.

177
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,332
- We picked up a hooker.
- Good boys.

178
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,124
First we acted sweet.

179
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,415
We took her to the field
then we beat her.

180
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,874
What a beating!
You should've seen it.

181
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,707
How she cried,
how she begged us!

182
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,874
She's still yelling,
"Oh, God. Oh, God!"

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,915
We're amazing.
We're the terror of Rome!

184
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,582
What happened?

185
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,624
What do you care what happened?
Are you my mother?

186
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,165
Oh, the wine goes to your head
and you take it out on me?

187
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,290
Not working tonight?

188
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,707
Do you think you can stay here?
You don't draw unemployment.

189
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,499
Look, handsome,
can't you see the state I'm in?

190
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,832
You think this is a joke?
I got a broken leg!

191
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,082
Broken?
You make me laugh, broken!

192
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,749
You work tonight,
the same as every night, the same!

193
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,290
You can't play the lady,
that's your life!

194
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,582
You think you bought me with
the dirty money you give me every day?

195
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,374
You ruined me!

196
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,915
I'd have been a good worker now,
or a thief!

197
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,832
I wouldn't be here!
You better work tonight.

198
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,499
Or I'll break your other leg, too.
Then it'll be over with.

199
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,665
I won't go to prison
Because I did nothing

200
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,957
May all the police in the city
Have a stroke

201
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,999
Go sing elsewhere! First you get drunk,
then you come to vomit here?

202
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,874
You're not romantic,
they're serenading you. Crummy whore!

203
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,832
Come and cook yourself
a couple of eggs,

204
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,790
you're nothing but bones.

205
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,999
You should end up like Nero,
you and these bastards!

206
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,165
Let's stay up here.
Down there it stinks.

207
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,540
Pick on your own kind.
Shame on you!

208
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,207
Ugly killer, I should stab you,
that's what.

209
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,624
Don't get mad.

210
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,165
You're crazy.

211
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,499
Look at that leg!

212
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,040
Who made you come here
in that condition?

213
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,665
If you die, nobody's going to cry.
At least if you did it for yourself...

214
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,040
You mean that my man
doesn't take care of me?

215
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,707
At least he's good
and he loves me.

216
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,999
Sure, he loves you.

217
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,207
Tongue, behave!
Or I'll bite you off!

218
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,832
Be like me,
I don't love anybody any more.

219
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,749
And they call me Amore.

220
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,040
Look what those punks are doing!

221
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,874
Leave the poor guy alone!

222
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,290
I wish all the worst for you. Jailbirds!

223
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:52,332
- Let's see you in the light, come.
- A car, or it's off.

224
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,749
Don't worry.

225
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,957
It's parked over there,
nice and close.

226
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,165
Bye, Amore.

227
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,707
You like Neapolitans?

228
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,749
Don't take us for Italians,
we Neapolitans are special.

229
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,040
There's our car.

230
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,790
Get in, get in.

231
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,915
We've met before.

232
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,290
- We're old friends.
- Who are you?

233
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:38,582
What? Have you forgotten me
already?

234
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,832
We were good friends.

235
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,749
The friend of Ciccio who's in jail,
remember?

236
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,915
Let me get a better look.

237
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,915
Yeah, you came
to my house today.

238
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,624
It took you a while,
but you got there.

239
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,499
What did you want
with Accattone?

240
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,915
He's a real good kid,
a pearl of a man.

241
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,374
Where are we going?

242
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,874
Now that you're here
with these friends of mine

243
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,415
who want to have a good time,
we'll go where we like.

244
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,582
Ah, what a beautiful spot!

245
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,249
Gennarino,
what are you waiting for?

246
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,457
Have you gone to sleep?

247
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,540
I don't like this place, I'm afraid.

248
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,957
Afraid? What are you afraid of?

249
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:11,582
I've never been here before.
The ditches, and the sheepdogs.

250
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,207
Let's go somewhere else.

251
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,540
What do you think I am, an animal?
Take your hands off me! I'll get out.

252
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,457
You get mad fast!
Instead you ought to be glad.

253
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:26,540
I was kidding.
I'm a physical kind of guy.

254
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,415
Why don't you be nice?
Let's go somewhere else.

255
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,957
With my leg bandaged, I can hardly
walk. Let's go somewhere else.

256
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,207
Don't worry.

257
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,999
Gennarino, go ahead.

258
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,165
Give me your hand, I'll help you.
Trust Gennarino.

259
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,624
We're all here.

260
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,499
Don't worry.

261
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,999
Your Anna has died

262
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:08,957
And they buried her

263
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:17,499
She always cried
Because she slept alone

264
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:25,082
Now she sleeps

265
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:30,415
Accompanied by the dead

266
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,790
What's she got in this bag?

267
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,374
She doesn't have two pennies
to rub together.

268
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,915
Damn.

269
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,415
Here they are.

270
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:35,915
Well?

271
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:47,540
Turn them off!
You want to blind me?

272
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,540
He'd crush you like a snake.

273
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,582
Have you gone crazy?
Leave me alone.

274
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:10,957
Pay no attention.
He's a hick, this guy. No style.

275
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,540
Get up. What are you doing?
Can't you stay on your feet?

276
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,249
Help! Oh, God! Oh, God!

277
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:33,082
Oh, God! No. No!

278
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:53,749
Help!

279
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,207
Don't leave me here alone!

280
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,290
I won't say anything!

281
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,540
Italy awakes!

282
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,499
What have you done?
You look kind of down.

283
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:47,457
Not at all!
I'm a free citizen.

284
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:51,415
My woman didn't come home last night.
They must have beaten her.

285
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:54,707
- I want to die!
- Hang yourself!

286
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,624
Laugh, you've gambled away
your food.

287
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,540
What are you going to do now?
Going to collect rags?

288
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:03,249
You'll be selling holy cards.

289
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,040
Get busy, kid,
or you'll starve to death.

290
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,790
Damn.

291
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,874
Easy, fellow Italians, behave.

292
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,332
Cops are on the way.
Act natural.

293
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:41,207
I'm going to church
to clean up the sacristy.

294
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,040
Listen, you...

295
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,582
Me? You've got the wrong guy.

296
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,249
Yes, you. Just a minute.

297
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,624
- Something wrong?
- Papers.

298
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,457
Who has their papers?
I can remember my name.

299
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:06,165
- What do I need my documents for?
- Papers.

300
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:09,040
Why?

301
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,415
Come along for a verification.

302
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:17,332
Out of 3 million inhabitants in Rome,
you have to pick me for a verification?

303
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,082
If you want a coffee...

304
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:23,749
- Come on, let's go. Don't be an idiot.
- Let go. Take your hands off me.

305
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,957
Don't make a fuss
and it'll be quick.

306
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,415
I'm not coming.
I'm fine where I am.

307
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:42,624
Go on, you tell him, too,
since you're his friends.

308
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,374
Isn't it better for him
if he comes quietly?

309
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,124
Okay, I'm coming! Enough!
I didn't do anything. Let's go.

310
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,082
You realise you've kept me here
for three hours?

311
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,040
What do you want?

312
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,665
I don't bother anybody.
You shouldn't bother me.

313
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:18,707
You have to let me go.
I'm fed up being here!

314
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,415
It's no use yelling.
Be a good boy.

315
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,040
Who has to question me?

316
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,624
Why doesn't he question me
and let me go?

317
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,415
I'm fed up being here!

318
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:33,207
Enough's enough, I don't know
anything. What do you want?

319
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,374
What do you want with me?

320
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,999
I'm sick, and you'll pay
or send me home.

321
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,915
You're making me mad,
you know.

322
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,624
Take it easy and sit down.
You're not at your house.

323
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,665
The sergeant will call you
when it's convenient.

324
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,082
When it's convenient?

325
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,415
I'm not waiting
for anybody's convenience!

326
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:03,332
I want to go! I've had enough!

327
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,874
Shut up, and sit down!

328
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,915
What are you doing?

329
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,165
Let me go!

330
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,665
Keep still!

331
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,624
Hold him, tight.

332
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,665
- I didn't do anything!
- We need a straitjacket.

333
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,499
- Let me go. I didn't do anything!
- Stop!

334
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,040
Oh, God.

335
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,415
Do you recognise anybody?
Don't be afraid.

336
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,832
No.

337
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,499
Get out. Go.

338
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,207
These?

339
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,999
No.

340
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:23,374
I recognise him, it's him!
It's him!

341
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,707
What's this all about?

342
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,332
Are you sure of what you're saying?
Look carefully.

343
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,374
It's them.
I saw their faces clearly.

344
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,124
The other one, too.
It's them.

345
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,999
Hey, Sarge, she's crazy!

346
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,457
Send her to the nuthouse!

347
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,415
You trying to ruin me, you bitch?

348
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,707
You must be sure,
because you can ruin them.

349
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,332
I swear on my mother, it's them.

350
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,415
These bastards,
they ruined me!

351
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,915
What did I do to you?

352
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:57,040
For no reason, they beat me up.
They nearly killed me.

353
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:02,499
- Get them out of here.
- I swear, I didn't do anything!

354
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,707
Now we'll see
if you did anything or not.

355
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,957
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

356
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,832
Pea-brain!

357
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,040
Take care in recognising
your attackers.

358
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:18,040
If anyone proves innocent,
you're in trouble. Be careful!

359
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:22,749
They were with me half an hour,
you think I can't recognise them?

360
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,540
Well?

361
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:53,957
Didn't you say he had brown hair,
kind of stocky?

362
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,124
It wasn't them.

363
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,332
Let's go.

364
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,624
Who wants to buy this ring?

365
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,499
I'm selling gold, not rags.

366
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,915
Accattone!

367
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,124
Accattone, explain something.

368
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,582
They let you go?
You're out already?

369
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:44,415
No, I'm going to jail
just because your girl is so pretty.

370
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,124
That would really be ridiculous.

371
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,165
If the guards hadn't been there,
I'd have eaten her alive.

372
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,082
That bitch!

373
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,874
What do you want from me?
Did I turn you in?

374
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,915
They want to put me in jail, too.
Be glad they let you go.

375
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,082
Stay out of jail
and enjoy your freedom!

376
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,624
She had to report me?
Am I an orphan?

377
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,790
I'd show her.

378
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:10,749
For slander and perjury,
the minimum's two years.

379
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:15,040
What'll you eat then,
soup from the women's prison?

380
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:18,915
Come on, who wants to buy this ring?
Start the bidding.

381
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:24,999
- How much?
- I paid 15,000. I'm asking half, 7,000.

382
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,874
Life's smiling on me today.
I want to make you smile, too.

383
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,832
Take advantage of it.

384
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:41,165
Hear what the prophet says.

385
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,707
Today you sell the ring,
tomorrow the chain,

386
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,790
in seven days the watch,

387
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:52,624
and in 77 days you won't have even
your eyes to weep with.

388
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,582
Accattone, look,
the cemetery's there.

389
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,165
Give it my best.

390
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,374
I don't need a nurse yet.

391
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,499
Did you sell your car?

392
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,499
Is the gold all gone?

393
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,082
You really look like a dirty beggar.
What a way to end up.

394
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,707
Long live us thieves.
We always know where to go.

395
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,707
We stretch out our hand,
we catch something.

396
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,957
Sure, a nice long stretch!

397
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:06,165
Remember,
we're all born with a vocation.

398
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,040
Mine was to be a thief,
and here I am!

399
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,999
You weren't born to be a pimp,
but a beggar... There you are!

400
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:16,124
Don't you have
anything to do today?

401
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,207
Piss off! I was fine
minding my own business.

402
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,957
Get a hold of yourself.

403
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,790
For thieves,
there's no being unemployed.

404
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,790
You're lucky to be so secure.

405
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,624
Not all thieves are rich.

406
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,499
Leave me alone.
The war days are past.

407
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,249
Today, as soon as you step outside,
they put you in jail.

408
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,665
Don't you see
what the police chief's doing?

409
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,790
Iaio!

410
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:48,249
I'm the poor soul of your father.
Don't you know me any more?

411
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,915
Damn.

412
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,249
Your mother lets you
run around like this, all dirty?

413
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,999
Don't you know you're a man?

414
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,624
Give your father a little kiss?

415
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,832
Iaio! Iaio!

416
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:22,915
- What are you doing here?
- Am I robbing your food from you?

417
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,874
Where's my wife?

418
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,207
Where is she?
Earning your son's bread.

419
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:34,040
Go away, the less she sees of you
the better for her.

420
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,957
I get it.

421
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,582
A renaissance family.

422
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:45,207
Laugh it up. Somebody'll kill you.
That's your fate.

423
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:49,124
It's lemon blossom

424
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:53,207
Who can this proper youth be?

425
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:58,332
A working man
or a great gentleman

426
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,707
Have you seen my wife?

427
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,582
Ascenza!

428
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:34,832
Ascenza, here's that
fine husband of yours!

429
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:40,999
- When do you knock off here?
- In a few minutes.

430
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,249
Since six this morning
we've been at it.

431
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,040
These things happen.

432
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,665
Is it hard work?

433
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:31,499
When you need it,
any job is good.

434
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,165
Do they pay you well, at least?

435
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,999
Enough to keep us from starving.

436
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,707
You're new.
I've never seen you before.

437
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,540
Just a month.

438
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,457
I could tell you what Italy needs.

439
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,415
Yes, let's see.

440
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,874
Lincoln freed the slaves.

441
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,707
In Italy, they've just started
with them.

442
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,957
Give me a gun,
and there'd be nobody left standing.

443
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,915
- What's your name?
- Stella.

444
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,999
I'm Vittorio. Nice to meet you.

445
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,790
Stella, star, show me the way,

446
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:46,249
teach me the way

447
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,207
to a bowl of bean soup.

448
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,374
- Hungry?
- Hungry, no. A little appetite.

449
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,332
It's noon. It's that time of day.

450
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,332
Tell me something,
you seem so innocent,

451
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:05,832
like a little girl,
good and not sly. Hmm...

452
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,374
I can't explain.
Are you from Rome?

453
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,999
- Me? Yes.
- Funny.

454
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:20,749
You're lucky,
not to know things.

455
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,290
- Bye, see you later.
- Bye.

456
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,290
I was waiting for you.
I have to talk to you.

457
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:27,665
Didn't you see me?

458
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,415
Will you stop!

459
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,999
Do I need a permit
to talk with you?

460
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:38,124
Do I have to pray to you
like a saint?

461
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,332
We don't have anything
to say to each other.

462
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,624
What we had to say,
we've already said.

463
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,290
That's that!

464
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:52,999
Don't yell!
Don't make a big scene.

465
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,457
Will you go?

466
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,540
I'm not talking to you any more.
Understand?

467
00:44:56,666 --> 00:45:00,790
I don't want anything to do with you,
understand? Go away!

468
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,249
Let me lead my life,
and you lead yours.

469
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:08,665
Don't act like a kid,
listen to my side.

470
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,749
I won't listen to anything.
I know what you want.

471
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,082
There's nothing left,
forget about me.

472
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:21,374
I didn't come begging for anything.

473
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,415
If I want to eat, I can find food
for myself and others.

474
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:28,082
I don't need anything from anybody.
What are you thinking?

475
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,374
You find a way to eat, sure.
Shame on you!

476
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,915
And you come out and say it.
Oh, cut it out.

477
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,832
You've never been good
for yourself or me or your son.

478
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:42,082
This is no land of plenty!

479
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,207
Don't make me say it again!

480
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:50,957
I know, I was lousy.

481
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,374
I made mistakes,

482
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,165
but give me a way to make it up,
to show you what I'm worth.

483
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,374
I'm fed up with this life.

484
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,165
I've decided,
I'm looking for a job.

485
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,249
It's not easy, you know that,
but I intend to find one.

486
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,457
Believing you was
the biggest mistake of my life.

487
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,040
What's wrong? People change.

488
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,415
So, decide before we get
to your house.

489
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:18,249
I don't want to see your idiot
of a brother and your father.

490
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,707
Well, then?

491
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,915
Get out of my sight! Go away!

492
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:33,415
You see how mean your mother is?

493
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,332
She doesn't have a conscience.

494
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,457
She wants you to grow up
without a father.

495
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:42,290
- What does he want?
- What's he doing here?

496
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,499
What does he want?
Someone to support him!

497
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,540
Now he has nobody, understand?

498
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,999
And he comes here
to eat at our expense.

499
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:52,957
Listen, idiot, stop coming here.

500
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,290
Someday, someone's going to
break your neck.

501
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,374
This isn't a soup kitchen.

502
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,457
Go and work if you want to eat.

503
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,165
You want to scare me?

504
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,249
Bash his face in.

505
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:13,457
That'll stop him
acting the bully in our house.

506
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:16,165
Crook! Bum!
Get out of here!

507
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,040
You're a sweet bunch.

508
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,374
The hicks' revenge!

509
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,540
You take it as a joke.

510
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:24,999
Just your nerve! Get out of here!

511
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,290
And remember,
don't come around here again.

512
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:32,749
I don't want your son to see you
and be ashamed of a father like you!

513
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,207
Stop! Stop, Father!

514
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:41,665
Help! Help!
He's got a knife. Hold him.

515
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,665
Hurry! Stop him!

516
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:39,624
Pimp!

517
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:55,915
Bad shape, eh?

518
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:59,540
Jesus, you're changed.

519
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:03,540
When are you going to have one
of those great dinners at Fiumicino?

520
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:08,415
Fish soup and mixed fry.
Do you remember? A dream!

521
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,540
Haven't they jailed you yet?
Piss off!

522
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:16,207
There's a rumour
you haven't eaten for two days.

523
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,749
Is it true?

524
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:20,874
If I vomit on you,
you'll eat for a week.

525
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,707
Oh, you've eaten! You're fine.

526
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,957
And I was so worried
that you were hungry.

527
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:29,624
I wanted to help you out.
Thank Jesus Christ!

528
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,207
Want an Alka-Seltzer?

529
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,832
Piss off! Don't you have
anything to do?

530
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,540
Come here.

531
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,040
You're lucky you can eat bones.

532
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:56,207
"...and in 77 days you won't have
even your eyes to weep with."

533
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,624
This is starvation, Accattone!
Why am I wasting my breath?

534
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,665
An angel will pass
and make it come true.

535
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:06,165
You've 200 lire, Cipolla. Buy us five
sausages, oil, tomato sauce, bread.

536
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,457
And take a taxi!

537
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:10,707
Go on, charge it.

538
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,624
Get it from the bakery.

539
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,749
It's that dumb father of yours
who'll pay.

540
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:18,249
And if his father finds him,
he'll hang him!

541
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,582
Don't the hungry
have a patron saint?

542
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:24,124
If you exist, lend us 2,000 lire.

543
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:31,499
Colonel, I don't want bread
I want a kilo of pasta

544
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,665
Don't worry,
I'll eat it all

545
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,415
Hey, kids, you like sausage?

546
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,957
Clear out or I'll eat you.

547
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:44,665
Accattone, if it wasn't for
the priests today we wouldn't eat.

548
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,082
Read this.

549
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:50,249
"Vatican assistance
for needy families."

550
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,457
Long live the clergy!

551
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,874
Fulvio, light the gas!

552
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,915
What do you want to do,
kill yourselves?

553
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,915
Fulvio, please!

554
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:11,457
Lend us the stove so we can cook
ourselves this spaghetti!

555
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:16,915
- We're hungry.
- Hurry, come up.

556
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:24,249
The stove is free,
we don't have anything to eat.

557
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,040
"It's the universal fast!"

558
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:32,415
Mama, put the water on,
make some pasta for them.

559
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:38,415
Fry, pan, fry!

560
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:42,540
Hurry up, ma'am.
It's a miracle we can stand up.

561
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:44,915
I'll make the sauce.

562
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,165
My speciality! Starvation sauce.

563
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,999
Sit down. Leave it to us!

564
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,249
Excuse us, ma'am.

565
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,499
Today I feel like a great cook.

566
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:19,499
Are you on a diet?

567
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,915
But what's hunger, really?
A bad habit!

568
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,915
It's all in the mind.

569
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,749
Ah, if they hadn't got us
used to eating as kids...

570
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:45,999
Hey, kid, who gave you
the habit of eating?

571
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,957
This starving father of yours?

572
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,665
Accattone, remember that time

573
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,790
when we stole that money
from a blind man to eat?

574
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,040
And the time
we sold your father's false teeth?

575
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:29,707
Hurry, or we'll end up like those guys
in the Nuremburg trials.

576
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,790
Are you game to screw them?

577
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,624
What for?
What do you want to do?

578
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:52,374
There's eight of us
for a plate of spaghetti.

579
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,707
How?

580
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,332
How can we get rid of them?

581
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:00,915
It's nothing.

582
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,165
You insult us,

583
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,999
call us good-for-nothings.

584
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,915
It's an offence to our honour!

585
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,415
I'll take care of them.

586
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:15,915
They'll leave,
and we'll eat the pasta.

587
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,790
Fulvio, they'll make you
a monument!

588
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:37,749
- You've saved four Italians.
- Yeah, a monument.

589
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,040
Right, the more good you do,
the more kicks you get.

590
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:44,874
Look here, what do you think we are?
We're good Christians.

591
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,624
We're grateful.

592
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,624
If you get into trouble, we'll always
find a bowl of soup for you.

593
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,165
Me, if I don't eat,
I stay in my house, not others'.

594
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:56,499
You're insulting us!

595
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,499
You were doing us a favour.

596
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:02,915
- No, giving you charity.
- What charity, you bastard?

597
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,790
Four boys your age

598
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:09,332
and you can't manage to buy meat?
You should be ashamed.

599
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:11,915
Look who's talking about hunger.
Yesterday, your wife told me

600
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:14,582
you ate up all the kids' dinner.
That's enough.

601
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,707
Tell the police about it!

602
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:21,040
You're their informer,
you think people don't know that?

603
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:23,749
Are you kidding
or do you mean it?

604
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:28,249
Kidding?
Everyone's talking about it.

605
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:30,374
Everybody!

606
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,832
Don't pay attention
to this poor idiot.

607
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,665
We're not trash.

608
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,749
We have our pride,

609
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,249
and we're capable of giving you
our pasta as charity.

610
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,957
Pride? What pride?

611
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:48,249
Pride in taking money
from women?

612
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:51,999
Even in jail, nobody associates
with the pimps.

613
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,582
What are you doing?

614
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,707
The Hun's right, we'll all leave.

615
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:04,749
Hunger's driven this jerk crazy.
Let's go.

616
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,707
It was almost done!

617
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,874
I didn't expect an attack like that.

618
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36,165
Me neither.

619
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,332
We've taught him a lesson.

620
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:46,499
- St Bosco, help us!
- Yeah, to die of hunger.

621
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,832
Accattone, how come
you look so pensive?

622
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,832
Is your arse itching?

623
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:06,249
Pio, what did you eat at noon?

624
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:09,374
I won't give him this satisfaction!

625
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,165
He's not going to eat that stuff!
I'll throw it out first!

626
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,874
Wait here. I'll bring the stuff
back to him. Leave it to me!

627
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:06,249
- Pio, go on, hurry, start it.
- Why? What's going on?

628
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:11,915
She'll get away. It's a girl.
Move, or we'll lose her.

629
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,290
- What do you guys want? Get out.
- One for all and all for one!

630
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,999
Now these bastards
will ruin everything.

631
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,749
Move it.

632
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:40,332
You'll pay for this. If I lose out,
you'd better run away.

633
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:43,499
You're making all this fuss
over a woman!

634
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:05,124
Hello, don't you recognise me?

635
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,624
Oh, hi.

636
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:11,457
Not working today?

637
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,249
I just finished.
I gave myself a half day off work.

638
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,249
- You're off?
- Yes, off.

639
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:19,207
A pawn ticket's about to expire.

640
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:22,332
It's a medal of my father.
I don't want to lose it.

641
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,374
- You're taking the tram?
- Yes, I'm going to catch it now.

642
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,540
If you want, I've got a friend's car.
There it is.

643
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:32,915
That's all right,
I'll take the tram.

644
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:38,457
We don't have anything to do anyway.
We'll go for a ride.

645
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,165
Come on,
don't be embarrassed!

646
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:44,665
Embarrassed?

647
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,124
My friends.

648
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,165
They'll leave right away.

649
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:58,999
They're all invited to a banquet.
The last supper.

650
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,332
Nice to meet you.

651
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:04,707
Sit in the middle.
You can take the tram tomorrow.

652
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:12,332
- Where're we going?
- The pawn shop.

653
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:29,915
What are they doing?

654
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,082
Producing.

655
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,874
Stop, stop, let me see.

656
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,707
You really want to look?
You like it?

657
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,415
Turn back. Are they bad women,
those two?

658
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:06,582
Bad women?
Can't you see how good they look?

659
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:11,957
- Never seen any?
- I want to look at them.

660
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,249
Look, then!

661
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,874
Now what? Some girl she is.
When will you wake up?

662
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,749
What are they doing?

663
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,165
They're doing what all women do.

664
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,707
Poor things.

665
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,374
Poor things?

666
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,290
They're smart kids,
smarter than you'd ever dream of!

667
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:37,415
What's to look at?
Have I got scabs?

668
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:40,415
Amore, don't you recognise me?

669
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,165
Is that you?

670
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,415
I didn't recognise you.

671
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,624
You're getting old.

672
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,457
I'm the best on the market.

673
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:56,540
Who's this? I don't know her.

674
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:59,415
What do you think?
She's in another class.

675
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,749
Ah, another class?

676
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,499
How's Maddalena?

677
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,624
Does she write to you?
They gave her a year.

678
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,874
- Her fault!
- You don't care about Maddalena.

679
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,040
Me, I'm smart,
not having a man.

680
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,790
Can't you change the subject?

681
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:22,999
My God,
you treat this poor child badly.

682
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,165
Dress her decently
when you send her out.

683
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:29,540
This dress is a rag,
and look at those shoes.

684
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:32,999
Mind your own business!
Pio, move!

685
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,582
Dumb hooker!

686
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:45,749
She's right,
you're kind of ragged.

687
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:48,790
This is the only dress I've got.

688
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:52,332
I have to give my folks
the money I make.

689
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:56,582
I'll bring you a dress.

690
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:01,249
- Will you really bring it?
- Why not?

691
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,874
You bring a dress,
I'll get the shoes.

692
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,665
Laugh, Stella.

693
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,915
Iaio, forgive me, I'm a bum.

694
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,832
A pair of shoes, 6,000 lire.

695
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:13,124
Where would I get 6,000 lire?

696
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:39,374
If he'd just let her leave,
this dirty hick.

697
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:24,999
Iaio, don't you ever recognise me?

698
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,207
I'm your father, after all.

699
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:32,290
Give Papa a little kiss.

700
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,582
A little kiss. Come on.

701
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,915
A good kiss. Come here.

702
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,332
The things I have to do.

703
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,707
Bye, behave yourself.

704
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:07,332
Now you're really a star in name
and in fact. It's clothes that count.

705
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,540
- Give me 1,000 lire.
- Yeah, we're rich.

706
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:18,290
Accattone, what's
the sudden inspiration?

707
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:22,457
If you want to eat,
the food stall's in the other direction.

708
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,082
Are you happy?

709
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:34,249
I'm happy,
you've both been so good.

710
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,540
Nobody's ever done
anything like this for me.

711
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:41,040
What did we do?
You deserve it, you're a fine girl.

712
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:43,374
I hope I can repay you.

713
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,040
The final touch!

714
01:07:56,958 --> 01:08:00,082
A little kiss? Come on.

715
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,707
And Pio, too.

716
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:09,915
We're all crazy.

717
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,665
- Bye, then.
- You're leaving already?

718
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:17,124
I got to go to the shop,
my wife's expecting me.

719
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:20,207
See you tonight.

720
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:21,832
- Bye.
- Bye.

721
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,540
- Bye, Pio.
- Bye.

722
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,999
- Thanks.
- Take care of yourself! Bye.

723
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,915
You're loyal.

724
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,874
Let's go this way.

725
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,499
Mind if we walk like this?

726
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,624
I already know, I love you.

727
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:59,582
It doesn't take me long
when a person deserves it.

728
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:04,332
Don't you feel anything for me?

729
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,457
I'm serious.
Don't you believe I love you?

730
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:10,540
- I swear.
- Why?

731
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:14,082
Why? First of all
because I like your looks.

732
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:18,749
Second, because you seem
different, helpless, alone.

733
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,624
And you need some comfort, too.

734
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,457
We're good together,
don't you think?

735
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:40,915
- I should make you a speech.
- Mussolini made speeches.

736
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:44,790
No, don't joke. This is serious.
I've got to tell you.

737
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,999
I want you to know
everything about me.

738
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,832
My father died in the war.

739
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:54,624
- Can I talk?
- Talk, talk.

740
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:59,082
My father died, and my mother
managed by being on the street,

741
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:02,165
like those women
we saw yesterday.

742
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:10,832
I'm saying this so you won't think
the wrong thing of me.

743
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,207
Let's go this way.

744
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:51,207
I feel only hate for my mother,
even if she did it for me.

745
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,915
There were other ways.

746
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,707
What did she do?
Instead of feeling sorry...

747
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:59,082
It's a mother's situation.
Cheer up.

748
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,540
When a person does that,
they love you.

749
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,874
It's not her profession,
she did it for you.

750
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,207
Don't you understand?

751
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:14,374
You ought to make her
a monument.

752
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:21,457
Are you mad, Vittorio?

753
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:25,165
Don't call me Vittorio,
call me Accattone.

754
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,165
There are lots of Vittorios,
I'm the only Accattone.

755
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,499
Those beads look nice on you!

756
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,290
It was a lovely thought.

757
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,332
Have you ever been with a man?
Tell me the truth.

758
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,124
A few times.

759
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,999
And what did you do?

760
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,040
We talked...
I don't know, what else?

761
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,499
Let's go over there.

762
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,582
Then nobody's touched you.
Is that true?

763
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,499
Is that true?

764
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,415
What's happened to Accattone?

765
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:48,415
Nothing. He's in love.

766
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:51,624
The happiest of men,
the smart guy!

767
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:56,874
In love? What do you mean?

768
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,499
You're telling fairy tales.

769
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,957
If you tell me Accattone's hungry,
I believe it.

770
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:07,415
- But in love? Hmm!
- If he's dumb, yes.

771
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:09,707
Here comes the prodigal son!

772
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:11,999
Come over here!

773
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:15,957
What do you want?

774
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,249
What's happened to your brother,
Accattone?

775
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,624
He's disappeared for three days.

776
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,374
You guys should know,
you're his friends.

777
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:28,249
- You on the way home from work?
- Yes, so?

778
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,290
You follow your brother's example?

779
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:32,957
Shame on you!

780
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:36,874
Your brother makes others do
all the work, your degenerate brother!

781
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:44,749
For us, it's always a holiday,
for you only May 1st!

782
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:50,165
You say Accattone isn't in love?

783
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:54,332
What's wrong? You got the fever?
Get your brain examined.

784
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,415
Can you imagine him in love?

785
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,915
Look, I've got good eyes.

786
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,874
Who's Accattone anyway?
The tough guy of Rome?

787
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,832
I tell you, basically he's stupid.

788
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,624
But he's got the profession of pimp
in his blood.

789
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,207
Bread is bread.

790
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:16,040
I say in 10 days at the most
we'll see Stella on the street.

791
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:19,415
- What'll you bet?
- Anything you like.

792
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:24,082
Your jacket, and if I win,
I'll give it to the orphans.

793
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,915
Listen to me.

794
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:33,207
If Maddalena hears anything about
Accattone having another woman

795
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:35,874
and putting the poor bitch to work,

796
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,332
nobody'll keep her
from sending him to jail.

797
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,624
"Orate, frates."

798
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:03,415
Drink and get drunk
and you'll make the cops come.

799
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,249
Are you paying? Piss off!

800
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,040
You're a mess.

801
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:11,249
Here's to you!

802
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:15,957
- You hear how they're in love?
- Men!

803
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:20,957
Look at these who have their men,
look at these two lost souls.

804
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,415
They've been in the life,
and what do they have?

805
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:28,040
They don't have anything,
not even a bit of gold.

806
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:33,082
- We wear that.
- You need a man beside you.

807
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:36,999
At night when I come home,

808
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:40,540
if nobody's there, I feel like crying.
You understand?

809
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,290
Accattone, excuse me...

810
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,749
There's those two guys.

811
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,124
Guys with cash.

812
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:12,915
They like that girl. She doesn't look
like a whore and they like that.

813
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:15,082
Want me to fix it up?

814
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:16,915
It's just some company.

815
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:21,040
Let him step up.
Do I have to throw her at him?

816
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:40,874
May I have this dance?

817
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:44,082
Dance with the gent.

818
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,707
Allow me.

819
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:56,957
Look at that dope.

820
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:00,249
Ah, Stella...

821
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:04,582
You're trapped, too,
and don't know it.

822
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,957
"All hope abandon ye
who enter here."

823
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,749
I bet the jacket.

824
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,790
You win!

825
01:17:15,916 --> 01:17:17,790
I've got a nasty eye.

826
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,957
I thought you'd fallen.
Congratulations. You're an artist.

827
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:26,415
Nice jacket. A real man's jacket.

828
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,624
- For me?
- Yes, it's for you.

829
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,249
Go with God.

830
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:46,707
The dope's got long arms,
he's having a try.

831
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,540
Okay, cut it out.

832
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:31,832
Who'll bet all we've drunk tonight
that I'll jump off the bridge?

833
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,999
I'll jump off the bridge.

834
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,665
And die like Tosca!

835
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:39,415
You don't believe me?
Then bet, you clowns!

836
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:41,249
And with my clothes on!

837
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:44,290
Don't go too far.

838
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:51,624
The guy's drunk, he'll really jump.

839
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,540
Run!

840
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,749
Let him jump, then!

841
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:03,124
Stop! I can't run any more.

842
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:08,249
Stop. I can't breathe.

843
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,957
The water's cold!

844
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:19,957
- What was I thinking?
- At least put a stone around your neck.

845
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:23,915
I understand you.

846
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:27,457
Is the fit over
or do I call for a straitjacket?

847
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:29,874
Ah, here we go again.

848
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:48,082
Aren't you ashamed?
Wash your face.

849
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:51,124
You're so drunk.
It's disgusting.

850
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:57,749
Good! You see, when you want to,
you understand things.

851
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:06,124
What are you doing?

852
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:08,915
Now what are you up to?

853
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,540
You're cute!

854
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:49,790
Hi, Vittorio.

855
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,415
What's wrong?

856
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,790
Why should anything be wrong?

857
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:02,082
Can't you see?
I make myself sick.

858
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,374
Before I met you, who was I?

859
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:08,999
I had a car and plenty of money

860
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,915
and everything I wanted.

861
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:14,665
Clothes, watches, rings, bracelets.

862
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,290
Gold!

863
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:18,290
And now I'm waiting for manna
from Heaven.

864
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,915
Find a job, then.

865
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:25,499
Doing what?
Giving other people my blood?

866
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:28,874
I'm not letting anybody
drink my blood. Work?

867
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:31,874
Animals work.

868
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:46,290
Last night you had
the time of your life.

869
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:52,165
You let that dope cheer you up
by the river.

870
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,790
If you'd shown
some respect for me...

871
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,915
I thought you were different.

872
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:01,624
It's the first time
I've made a mistake.

873
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,165
Embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

874
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:06,415
They laughed behind my back.

875
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:10,374
I thought that was how I should act.

876
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,040
I told you to dance with him.

877
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:16,207
Instead, you wanted to be
the sophisticated lady.

878
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:18,874
You wanted the honeymoon.
You liked him, didn't you?

879
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,665
Deny it!

880
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:24,165
- Now you're insulting me.
- I'm insulting you?

881
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:27,165
You insulted me.
You had fun behind my back.

882
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,332
You offended my pride!

883
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:34,957
I should have expected it from you.

884
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,957
Like mother, like daughter.

885
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,582
I know where you want to lead me.

886
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:48,082
I expected it, believe me.

887
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,749
Don't get too worked up.
I know what you want from me.

888
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,707
Ah, you know! Then do it!
What are you waiting for?

889
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,749
Why do you talk to me like this?

890
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:03,915
You know I'm not experienced.

891
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:06,374
I've been through sorrows
and hard times.

892
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,249
I'm not like the other girls.

893
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:12,790
How should I know what to do,
what not to do?

894
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:14,374
What do I know?

895
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,249
Learn from your cow of a mother.

896
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,915
Now you cry, stupid!

897
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:28,665
If I'd known you'd cry,
I wouldn't have said it.

898
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:30,624
I was kidding.

899
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,874
No, you weren't.

900
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,040
I know what you want.
That's your aim.

901
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:44,874
Let's forget about these things.

902
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,915
What matters is that we're in love.

903
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:53,457
One day we'll say
to hell with everything.

904
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:59,207
Our Lady, make me a saint,
I've done my penance.

905
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:06,624
There he is, the beggar!

906
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,582
He's back in business!

907
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,499
Booming, eh, Accattone?

908
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:16,790
I know somebody that
if they saw for themselves

909
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:19,624
would give Accattone
a big surprise!

910
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:23,207
Unfortunately she can't see or hear,
lying in her cell

911
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:26,790
counting the days on the pisspot.

912
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:29,082
Here's the hawk.

913
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:32,457
Well? You hiding?

914
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,915
Afraid of the john
who'll take you away?

915
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:41,415
Now you're here, do what all of us do.
Make peace with yourself.

916
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:44,332
There's no Hell anyway,
and no Heaven.

917
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:47,374
She's ashamed.

918
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,999
I was so ashamed the first time.

919
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:52,999
Now I'm the most shameless of all.

920
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:58,999
Amore! Here comes the sacristan.

921
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:08,415
Run to the man who loves you!

922
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:10,499
Come on, let me in.

923
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:13,082
How about this masterpiece?

924
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,249
Let her be. She's a poor victim.

925
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,874
Well? Shall we get going?

926
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:32,707
Oh, don't tell me
you're really going with her?

927
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:35,332
She's wasting no time!

928
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:38,165
You expect him
to always eat the same dish?

929
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:41,332
Bye, Amore.
I'm being unfaithful to you!

930
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:47,290
Amore, make way for the young.

931
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,832
It's time for you to retire.

932
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:14,415
Do I have to file an application or what?

933
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:39,457
Is this the first time you're doing it?
The first time you...

934
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:42,082
Yes.

935
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:46,332
The world's a big garbage dump,
everything's changed.

936
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:48,790
And one tramp more, one less.

937
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,915
What do you think?

938
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:06,082
So I'm lucky. It's the first time.

939
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:12,040
Are you embarrassed?
You don't even know what it is.

940
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:14,832
Come here. Get moving.

941
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,915
I didn't pick you up
so we could take a drive.

942
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:23,207
I disgust you?
You take me for a dope?

943
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,915
Then why did you come?

944
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:28,124
I don't want to do it.
Take me back.

945
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,999
Take you back?

946
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,415
What did you expect
from this kind of a life? Candy?

947
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:35,749
Take me back.

948
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:40,749
Walk! Go on, get out!
Clear out!

949
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,165
You dope!

950
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:51,040
Hey, look, he's back alone.

951
01:27:51,166 --> 01:27:53,249
Did you lose Accattone's girl?

952
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,374
You sent me off with a nutcase?

953
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,749
What was wrong with her?

954
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:05,124
She started crying.

955
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:07,665
She wouldn't play
so I dumped her there.

956
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:12,415
From the Appian Way
she'll make a pilgrimage here.

957
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,624
What can she do,
the Quo Vadis?

958
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,999
Laugh, damn you! You idiot!

959
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,124
Lend me your bike.

960
01:28:26,166 --> 01:28:28,332
Easy, or you'll kill yourself!

961
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,915
You're leaving?

962
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,665
You leave me like this?

963
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:41,249
- I'm full of poison, if I bite I kill.
- That's how it is?

964
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:43,540
Don't let me lay eyes on you again!

965
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:46,707
Go back to your village,
in Rome you stink!

966
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:51,082
You would have liked
the innocent, eh? Idiot!

967
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:53,290
Amore, watch out, the cops!

968
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:58,082
So what? I'll take it out on them.

969
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:08,040
What do you want? Leave me alone.
I won't go to the police station.

970
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:10,915
I'm in charge of my own life.
I do what I like.

971
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:12,832
Calm down
or we'll take you to the nuthouse.

972
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,707
What do I care!

973
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,665
When is she getting here?

974
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,957
She's going to keep me up
till morning.

975
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,749
Damn it!

976
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:39,999
What a life.

977
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,165
Always fighting for everything.

978
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:46,165
Do I really have
to end up like this?

979
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:50,165
I'm not putting up with it.
Not even for Christ himself.

980
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:51,249
Come in.

981
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:07,790
Maddalena, you're here?

982
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:10,415
Where else? On the Riviera?

983
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:13,582
How are things?

984
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:23,874
Who are you primping yourself for,
may I ask?

985
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:25,999
Why?

986
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:28,832
The man who loved you
has left you.

987
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:31,999
Really?

988
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:34,915
Lina, did you hear her?

989
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:40,374
- Who's he with?
- He's with a young kid.

990
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,374
You don't know her.

991
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,790
Name of Stella. A beautiful girl.

992
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:56,457
He's put her to work, too.
Poor Stella.

993
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:58,790
That man you had is a genius.

994
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:01,999
Bastards. You and him!

995
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,374
What's wrong?

996
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,790
I wanted to report Cataldi Vittorio
known as Accattone.

997
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:19,290
- For what?
- Pimping.

998
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:21,665
- Did he pimp for you?
- No.

999
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:27,415
Who, then?
What are you reporting him for?

1000
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:31,499
Pimping! Don't you understand me?
I told you.

1001
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:33,374
Are you deaf?

1002
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,165
Who is it?

1003
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:40,957
The charge can come only
from the person involved

1004
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:43,290
incited to prostitution.

1005
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:45,249
You don't know him!

1006
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:47,040
He's capable of anything.

1007
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:51,332
He's capable of anything
for his comfort! Even killing.

1008
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:52,874
You've got to jail him!

1009
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,915
He's not worthy of living.
You've got to jail him!

1010
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:57,540
Jail him!

1011
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,165
Where did you find her?

1012
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:14,249
- I'll carry the suitcase.
- Me, too. Me, too.

1013
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,624
I'll carry the stuff.

1014
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,790
Come in.

1015
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:33,374
Stella, introduce yourselves.

1016
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,832
- Pleased to meet you.
- Same here.

1017
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:41,790
We managed before, so we'll
manage now, won't we, Nannina?

1018
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,749
Let me have that.

1019
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,332
Thanks, Nannina.

1020
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:56,582
Are you happy?
This is no palace.

1021
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,290
At least the roof doesn't leak.

1022
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:02,874
- Happy?
- If I'm not a bother.

1023
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,707
There are two possibilities.

1024
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:11,665
Either I've gone crazy,
or I'm sane again.

1025
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,332
You like Marsala?

1026
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,707
- Let's have some?
- There's still some Marsala?

1027
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,499
The great times!

1028
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:25,915
Yeah, let's have a glass.

1029
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:41,957
This Marsala's historic,
if you knew...

1030
01:34:42,708 --> 01:34:44,249
Eh, Nannina?

1031
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:47,165
Let's hope all goes well.

1032
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:54,582
Mamma, us too.

1033
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,790
A little Marsala?

1034
01:35:00,416 --> 01:35:01,874
Thank you.

1035
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:09,749
Here's to us, then.

1036
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,999
And screw them all.

1037
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:13,874
Aren't they a picture?

1038
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:21,790
Here's to Heaven,
and Stella, who's found a home.

1039
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:31,415
The first step's made!

1040
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,915
Hey, brother.

1041
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:39,874
Come on, we'll be late!

1042
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,624
I can't do anything.

1043
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:54,457
Learn.

1044
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:56,249
Here's the cattle car!

1045
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:14,874
The boss is kind of grouchy.

1046
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,749
When you work,
nobody gives you the money.

1047
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:20,749
What a brother!
Who did you take after?

1048
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,874
After St Sebastian the Martyr.

1049
01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:30,499
Good morning.

1050
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:33,832
Sor Pietro,
I told you about my brother.

1051
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:37,665
Changed your mind?

1052
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:43,040
- All right.
- So long, Sor Pietro.

1053
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:44,665
Goodbye.

1054
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:08,124
Hey, Panzone, we're loading.
Where's our iron?

1055
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:11,249
- Over there.
- Is it 80 quintals?

1056
01:37:11,375 --> 01:37:15,040
80! You think I'm robbing you?
80 quintals.

1057
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:16,915
80 quintals.

1058
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,124
There's all this iron in Italy?

1059
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,540
Go on, work hard
and you'll finish quick.

1060
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:27,040
Yeah, finish living.

1061
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:30,957
- How many trips?
- Six, if we really push it.

1062
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,499
Push yourself!

1063
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:51,415
Are we in Buchenwald here?

1064
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:08,415
- And I thought it was easy.
- You fade out fast.

1065
01:38:13,791 --> 01:38:16,624
You're lucky I'm winded,
or I'd kill you.

1066
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:38,790
Working has a bad effect on you.

1067
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:45,540
Come on, one more trip
and we're through.

1068
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:02,707
God's will be done!

1069
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,707
Poor Accattone.
There's a finished man.

1070
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:26,582
Watch out,
the dog catcher's coming!

1071
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:33,540
What's wrong?
Why's he acting like that?

1072
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:37,124
Search me. This morning he looked
like the Statue of Liberty.

1073
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,624
He looked down on everyone.

1074
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:42,874
Hey, victim!
You pathetic case!

1075
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,499
That's enough from you, bastards!

1076
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:47,832
You're so prosaic.

1077
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,540
Vittorio. What have they
done to you?

1078
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,374
My God, what's happened?

1079
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:52,707
I'm a dope, that's what happened!

1080
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:55,915
For 1,000 lousy lire
I went and killed myself.

1081
01:40:56,041 --> 01:40:59,415
I should've had a stroke
instead of going there.

1082
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:01,749
Calm down. Don't say that.

1083
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:04,457
Mind your own business.
That's enough.

1084
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:06,749
Listen. Let me say something.

1085
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:09,415
Skip it, forget it.

1086
01:41:10,416 --> 01:41:14,082
Vittorio,
if you aren't up to working,

1087
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:17,665
I'm ready to go on the street again,
if that's better.

1088
01:41:17,791 --> 01:41:20,124
What are you saying? Shut up!

1089
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:23,332
What do you care about me?

1090
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:25,332
Nobody's going to cry over me.

1091
01:41:26,166 --> 01:41:28,249
You on the street? Cut it out.

1092
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,749
I decided, I'll look after you.

1093
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:33,374
You'll stay at home!

1094
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,915
If I decide something, that's it.

1095
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:38,749
Either the world kills me,
or I kill it.

1096
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:53,832
Mama, wee-wee.

1097
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:33,707
Master Accattone! Master Accattone!

1098
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:37,957
Come here. Sit with us.
Come on.

1099
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:21,665
Aren't you coming?
We're all ready.

1100
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:23,457
We're waiting for you.

1101
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:41,415
Where'd you get all these flowers?

1102
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,457
- Over there.
- Let's go.

1103
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:19,040
What's happened?
Won't you tell me anything?

1104
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:28,374
Will you tell me what's happened?

1105
01:44:36,125 --> 01:44:37,665
I can't hear you.

1106
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:57,957
What's happened?

1107
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:00,499
Don't you know? Accattone's dead.

1108
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:14,040
Vittorio, let's move...

1109
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:39,790
You could've told him not to do it.
What kind of friends are you?

1110
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,915
You can't go in.

1111
01:46:15,958 --> 01:46:17,624
Why not?

1112
01:46:19,166 --> 01:46:20,374
No.

1113
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,207
Say, sir, why don't you dig
a bit further on?

1114
01:47:29,416 --> 01:47:31,957
The earth is all dark here.

1115
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:34,415
Sorry, but I can't.

1116
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,915
Just a bit over there, a little.

1117
01:47:40,041 --> 01:47:41,790
Please, sir.

1118
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,665
There in the light, it's better.

1119
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:49,790
Very well.

1120
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:00,999
Where's Balilla?

1121
01:49:01,875 --> 01:49:04,165
He's filling his tank.

1122
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:07,332
Hey, Balilla, you drunk,
somebody wants you!

1123
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,874
Is it the cops? I'm innocent.

1124
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,582
Balilla, I've got to talk to you.

1125
01:49:15,416 --> 01:49:18,165
Come here and have a drop.

1126
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:30,415
- I don't have a cent.
- So?

1127
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:32,749
I tried working yesterday.
You know, right?

1128
01:49:32,875 --> 01:49:34,707
Shame on you!

1129
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:38,665
What'll we do?

1130
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:41,415
The world belongs to the happy.
Come here, Cartagine.

1131
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:44,290
I'm done.

1132
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,540
Who do we hit?

1133
01:49:50,666 --> 01:49:55,749
We don't do light stuff,
we just trust our luck. Cartagine!

1134
01:49:57,916 --> 01:49:59,415
Here I am!

1135
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:03,499
Blessed be the day I was born.

1136
01:50:18,583 --> 01:50:22,332
- Where are you going?
- Divino Amore sanctuary.

1137
01:50:22,458 --> 01:50:24,332
Take these flowers.

1138
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,749
A present.

1139
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:29,457
Load up this garbage
and take it away.

1140
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,624
You're joking.

1141
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,749
Come on, Cartagine,
always in the mud.

1142
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:38,374
I want to be in the flowers,
damn you!

1143
01:50:49,458 --> 01:50:52,249
For eight hours,
we've been walking.

1144
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:56,874
I've never managed to steal
this damn truck. I have to get even.

1145
01:51:00,166 --> 01:51:01,999
Maybe this is it.

1146
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,999
Damn it! God damn it!

1147
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:41,915
That's enough!

1148
01:52:42,208 --> 01:52:45,874
Put your shoes back on!
You want to gas us?

1149
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,540
You really stink!

1150
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:50,374
Is that my fault?
We've been walking all day.

1151
01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:54,040
You stink worse alive than dead.

1152
01:52:57,916 --> 01:53:00,165
I'll confess something to you.

1153
01:53:00,291 --> 01:53:02,540
You know
when I last washed my feet?

1154
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:08,749
August 15th, at the beach.

1155
01:53:10,125 --> 01:53:13,499
Cinderella's shoe was brought back
by the prince.

1156
01:53:15,166 --> 01:53:17,290
Yours by the fire department!

1157
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,374
Do you realise?

1158
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:31,249
You have a fortune in those feet
to exploit!

1159
01:53:40,375 --> 01:53:42,790
DDT is for killing flies.

1160
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:45,082
You kill horses!

1161
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:11,290
Heaven's sent us this truck.

1162
01:54:11,416 --> 01:54:15,707
It's salami, 20,000 lire at least.
Go, Cartagine.

1163
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:59,707
If you believe in providence,
you don't starve to death.

1164
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:03,457
Stella's right, my poor Stella...

1165
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:27,249
Stop. It's useless to run.
We know who you are.

1166
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:49,957
Oh, God!

1167
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:07,499
Accattone. What's wrong?
How do you feel?

1168
01:56:08,541 --> 01:56:09,874
Accattone...

1169
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:13,749
Ah, now I'm fine.

1170
01:56:18,375 --> 01:56:19,832
Why?
