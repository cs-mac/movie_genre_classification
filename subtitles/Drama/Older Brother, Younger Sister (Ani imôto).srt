How are you Kizo?

16
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:08,938
Not very well, Because of this work

17
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:11,235
We don’t work anymore as we used to

18
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:14,284
of course not.

19
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,584
With you, it was good.

20
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:23,682
We worked hard,
carrying heavy stones

21
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,854
Those are good memories

22
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,265
Kizo, let’s have a drink together after work

23
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:44,690
With pleasure

24
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,591
Life has turned hard for him

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,016
Nowadays, he doesn’t have a work anymore

26
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:03,318
since the river banks have been 
built in concrete.

27
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:07,285
He used to have 7 boats

28
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:10,543
and 70 employees

29
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:13,091
Everyone knew the name AKAZA 

30
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:16,055
Again your stories with 
good-hearted hero

31
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,564
They don’t understand

32
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:30,757
careful

33
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:52,518
Hey, do you know what is Môn doing ?

34
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:53,478
Is she still sleeping ?

35
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,246
Is Ino back at home ?

36
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,468
Daddy

37
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:41,049
next stop is “Tsujiya factory”

38
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,109
you have a day-off today?

39
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:24,903
Yes

40
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,247
I’ll see you at your place later today

41
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,419
What’s the matter ?

42
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,632
Your sister is at your home.

43
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,971
My sister ? since when?

44
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,770
- since five days
- really ? that’s strange.

45
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,283
Good day madam.

46
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,624
What are you doing here?
If the neighbours see you...

47
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:52,260
Stop playing with men
or you end up like your sister.

48
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,056
be careful,

49
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,067
Good day Sir,

50
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,448
Good day,

51
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:05,290
Taichi, hurry up.

52
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:12,850
Anyway, you’ll hear about it very soon

53
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,749
TSUJIYA
NOODLE FACTORY

54
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:37,680
- San
- hello

55
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,058
Today is off?

56
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,691
You’ll see Ino today?

57
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:45,283
He didn’t come to work?

58
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:48,582
As soon as he gets some money,
He disappears

59
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:53,136
But I need him for a job

60
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,681
Please apologise. I’ll tell him

61
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,018
Yes please.

62
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,753
Her sister, Môn,
pays for her nurse school

63
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,343
with the money she took from men

64
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:13,645
then, she has been fired
from her first job

65
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,864
I don’t want you to get involved with Sân

66
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:20,997
Môn has the nerve 
to come back to this village

67
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:25,216
If you let go
I hang myself here.

68
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:30,396
Taiichi, be reasonable, OK ?

69
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:39,210
She looks like an innocent girl,
but Sân is just like her sister

70
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:43,345
Look at her,
her mother was a hair-dresser...

71
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,602
Those two girls are only
smooth talk and nice touch ! 

72
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,124
- Welcome.
- Good day.

73
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:58,257
It’s hot today, isn’it ?
Would you like some cold drink ?

74
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,029
How is the business going ?

75
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,577
Slowly.

76
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:12,626
It would be better
if there wasn’t shoplifters

77
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,004
shoplifters ?

78
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,928
The last time,
It was six cakes.

79
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:18,349
children ?

80
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,064
No, your father and your brother.

81
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,776
But they don’t like cake

82
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,906
Your father steels cake,

83
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:29,669
not for him
but for his former employees.

84
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,883
Ino steels money from the cashdesk

85
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,017
So much trouble on our family...

86
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,190
it’s tragic.

87
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,659
How is he, papa?

88
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:45,918
He is fine, but complaining a lot as usual.

89
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:52,141
Môn is back ?

90
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,232
holidays ?

91
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,071
No she left her job

92
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,491
She resigned ?

93
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,101
What has she done?

94
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,563
Nothing

95
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:13,403
At the factory
they told me that...

96
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:14,823
What did they tell you?

97
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,123
That I should not play with men
like Môn does

98
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:20,337
with men ?

99
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,799
Is that true ?

100
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:24,807
Do you really believe that Môn does it?

101
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,021
Here you are. Eat this

102
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,505
People say that this old Tokiko

103
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,387
is loosing her head.

104
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,394
That is why she is telling stories.

105
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:48,574
Have this drink, It taste good with this

106
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:49,618
Thanks

107
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,548
Someone gave it to me,
but it is too loud.

108
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,260
Was it Môn?

109
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:58,641
Me too, I have a present.

110
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:03,068
Here you are.

111
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,489
What is it?

112
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:11,632
Bamboo sandals.
It’s ideal for summer.

113
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:16,269
It’s very good quality
With nice ribbon...

114
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:19,610
It must be expensive.

115
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:22,534
You told me you would like that model.

116
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:26,085
with your small pay… Thank you.

117
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,050
Can you keep the store ?

118
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,927
Of course

119
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,560
I’ll go shopping.

120
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,798
This really looks worn-out...

121
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:48,557
Of course. It belonged to your brother
Your sister, and you.

122
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,401
Just stay there… If a customer comes

123
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,399
Come on, let’s have a drink

124
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,279
Stop it, it is too early

125
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,242
I have something to ask you.

126
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:13,871
Hell.

127
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:26,319
What’s the matter?

128
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,823
Are you hiding a girlfriend from me?

129
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,285
shut-up.

130
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:52,593
Dad, do you want to try ?

131
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,516
fool !

132
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:01,950
Go back home !

133
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:07,254
What a temper!
You’re disgusting.

134
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,051
What ?

135
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,360
I don’t want to see Môn at home!

136
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,817
Still dragging yourself...

137
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:45,207
She is dreaming of a romance stroll
in the moonlight... ridiculous.

138
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,517
How can you appeal to men
with this face ?

139
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,946
Finally, you come back pregnant

140
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,162
and then, you complain you ache all over

141
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:03,169
You just sleep here all day, like a log.

142
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:15,534
As we don’t know
what egg you are going to lay

143
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,209
you’d better not keep it

144
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,509
I hate baby cry at night.

145
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:29,861
Your boyfriend is clever than you.
after having a good fun,

146
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,785
he drops you.

147
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,753
you don’t even have his address.

148
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:41,097
and you, despite all,
you still love that bastard.

149
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,235
What a fool !
Still being in love...

150
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,300
You will see, your baby will get bigger

151
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,098
and when he is born,

152
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:01,231
you’ll be rejected from the society.

153
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:13,470
Then you’ll have to go to Tokyo
and you’ll die with the baby !

154
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,106
Let that be a lesson to you !

155
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:55,450
Really, because of my sister

156
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,914
you are not allowed to speak to me ?

157
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,758
Yes, it’s because of the grand-ma

158
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:05,183
My father has also been adopted by her

159
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,522
She has nothing in life but work

160
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:16,669
The word "love" makes her sick

161
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,012
To them, Love is bad

162
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:22,727
because it misleads young people.

163
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:29,911
They lost a son during the last war.

164
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,462
If I leave with a woman,
it would be a disaster

165
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:39,602
It is not only
because of your sister

166
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,865
Anyway
if we get along well

167
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:47,580
there would be no trouble
wouldn’t it

168
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:59,820
Taiichi, can’t you go back
to your real family ?

169
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,704
No, they have seven sons….impossible

170
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:08,132
I don’t want them to argue

171
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:10,763
You are all old-fashioned

172
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:19,619
My sister is taking care of herself

173
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:21,582
It is not your business

174
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:25,383
We are in the country here.

175
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:31,816
Tokyo is on the other side of the river.

176
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,826
Sân, you have already seen other places,

177
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:39,001
but here, there are people
who have never travelled to Tokyo

178
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:48,316
In Tokyo, one has much 
more freedom than here

179
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,198
It is not far though,
just on the other side.

180
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,060
hey, Kizo...

181
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:33,444
What do you think..?

182
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,911
Me… in my all life

183
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:39,086
I have never surrender...

184
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,722
I would never accept

185
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,559
to become a looser !

186
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,146
You are damned right.

187
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,860
Listen to me,

188
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:51,369
I’m born here, and since then,

189
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,336
I have always lived with this river!

190
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,765
- Who is the old man ?
- stop it.

191
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,199
in the old times, we used to stick together

192
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:12,720
Nowadays,
young workers are too hard,

193
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:16,229
they don’t show respect anymore
at work

194
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:19,112
Hey boss, do you remember...

195
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:24,210
on new year’s day,

196
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,131
Us, all 70 of your workers,

197
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:29,891
we stand in line in your garden

198
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,569
receiving greetings,
and drinking Saké together.

199
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:37,162
it was wonderful.

200
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:43,513
When it comes to organise party,
you were,

201
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:44,891
always the best.

202
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:48,234
OK, I’ll do it again this year.

203
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:52,454
for new year’s day

204
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,964
I hate stinginess.

205
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,401
Boss. You remain trustworthy.

206
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,128
Tell me, boss...

207
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:13,929
me too,
I came here at seven,

208
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:17,606
at 15, I started looking up for stones,

209
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:21,283
until 20
when I became on my own,

210
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:24,459
I’ve learned that job, 
hurting my back everyday 

211
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:28,177
carrying heavy baskets.

212
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:33,066
I was not the kind that stay by
the river looking helpless

213
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,865
under the scorching sun.

214
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,835
You are damned right

215
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:47,856
every year, during the rainy season
the water level could raise 

216
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:50,405
and even when it last long,

217
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,831
our baskets remain
at the bottom of the river 

218
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:57,424
with the stones that we had found.

219
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,391
It would stay there 

220
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:03,942
until the end of the rain.

221
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:06,824
But nowadays...

222
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,836
they just cover the banks with concrete !

223
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,892
Yes, that’s true...

224
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,820
- Please, More sake
- right away

225
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:23,453
have another drink

226
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:28,051
Don’t worry,
This is the only place which is giving me credit.

227
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:37,367
I don’t think I can live other places.

228
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:42,422
I am staying here. I am not moving

229
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:44,888
of course not

230
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:49,818
I don’t even want you to pick up 
stones like us 

231
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:53,077
More drinks please.

232
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,667
what’s the matter ?

233
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:17,478
what is happening?

234
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,711
Sân has just come here, you know ?

235
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,056
forget it.

236
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,688
She can not control herself.

237
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,652
But she is my daughter.

238
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:40,666
Your daughter that you spoiled
Look at her now.

239
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,493
Môn, where are you going?

240
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,540
Where are you going ?

241
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,340
Go wherever you want.

242
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:01,891
Ino, be nicer to her.

243
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:06,278
You don’t have the right to speak to me like that

244
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,952
you neither. You’re just a lazy sloth.

245
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:12,377
You have to choose the right time
to get angry

246
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:16,013
Just now, this is not the right
time for Môn

247
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:19,898
anyway
this is your father’s job

248
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,492
As he doesn’t tell her anything,

249
00:24:23,785 --> 00:24:27,837
we too, should leave her alone 

250
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:33,479
Thanks, but I am bothering
everyone here

251
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,280
Yes, you are a pain 

252
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:40,538
Sân will not be able to find
an husband like any other girl

253
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,806
Ino, Môn has worked
to pay for my studies...

254
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:49,564
she gave me a chance.

255
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:52,447
What ? Shut up brat

256
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,413
Môn, wait !

257
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:58,212
Leave me,
I’ve decided to go.

258
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,224
But what are you going to do
with your baby ? 

259
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,611
I’ll go and ask the hospital.

260
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:08,407
No, wait !

261
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:11,081
I am not an animal

262
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,299
I want to make up for it

263
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:17,850
but you treat me like a slut

264
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,648
now it’s enough!

265
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,789
Ino, you are not the one who feeds me,
I live on my own.

266
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:26,874
What ?

267
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,340
stop it, please.

268
00:25:30,092 --> 00:25:33,226
I will raise my child by myself.

269
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:38,197
He is already alive !

270
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,178
Men can not feel this.

271
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:48,183
I will never abandon him.

272
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:54,994
Don’t worry anymore, it’s over.

273
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,252
Daddy told me

274
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:02,473
to take my responsibilities

275
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:06,776
and that he doesn’t want to see 
his disgraced daughter anymore

276
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,040
Don’t play the elder brother,

277
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,798
you are giving me headache, that’s all.

278
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:20,981
I am a big girl,
I know how to defend myself

279
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:25,870
I won’t bother anyone

280
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,467
Sân

281
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:31,720
Môn

282
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,217
The future bride?

283
00:28:33,217 --> 00:28:34,802
Yes, presumably

284
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:23,916
It taste good 

285
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,087
thank you very much

286
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:32,886
Good day

287
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,724
Welcome

288
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,270
It smells good.

289
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:42,067
Look, I bought this cooking pot
with your money 

290
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:43,485
but it was so few.

291
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:45,238
I paid some of it myself

292
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:48,493
I wanted to have it before you come 

293
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:51,205
Any news from Môn ?

294
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,252
She came once for new year’s holidays 

295
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,801
Do you want to eat something ?

296
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:07,313
Help yourself.

297
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,148
- Hello.
- Hello.

298
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,943
I would like to know...

299
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,444
where does M. AKAZA like

300
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,115
Here is his store.

301
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:18,996
My name is OBATA

302
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,499
I come to see Môn.

303
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,128
Môn...

304
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,388
Well...

305
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:34,019
I came to talk with you
About her.

306
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,150
Môn is not living here anymore,
She is in Tokyo.

307
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,360
Could you please wait for a moment ?

308
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:42,740
Yes.

309
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:45,785
Sân, take him home.

310
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:48,038
I am going to find Dad.

311
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:50,792
Come with me.

312
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:13,993
Mika, Can you keep the store?

313
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,205
I’ll give you something later 

314
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:21,630
Excuse me

315
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,259
Are you her sister?

316
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,574
Could you please wait here.

317
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,898
Daddy !

318
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,068
He is here, the father !

319
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:08,489
What ?

320
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,618
He is at home.

321
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:12,870
Môn’s boyfriend...

322
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,629
He is a young student

323
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,882
Be reasonable, no violence.

324
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:52,345
Maybe he wants to discuss
about the baby with Môn

325
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,768
Does he look dishonest?

326
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:00,190
No, he seems to be well-mannered

327
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,286
Please, have some tea.

328
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,882
Sân

329
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:21,137
Can you keep the store?

330
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:36,785
Don’t stay there. Please get in 

331
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,533
What do you want?

332
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,208
I haven’t introduce myself,

333
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,670
My name is OBATA

334
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,263
I shouldn’t be here right now.

335
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:23,567
My father locked me in,
I couldn’t get out.

336
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:28,907
Please forgive me for giving you
so much trouble.

337
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:36,376
I came here today

338
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,092
to give Môn a compensation...

339
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:49,937
I thought about it all the time...

340
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,195
Did she have an abortion?

341
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,718
Did you come here
just to put your mind at ease ?

342
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,182
Do you thing that everything is over ?

343
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:15,433
Well, it’s not !

344
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:18,353
Do you thing we’ll forgive you
if you give us money...?

345
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,735
No, but I’d like to help
as much as I can...

346
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,204
The child is still-born.

347
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:38,091
Since that day,
Môn is not the same anymore.

348
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:48,189
Where is she currently living?

349
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,697
I’d like to see her
to explain my behaviour and to apologise

350
00:36:57,077 --> 00:36:59,080
I can’t stay like this.

351
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:04,338
I have no idea. We tried in vain
to hold her back here.

352
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:09,095
Now, she doesn’t give us her address.

353
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:17,816
Madam.

354
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:22,447
This is from Sân for your guest.

355
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,534
Really? Thank you.

356
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:38,012
Even if you genuinely apologise,

357
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,683
I doubt Môn would see you again...

358
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:43,894
You should better go back home.

359
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,701
M. OBATA,

360
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:57,708
Don’t you ever do such stupid thing again

361
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,294
This time,
You’re the one who won...

362
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:35,680
Don’t worry,
my husband is always like that.

363
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,977
If you can,
Please stay for dinner with us… 

364
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,312
No, thanks.

365
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:44,986
Madam,

366
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:51,118
I have to leave,
Thank you very much.

367
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,953
Please.

368
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:56,793
If Môn comes here one day, 

369
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:00,631
I’ll tell her that you came.

370
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,721
Please ask for her address.

371
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:07,142
and also

372
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:11,148
Please accept this.
It’s not a lot.

373
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,231
What is this ?

374
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:14,320
some money, a very small amount.

375
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:16,280
No, I can’t accept this.

376
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:18,575
Please... you may need it…

377
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,619
There is no reason I should accept.

378
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:22,455
Please, I beg you.

379
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:27,129
This is the only thing
I will ask you 

380
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:30,635
This is not a lot

381
00:39:30,676 --> 00:39:34,599
but if you feel pity for me,

382
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:39,189
accept it, please...

383
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:42,611
I should go

384
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:54,044
Wait

385
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:18,287
How do you call this ?

386
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,207
This is boxwood flower

387
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,294
It is really beautiful.

388
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:25,046
I don’t know if you’ll like it

389
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,216
with pleasure. Thank you very much.

390
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:40,528
How old are you ?

391
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:43,532
I just got 24.

392
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:48,247
So, just one year of difference with Môn.

393
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:56,134
This is my address.

394
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,306
Could you pass it to Môn ?

395
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,939
OK, next time she visits us.

396
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:08,318
Apparently, she often changes location.

397
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:11,866
each time, we ask for her address.

398
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:14,077
but she never tells us.

399
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:19,711
Well, if you see her...

400
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:10,204
Wait !

401
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:15,130
I am Môn’s brother,

402
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:19,010
I have things to discuss with you,
follow me,

403
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:55,188
Have you seen Môn since then?

404
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:57,774
No never.

405
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,447
Really ? never ?

406
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,462
Listen to me,
You are the one who abused my sister

407
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,343
and torment my family
how dare you coming here ?

408
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:27,568
When we were small, Môn and I
were sleeping in the same bed 

409
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:30,446
When she needed to take a pee,

410
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:33,326
I would go to the toilet with her

411
00:44:34,911 --> 00:44:38,040
I would carry her on my back...

412
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,672
I preferred playing with her
than with my friends.

413
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:47,430
Until she gets 17

414
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:50,475
there was no boundaries
between us

415
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,396
we were always together on table 

416
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,278
We got along better than
brother and sister 

417
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,537
When she came back pregnant with your child...

418
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:07,125
I shout at her, treating
her like a slut on purpose.

419
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:11,466
They then started hating me 
And got softer on Môn

420
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:13,551
I don’t regret it

421
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,349
If I hadn’t done it,
Môn couldn’t cope...

422
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:23,232
But you,
I knew that you’ll come one day...

423
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:25,235
I was waiting

424
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:29,492
for that moment where I could 
tell you about Môn and me.

425
00:45:32,705 --> 00:45:34,665
The daughter of a worker

426
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:38,378
can not be wit a neat
student like you ? 

427
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,925
One can forgive but

428
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:45,139
I am not like my father
who don’t give a damn about anything

429
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:48,060
I won’t let you leave like this!

430
00:45:57,323 --> 00:46:00,203
Did you come here only to apologise ?

431
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:03,792
But there is nothing else I can do

432
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:06,252
what about Môn ?

433
00:46:07,212 --> 00:46:09,801
If I see her, we’ll speak about it

434
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,263
Are you going to marry her ?

435
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,557
I don’t know. Perhaps.

436
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,730
Liar !

437
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:24,696
Don’t hit me !

438
00:46:25,156 --> 00:46:26,282
What ?

439
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,916
You, bastard, may very
well forget everything...

440
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,128
Môn has suffered much more than that !

441
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:40,095
She is not like she used to be.

442
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,931
She doesn’t want to live with you.

443
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:49,901
She is worse than before
but she is more confident,

444
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:55,241
She has lost that innocence
that you loved 

445
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:01,668
She has nothing left in life...

446
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:04,672
Because of you.

447
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:07,801
If you hadn’t touch her...

448
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:11,765
she wouldn’t be what she is now

449
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:17,275
Don’t you ever come back !

450
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:26,454
and promise me that 
you will never make her cry again.

451
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,084
It was my fault

452
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,879
You are right.

453
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:53,869
I am her brother.

454
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,582
If you were in my position,

455
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,753
you would understand me.

456
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:09,266
Go home,

457
00:48:28,377 --> 00:48:31,548
there is a bus stop further in that direction

458
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,074
- Did you find him ?
- No

459
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,035
Moron... what is he doing ?

460
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:28,673
San.

461
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,850
Let’s go live together in Tokyo.

462
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,687
later, it would be too late.

463
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:40,149
The date of my marriage has come.

464
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:43,195
I am completely stuck,
I must leave

465
00:49:44,738 --> 00:49:47,075
But I am not ready yet...

466
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:50,039
Never mind, we’ll sort it out.

467
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:51,040
but...

468
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:54,170
We’ll take time to consider 
in Tokyo, not here.

469
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:55,755
I took my decision.

470
00:49:55,922 --> 00:49:57,006
but...

471
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:02,264
San, You are the one
who wanted to go to Tokyo...

472
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:04,726
We can’t leave like that, without a word.

473
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:09,025
I’ll be waiting at the bus stop.
Will you be there ?

474
00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:11,653
Is it OK ?

475
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:20,625
I’ll be waiting. See you in a minute.

476
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:42,240
I am sorry.
Are you hungry ?

477
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:44,284
- Did you have something to eat ?
- Yes.

478
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,752
Someone was here ?

479
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,131
Can you stay until this evening ?

480
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:55,633
Yes.

481
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,599
What is the matter ?

482
00:51:10,907 --> 00:51:12,825
Tell me. That man, OBATA...

483
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:14,078
why did he come...?

484
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:15,704
To apologise

485
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:17,959
That’s it

486
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,420
He is so sorry, the poor boy.

487
00:51:23,591 --> 00:51:24,926
Are you going home ?

488
00:51:25,802 --> 00:51:29,350
Mom, I have to leave.

489
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:32,896
Really, so soon?
Are you so much busy?

490
00:51:35,024 --> 00:51:37,403
Yes. But I was pleased to see you.

491
00:51:39,114 --> 00:51:42,244
Me too. Well,
I won’t insist.

492
00:51:43,912 --> 00:51:46,167
- See you next time
- Take care.

493
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,252
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

494
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,027
- Two tickets to the station.
- OK.

495
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:40,097
Thank you very much.

496
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,690
They must be looking for me.

497
00:54:17,265 --> 00:54:19,562
Thank you very much

498
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:35,974
Do you know him ?

499
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:39,942
Wait for me
We shouldn’t be seen together

500
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:40,945
The tickets ?

501
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,656
I go and buy them.

502
00:55:10,135 --> 00:55:11,262
It’s done

503
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,809
The train will leave soon 

504
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:18,362
What is the matter ?

505
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,830
Taiichi, I am going back to Tokyo alone.

506
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,252
Why ?

507
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:27,424
Don’t get angry 

508
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:29,929
If we leave together to Tokyo

509
00:55:30,096 --> 00:55:33,020
What can we do there with no future

510
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:37,155
Even if we find a room in a hotel,
we can not live there 

511
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:42,415
Moreover, if the police is after us 
It would be terrible

512
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:46,634
What on earth are you talking about?
Let’s go now !

513
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,308
Please, think about it.

514
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:52,271
No, I don’t want to.

515
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:57,743
Listen, if we get along well
it would come naturally.

516
00:55:58,368 --> 00:56:00,874
I am sure we can manage.

517
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:03,756
but not now.

518
00:56:04,256 --> 00:56:08,016
It is too early. We are not 
there yet. We can not make it work

519
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:11,105
Let’s wait until we 
are sure about ourselves 

520
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:14,320
You don’t love me anymore ? 

521
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:18,164
Why don’t you understand ? 
Think about it again

522
00:56:18,414 --> 00:56:20,877
I’ve already thought a lot about it. Let’s go !

523
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:24,428
No. the only solution you have
is to run away 

524
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:28,896
Why can not you just tell them 
that you love me ?

525
00:56:29,564 --> 00:56:31,067
It is hopeless

526
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,531
You are just a big lump

527
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,038
Sân

528
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:41,758
If you love me, you should tell your family 

529
00:56:42,426 --> 00:56:44,389
that you don’t want that marriage

530
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:47,187
that you would leave the house
to live with me

531
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,027
Tell them, or you are not a man 

532
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,502
I am going

533
00:56:57,544 --> 00:56:58,504
Sân

534
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:00,426
No, leave me alone !

535
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,494
During his life, this student never 
had to take a commitment 

536
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:36,549
A honest, decent and boring life.

537
00:57:37,593 --> 00:57:40,850
I’ve never been like him !

538
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,699
I have just nothing in common
wiht those people.

539
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:55,049
I can have my own opinion,
right ?

540
00:57:56,259 --> 00:57:57,847
right.

541
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:02,273
Boss.

542
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:53,374
Thank you very much.

543
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,042
Good day.

544
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,794
Good day

545
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:28,142
Taiichi.

546
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,604
here, Take over me.

547
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:22,088
Good day.

548
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:36,670
Some lemonade please

549
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:14,939
Hello

550
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,441
Sân, you took an unusual path 

551
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:32,781
Did you stop at the store ?

552
01:02:34,075 --> 01:02:35,159
Mum was there ?

553
01:02:35,242 --> 01:02:36,618
No. Daddy was sleeping.

554
01:02:36,701 --> 01:02:39,119
Daddy is keeping the store. That’s nice

555
01:02:43,038 --> 01:02:44,956
It has been such a long time

556
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:56,837
Don’t you look thinner? 
Especially in the face.

557
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,046
Yes, maybe a little bit.

558
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:01,506
- You are a grown-up now
- Do yo think so ?

559
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,091
Nothing to be ashamed of.

560
01:03:38,901 --> 01:03:40,777
let’s call her

561
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,738
Hello

562
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,864
Hello ! 

563
01:03:51,617 --> 01:03:52,992
She can not hear us.

564
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:55,578
Mummy

565
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:58,370
Dear mother

566
01:04:01,456 --> 01:04:04,123
OK, I hear you. Get in.

567
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,708
She aged so much

568
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,170
Is she not happy to see us ?

569
01:04:14,587 --> 01:04:16,587
- Hello.
- Please forgive me for not answering.

570
01:04:16,629 --> 01:04:18,547
You are welcome.

571
01:04:18,714 --> 01:04:21,675
I was sure that you would 
come for the holidays.

572
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,342
Since yesterday, I am cooking cakes.

573
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:25,469
really?

574
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,177
Don’t Sân come often ?

575
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:28,511
No, very rarely.

576
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:31,096
Before, she was very close
to her family.

577
01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:35,932
She told me she has to study a lot
to become a mid-wife

578
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:38,724
That’s a good reason.

579
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:41,143
Good luck then.

580
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:45,729
Ahh It is so hot

581
01:04:49,606 --> 01:04:52,523
Is it hot outside?
Where did you meet Môn ?

582
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,942
- just outside
- really ?

583
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:59,361
I have seen the new bride
at the noodle factory.

584
01:05:03,238 --> 01:05:06,740
At the wedding ceremony, everybody
was wearing autumn kimonos

585
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:08,824
They didn’t wait for the end of summer

586
01:05:09,116 --> 01:05:11,117
The old lady just couldn’t wait

587
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:13,660
The kimono of the bride
seemed very heavy.

588
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:17,036
The old Tokiko was wearing
a lined kimono...

589
01:05:17,203 --> 01:05:19,747
After that, because of heat rash,

590
01:05:19,914 --> 01:05:22,833
she could’nt take a bath
for one month.

591
01:05:23,582 --> 01:05:26,250
You talk nonsense
As usual...

592
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:28,085
you know me well.

593
01:05:31,754 --> 01:05:35,921
Mister OBATA came here.

594
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:38,175
OBATA ?

595
01:05:39,174 --> 01:05:40,758
Really? When?

596
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:45,759
It was maybe three months ago...
Wasn’t it Sân ?

597
01:05:47,012 --> 01:05:47,595
yes.

598
01:05:49,096 --> 01:05:51,096
Why did he come here ?

599
01:06:05,937 --> 01:06:07,981
Here is his address.

600
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,275
He came to apologise

601
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:14,276
- Did he talk with dad ?
- Yes

602
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:15,902
What did he say ?

603
01:06:15,943 --> 01:06:18,237
Your father ? nothing special.

604
01:06:18,738 --> 01:06:20,696
wasn’t he too harsh on him ?

605
01:06:20,863 --> 01:06:23,988
No, he kept cool
It’s rather rare for him.

606
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,533
He even called him “Mister OBATA"

607
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:31,286
But I was scared 
your father might become violent

608
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:34,787
fortunately, he was very polite.

609
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,747
I am sorry to give you so much trouble.

610
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:41,291
He didn’t have to come 

611
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,710
- Did Ino meet him ?
- No

612
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,169
That’s better !
He makes a whole lot of fuss,

613
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:50,169
he could go over the top.

614
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:52,213
He was not here

615
01:07:06,387 --> 01:07:08,763
He is an handsome guy
Isn’t he?

616
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:09,930
Who ?

617
01:07:10,514 --> 01:07:12,139
him.

618
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:16,893
You fool ! You still love 
The one who dropped you ?

619
01:07:16,976 --> 01:07:20,727
Stop it. That’s enough.

620
01:07:24,064 --> 01:07:25,022
Here you are Mum

621
01:07:25,147 --> 01:07:27,691
- This is for me ?
- And here is my present.

622
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:29,774
- Here you are
- What is it ?

623
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:31,901
- Some Yukatas
- Really

624
01:07:36,778 --> 01:07:39,239
There are 3 of them

625
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:41,697
yes for San,
she prefers western style

626
01:07:41,864 --> 01:07:43,658
Present for me too ?

627
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:44,615
here you are

628
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:48,536
You don’t have to give present to all of us

629
01:07:50,745 --> 01:07:52,037
Would like some tea ?

630
01:07:52,204 --> 01:07:55,789
No, thanks.
I prefer water from our well.

631
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,708
It is the best water of the world

632
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:01,792
Really ?
Have as much as you want

633
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:05,961
You can change clothes,
there is my old summer kimono

634
01:08:24,346 --> 01:08:26,138
With this, you could make a cute robe

635
01:08:26,138 --> 01:08:27,347
cute ?

636
01:08:27,472 --> 01:08:29,099
Why not ?

637
01:08:29,681 --> 01:08:33,101
I don’t dress
like a little girl anymore

638
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,268
Really? You have a boyfriend, right ?

639
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,020
Not at all. That is too much...

640
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:43,856
I don’t have men on my mind

641
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:48,316
Marriage is not all in life.
I need to get a job.

642
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,693
Ahhh!

643
01:08:51,278 --> 01:08:53,986
Life is what matters, right ?

644
01:08:54,694 --> 01:08:55,987
Life...

645
01:08:57,405 --> 01:08:59,699
Yes... it’s hard.

646
01:09:04,784 --> 01:09:09,370
According to my experience,
men are all bastards

647
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,706
a women of low reputation like me 

648
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:16,082
can easily be liked by men 

649
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,626
by playing with them as they expect to...
That’s the tactic...

650
01:09:20,626 --> 01:09:23,127
they taught us

651
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:31,424
I don’t count how many times
I believed them...

652
01:09:32,049 --> 01:09:34,175
At the end, they are just all the same.

653
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:38,052
Now, I don’t care.

654
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:49,183
Môn, what did you like in OBATA

655
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:52,684
What a question

656
01:09:54,518 --> 01:09:58,437
I am sure you can find 
someone better

657
01:09:59,772 --> 01:10:03,690
Maybe there is someone

658
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,233
It’s a big world

659
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:11,235
I met a couple of nice guys, but

660
01:10:11,278 --> 01:10:14,070
the handsome ones were too pretentious

661
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,573
and those who had money 
were too violent 

662
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:20,700
He is the only one 
who is balanced

663
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,746
But if he comes to pick me up
I won’t go with him

664
01:10:29,954 --> 01:10:32,373
I still love him in my mind...

665
01:10:33,665 --> 01:10:37,291
But, now he is too lukewarm for me.

666
01:10:42,836 --> 01:10:44,921
Here you are. Nice and cool 

667
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:48,132
I’ll give some good and fresh
watermelon.

668
01:11:01,222 --> 01:11:02,179
Here you are

669
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,891
I should take advantage of
all soul’s day.

670
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:11,185
have a good work.

671
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:14,395
Same to you,
rich man

672
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,439
That’s a good one 

673
01:11:21,482 --> 01:11:23,399
You can go and have lunch 

674
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:29,612
hey boss...please

675
01:11:29,654 --> 01:11:33,656
It is tough to work on holiday
Without extra money

676
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:36,865
again ?

677
01:11:46,412 --> 01:11:48,747
She has really fallen.asleep 

678
01:11:48,788 --> 01:11:51,581
Let her sleep...
She can rest.

679
01:11:51,664 --> 01:11:53,750
She looks tired.

680
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:56,084
She probably doesn’t sleep a lot...

681
01:11:56,418 --> 01:11:59,001
- Yoo too, be careful
- to what ?

682
01:11:59,503 --> 01:12:02,503
the other day,
Someone saw you at the station.

683
01:12:04,131 --> 01:12:08,216
It is better for this adopted son
To marry someone else

684
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:13,093
They were in such a hurry
for the wedding !

685
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:20,597
For you, it is too early,
isn’t it ?

686
01:12:23,432 --> 01:12:27,267
I thought his love was genuine...

687
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:30,685
Unhappy in Love ?

688
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,187
Were you awake ?

689
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:35,772
You should not regret it

690
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:39,189
You can have any men you want

691
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:44,069
I’ll find someone nice for you

692
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,323
Mum, I’ve seen OBATA in the bus
going to the station

693
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:55,991
He was eating the cakes.

694
01:12:56,032 --> 01:12:58,033
The cakes I gave him ?

695
01:12:58,075 --> 01:13:00,661
He is like a little boy

696
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,288
Good day, Ino

697
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:05,788
Do you work today ?

698
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:08,248
theres is no holiday for me !

699
01:13:09,831 --> 01:13:13,333
You are there ?

700
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:17,711
Don’t lie down like a dead person

701
01:13:17,877 --> 01:13:20,170
We’ll have some cake for lunch, OK ?

702
01:13:20,297 --> 01:13:22,630
and I’ll make some nice dishes
for this evening 

703
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,882
Môn, come here

704
01:13:33,427 --> 01:13:36,805
You should better go home early
to have fun with your customers

705
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:41,016
here is a good-mannered household

706
01:13:41,308 --> 01:13:43,807
I don’t want you to bring mess into it.

707
01:13:44,475 --> 01:13:45,393
Ino !

708
01:13:46,726 --> 01:13:51,479
Anyway, she doesn’t care,
even if I shout at her.

709
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:52,855
That’s enough.

710
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:56,314
Ino stop it.
We don’t see each other very often any more...

711
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:59,567
There is no use to be nice
with her.

712
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:05,236
Look, Môn brought very nice presents.

713
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:08,196
I’ll buy you tons of it

714
01:14:08,906 --> 01:14:10,865
No, it’s for you.

715
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,949
I don’t want to wear what she bought
with dirty money.

716
01:14:24,914 --> 01:14:28,999
I want her to come back here only when
she has a decent job 

717
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:32,793
Shut-up….let’s eat

718
01:14:32,877 --> 01:14:34,668
Môn, come and eat.

719
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,170
This is intermission, understand ?

720
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:38,671
Intermission ,

721
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:42,006
It’s a break during a play. The curtain comes 
down between two acts.

722
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:46,967
Now it is time for intermission,
we stop the show.

723
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,774
Some green tea

724
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:19,567
already finished ?
Do you want something else ?

725
01:15:19,985 --> 01:15:22,195
I don’t, because of somebody here

726
01:15:22,195 --> 01:15:24,820
Stop turning the past over

727
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:26,823
The past is still going on

728
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,615
This guy didn’t have the right to come here

729
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:32,782
but he took advantage of your good nature

730
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:35,535
Did you see M OBATA ?

731
01:15:35,535 --> 01:15:37,619
- Yes
- Where ?

732
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,413
I followed him after he left the house.

733
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,624
And then ?

734
01:15:47,874 --> 01:15:49,750
What have you done to him ?

735
01:15:51,043 --> 01:15:53,377
I beat him up

736
01:15:53,627 --> 01:15:58,297
He didn’t fight back. I scared him a lot
It was fun

737
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:03,049
Come on, tell me that again.

738
01:16:04,758 --> 01:16:06,677
I beat him up

739
01:16:09,636 --> 01:16:10,553
Bastard

740
01:16:10,762 --> 01:16:12,596
How dare you

741
01:16:13,431 --> 01:16:15,847
Who ask you about it ?

742
01:16:16,724 --> 01:16:18,641
Why are you such a coward ?

743
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:24,144
What is it between you and him ? nothing ?

744
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:29,398
I gave myself to him
but that is not your business !

745
01:16:30,606 --> 01:16:32,105
What ?

746
01:16:32,816 --> 01:16:33,858
Stop it !

747
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:36,817
Who asked you to beat the living
daylights out of him?

748
01:16:37,318 --> 01:16:39,736
You are a coward, a swine !

749
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:45,989
crazy bitch !

750
01:16:45,989 --> 01:16:47,282
stop it Ino

751
01:16:48,698 --> 01:16:49,825
stay out of it

752
01:16:57,328 --> 01:16:58,745
What a stupid bastard...

753
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,247
Ino stop it !

754
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,709
You don’t get it

755
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:20,341
here I am, kill me, kill me !

756
01:17:22,883 --> 01:17:25,886
Kill me you bastard !

757
01:17:26,303 --> 01:17:27,303
Again...

758
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:29,178
stop it Ino !

759
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:36,224
You ! I know that you just go with sluts

760
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:39,726
but I don’t go along with your game

761
01:17:41,269 --> 01:17:43,520
According to you,

762
01:17:43,645 --> 01:17:47,229
I am a druken whore

763
01:17:48,314 --> 01:17:50,940
A dissolute woman who can not marry anymore

764
01:17:53,608 --> 01:17:56,277
and who doesn’t give her address
to her parents

765
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:58,195
Exactly

766
01:17:59,654 --> 01:18:01,153
But… someone 

767
01:18:01,695 --> 01:18:03,447
who has already offered his apologies...

768
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:07,031
How can someone dare to take advantage
Of his weakness ?

769
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:08,992
I hate those people !

770
01:18:12,452 --> 01:18:13,787
Tomb engraver !

771
01:18:14,578 --> 01:18:16,037
Are you a man ?

772
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:21,373
What a shame to show him
that Mon’s brother is such a coward !

773
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:23,499
Moron !

774
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:27,417
keep it down,
the neighbours can hear you.

775
01:18:27,543 --> 01:18:29,128
Leave me alone, mum.

776
01:18:29,377 --> 01:18:32,254
I can’t believe
my brother be like this.

777
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,673
I can’t stand him anymore

778
01:18:35,505 --> 01:18:36,340
Would you like some more...

779
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:39,717
Go on, keep hitting me !

780
01:18:40,592 --> 01:18:41,592
Stop it !

781
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:43,593
bastard ! 

782
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:47,763
Do you think I’ll change my mind
Because of your blows
 ?

783
01:18:48,763 --> 01:18:51,140
Those are just for little girls

784
01:18:52,015 --> 01:18:56,016
From here, you can not understand
what I am doing in town

785
01:18:58,269 --> 01:18:59,186
Again !

786
01:19:02,145 --> 01:19:04,312
That’s enough now!

787
01:19:04,354 --> 01:19:07,066
You are both the same...

788
01:19:09,607 --> 01:19:11,400
Hit me !

789
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:23,490
Get out of here and go back to your place !

790
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:11,265
You changed... you became a fearsome woman...

791
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,685
Mom

792
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:19,728
Don’t you worry

793
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:22,730
I beg you 

794
01:20:22,772 --> 01:20:26,899
to live a decent life
like any well-mannered lady

795
01:20:27,774 --> 01:20:31,276
Earlier, I thought you were 
even worse than your brother 

796
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:37,988
I am not as bas as
you think.

797
01:20:41,489 --> 01:20:43,034
but...

798
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:47,368
it’s too late for me.

799
01:21:52,028 --> 01:21:54,236
- Have an eye on the house,
- OK.

800
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,824
Don’t drink too much.

801
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:11,080
See you later, Môn.

802
01:23:20,826 --> 01:23:22,742
Shall we go this way ?

803
01:23:45,088 --> 01:23:46,214
Ok, let’s go.

804
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:30,071
and the spoon !

805
01:25:03,004 --> 01:25:06,007
It is too hot to take the bus !

806
01:25:06,048 --> 01:25:07,631
...because ...

807
01:25:08,592 --> 01:25:12,301
I have to work very hard
and for a long time.

808
01:25:14,428 --> 01:25:15,803
long...

809
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:17,846
When will you come back ?

810
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:21,139
I don’t know.

811
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,350
When I wish to see Dad and mum...

812
01:25:33,021 --> 01:25:35,689
and to see Ino too
who is neither nice nor fine

813
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:38,940
but I’ll come to see him though.

814
01:25:46,153 --> 01:25:48,821
Môn, take care.
