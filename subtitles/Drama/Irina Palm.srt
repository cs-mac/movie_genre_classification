IRINA PALM
by Sam Garbarski

2
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,578
Mom, it's a bit...

3
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:11,638
Yeah, I know, it's a lovely lion that want
to ruffle. Come on, let's go. We'll be late.

4
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,638
Alright.

5
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,114
- Nana!
- Hi, Olly!

6
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:49,874
Hi Dad!

7
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:52,265
- Who's my boy?
- Me!

8
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,422
- Maggie, you shouldn't have.
- Well -

9
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:08,219
Did you bring any water?

10
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,019
Sarah, don't, just...

11
00:04:10,298 --> 00:04:11,603
But the water's fouled here.

12
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,193
Please! I just forgot.

13
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,174
Here.

14
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:16,855
Thanks.

15
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,212
Look, how nice have you done it!

16
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,295
Sold it for nothing.

17
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,634
All these treatments
and Olly's still ill.

18
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,702
We would never forgiven ourselves
if we hadn't tried evrything.

19
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:50,230
Anyway I don't regret a thing.
I'd sell up again tomorrow.

20
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:52,639
Why do you still come here?

21
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,387
Jane's not all bad.

22
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:04,372
Here's been something to do, I suppose.
It takes my mind off things. Anyway, thanks.

23
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:26,048
I can't resist.

24
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,520
Oh, Jane.

25
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,685
You shouldn't have.

26
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,425
Boys love that kind of thing.

27
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,596
Now, listen, Beth and
Julia are forging ahead.

28
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:41,706
I know things haven't been easy
but I'm getting a tinsy wincy bit bored but losing

29
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,620
I want to save the smell of victory
just once

30
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:49,069
I want to see these wonderful
smiles wiped out their faces.

31
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,357
How's Olly?

32
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,711
Same as...
Oh, not really, he's -

33
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,824
He'll pull through Maggs.

34
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:21,834
Mr and Mrs Cubine, I've just examined Olly
and Olly's condition is deteriorating.

35
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:31,221
There is a new treatment, in the 
Orphan Diseases' Congress in Melbourne.

36
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,922
I'm referring Olly's case to a
specialist consultant in London.

37
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,221
Last throw of the dice?

38
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,205
Yes.

39
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,181
You're luck, they're going to take him.

40
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,273
You should leave as soon as possible.

41
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,747
- Leave?
- Yes, Australia.

42
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,944
What?

43
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,741
I assumed you knew.

44
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,882
It's the only place that do it.

45
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,088
- You can't do it here?
- No.

46
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:39,153
- We have to go there?
- Yes.

47
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,901
Who pays?

48
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,034
When can we take him?

49
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,116
Frankly as soon as possible.

50
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:53,312
Should he stay beyond 6 weeks or so,
he'll be too weak to travel.

51
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:54,876
Who pays?

52
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,411
The treatment is pro bono. All
other costs, hospital, travel

53
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:02,019
- et cetera will have to be merged.
- Oh, yes.

54
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:37,952
We will find the money. You knew -

55
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,541
Give it a rest, mom.

56
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:43,711
We can borrow.

57
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:45,287
We can nothing!

58
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,688
Nobody will loan us any more money,
the whole village have already donated.

59
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,402
Shut up, shut up!

60
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:51,313
- At least mom's trying to help.
- Shut up!

61
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:57,734
Hey, look, I just want to go
home, okay. Just take me home.

62
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:04,189
I can find my own way home.
It's okay.

63
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,579
It's... go on, go on.

64
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:48,780
You already heavily in debts, you got
nothing to borrow against.

65
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,029
I mean you got no income, you got no savings...
and you don't own your home anymore.

66
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,746
My grandson is dying. I need money.

67
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,720
You have no skills, no employment
history and no qualifications.

68
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,594
Why is it that you think
I can do for you?

69
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,204
Look, I'm gonna be honest. Your age is gonna
be almost impossible to find you anything.

70
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,077
I'm sorry.

71
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,076
I've come about the job.

72
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,684
Go on, last door.

73
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:21,730
A job?

74
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:25,837
Do you know what goes on here?

75
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,185
Do you know what hostess does?

76
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,168
Sort of.

77
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:33,374
Sort of?

78
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,214
What kind of sort of?

79
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,076
Sort of things.

80
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,337
Things?

81
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:48,854
Things like making tea and clearing up...
those sort of things.

82
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:53,671
Here the word hostess is a euphemism.

83
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,642
Do you know what euphemism is?

84
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:58,414
No.

85
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:02,050
... my lawyer
explained it to me.

86
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:06,555
When you use one word for another. 

87
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,614
For example, here, hostess means whore.

88
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:21,811
Ok. What kind of hostess are you?

89
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:29,047
Straight, kinky, many special tricks.

90
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,872
No, listen, here, Mr -

91
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:38,101
Pecklush. If you're good
and I like you, Miky.

92
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,330
You are not working girl.

93
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:48,143
I bet you can't even say "fuck". Can you?

94
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:52,385
You're too old.

95
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,260
Show me your hands.

96
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:03,353
Show me your hands.
I'm not going to bite.

97
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,601
Give me your hands.

98
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,070
They're pretty.

99
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:20,827
And smooth.

100
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:31,282
Very smooth. Many girls work here,
their hands are ok, but -

101
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,675
I don't think we'll have a bit less
of that -

102
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:41,096
Okay, this is the deal:
men come here to see

103
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,956
to touch, to be toched
by women, you understand?

104
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,585
Can you wank men off?

105
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,214
What?

106
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,117
Can you wank men off?

107
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:57,585
What?

108
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:02,464
Can you... wank men off?

109
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:15,116
Hmm, yes... no, I mean, if I'm being honest
it's been a long long time since I -

110
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:20,320
Pity, hands like yours are made
for those sort of things.

111
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,359
I think I better go.

112
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,166
Start at 600 P a week.

113
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,057
How much?

114
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:33,384
If you heighten with your hands and else, 900 P.

115
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,034
What's the matter? Lost your husband?

116
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,313
What?

117
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:26,688
I've come about the job.

118
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,071
Japan.

119
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,994
I see them in Tokyo, bring them here.

120
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:48,223
No one else has something
like this except <i>Sexy World</i>.

121
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:50,507
Nobody but me.

122
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:58,099
You press this botton, red
bump when you're ready.

123
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:07,924
They have 5, 6 minutes. Any longer

124
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:12,908
you press this botton and if
they don't come, I come.

125
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:18,320
This Luisa, she will show you rules.

126
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,244
Hello.

127
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,416
Hi.

128
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,198
- Phone.
- Yeah.

129
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,526
You have a whole evening.

130
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,839
Okay.

131
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:45,219
Time to go to work.

132
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,608
Sorry.

133
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,484
What, now?

134
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:59,107
First, you get a good grip.

135
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:03,093
See? See how it stiffens.

136
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:08,587
Circumcised are so sensitive, grip tider.

137
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:14,512
Speed is important, make sure to change, like this.

138
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,325
<i>Oh, God!</i>

139
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,294
<i>Bloody Hell!</i>

140
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:23,144
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

141
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:29,363
<i>Oh, fucking!</i>

142
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,671
Do they always go on like that?

143
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,589
No, only him. Watch.

144
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:42,392
After, slow, fast again.

145
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,267
The harder it gets, the faster it goes.

146
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,814
Remember, you are in control.

147
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:00,852

148
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:13,779
See, it easy.

149
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,749
Next time, you do.

150
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:25,595
Who? Me?

151
00:21:26,145 --> 00:21:27,154
Who else?

152
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,183
No, no, no, no, I really can't.

153
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:30,988
Okay, if you wanna leave?

154
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,513
Oh, come on, sit down.

155
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,802
First time is always the most embarassing,
but after that you'll wet for England.

156
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,076
Give me your hand.

157
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,528
Your hand!

158
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:53,198
I really think - I think you
should do it just one more time.

159
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,511
Your hand.

160
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:04,673
Bloody hell!

161
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:08,322
Part of the job.

162
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,110
No, no, I can't.

163
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:14,451
Come on.

164
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:15,980
Relax. Up - Relax.

165
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,066
Up and down, slowly.

166
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:23,219
Slowly, relax.

167
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:27,366
It's too soft.

168
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:30,209
 <i>Ha!</i>
- Sorry!

169
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:32,221

170
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,581
Relax, that's good.

171
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:40,599
Gently but firm. That's good.

172
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,009

173
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:51,818
All the way along.

174
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:56,958
Yes, like that. That's it...

175
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:14,351
She went through troubles?

176
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:17,343
It's funny.

177
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,682
Of course it's funny. But is she worth it or not?

178
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:27,116
She has a soft touch... It could be.

179
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:31,066
What day is it?

180
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:33,860
Wednesday.

181
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,815
You've got her till friday.

182
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,231
Now, have you got your ticket?

183
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:22,747
-

184
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:24,496
On time.

185
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:33,128
Maggie! Where are you off to?

186
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,644
Magg, are you alright?

187
00:24:58,711 --> 00:24:59,640

188
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:06,424
Need anything?

189
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,426
You can go home, now.

190
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,181
Hi, leave your message after the beep.

191
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:48,285
Just me, Maggs. What's got into you?

192
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,354
Julia find all the thing bizarre.
Where are you now? In this time of night.

193
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:57,857
Give me a call. Soon.

194
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,751
Still here, where's mom?

195
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:35,789
You should go and live with your mother.

196
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,074
Maggie.

197
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:10,359
Mr Pecklush.

198
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,368

199
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:34,309
Hey, do you need a drink, uh?

200
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,835
We met when I was 17.

201
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:54,178
Trevor was old, full of himself.

202
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:59,413
I didn't know any better. Who does, at that age?

203
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:02,271
Ended up pregnant.

204
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,121
Home had nothing to offer.

205
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:10,117
So I got married.

206
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:11,855
Came down here

207
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,906
but then I lost the baby.

208
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:23,636
John arrived 12 years later.

209
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:27,808
Quite a surprise to say the least.

210
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:31,526
We plodded on.

211
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,907
And Trevor died.

212
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:43,201
7 years ago. Heart attack.

213
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:51,937
And just after that, Olly became ill.

214
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:58,027
And... and here I am.

215
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,413
The Wanky Widow.

216
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,792
Yes.

217
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:08,867
My husband was a pig.

218
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:10,431
He beat me. So...

219
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:16,103
So I left.

220
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,308
Bastard. Now, one for the road?

221
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,654
Yes, why not?

222
00:33:28,795 --> 00:33:30,745
Chris, two more.

223
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:38,719
Don't tell me I stop.

224
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,481
I promised Tom I wouldn't.

225
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:47,185
I think about stopping every day.

226
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:52,437
But then I think: screw it, I
deserve all the cigarettes in the world.

227
00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:24,304
<i>Dear Mr Cooper, we regret to inform
you in this occasion we are not...<i>

228
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:25,977
<i>in a position to offer
the loan as requested.</i>

229
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:32,500
Thank you.

230
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:42,070
And... I'll have 5 of these,
the hundred thousand ones, please.

231
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,217
Feeling lucky, are we?

232
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:54,166
Oh, I thought I had more,
I'm sorry, I'll have 4 of them.

233
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:08,728
Hi.

234
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:36,588
200 P? But this isn't -
You, you said -

235
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:39,501
I said monday you earn 6-8,
if you work. And don't cry.

236
00:35:40,992 --> 00:35:43,946
I make the rules.

237
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:58,388
Mom? This time I come from the rest of the washing.
... going back to the hospital...

238
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:02,858
You alright mom? 

239
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:07,061
Me? No, I mean YES. Why?

240
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,863
Well, it's jus you haven't been to
the hospital for a while and...

241
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:13,216
it's not like you, that's all.

242
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,363
I thought maybe you were ill or something.

243
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:16,982
No, no, I'm okay.

244
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:21,217
You know me, same all me.

245
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:24,199
I'll be in tomorrow.

246
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:25,968
Promise.

247
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:28,464
Good, Olly misses seeing you.

248
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:31,998
Thanks mom.

249
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:02,631
How is he?

250
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:09,975
You need to rest.

251
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:14,257
I've been turned down again.

252
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:15,896
I know.

253
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:19,789
I don't know what to think any more.

254
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,304
I can't... just don't know what to do anymore.

255
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:31,271
Doctor said in about 4 weeks
he'll be to weak to... to

256
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,903
to...

257
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,184
I love him so much.

258
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:42,078
I really love him.

259
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:29,857
P 640

260
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,049
I need more. I need -

261
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,375
A name.

262
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:53,162
A name you'll earn more.

263
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,127
Irina Palm.

264
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,334
I like Irina.

265
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,726
Where I come from there are
many beautiful Irinas.

266
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:07,144
First girl I didn't do it, she was an Irina.

267
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,456
They see Irina, they think -

268
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,634
Some sexy young girl.

269
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,822
Not a middle-aged frump.

270
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:19,540
Frump? What is "frump"?

271
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:25,303
Someone like me. Dumb, middle-aged.

272
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,076
If you are so frumpy how can I make you Irina?

273
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:39,336
Don't be so shy, Irina... sexy.

274
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:42,947
You can be anyone. You know,
at home you are Maggie:

275
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:48,302
Clean, washed up, kids, all
the shit, but here: Irina.

276
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:51,605
You like being called Suzy Lush?

277
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,590
Who cares? Separate, always.

278
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:58,341
In the boot Suzy, at home with my
child Adam, with my friends, Luisa.

279
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,556
Forget, shit happens.

280
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:04,134
You're round.

281
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:13,119
Been working hard?

282
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,237
Are you ignoring me?

283
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,689
I do think you've been just teenious
but selfish, don't you? Sneeking off

284
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:33,502
to heaven's know where. Leaving your closest
friend. We had some kind of race or something?

285
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,875
Maggs! Maggs, slow down.

286
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,710
Maggs! What - Oh, for god's sake
What's got into you?

287
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:47,222
Maggs! Maggie, what's going on?

288
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:49,053
Please Jane, I'm late.

289
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,336
Late? Late for what?

290
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:52,712
Late for work.

291
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:54,383
Late for work? Oh.

292
00:41:54,673 --> 00:41:56,880
You've got a job?
What job? Where?

293
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,055
- I've got to go.
- You're blushing.

294
00:41:59,257 --> 00:42:00,720
I'm not. I've got to go.

295
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,929
Don't follow me. Just don't.

296
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:10,585
A job?

297
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,961
A job? Where?

298
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,192
Where indeed.

299
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:14,388
Doing what?

300
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:16,242
She wouldn't say.

301
00:42:16,585 --> 00:42:17,882
Why not?

302
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,153
Maggie can't do anything, can she?

303
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:26,982
<i>Oh, God! Yes!</i>

304
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:33,034
P 750.

305
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:45,430
What?

306
00:42:46,502 --> 00:42:47,394
Nothing.

307
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:28,011
This one.

308
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:36,854
Hi Nana!

309
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,031
Look what I've found.

310
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:41,417
Lying in the street.

311
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,401
No, you didn't.

312
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:47,167
I can't stay long.

313
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:50,018
Why not? You're never here anymore.

314
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,548
Well, I've got things to do, Mr.

315
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:56,834
Like trying to make sure you get better.

316
00:43:57,731 --> 00:43:58,763
How?

317
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,435
It's a secret!

318
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:04,436
I like secrets.

319
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:10,489
Yes, but the thing about a secret
is that it has to stay a secret.

320
00:44:11,374 --> 00:44:14,548
And it will be a long time
before a can tell you this one.

321
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:26,439
So, remember: shh!
It's a secret.

322
00:44:35,922 --> 00:44:36,868
Maggie!

323
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:38,709
You didn't tell us you were coming.

324
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:43,378
A flying visit, you know,
to keep his chin up.

325
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:46,820
You look in a bit of a hurry.
Doing something special?

326
00:44:47,928 --> 00:44:53,137
No, not really, few things to do.
I must go.

327
00:45:31,616 --> 00:45:32,705
You're good.

328
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:35,191
Thank you.

329
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:40,898
Not many women have your touch.

330
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:44,915
I tried you out.

331
00:45:45,898 --> 00:45:47,930
You tried me out?

332
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:52,587
You have -
How to say?

333
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:54,198
When?

334
00:45:54,537 --> 00:45:56,701
Yesterday. Of course
I tried you out.

335
00:45:57,479 --> 00:46:02,475
I have to know. If I don't
know how do I build your future?

336
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,994
I want you to work more,
longer. Evenings.

337
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:11,723
You can became big earner.

338
00:46:15,888 --> 00:46:17,779
I need P 6,000.

339
00:46:18,003 --> 00:46:19,187
It's not a problem with you hands.

340
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:21,521
Now, I need it now.

341
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:28,004
That's it, I have enough of this.

342
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:32,640
Where are you going? P 6,000 is a lot!

343
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:44,282
I don't have time to become a big earner.

344
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:45,959
Why?

345
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:54,473
Okay, if I give you... If!
What do I get?

346
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,332
I'll earn P 800 a week minimum.

347
00:47:01,243 --> 00:47:03,931
I will work for 10 more weeks.

348
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:11,493
So you get you're P 6,000 and can
keep all the rest as interests.

349
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:27,383
Okay. If you cheat me, I'll
find you, and I'll kill you.

350
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:20,115
For the flights, the hotel, for the...
well, you know, thing usual.

351
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,305
It's enough, isn't it?

352
00:48:31,446 --> 00:48:33,054
I think I better go.

353
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,946
It'll be ready tomorrow.

354
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,574
Where did you get it?

355
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:56,368
Always the right elbow...
I don't know how to do it.

356
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,775
Where did you get the money?

357
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,537
Well the stitch won't show, I hope.

358
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:06,755
Mom, this is a lot of money,
where did you get it?

359
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,603
Listen to me! This if you're
gonna need it out there.

360
00:49:13,336 --> 00:49:16,639
Mom, can we just stop this for
a second, please, this is creepy.

361
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:19,451
I just want to know you haven't
done something stupid.

362
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:22,248
No, I haven't.

363
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,355
Then, where did you get the money?

364
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,573
I'm not telling you.

365
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:28,088
And I never will.

366
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,496
Why?

367
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:36,341
Because... you've got Olly to sort out.

368
00:49:37,595 --> 00:49:43,669
You've got flights to book, you've got
hotels to arrange. You're wasting time.

369
00:49:50,764 --> 00:49:51,782
Okay.

370
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,746
No one's gonna break in.

371
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:10,648
Why don't you shout it a bit louder?
The end of the village didn't hear you.

372
00:50:21,554 --> 00:50:22,719
-

373
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,432
Do you want me to keep reading?

374
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,324
Yes. Okay.

375
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,376
Arks edged closer

376
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:41,720
... he saw a dark shadow in the oily water.

377
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:46,431
He looked at the shadow,
something very big.

378
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,988
Very dangerous.

379
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:55,290
"If only we could get a closer look at it!"
said Tex

380
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:05,366
Captain Osgast: "If the water level
keeps rising, he might swim up here.

381
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,526
and get a closer look."

382
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:31,818
Sorry. Train was late.

383
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,194
I said I'm sorry.

384
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,777
<i>Oh! Yes!</i>

385
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:23,577
<i>Oh! Yes!</i>

386
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,398
Give me the shock of my life, you did.

387
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,417
I'm not telling you.

388
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:40,061
Not telling me what?

389
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:42,361
Whatever it is you wanna know.

390
00:52:42,396 --> 00:52:44,036
You don't know what I'm
going to ask you yet.

391
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:45,268
I'm not telling you.

392
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:47,337
Why? What's so bad?

393
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,606
I'm not in trouble if that's what you're
worried about, I'm not that daft.

394
00:52:51,193 --> 00:52:53,337
I'm not telling you.

395
00:52:55,334 --> 00:52:56,998
Where did I put my scissors?

396
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,208
You really mean it, don't you?
You don't want me to know?

397
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:03,845
No.

398
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:12,081
So, presumably, this is the reason why it's gonna
be years before you can tell Olly your secret?

399
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:49,457
What was that banging?

400
00:53:54,538 --> 00:53:57,316
You're crazy! Separate,
Maggie, Separate! Otherwise...

401
00:54:04,192 --> 00:54:06,677
One week worked, P 600 paid of debt.

402
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:11,243
9 weeks left, P 5,400 still owed.

403
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:19,582
Is there anything else I need to know?

404
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:22,339
Like what?

405
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:27,207
Like: will you be decorating
the rest of my club as well?

406
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:31,678
Can I go now?

407
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:00,936
Who are you? You noisy cow!

408
00:55:01,323 --> 00:55:02,933
What the fuck you think you're doing?

409
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:05,717
Pervert!

410
00:55:29,264 --> 00:55:31,074
Penis Elbow.

411
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:33,172
Penis Elbow?

412
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:37,003
Yes, tennis players get Tennis Elbow,
we get Penis Elbow.

413
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:39,382
Penis Elbow.

414
00:55:41,283 --> 00:55:42,504
Been busy?

415
00:55:44,097 --> 00:55:46,096
Rest it for a while.

416
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:50,226
Apply this morning and evening.

417
00:55:50,603 --> 00:55:51,488
How long?

418
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:53,259
A week, at least.

419
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:57,351
You'll need to wear this for a while, as well.

420
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:05,116
Don't take it off, even at home.

421
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:10,053
Can you work with your left hand?

422
00:56:10,944 --> 00:56:11,866
Think so.

423
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:12,928
Good.

424
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,524
She's that good?

425
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:54,978
Oh, yes.

426
00:56:56,148 --> 00:56:57,755
You should see the fucking queue.

427
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:01,964
Find out a bit more about her.

428
00:57:05,104 --> 00:57:06,559
Don't let Miky find out.

429
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:14,384
Tea?

430
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:15,410
No, thanks.

431
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,950
Just got the flights for next week on thursday.

432
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,135
Fine.

433
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,608
What's happened to your arm?

434
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:22,290
This, nothing.

435
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:25,342
Doesn't look like nothing, you've
got your arm in a sling, what happened?

436
00:57:25,556 --> 00:57:28,540
Nothing to tell, really, it's just a sprain.

437
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:30,847
Doing what? What were you doing?

438
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,282
Just cleaning.

439
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,602
Really, it's nothing dramatic. 

440
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:37,209
You got any bread left?

441
00:57:37,474 --> 00:57:39,384
Yes. It's in the bin.

442
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:41,967
Thanks, mom.

443
00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:43,323
You're welcome.

444
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:44,644
Give my love to Olly.

445
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,429
Well, fine.

446
00:58:02,523 --> 00:58:05,094
Oh, been in the wars, are we?

447
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,430
Not really.

448
00:58:09,274 --> 00:58:10,243
Looks bad that.

449
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:13,231
Oh, no, it's - it's really nothing.

450
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,055
I'll have a -

451
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,078
Arm in a sling?

452
00:58:19,197 --> 00:58:21,104
It's nothing, really.

453
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:23,200
So, how did it happen then?

454
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:31,370
I'll have a pint of milk, please Edith,
and two scouring pads, please.

455
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:36,942
- Wrenched your arm, did you?
- No.

456
00:58:37,298 --> 00:58:38,756
- Lifting?
- No.

457
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:41,111
- Landing on back?
- No.

458
00:58:42,775 --> 00:58:44,930
So, just how did you do it then?

459
00:58:48,884 --> 00:58:50,701
Wouldn't you like to know.

460
00:58:55,347 --> 00:58:56,302
Thank you.

461
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:11,825
Luisa, what's wrong?

462
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,714
Fuck off!

463
00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:21,995
Empty boot and not enough
cliency is very bad image.

464
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,688
But you can't just sack her.

465
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:26,921
I sack people every week.

466
00:59:26,956 --> 00:59:29,170
But how can you? She's got a kid!

467
00:59:29,205 --> 00:59:31,385
People work here to make profits.

468
00:59:31,812 --> 00:59:32,554
But -

469
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:34,494
Clients want you, not her.

470
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:37,628
She leaves, you stay.
It's business.

471
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:40,964
If I give up my job,
you'll take her back?

472
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:42,233
How? You owe me.

473
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:44,731
You have 8 weeks left to pay your debt.

474
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:48,317
Then you'll leave.
Business is that.

475
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:55,364
So that's what I am to you.

476
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,754
Business.

477
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:16,892
What do you want?

478
01:01:21,571 --> 01:01:25,007
Look she's Maggie. She took my job.

479
01:01:36,537 --> 01:01:39,084
Doesn't sound too good, does it?

480
01:01:40,224 --> 01:01:43,833
Taking someone's job, my job,
you fucking bitch.

481
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:46,741
Why you're here?

482
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,257
Why?

483
01:01:53,748 --> 01:02:00,415
Feel guilty or come to see how
poorly I live?

484
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,763
Or come to help?

485
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,100
I thought we were friends.

486
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:14,123
Friends, yes. I had a good job,
good money. I help you, I teach you.

487
01:02:14,158 --> 01:02:17,667
I even told Miky how good you are.
And that's a friend, I think.

488
01:02:17,702 --> 01:02:19,471
And what did you do?

489
01:02:19,746 --> 01:02:20,952
I didn't do anything.

490
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,294
You didn't do anything? You took
my clients, you fucking tourist.

491
01:02:25,623 --> 01:02:26,072
Maybe -

492
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:27,701
Maybe just fuck off.

493
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:48,364
Got a cigarette?

494
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:12,624
7 weeks left, P 4,200 left to pay.

495
01:03:15,347 --> 01:03:16,428
How is your arm?

496
01:03:36,228 --> 01:03:39,154
Miss Irina, please let me have
the honor to show you something.

497
01:03:40,165 --> 01:03:41,713
Just across the road, here.

498
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,610
Piazza Irina P.

499
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:43,001

500
01:04:44,002 --> 01:04:45,254
That's for the best pay.

501
01:04:49,072 --> 01:04:49,994
What happened to your arm?

502
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,712
Penis Elbow.

503
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:08,590
You don't just wank the panties,
you train the girls. 

504
01:05:09,028 --> 01:05:12,325
With you here, this'll be the
classiest place in Soho.

505
01:05:12,882 --> 01:05:17,373
And you get 15% of all the girls
earnings, in top of your earn.

506
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:19,603
What do you say?

507
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:21,885
But I still owe Miky.

508
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:28,406
How much do you owe?

509
01:05:29,276 --> 01:05:31,339
Over P 4,000.

510
01:05:36,486 --> 01:05:37,857
I'll take care of that.

511
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:42,891
You owe me. What do you say?

512
01:05:48,162 --> 01:05:49,216
I've had an offer.

513
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:54,228
Who?

514
01:05:56,310 --> 01:06:01,102
Someone called Dave, Sex-o-Roma.

515
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,297
It's a lot of money.

516
01:06:19,487 --> 01:06:21,435
But I still owe you.

517
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:28,339
Tell me when you leave.

518
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:04,910
Where is she?

519
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,431
Maggie!

520
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:32,903
Maggie, stop please.

521
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:36,062
Why? I mean nothing to you.

522
01:07:36,856 --> 01:07:38,213
I'm just another Luisa.

523
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,793
You are not Luisa.

524
01:07:41,482 --> 01:07:43,414
Of course not, I'm valuable.

525
01:07:44,063 --> 01:07:45,350
I'm business.

526
01:07:48,055 --> 01:07:51,981
6 girls, I don't know
what I was thinking,

527
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:55,001
work in a place like that.

528
01:07:55,354 --> 01:07:56,828
It's like being a Madam.

529
01:07:57,837 --> 01:07:59,500
What am I doing here Miky?

530
01:08:02,448 --> 01:08:03,809
I don't know what you are doing here.

531
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:05,526
I just came for Olly.

532
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:06,861
Who is Olly?

533
01:08:07,075 --> 01:08:09,624
My grandson. He's dying.

534
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:13,922
He's dying and I'm wanking. It's mess.

535
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:16,561
What am I gonna do?

536
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,185
But you said yes?

537
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:25,377
No, I didn't.
At leat I think I didn't.

538
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:30,955
- What do you want to do?
- Stay.

539
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:37,383
You should smile more.

540
01:08:44,322 --> 01:08:45,242

541
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:53,869
Mom?

542
01:09:01,539 --> 01:09:03,320
Hi Jane, it's me, Tom.

543
01:09:03,728 --> 01:09:04,868
<i>Tom, do you know what time it is?</i>

544
01:09:05,138 --> 01:09:08,521
Yes, I know, sorry it's late.
Is mom there? Just -

545
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:12,492
<i>Of course not, why would she be?
Is there a problem?</i>

546
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:15,370
No, it's nothing. I remember, a thing,
she's... she's somewhere else.

547
01:09:16,663 --> 01:09:17,400
<i>Are you sure?</i>

548
01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:20,216
Yes, okay, no, no, it's nothing.

549
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:21,247
- Goodbye.
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

550
01:09:24,108 --> 01:09:25,687
She said it was a secret.

551
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,655
And?

552
01:09:37,892 --> 01:09:38,992
She left.

553
01:09:40,035 --> 01:09:41,449
Went to America.

554
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:50,147
Wanted to be a doctor or
find someone who could give her ...

555
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:53,866
You never saw her again?

556
01:09:56,881 --> 01:09:58,180
No I can't.

557
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:04,477
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

558
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:07,352
I hate people.

559
01:10:17,357 --> 01:10:18,464
Mallorca.

560
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:31,480
For retirement, if it's ever finished.

561
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:34,750
You know

562
01:10:38,251 --> 01:10:41,094
I really do like your smile. 

563
01:10:48,765 --> 01:10:50,851
I like the way you work. 

564
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,224
Thanks for walking me.

565
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,086
What'll I do about Dave? 

566
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:20,737
I'll sort it out, it's okay.

567
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:41,829
I think I better go,
I can't miss the last train.

568
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:24,788
Pretty sling.

569
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,278
How's that feel?

570
01:12:35,497 --> 01:12:39,017
Not bad. It's a bit stiff.

571
01:12:39,353 --> 01:12:41,142
It'll be alright in a couple of days.

572
01:12:41,873 --> 01:12:43,464
Ease yourself back into it.

573
01:12:47,604 --> 01:12:48,921
Take it easy.

574
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:54,307
Bye!

575
01:12:56,341 --> 01:12:58,628
Goodbye and thank you very much.

576
01:12:59,077 --> 01:13:04,391
It's nothing. It's been an
honor to treat Irina Palm.

577
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,285
Bye girls!

578
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,169
After next one tell Maggie
to come to my office.

579
01:17:24,871 --> 01:17:26,780
I just want to see if you're alright.

580
01:17:28,451 --> 01:17:31,591
Olly's dying, you're on the game,
sunshine, what more can I want?

581
01:17:31,841 --> 01:17:32,320
Tom.

582
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:33,622
I'm taking your money back.

583
01:17:33,919 --> 01:17:35,546
I know you must be -

584
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:36,978
You must be what?

585
01:17:37,013 --> 01:17:38,341
You must to understand!

586
01:17:38,376 --> 01:17:42,091
No, I don't understand.
No, I don't understand, not a thing.

587
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:46,270
I don't understand advanced maths,
I don't understand black holes

588
01:17:46,305 --> 01:17:48,804
or why people like the Beatles.
I don't understand, I don't understand

589
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:50,738
why my mother is a whore.

590
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:52,818
I'm not a whore.

591
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,732
Tom, I think you should apologize..

592
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:58,281
Sorry, sorry, sex worker. Isn't that
the bullshit term for a whore these days?

593
01:17:58,486 --> 01:18:01,422
I'm not a whore, take that back.

594
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:06,470
I'm paying your money back, every
penny. Every fucking penny!

595
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:07,940
Every penny, mom!

596
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:08,940
Tom, please.

597
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:13,898
Every penny, and it's not enough so in the
world that can clean what you've been doing.

598
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,543
- Tom are going to stop it now?
- Every slimy penny!

599
01:18:16,578 --> 01:18:17,781
We can't get the money back.

600
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:20,253
Don't tell me what I can do!

601
01:18:20,288 --> 01:18:21,830
Stop telling me!

602
01:18:22,382 --> 01:18:26,623
For the last five years people have been
telling me: do this, do that

603
01:18:26,658 --> 01:18:31,097
don't do this, don't do that,
try this, try that, don't try this,

604
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:34,456
Just leave me alone!
Don't fucking tell me!

605
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,058
I don't regret what I've done.

606
01:18:46,123 --> 01:18:48,898
And don't you ever call me that word again.

607
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:54,976
If you ever set foot in that place again,
you'll never see Olly again.

608
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:57,057
Ever.

609
01:18:57,514 --> 01:18:59,341
Never! Never!

610
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:02,588
He will not have grandmother who's a whore.

611
01:19:30,545 --> 01:19:31,564
Tell them you're not coming back.

612
01:19:32,032 --> 01:19:32,922
Tom, I -

613
01:19:33,124 --> 01:19:34,218
You tell them, now!

614
01:19:34,843 --> 01:19:35,906
It's not that simple.

615
01:19:36,112 --> 01:19:38,173
I don't care mom.
You tell them now, please.

616
01:19:38,453 --> 01:19:40,986
Tell them now, right now,
right this minute. Tell them please!

617
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:48,836
Sexy World.

618
01:19:56,695 --> 01:19:57,452
Hello?

619
01:19:58,182 --> 01:19:59,793
Can I speak to Miky, please?

620
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,076
Thank you.

621
01:20:03,509 --> 01:20:06,184
Miky, this is Maggie.

622
01:20:06,462 --> 01:20:07,324
What happened?

623
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:10,469
I'm sorry but it's my son.

624
01:20:11,128 --> 01:20:12,871
I will coming back.

625
01:20:13,182 --> 01:20:14,467
You have to.

626
01:20:14,502 --> 01:20:15,815
Yes, I know -

627
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:21,734
Listen, she's not ever coming back.
Do you hear?

628
01:20:22,183 --> 01:20:23,543
You're fucking money!
I'll bring it back!

629
01:21:23,905 --> 01:21:25,457
Hi Maggie.

630
01:21:27,139 --> 01:21:28,079
Hello.

631
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,615
Now meet the woman of mystery.

632
01:21:29,982 --> 01:21:32,250
Yes, what's all this about the job?

633
01:21:35,063 --> 01:21:36,222
It's no mystery.

634
01:21:36,426 --> 01:21:37,923
Why all the secrecy?

635
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:41,205
I must say I was rather
shocked by your behaviour.

636
01:21:42,677 --> 01:21:44,661
I think someone's got a little secret.

637
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:46,923
Spill the beans, Maggs.

638
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:54,240
I forgot sad Maggs, what you're talking
about isn't something dramatically interesting.

639
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,194
I wank men off.

640
01:22:01,427 --> 01:22:02,383
Wank?

641
01:22:05,628 --> 01:22:07,104
Masturbation?

642
01:22:09,478 --> 01:22:12,165
You masturbate men?

643
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:16,036
Is that boring enough for you?

644
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:18,881
Why?

645
01:22:19,774 --> 01:22:21,072
Money.

646
01:22:22,099 --> 01:22:29,068
Whithout wishing to prime Maggs, how does it,
not really anyone business of course, but -

647
01:22:29,415 --> 01:22:32,535
How, how did you do?

648
01:22:34,727 --> 01:22:38,068
Well, they stick their cocks

649
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:44,427
through a whole in the wall

650
01:22:50,618 --> 01:22:54,399
I wank them off, they come,

651
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:57,826
end of story.

652
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:05,266
Miky says I've got the best
right hand in London.

653
01:23:05,549 --> 01:23:06,411
Miky?

654
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:07,917
Club owner.

655
01:23:13,734 --> 01:23:15,083
In Soho?

656
01:23:15,118 --> 01:23:16,433
Sexy World.

657
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:19,561
I'm Irina Palm.

658
01:23:20,449 --> 01:23:21,761
I'm the best.

659
01:23:23,855 --> 01:23:25,465
Irina Palm?

660
01:23:25,748 --> 01:23:27,357
Stage name.

661
01:23:27,565 --> 01:23:29,052
Everyone has one.

662
01:23:30,253 --> 01:23:33,358
These look delicious Jane,
Did you make them yourself?

663
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:37,145
Yes.

664
01:23:39,586 --> 01:23:46,295
When you say cocks, are any of them...
are any of them... are they -

665
01:23:49,843 --> 01:23:51,058
Big?

666
01:23:51,862 --> 01:23:52,362
Yes.

667
01:23:53,809 --> 01:23:55,970
Well, sometimes..

668
01:23:57,183 --> 01:24:00,918
Every now and then, you do get one.

669
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:07,234
That's, well, I'm talking...

670
01:24:15,405 --> 01:24:18,124
Penis Elbow.

671
01:24:19,143 --> 01:24:21,349
Penis Elbow?

672
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:22,348
Yes.

673
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:27,501
Well,

674
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:31,961
goodbye.

675
01:24:42,574 --> 01:24:46,238
I was just thinking of Trevor, if he'd
been alive, would you have told him?

676
01:24:49,287 --> 01:24:51,927
No, probably not.

677
01:26:34,045 --> 01:26:35,749
I'm not giving back the money,
it's for Olly.

678
01:26:37,248 --> 01:26:38,827
Stop being so obstinate.

679
01:26:39,973 --> 01:26:42,802
I don't care how she got the money.
She got it that's all that matters.

680
01:26:42,837 --> 01:26:43,969
To you, maybe.

681
01:26:44,374 --> 01:26:46,035
Stop being so fucking sanctimonious.

682
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:48,704
Thomas! Thomas!

683
01:26:48,927 --> 01:26:50,249
Look we all boast about what
we would do for our kid,

684
01:26:50,284 --> 01:26:53,225
how precious they are,
how we would die for them.

685
01:26:53,517 --> 01:26:55,414
Well, I've just found out what that means.

686
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:57,584
God knows there are times
when I could swing for her.

687
01:26:57,619 --> 01:27:00,160
But Maggie put herself in the line.
For my son.

688
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:01,957
And I'm grateful.

689
01:27:24,396 --> 01:27:25,292
Thanks.

690
01:27:34,147 --> 01:27:35,320
How is he?

691
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:37,182
He'll come around.

692
01:27:43,484 --> 01:27:46,280
I came here to say, to say -

693
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:52,652
Thanks, really.

694
01:27:53,828 --> 01:27:59,001
It hasn't been a great deal between us,
I know... What you've done!

695
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,218
We want you to come with us.

696
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:09,171
But you need the money.

697
01:28:09,406 --> 01:28:10,797
It'll be a bit less.

698
01:28:16,228 --> 01:28:18,801
Tom will come around, I'm sure he will.

699
01:28:23,877 --> 01:28:25,217

700
01:28:30,397 --> 01:28:32,082
Tell me he's gonna be alright.

701
01:28:40,764 --> 01:28:41,686
Please!

702
01:28:43,201 --> 01:28:45,205
Please tell me he's gonna be okay.

703
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:29,131
Busy.

704
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:31,287
<i>Merry Christmas, Maggie.</i>

705
01:29:48,609 --> 01:29:50,103
Oh... we are honered.

706
01:29:53,852 --> 01:29:55,484
Packet of Bremmies, please Edith.

707
01:29:57,345 --> 01:30:04,115
By the way, given your new profession
I found, how should I say this,

708
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:07,804
a more salubrious partner.

709
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,646
I know about you and Trevor.

710
01:30:11,836 --> 01:30:12,894
I beg your pardon?

711
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,321
Your affair with my husband.

712
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:16,853
I've known for years.

713
01:30:17,854 --> 01:30:19,083
I don't know what you are talking about.

714
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:21,756
We're not all like you, you know.

715
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:23,491
I know everything.

716
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:25,869
Times, dates, places.

717
01:30:26,914 --> 01:30:30,334
I know how much you liked
being spanked.

718
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:34,663
He confessed before he died.

719
01:30:35,772 --> 01:30:37,332
Couldn't take the guilt.

720
01:30:37,616 --> 01:30:42,711
You know Trevor,
weak like is tea.

721
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:56,240
You know what it is? I really
fancy a package of Fruit & Nuts.

722
01:30:57,047 --> 01:30:58,891
I haven't had one for ages.

723
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:19,274
Here I am.

724
01:31:22,618 --> 01:31:23,662
Where's Sarah?

725
01:31:24,948 --> 01:31:27,053
The doctor said she stayed with
Olly at the hospital.

726
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,146
We are going to follow
the ambulance to the airport.

727
01:32:13,384 --> 01:32:14,840
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where have you been?

728
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:15,744
Traffic.

729
01:32:15,995 --> 01:32:19,406
Olly, you alright? Have you got everything?
Have you got your books?

730
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,810
I love you, just be -

731
01:32:22,845 --> 01:32:24,171
Come on.

732
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:26,016
- Okay, come on.

733
01:32:26,987 --> 01:32:28,124
I'm not going.

734
01:32:28,826 --> 01:32:29,707
What?

735
01:32:30,172 --> 01:32:32,204
I said I'm not going.

736
01:32:33,563 --> 01:32:34,937
Olly is going to be fine.

737
01:32:36,358 --> 01:32:37,765
You don't need me here for that.

738
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:41,801
In fact you'll be better off
without me.

739
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:45,318
Why aren't you coming?

740
01:32:51,642 --> 01:32:52,848
I can't tell you now.

741
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:55,942
Remember? Our secret!

742
01:32:55,977 --> 01:32:57,065
Yes.

743
01:32:57,758 --> 01:33:01,175
And I'll see you when you
get back. When you're well.

744
01:33:02,394 --> 01:33:04,290

745
01:33:12,057 --> 01:33:13,194
Thank you, Maggie.

746
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:48,527
Subtitled by Catherine
Sorry if I missed something!
