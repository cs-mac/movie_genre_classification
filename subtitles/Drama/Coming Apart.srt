1
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:06,207
The Mexican cartels have
1,500 miles of border between them

2
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,813
and the greatest drug-consuming
nation on earth...

3
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,304
...separated
by a 15-foot-high fence

4
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:15,683
which starts at the Pacific Ocean

5
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,983
and travels the distance
of four states.

6
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,473
They flood our streets,
day after day, week after week,

7
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:37,774
at an average of 20 tons a month.

8
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,463
That's enough to provide
a line of cocaine

9
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:43,081
for every man, woman,
and child on this planet.

10
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,810
- Yeah?
- It's me.

11
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:06,819
What's up?

12
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,376
I've got tickets
to the Tuesday game.

13
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:11,907
- Is that right?
- Row 10, seat 14.

14
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,675
14? Oh, I'm with that!
I'll see you there.

15
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,521
From 10 tons
a week ago in Colombia

16
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,600
to one bump tonight in L.A.,

17
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,351
worlds away from the men

18
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:23,042
who run
the whole goddamned show.

19
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,759
And remember, no one must
make all the arrests.

20
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,765
We book them downtown,

21
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:49,451
and the extradition will
take place from there.

22
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:50,878
Are we clear?

23
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:54,251
We're clear that you wouldn't be
going in there without us.

24
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,613
You heard the man.

25
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:58,816
Let's get ready to move.
Demetrius, let's have the gun.

26
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,859
- Esta loco.
- You gotta be kidding me, Frost.

27
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,085
We are on their turf.
Isn't that right, Sean?

28
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,311
Come on.

29
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,830
Memo Lucero was a Colombian

30
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:40,262
who saw opportunity in Mexico's
northern border towns.

31
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,357
He set up shop in Tijuana

32
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,833
and built the busiest,
most lucrative drug pipeline

33
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,062
the world has ever seen.

34
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,858
Lucero never slept
in the same place twice,

35
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,029
so no one
ever knew where he was.

36
00:04:56,005 --> 00:05:00,806
But after seven years,
we finally tracked him down.

37
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,433
Let's go.

38
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,759
Frost, this is stupid.

39
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,169
They call us down here.
They take away our weapons?

40
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,924
They expect us to go
into a building

41
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:14,751
full of drunken
cartel gunmen unarmed?

42
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,128
I mean, that isn't fun.

43
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,034
You're not getting paid
to have fun.

44
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,148
Good luck, gentlemen.

45
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,278
Bureaucrats!

46
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,413
Ay, chingado.

47
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,332
All right.

48
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,013
Stay down!

49
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:24,954
Shit!

50
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:59,341
You have no idea what kind
of mistake you're making.

51
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:08,320
Put your hands up!

52
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,788
Things are only
gonna get worse, for all of us.

53
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:13,781
Do me a favor
and shut the fuck up!

54
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:24,928
Come on.

55
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:40,641
Boss, let me go home
and see my wife.

56
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:42,680
- I'll think about it.
- I can't go home and see my wife?

57
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,158
I'll think about it!
Get out of here, you knucklehead!

58
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:48,043
Hey! Good job!

59
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:50,436
Damn right, good job!

60
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,201
Seven years, dog!

61
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,483
We got him!

62
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,061
- Where are you?
- Honey, I'm still down here.

63
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:17,464
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

64
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:19,151
It was a little crazy,

65
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:21,911
but I'll be home tomorrow
or the next day.

66
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:23,028
Right.

67
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,518
Baby...

68
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:27,209
...what are you wearing?

69
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:30,909
One of your old jerseys.

70
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:35,231
Not that blue one that you
look incredibly sexy in.

71
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,107
Yeah, the one that
smells like you.

72
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:42,349
- Is that a good thing?
- It's a great thing.

73
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,480
What are you doing right now?

74
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,451
Making candles.

75
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,435
Is that pine or evergreen?

76
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,244
Sean!

77
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,499
It's my favorite one.

78
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,077
Of course it is.

79
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,518
Oh, I miss you!

80
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,584
Two months ago,
with the arrest of Memo Lucero,

81
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:09,272
we finally dealt the Pacific corridor

82
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,096
its first substantial blow.

83
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,775
We didn't talk like cops,
we didn't look like cops,

84
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,757
we didn't act like cops.

85
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:20,684
For that matter, we never
hung out with them, either.

86
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,456
We had an edge that came
from growing up on the streets.

87
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,202
That's why were
the most successful

88
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,756
anti-narcotics crew
in law enforcement.

89
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:32,059
We made the dent that
the naysayers said we couldn't make.

90
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,670
From this day forward,
things will be different.

91
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:40,072
By taking out Lucero,

92
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:43,207
we have cut the head
off the dragon.

93
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,245
And now we are sending
an emphatic message

94
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,176
to anyone out there
who may have designs

95
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:53,653
on filling the void
left by Memo Lucero.

96
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:56,641
The cartels know now

97
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,990
that the U.S. Will not stand by idly

98
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,790
while they pollute our shores
with their narcotics.

99
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:03,039
What's happening, homes?

100
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:10,412
Peace will be restored,
and the flow of cocaine will stop.

101
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:36,068
I'm happy to announce
that, effective today,

102
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,816
their business
in Southern California is over.

103
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:46,962
To the men and women
of our undercover units,

104
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,124
enjoy the accolades,
because you've certainly earned them.

105
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,064
They want to play in a tournament.
They want to ball against us, dog.

106
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,557
Against who?

107
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,504
Ramon Cardena
was killed yesterday.

108
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,673
- Who, Lucero's guy?
- Yeah, state's attorney's.

109
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,378
I'm not gonna shed
any tears over it,

110
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,004
but I am concerned
about one thing...

111
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,500
this could get a little bit messy.

112
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,358
Frost, this is for you.

113
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,779
It's eucalyptus, for enlightenment.

114
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,737
Enlightenment?
Baby, he's a senior citizen.

115
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,925
- Give him the Viagra candle.
- Sean!

116
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,470
Big Sexy!

117
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,447
What's up, dog?

118
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,712
What did I tell you about smoking?

119
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,742
I got you, dog.

120
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,034
You don't want me to
put you in the sleeper hold.

121
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,604
What's up with all these
damn narc cars out here?

122
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,004
Is this a police convention?

123
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,234
Supposed to be
a damn barbecue, dog.

124
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,407
Believe me, you're cool here.
You're with me. It's my house.

125
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,804
I sure hope
it's cool to go through.

126
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,770
- Thanks.
- Hi.

127
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,427
What's up with that?

128
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,088
What's up, my Main D?

129
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:35,199
Yo, Sexy,
what's going on, boy?

130
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,154
Man, it's cracking out here.

131
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,621
Check that out.

132
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,602
- Yeah!
- Oh, my goodness!

133
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,015
Talkin' to me!

134
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,239
Yeah?

135
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,371
Imagine she was like us...

136
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,721
just wanted to fuck,
you know what I'm saying?

137
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,955
Right here, right now.
Why can't women think like that?

138
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,955
Sometimes a man
got to get his fuck on

139
00:17:56,947 --> 00:18:00,041
without love getting
in the way of it, that's all I'm saying.

140
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,750
Can I get an amen up in here?

141
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,509
- Amen.
- That's what I'm talking about.

142
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:06,943
Now, I'm sure that my man Sean
feels the same way, right?

143
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,129
- Yes.
- Huh?

144
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:11,048
- Yes.
- Get the hell out of here!

145
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:13,189
Why you trying
to do that to me?

146
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,196
Hey, dog, his girl
got him whipped, dog, for real.

147
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:19,172
- Oh, you're not whipped?
- No. I'm peeping right now.

148
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:22,490
You still got the game?
Candice!

149
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,336
No, no, I'm just joking.

150
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:27,526
We're having a debate about
the survival of the species...

151
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,804
You're having a what?

152
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,862
Both of y'all whipped!
Look at y'all!

153
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,053
What are you guys
talking about?

154
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,094
You see what I'm talking about?

155
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,308
All changed!

156
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,433
Want to help out your pops?

157
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,216
Give me...

158
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,298
D.E.A., punk. Don't move,
bitch, or I'll blast you!

159
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,691
No, that's enough of that.

160
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:57,085
Don't be teaching her that
funky armlock and curse words.

161
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,071
What?
I didn't make her do it.

162
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,035
Hicks taught her that, not me.

163
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:06,488
- You didn't teach her that?
- I just taught her to...

164
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,015
- I love watching you with her.
- Do you?

165
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,299
You're so sweet.

166
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:16,087
Sounded rough to you?

167
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:19,451
Yeah. I know you taught her that.

168
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,269
I love you.

169
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,766
Want me to kick everyone out?

170
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,710
You read my mind.

171
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:31,678
- Who loves you?
- You.

172
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,272
Que pasa, homes?

173
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,265
What's up?

174
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,826
What do you think, homes?

175
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,802
What do I think?

176
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:59,179
Got equipment or what, man?

177
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,852
Good shit, man.

178
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:05,517
I think we should
let the games begin.

179
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,736
I'll take care of him.

180
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,926
I'm so proud of you, baby.

181
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,124
Who is it, baby?

182
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:27,665
Get down!

183
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,018
Stay down!

184
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:35,359
Fuck!

185
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,631
Hey!

186
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:50,007
Hey!

187
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:02,245
Hey, you fuck, you come
into my house while I sleep?

188
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,618
You can't kill Diablo.

189
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,047
What did you say?

190
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,730
You cannot kill Diablo.

191
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:31,330
Stace, call 9-1-1.

192
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:41,444
Get up.

193
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,461
Are you...?

194
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,069
Baby...

195
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:02,071
...I'm okay.

196
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:05,474
I got 'em. I protected you.

197
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,647
You okay?

198
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:11,100
- You hit?
- I am.

199
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:19,801
Honey?

200
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,324
I'm okay.

201
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:28,580
9-1-1.

202
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,568
All right, baby...

203
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:32,487
Hello?

204
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:33,804
...Iook at me.

205
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:36,851
Sir?

206
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,382
What's the nature
of the emergency?

207
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,015
I'm fine.

208
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,752
What kind of assistance
do you require?

209
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,186
I'm okay.

210
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,956
I can't understand you, sir.
Can you speak up?

211
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:55,848
Baby...

212
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,324
Are you there, sir?

213
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:36,854
It's all right.

214
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:42,529
Say hi to Uncle Sean.

215
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,514
Hi, Sean.

216
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,587
It's all right, dog.

217
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,119
Just rest.

218
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:56,768
Stacy.

219
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,745
Stacy.

220
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:08,890
Sean.

221
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:15,896
Sean.

222
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,212
Where's Stacy?

223
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,687
Where's my wife?

224
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:34,166
Look, man, um...

225
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:37,869
You've been out for a while.
You lost a lot of blood.

226
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,572
Where is she?

227
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,323
They buried her, Sean.

228
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,567
Where's my wife?

229
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:26,439
Calm down.
Calm down, now.

230
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:37,736
I've got you, man.

231
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,487
I've got you.

232
00:26:40,923 --> 00:26:42,515
I'm here for you, man.

233
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:46,484
Fight on, man.
We'll take care of you.

234
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,363
Which one is it?

235
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,398
Right over there.

236
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:07,429
This prisoner is
in for two life sentences.

237
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,623
He's got nothing to lose,
but that doesn't matter.

238
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,998
You and I both know

239
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:13,441
who this guy is
and what he is capable of,

240
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:15,874
so you stay ten feet away
from him at all times,

241
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,932
and do not touch or threaten
the prisoner at any time.

242
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:21,369
- We clear?
- Clear. Open it up.

243
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,958
You've got five minutes.

244
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,313
You didn't expect
to see me again, did you?

245
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,678
Ten feet, Vetter!

246
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:51,121
- This good?
- Yeah.

247
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:55,355
You tried to have me killed...

248
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,370
...and you don't want
to talk to me?

249
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,065
That's okay. I have
all the time in the world.

250
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,060
Get him out of here!

251
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:14,225
You didn't think
I was gonna get to you?

252
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,297
Is that your family?

253
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,562
All right, fuck the talk.

254
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,567
Let me just ask you a question.

255
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:29,447
Did you kill my wife?

256
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:39,125
Did you kill my wife?

257
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,906
Answer me, motherfucker.

258
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,820
Answer the fucking question!

259
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,137
Vetter, step away
from the prisoner!

260
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,565
Vetter, damn it, I told you!

261
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:58,286
Get away from him.
Get away.

262
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,968
I was just
asking him for a smoke.

263
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:03,021
Get off me.

264
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:05,697
I got a smoke for you.

265
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,449
If I wanted you dead...

266
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,231
...you would be.

267
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:25,500
That's enough.
Let's go, Vetter.

268
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:26,906
Come on. Come on!

269
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:27,902
Come on!

270
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:29,199
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:35,877
Come on, Vetter, let's move.

272
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:38,247
Come on.

273
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:48,584
The order to hit my home
had to come from the top,

274
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:52,208
but to find that person,
you have to start at the bottom

275
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,064
and work your way
up the pipeline.

276
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,508
Somewhere along the line,
someone will talk.

277
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:01,572
- Yo, "T," what up?
- What's up with you?

278
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,663
Chillin', man.
Where Sexy at?

279
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:05,742
- In the house.
- Okay.

280
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,952
Yo, Big Sexy.

281
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,363
What's up, boy?

282
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,667
What's up with your D-Max?

283
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,616
- Chillin', dog.
- I'm glad you came.

284
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:17,834
I didn't know y'all was rolling.
Sean. What's up, man?

285
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:22,444
If you need a place to stay,
you are more than welcome.

286
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,632
All right?

287
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,305
Hey, man, we've got to
get at you about something.

288
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,757
So what's up?

289
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,705
We need to know who
out there moving major weight.

290
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,174
What kind of weight
y'all talking about?

291
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:36,917
Distribution level.
Some real shit.

292
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:39,029
Guys who are hooked up
with this new network.

293
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:42,536
Why you drinking out
the milk carton? Get a glass, man.

294
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,525
Damn!

295
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:45,784
Sexy, for real, man.

296
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,323
Talkin' about this weight,
we need to know who movin' it.

297
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,225
Those niggas
over in Ghost Town.

298
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:53,180
They movin' major weight
over by that church, man.

299
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:57,115
You still runnin' that dog?
You know, with your little dog?

300
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:58,688
I got the dog thing goin'.

301
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:02,411
Sean, I'm thinking
that could help us out.

302
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,568
You down with
hitting them fools up?

303
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:08,062
I don't care much about
them niggas on that side of town.

304
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:10,902
- Let's hit 'em up.
- Yeah, like tonight.

305
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,182
Cool.

306
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:14,662
I heard you came by the hospital.

307
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,455
Sorry, man.

308
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,731
I appreciate that.

309
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,106
That's cool.

310
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,796
I'm telling you, man,

311
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,721
we should have brought
the D.E.A. Dogs out here.

312
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:34,470
Come on, D,
don't insult me like that.

313
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:38,794
Capone will sniff a roach
out of the ashtray

314
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:41,221
out of any damn car on the block,
you know what I'm talking about?

315
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,679
- Well, get to sniffin'.
- Chill, chill, chill.

316
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:47,052
- We ain't got all night.
- Come on, boy.

317
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,186
Go get 'em, boy.

318
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,632
Come on, Capone.

319
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:02,830
All right, cool.

320
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:04,513
Go on, baby.

321
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,924
What's taking so long?
We ain't got all night, man.

322
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,689
Yeah.

323
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:17,869
Ain't in that one.

324
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:22,039
Come on, Capone.

325
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:25,572
- He got it.
- You sure?

326
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:26,901
Yeah, I'm sure!

327
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:29,650
He got it, man.

328
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:41,621
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
What you call yourself doing?

329
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:43,267
This ain't your car!
You get away from here.

330
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:45,634
Easy, ma'am,
I'm just doing my job.

331
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:47,663
You assholes ain't got
nothing else to do

332
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,110
but come harass innocent,
hardworking citizens with this crap?

333
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:53,605
This is an honest,
blue-collar neighborhood.

334
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:55,437
Why don't you take your fat ass
up to the Palisades?

335
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,089
They could afford to pay
those $130 tow jobs.

336
00:34:57,092 --> 00:34:59,754
This is an official impound.
It has five tickets.

337
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,946
My man, we got this.
Is this your vehicle?

338
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:04,825
It could be my vehicle.
Who are you supposed to be?

339
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:08,174
This is who I'm
supposed to be, right here.

340
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,661
Sexy, pop the trunk, man.

341
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:18,646
Dog, what you doin'?
Pop the trunk!

342
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,619
Hurry up!
Fuck is going on? Come on.

343
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:29,974
Damn!

344
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,602
Now, is that your shit?

345
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:35,810
Is this your car or not? Is it?

346
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:37,614
Come to think about it...

347
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:40,507
No. That's Monroe's car.

348
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:43,286
- Monroe?
- They call him Overdose.

349
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:45,671
- Where he stay?
- Right over there.

350
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:48,697
All right.
Go on back in the house.

351
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,978
Ain't got
enough time for this stuff.

352
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,400
Tow the car, nigga.

353
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,269
Yo, Sexy,
you've got to come here.

354
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:08,041
I ain't meetin' y'all
over here like this!

355
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:11,063
- Sexy, roll, man.
- Careful, man.

356
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:50,212
We got dope.

357
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,581
Aw, shit! Fuck!

358
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:32,317
"Diablo."

359
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,078
Fuck!

360
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:12,984
Hold your fire!
We're police officers!

361
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,426
Get the fuck out of my house!

362
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,238
- You got to chill!
- "Chill"? Fuck you!

363
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:23,063
You want me to chill
so you can ice me?

364
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:25,107
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out!

365
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,500
Yo, listen, I said
we're police officers, so relax.

366
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,876
We're here to help. That's all.

367
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:38,091
I'm coming up, all right?

368
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,852
Do your thing.
I'm reloading my shit.

369
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,777
Sean, hold your fire.

370
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,453
Now, look, man, I'm coming up,
so you've got to stop shooting.

371
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:54,479
Don't try nothing, homey.

372
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:56,464
Just take it easy, all right?

373
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:58,425
If we were the cleanup crew,

374
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:01,969
we would have finished you off
from down here, man.

375
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,059
Wouldn't be sticking my head
in here trying to get shot.

376
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:09,355
Just want to talk, all right?
Now, I'm coming up.

377
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:10,278
Slow.

378
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:26,184
I put my gun down, all right?

379
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:52,927
I know you scared.

380
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:55,236
I know you don't like the police...

381
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:58,542
Damn sure talking
to a police in an attic.

382
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:02,707
Back in the day,
I couldn't stand the police.

383
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,297
They used to fuck with us
all the time.

384
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:06,391
Me and my homies would be
rolling down the street.

385
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:07,810
They'd pull us over jackin' fools.

386
00:40:07,818 --> 00:40:09,945
- You po-po.
- I know.

387
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,991
We used to complain that police
didn't do nothing for us.

388
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:16,662
And we was right, they didn't.

389
00:40:16,618 --> 00:40:20,315
I got tired of complaining.
I made a choice.

390
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:22,787
I'm trying to help.

391
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:28,232
But what you doin', man,
you ain't helpin' us.

392
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,262
By the way things look downstairs,

393
00:40:32,235 --> 00:40:35,466
you need to think about
getting into a whole 'nother game.

394
00:40:37,323 --> 00:40:40,781
Only one alternative...
you put that gun down,

395
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:43,684
or my partner downstairs,
man, trust me,

396
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:45,594
he will take you out.

397
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:53,708
Now, do the right thing
and just put it down.

398
00:41:02,315 --> 00:41:05,375
Since everything went down
with the big man,

399
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,451
shit has been major slow,
know what I'm sayin'?

400
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:10,268
He went up to,
like, $20,000 a ki.

401
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:13,347
I couldn't do nothing
with that, man.

402
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:16,261
This new dude was
supposed to hook me up...

403
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:19,730
- Who's this new dude?
- I don't know his name.

404
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:22,355
He contacted me, say he had
this, that, and the other.

405
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:26,649
He said he had kis for $14,000,
so I'm thinkin' everything's velvet.

406
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,167
- Right.
- But hell no.

407
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:30,332
Then this stupid motherfucker
gonna call me back,

408
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:33,079
telling me some shit about,
he want $20,000 a ki,

409
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:34,764
and I got to buy it?

410
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:37,699
I'm like, man, you stupid!
Who you think you talkin' to?

411
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:38,940
You kiss my ass.

412
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,480
- So what happened?
- What you mean?

413
00:41:40,492 --> 00:41:42,483
Why you still alive
and your homies are dead?

414
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:43,908
I was in the attic.

415
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,247
- Doin' what?
- Hidin'.

416
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,125
What kind of coward shit
is that, man?

417
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:48,846
You see homey
in there in that chair

418
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:51,312
with his tongue
pulled through his neck?

419
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:55,603
You'd better get real.
Reflexes too slow.

420
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:57,500
Enough of the bullshit, dog.

421
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:00,697
The name... the new guy,
what is his name?

422
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,619
I ain't tellin' y'all shit else.
Nothin' else.

423
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,156
I'm cool with y'all.

424
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:06,791
These motherfuckers ain't no joke!

425
00:42:06,796 --> 00:42:09,458
They would scalp me and send
my braids to my momma!

426
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,321
What y'all gonna do,
take me to jail?

427
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:14,066
Take me, then.
I'm cold anyway.

428
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,153
Give me a fuckin' coat.
Put me in the car.

429
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,324
We got us a hardhead right now.

430
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:22,769
- You sure about that?
- Actin' like you want to, man.

431
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:24,223
You're not gonna
tell us anything else?

432
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,261
Nothing else!

433
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,712
- You don't want to talk anymore?
- He ain't gonna talk.

434
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:32,577
You sure about that?

435
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:34,993
Here you go.

436
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,285
You think you a player
'cause you got an S600?

437
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:41,987
Not because of those
wack-ass dubs on that piece of shit.

438
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,595
Oh, yeah.

439
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:46,430
Does he think 'cause of this tatt
he's a gangster?

440
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:47,575
Get your hands off me.

441
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:49,360
Not 'cause of
the played-out platinum.

442
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,951
You don't think you're
crossing them over, do you?

443
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:55,011
Back in the day,
I would have taken this from you.

444
00:42:54,957 --> 00:42:58,222
You think you're a man because
you move a ki here and there.

445
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:01,524
That ain't weight! Did he think
that was weight in that piece of shit?

446
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:05,309
Let me tell you something...

447
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:07,727
the real motherfuckers
don't move a ki here and there.

448
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:10,026
They move
50 metric tons a month!

449
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:12,539
I'm gonna ask you...

450
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,320
Get your gun
out of my face, man.

451
00:43:15,278 --> 00:43:16,836
Okay.

452
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:19,372
We'll do it like this.

453
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:24,704
Okay.

454
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:30,647
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

455
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,235
What's the name?

456
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,853
I don't know their name!
Hey, man!

457
00:43:39,214 --> 00:43:41,842
I'm gonna ask you again.
What the fuck is his name?

458
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,103
Hey, man!

459
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:45,814
- What's up with your people?
- What's the fucking name?

460
00:43:47,277 --> 00:43:48,676
I don't know, man!

461
00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:50,482
Motherfucker named
Hollywood Jack, man!

462
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:52,241
Hollywood Jack, man.
My name Monroe Johnson.

463
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,604
I don't want no problems
with y'all, man.

464
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,566
The rest of the dope
in the gray Monte Carlo.

465
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,720
We got it, man. Come on.

466
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:05,464
We got ten pages on this thing,
all from the same number...

467
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,021
Soleil Tanning Salon.

468
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:09,848
Tanning salon?

469
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,034
You know damn well
you don't need no tan.

470
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,468
Whoa!

471
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,757
Slow down!

472
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,325
I think that's him.

473
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:49,893
Looks Hollywood to me.

474
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,523
Yeah, that's definitely him.

475
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,114
Ricky Martin, move over.
Here comes Hollywood Jack.

476
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,063
Hold on.

477
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,694
Yeah, we got you.

478
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,977
All right, I'm back.

479
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:12,550
Yeah, all right.

480
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,619
Yeah, I can do that for you.

481
00:45:14,607 --> 00:45:16,097
Yeah, okay.

482
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:20,264
Yeah. Good-bye.

483
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:24,905
Hello. How's it going?

484
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:26,242
Good. Hey...

485
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:29,256
...how long has that clown
in the truck been out there?

486
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:30,995
I don't know.

487
00:45:43,183 --> 00:45:45,014
I'm gonna check him out.

488
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,909
- Just go easy, all right?
- I'm just gonna talk to him.

489
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,616
Let's make this quick.

490
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:05,672
- I like this car.
- Hey, nice truck.

491
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:06,742
Thanks.

492
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:09,533
In fact, I was thinking
about trading this one in

493
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:11,422
for, like, seven of those.

494
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,671
Really?

495
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:14,952
I like it better than the S600.

496
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:19,111
Let me get your license
and registration, please.

497
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:21,820
May I ask what I did?

498
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:25,406
Yeah, your mud flaps.
You got no mud flaps on this.

499
00:46:25,328 --> 00:46:27,558
It's a fuckin' Porsche.

500
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,506
You won't have to worry
when you trade it for the truck.

501
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,815
And you're parked
in a handicapped spot.

502
00:46:32,785 --> 00:46:33,877
Did you know that?

503
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:36,066
Oh, really? No!

504
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:37,414
Aw, shit!

505
00:46:37,425 --> 00:46:40,326
- You can get out of your car.
- Thank you.

506
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,963
Beverly Hills dispatch.

507
00:46:44,945 --> 00:46:48,642
2-1-6. Run this plate
for me real quick.

508
00:46:48,562 --> 00:46:50,496
You can go ahead and get out.

509
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:55,215
Number
4-queen-david-apple-4-8-6.

510
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:56,113
Stand by.

511
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,477
I said get out of the car.

512
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,815
This is fucking ridiculous!

513
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:01,418
When in the history of mankind

514
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:04,418
has anyone been harassed
for their fuckin' mud flaps?

515
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:05,893
Watch your language.

516
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,897
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me rephrase.

517
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,448
Fuck you!

518
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:13,254
Aw, shit.

519
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,520
God!

520
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,472
I'm out, I'm out!

521
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,126
Damn! Chill, dog.

522
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:23,528
What does the name
Overdose mean to you?

523
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:25,972
- Over who?
- Overdose!

524
00:47:25,938 --> 00:47:28,065
There's a human being
named Overdose?

525
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,312
Answer the fucking question.

526
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,093
2-19-54.

527
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:34,576
What the hell is a 2-1-9-5-4?

528
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,308
Subject has
a warrant forjaywalking.

529
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:38,103
Jaywalking?

530
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:42,091
Tell me why you paged
some drug trafficker ten times.

531
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:43,663
I didn't page anyone.

532
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:47,363
That's your salon, right?
The calls came from your salon.

533
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:51,075
Ninety percent of
my clients do narcotics,

534
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:53,119
and they all use that phone.

535
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:55,631
I don't know.

536
00:47:55,602 --> 00:47:58,093
Why would Overdose
refer to you as his supplier?

537
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:59,829
You're Hollywood Jack,
aren't you?

538
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:03,421
- Come again?
- Hollywood Jack.

539
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:07,282
My civil rights are being violated
'cause some jig drug dealer

540
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:10,156
named Overkill or Oreo
or whatever the fuck his name is

541
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:12,329
mentioned a guy
named Hollywood Jack?

542
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:17,198
Call my lawyer, you cocksucker!

543
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:19,366
Call your lawyer?

544
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,552
God!

545
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:24,497
Can you guys see this?

546
00:48:24,499 --> 00:48:27,127
You don't know who that is?
I'll call your lawyer.

547
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:30,059
I'll beat the shit out of him
after I beat the fuck out of you!

548
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:31,834
What the fuck
does Overdose mean to you?

549
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,762
What are you doing, man?
You've got to chill.

550
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:35,340
Damn! Chill, boy!

551
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:38,407
Get the fuck back in the car!

552
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:40,256
What's wrong with you, man?
People could be videotaping!

553
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:41,505
Chill out!

554
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:43,218
Get back in the car, man!

555
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:45,949
All we got on this guy
is a warrant for jaywalking.

556
00:48:45,907 --> 00:48:47,499
That's it.

557
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,203
That's all we got...
a fuckin' jaywalking ticket!

558
00:48:50,163 --> 00:48:53,394
Yo, Hollywood, how'd you know
Overdose is black?

559
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:54,696
What?

560
00:48:54,707 --> 00:48:57,471
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you called him a "jig," right?

561
00:48:57,427 --> 00:49:00,191
Don't stupid fucks like you
call black people "jigs"?

562
00:49:01,428 --> 00:49:02,452
You fucked up.

563
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:06,750
My lawyer is gonna have
a field day with you, psycho fuck!

564
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:09,807
Your lawyer?
I'll strike him, too!

565
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:12,866
Is there a problem?

566
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,817
Get back in the fuckin' salon.

567
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:16,896
Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

568
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:18,647
Can I help you with something?

569
00:49:18,644 --> 00:49:21,579
Get in your truck, man!
Everything is fine.

570
00:49:21,524 --> 00:49:23,617
Get the fuck
in the truck, man. Damn!

571
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:43,937
Hey, sleepyhead!

572
00:49:43,924 --> 00:49:45,687
What the fuck, homey?

573
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:47,618
I just want... whoa!

574
00:49:47,604 --> 00:49:49,538
I was crashed out, man.

575
00:49:49,524 --> 00:49:51,958
I'm sorry, man.
I just wanted to ask a question.

576
00:49:51,924 --> 00:49:54,859
Could I get a beer or something?

577
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,772
Yeah, get a beer, man.

578
00:49:57,781 --> 00:49:58,770
Okay.

579
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,670
What were you doing
down at the salon

580
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:04,153
paging some ghetto rat's
crack pad, like, ten times?

581
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,484
I fucked up.

582
00:50:05,493 --> 00:50:08,223
Oh, no, hey, fuck it.
Don't worry about it.

583
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:09,944
It's no big deal.

584
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,874
But...

585
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,455
what is a big deal is,
I spent my afternoon with cops...

586
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:17,781
specifically, the cop
you were supposed to take out.

587
00:50:50,678 --> 00:50:52,077
Stupid ass.

588
00:53:02,872 --> 00:53:04,362
When I was little...

589
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:09,241
...my brothers and sisters and me...

590
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:12,257
...we all slept in the same room.

591
00:53:12,248 --> 00:53:16,947
There was no electricity,
dirt floors.

592
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:19,122
When it would rain...

593
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:24,806
...we couldn't sleep 'cause
the raindrops on the tin roof

594
00:53:24,695 --> 00:53:26,890
were too loud.

595
00:53:26,872 --> 00:53:29,966
What did you
call me down here for?

596
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:32,437
I might be able to help you.

597
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:35,907
You had your chance to talk to me.

598
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:43,901
They killed my wife...

599
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:48,381
...and my son.

600
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,383
When there's a change at the top,

601
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:09,703
they start over,
build their own pipeline.

602
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,719
They'll be looking for new buyers.

603
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:16,749
So if you could come up
with enough money,

604
00:54:16,697 --> 00:54:19,063
you'll flush him out.

605
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:25,131
I can't do anything about him,
but you can.

606
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,700
Romans.

607
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,338
Come on, baby, slide over here!

608
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:24,200
We've been hurting for product

609
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:26,279
ever since these fuckers
took down the sale.

610
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:30,471
And you hear all this
stupid shit about Diablo.

611
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:32,189
I don't want any part of Diablo.

612
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:34,781
I just need to get
back to business.

613
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:37,510
Diablo's been pulling
some bold fuckin' moves.

614
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,991
He's been clipping
the lower-level guys,

615
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,264
cutting 'em clean out.

616
00:55:40,282 --> 00:55:42,716
Bam! Gone!
Streamlinin' the pipeline.

617
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:45,881
Now, with us, they've got to
walk on eggshells.

618
00:55:45,818 --> 00:55:48,150
They fuck with us,
they got problems in the jails.

619
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:51,286
We'll kick their wetback ass
in every jail in the state.

620
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:53,456
It's like
an insurance policy for 'em...

621
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:56,063
we get Central and NorCal,
they get SoCal. Simple.

622
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:58,791
Don't worry about us.
We don't deal with California.

623
00:55:58,747 --> 00:55:59,873
Right.

624
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,708
You're looking at a shipment
like that every month.

625
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:16,486
He can do 18 per.

626
00:56:16,475 --> 00:56:18,443
Eighteen? You gotta be
kidding me, man.

627
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:20,622
- What?
- You're wasting my time.

628
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:24,627
All right, all right. Wait up.

629
00:56:24,572 --> 00:56:27,336
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen?

630
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,283
I can't believe I just said that.

631
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:32,369
- Who pays them prices, cops?
- You got some nuts on you.

632
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:34,579
You want to do business
with me or not?

633
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:38,151
Aw, fuck, man,
you're killing me here.

634
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:41,408
All right, look, we can do fifteen.

635
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,571
You know how fuckin' tight
it's been around here.

636
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:47,636
Anything less than fifteen,
I'm cuttin' my own throat!

637
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:56,062
We could do fifteen.

638
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:57,996
All right. Jesus!

639
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,915
Hey, guys.
Want a dance, honey?

640
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:02,326
No, thanks.

641
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:07,194
Joe, buy him a dance.
We need to loosen him up.

642
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,720
He's so... serious.

643
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,571
Get the fuck off my lap.

644
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,463
Fuck you!

645
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,640
You should have
more respect for yourself.

646
00:57:19,612 --> 00:57:21,546
What's your deal, bro?
You a faggot?

647
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,378
What did you just say to me?

648
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:32,541
You call me a fuckin' faggot?

649
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:38,388
What the fuck you standing up for?
We got a problem here?

650
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:47,075
The fuck you looking at?

651
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:53,288
There's not a problem.

652
00:57:58,269 --> 00:57:59,896
Come on, sit down.

653
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:01,871
You kill me, man.

654
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:06,361
I'm hoping
you're a good businessman,

655
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,735
'cause if you are, there's
a whole lot more business for you.

656
00:58:09,662 --> 00:58:11,527
There's nobody else
out there right now.

657
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:13,712
But don't ever talk to me
like that again.

658
00:58:13,693 --> 00:58:18,460
Don't ever try to disrespect me.
I don't care who is around.

659
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,700
Where I'm from, you talk like that,
you get punched in the face.

660
00:58:21,629 --> 00:58:23,529
It's just business.

661
00:58:26,717 --> 00:58:30,983
Now, look, here's the deal...
you get a car, something clean,

662
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:33,870
meet me 2:00 Friday
at Utro's by the harbor,

663
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:35,345
right there near berth 73.

664
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:37,791
My people will be there.
You switch keys with them...

665
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:08,233
- Who loves you?
- You.

666
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:34,120
The man that runs this organization
calls himself Diablo.

667
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:36,679
This man is Jack Slayton.

668
00:59:36,638 --> 00:59:38,731
Everything we have leads to him.

669
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:42,504
What the fuck are you reading?

670
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,396
Does that have anything to do
with what we were talking about?

671
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:47,607
If you don't want
to be here, get out!

672
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,821
Get on with it.

673
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:57,926
The second move...

674
00:59:58,815 --> 01:00:02,683
The second big move is to flood
the whole entire West Coast

675
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:05,686
with more coke
than we've ever seen before

676
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:07,599
in a straight-up hostile takeover.

677
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:09,609
If that happens, we're
right back where we started.

678
01:00:10,976 --> 01:00:12,705
We shouldn't have
gone to Mexico.

679
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,187
We can do this.

680
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:17,064
We can shut them down
before they become

681
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:18,784
the next dominant cartel.

682
01:00:20,703 --> 01:00:22,728
It's very important to me.

683
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,153
They're ruthless.

684
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:28,770
Come into your fuckin' home.

685
01:00:46,592 --> 01:00:47,854
This is Mobile One.

686
01:00:47,872 --> 01:00:50,340
Approaching
entry point unsecured.

687
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:53,806
How's it going?

688
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:54,814
Good.

689
01:00:54,847 --> 01:00:56,838
Where's your clowns?

690
01:00:56,832 --> 01:00:58,823
They wanted to
meet up with you later, man.

691
01:00:58,816 --> 01:01:00,545
You all set?

692
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,361
Yeah, I like these rims.

693
01:01:04,352 --> 01:01:06,912
Yeah, thanks, man. Pull in.

694
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,508
I got the all right.
Everybody in place?

695
01:01:09,473 --> 01:01:11,873
We got Mobile Two
on the waterfront. That's covered.

696
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:17,472
Exit road is secure.

697
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:22,028
This is C.R. Team,
behind Utro's. Got it covered.

698
01:01:23,425 --> 01:01:25,154
There's your boy.

699
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:39,923
How you doin'?

700
01:01:49,954 --> 01:01:52,445
Just making sure
you're not wired, that's all.

701
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:00,515
What are you doing?
I'm not wired, man!

702
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,111
That's what every cop says.

703
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:03,171
Hey...

704
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:06,581
Where do I know you from?

705
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:08,060
You don't know me.

706
01:02:09,377 --> 01:02:11,242
You want to do business or not?

707
01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:21,609
- Is that all of it?
- All there, to the penny.

708
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,096
You're lucky, you know.

709
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,370
Yeah, I'm lucky
to be back in business.

710
01:02:26,562 --> 01:02:28,723
We're taking over the corridor.
You know that, don't you?

711
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:30,298
Anybody who fucks with Diablo...

712
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,614
Come on. Fuck.

713
01:02:33,602 --> 01:02:35,763
Remember that cop
who took down the big man?

714
01:02:35,745 --> 01:02:38,009
We took care of
his stupid bitch wife.

715
01:02:40,226 --> 01:02:42,626
So you took care of
his stupid bitch wife?

716
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:47,929
Any bitch who marries a cop
has got to be stupid.

717
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:49,806
The keys are in the car.
Take care.

718
01:02:53,346 --> 01:02:55,610
You killed my wife,
you motherfucker?

719
01:02:56,195 --> 01:02:57,628
Damn!

720
01:02:57,634 --> 01:02:58,862
Red is on waterfront.

721
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:01,691
Get in here!

722
01:03:04,387 --> 01:03:05,684
You mother!

723
01:03:07,107 --> 01:03:08,870
Hold on.

724
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,994
We've got
an L.A. Sheriff's unit coming in.

725
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:15,056
Think we ought to move in?

726
01:03:15,043 --> 01:03:18,706
- Stay in place.
- This one ours?

727
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:19,821
That's not our guy.

728
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:22,175
I repeat, that is not our guy.

729
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:26,092
Negative!
It's not one of ours!

730
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:27,413
Move in!

731
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:30,860
Fuck!

732
01:03:46,627 --> 01:03:49,255
Code 13!
We've got an officer down!

733
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:51,744
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

734
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:01,033
Fuck!

735
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,110
Fuckin' monkey cocksucker!

736
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:06,648
Fuck you!

737
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:12,650
Motherfucker!

738
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,379
Oh, shit!

739
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:18,965
Boss, you wanted to see me?

740
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,645
Yeah, Sean, come in.
Sit down.

741
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:30,146
Sean, you're done.

742
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:34,492
- Boss, it was a setup.
- It was a disaster.

743
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:37,359
You lost it
in the middle of an operation,

744
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:39,581
and now
three officers are dead.

745
01:07:43,496 --> 01:07:44,758
Boss, I'm sorry.

746
01:07:44,775 --> 01:07:48,233
I know I fucked up,
but you can't take away my...

747
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:49,999
This is all I have left.

748
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:51,822
I'm sorry, too, Sean.
I'm sorry about...

749
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:54,444
I'm very sorry about Stacy...

750
01:07:56,296 --> 01:07:58,321
She was like a daughter to me.

751
01:07:58,311 --> 01:08:01,747
What you need is
some time to grieve.

752
01:08:01,672 --> 01:08:04,163
You're going to take six months.

753
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:07,002
We'll do a psych evaluation
at the end of that time,

754
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:09,112
and then we'll see
where we're at.

755
01:08:17,992 --> 01:08:20,620
I remember
when you gave me this.

756
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:22,575
How proud it made me.

757
01:08:22,568 --> 01:08:26,368
You said I was part of the family.

758
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:37,087
I grieve every day.

759
01:08:38,313 --> 01:08:41,305
You know what it's like not being
able to go into your own home?

760
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:46,565
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

761
01:08:52,072 --> 01:08:53,869
This takes time.

762
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:56,604
Yo, Sean.

763
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,623
Yo, man,
what the hell was that?

764
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,134
They said it was a setup.

765
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,424
What do you think?

766
01:09:27,849 --> 01:09:30,647
I let my emotions take over.

767
01:09:30,602 --> 01:09:33,093
I lost it out there.

768
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:36,228
I can't help this anymore.
They took my badge.

769
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:39,628
You're beating against
a billion-dollar business.

770
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:44,253
You alone are trying
to bring down a monster.

771
01:09:44,169 --> 01:09:45,864
As a cop, that's impossible.

772
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:49,389
You must become a monster.

773
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,768
She must have been
a good woman.

774
01:09:59,723 --> 01:10:02,123
She was a wonderful woman.

775
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:07,870
And a wonderful wife.

776
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:10,867
Met her when I was 15.

777
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:14,840
I don't know what
would have happened to me

778
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:16,350
if she hadn't come into my life.

779
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:19,985
She was all I ever had.

780
01:10:29,387 --> 01:10:33,448
What's the one thing a man
like me won't touch in this business?

781
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:37,223
The end product, the end result.

782
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:40,466
The money.

783
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:43,483
I know where the money
is being safe-housed.

784
01:10:43,434 --> 01:10:46,631
You'll have to follow it to Mexico.

785
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:50,006
But in Mexico, you'll be alone.

786
01:10:51,851 --> 01:10:54,285
But you must give me your word
you'll get me out of here.

787
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:58,802
I'm not safe here.

788
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:02,366
I need a transfer.

789
01:11:05,964 --> 01:11:08,125
Tell me where it is.

790
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:36,756
- You haven't painted this place yet?
- You sound like Candice.

791
01:11:36,651 --> 01:11:40,348
I'm gonna come by this weekend
with a couple of cans of paint.

792
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:42,133
What's going on, man?

793
01:11:42,124 --> 01:11:46,561
I just staked out the place.
I need four guys.

794
01:11:46,443 --> 01:11:47,876
Staked out what place?

795
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:50,147
I found out where the money is.

796
01:11:50,124 --> 01:11:52,922
Sean, you should let
the department handle this.

797
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,605
I'm gonna be back for you
in a little while.

798
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:57,095
You should really
let Frost handle this.

799
01:11:57,067 --> 01:11:59,001
Have you
seen Rachel anywhere?

800
01:11:58,987 --> 01:12:01,217
I haven't seen her.
She's probably in the house.

801
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:02,595
All right.

802
01:12:07,308 --> 01:12:09,242
She doesn't want me here?

803
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:12,919
Things ain't been
so cool around here.

804
01:12:14,061 --> 01:12:16,359
You know when we came
to visit you in the hospital?

805
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,027
That freaked Rachel out.

806
01:12:18,028 --> 01:12:20,826
She asked me
when was daddy next

807
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,645
to be laid up there in the hospital,

808
01:12:22,636 --> 01:12:25,366
tubes all in my face
and my chest.

809
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:27,918
I'm sorry
about the family thing.

810
01:12:29,004 --> 01:12:31,131
Big Sexy's in.

811
01:12:31,116 --> 01:12:32,276
Sexy?

812
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,435
You went and got Se...

813
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:37,097
No. Let me
tell you something, man.

814
01:12:37,101 --> 01:12:38,966
We ain't no gangbangers no more.

815
01:12:38,957 --> 01:12:40,891
I know we're not gangbangers.

816
01:12:40,877 --> 01:12:42,845
Then what's with Sexy?

817
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:45,229
I'm using
whatever resources I have.

818
01:12:45,197 --> 01:12:47,097
Let me tell you something...

819
01:12:47,085 --> 01:12:48,950
I just came here to get you.

820
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:51,637
I'm gonna be back later.
We'll work this out.

821
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:54,964
Don't bother to come and get me.
I'm not rollin'.

822
01:12:54,893 --> 01:12:57,760
That's right. You fuckin' up.
You out of control, man.

823
01:12:57,709 --> 01:12:58,903
How am I fuckin' up?

824
01:12:58,925 --> 01:13:00,517
Everything you do is messy,

825
01:13:00,524 --> 01:13:02,788
and I got to clean up
after your sloppy ass.

826
01:13:02,765 --> 01:13:05,256
But that's not my fault
if somebody gets out of line.

827
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:07,219
I'm not fuckin' with you.

828
01:13:07,213 --> 01:13:10,671
How could you turn your back on me,
as long as we been rolling together?

829
01:13:10,606 --> 01:13:13,336
You fuckin' up, and I'm
not about to risk my family!

830
01:13:13,294 --> 01:13:16,058
What the fuck would you do?
Ask yourself that.

831
01:13:16,014 --> 01:13:18,608
You talk about the hospital,
the nightmares.

832
01:13:18,573 --> 01:13:20,473
What would you do if she died?

833
01:13:40,557 --> 01:13:42,991
Hi. You've reached
the Vetter residence.

834
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:44,550
We can't get
to the phone right now.

835
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:45,991
Sean, knock it off!

836
01:13:45,998 --> 01:13:48,262
We're a little busy,
but we'll call you back.

837
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:49,227
Thanks.

838
01:13:50,637 --> 01:13:53,401
Yo, Sean, it's "D."Pick up.

839
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:55,411
Yo, Sean.

840
01:13:56,653 --> 01:13:59,247
Yo, man, trust me,

841
01:13:59,214 --> 01:14:02,149
you gotta think this through
before you make a move.

842
01:14:02,094 --> 01:14:05,029
I'm tellin'you,
think it over, man.

843
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:07,163
You hear me?

844
01:14:39,535 --> 01:14:41,025
Yo, Sean, what up?

845
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:48,188
You got all your people here?

846
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:49,199
Man, we ready.

847
01:14:49,231 --> 01:14:52,394
Yo, you don't have to
go through with this.

848
01:14:52,334 --> 01:14:55,326
This is how we roll.
Stacy was like family.

849
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:58,077
Plus I got some new shit
I want to test out.

850
01:15:22,127 --> 01:15:25,358
I can't let you
roll without me, man.

851
01:15:31,632 --> 01:15:33,463
It's on, dog.

852
01:15:33,456 --> 01:15:35,447
I got some extra vests in the car.

853
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:38,991
Let's move!

854
01:16:06,737 --> 01:16:09,331
Get the fuck down!

855
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:12,095
Get the fuck down!
Everybody stay down!

856
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:13,572
The fuck...?

857
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:16,250
Move!

858
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,454
Move! Move!

859
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,568
Stay down! Stay down!

860
01:16:22,513 --> 01:16:23,707
Move!

861
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:25,993
You thought I wasn't
gonna find you?

862
01:16:25,968 --> 01:16:27,936
The fuck, man?

863
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:29,354
Get up, fucker!

864
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,179
Stay down!

865
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:38,685
- Yo, watch these motherfuckers!
- I got these motherfuckers!

866
01:16:43,378 --> 01:16:44,402
When are you
dropping the money?

867
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:45,628
I don't know.

868
01:16:47,313 --> 01:16:49,247
When are you dropping
the fuckin' money?

869
01:16:49,233 --> 01:16:51,667
- Soon as I make the call!
- Get up!

870
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:58,168
Make the fuckin' call.
Use the satellite phone.

871
01:16:59,057 --> 01:17:00,922
God damn!

872
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:02,244
Hurry up, man!

873
01:17:02,257 --> 01:17:04,782
And don't try that smuggler talk.
I speak it fluently.

874
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:12,716
New York Pizza.

875
01:17:12,722 --> 01:17:15,190
Yeah, we're having a party.
I'd like to order some pizza.

876
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:16,985
Cheer the fuck up!

877
01:17:16,977 --> 01:17:18,604
You want it right now?

878
01:17:18,609 --> 01:17:20,236
Party already started.

879
01:17:20,242 --> 01:17:22,369
We've got some really
hungry people here.

880
01:17:22,354 --> 01:17:24,914
That's just excellent.
What would you like on your pie?

881
01:17:25,362 --> 01:17:26,795
Everything.

882
01:17:30,098 --> 01:17:31,895
Is that gonna be cash,
check, or charge?

883
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:34,051
Cash, check, or charge?

884
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:37,625
Cash.

885
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:38,810
What's your location?

886
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,767
Devil's Playground.

887
01:17:40,753 --> 01:17:43,313
That's gonna take a little
longer than 30 minutes.

888
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:45,045
I'll see you there.

889
01:18:06,226 --> 01:18:08,421
Ladies and gentlemen,

890
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:10,063
please put your seatbacks
and tray tables

891
01:18:10,066 --> 01:18:11,556
Into their upright position.

892
01:18:12,786 --> 01:18:14,879
We are about to make
our final descent

893
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:18,667
into the middle
of fuckin' nowhere.

894
01:18:48,242 --> 01:18:49,903
Que pasa, Joe?

895
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:54,525
Is this fuckin' beautiful or what?

896
01:18:54,484 --> 01:18:59,217
I think I'm gonna open a salon
three miles north of here,

897
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:01,025
'cause people
all around the world, Joe,

898
01:19:01,012 --> 01:19:02,639
they just want to look pretty.

899
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:05,793
'Cept for you, of course.

900
01:19:06,803 --> 01:19:09,601
Don't move, Joe. I'll get the door.

901
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:24,220
Man, I don't know
how you stayed alive this long.

902
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:26,044
Get the fuck in the car!
Get in the car!

903
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:27,128
All right! Jesus!

904
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:29,214
Big Sexy, get rid of him
and come back for the truck!

905
01:19:29,204 --> 01:19:30,603
See ya, Joe.

906
01:19:32,276 --> 01:19:34,039
So you're not a hairdresser.

907
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,402
You tellin' me this punk is Diablo?

908
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:39,273
- Whoa. I'm not Diablo, man.
- Shut up.

909
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:42,656
No, he's not Diablo,
but he's gonna take us to Diablo.

910
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:45,344
Yeah, I'm gonna
take you guys to Diablo...

911
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,961
or not.

912
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:52,532
What are you gonna do, man?
You gonna shoot me?

913
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,263
Fuck you!
You're not gonna do shit!

914
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:56,786
Push comes to shove,
you're just a fuckin' cop!

915
01:19:57,717 --> 01:19:58,911
What did you say?

916
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:01,264
Don't bury me! Come on!

917
01:20:01,236 --> 01:20:03,796
Don't want to
tell the truth, do you?

918
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,029
Okay, bad fuck!

919
01:20:06,004 --> 01:20:08,234
So you say
you never seen him before?

920
01:20:08,213 --> 01:20:10,875
I've never seen him.
I don't know his name.

921
01:20:10,837 --> 01:20:13,772
- But you ran drugs for him.
- That's the way it works.

922
01:20:13,716 --> 01:20:15,377
He's fuckin' lying.

923
01:20:15,381 --> 01:20:16,814
...the way it works!

924
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:19,482
Assuming this worked,
what was gonna happen next?

925
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:27,680
Assuming this worked,
what was gonna happen next?

926
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:29,800
The airstrip...

927
01:20:29,781 --> 01:20:31,043
Stop.

928
01:20:32,022 --> 01:20:34,115
They have a house
south of the border.

929
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,558
I drop the cash, I just walk.

930
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:40,086
It would have been a done deal.

931
01:20:40,053 --> 01:20:41,452
It's still gonna be.

932
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,753
Sean, money's ready.

933
01:20:57,301 --> 01:20:59,098
When we get there,

934
01:20:59,094 --> 01:21:01,927
you keep that personality thing
going, all right?

935
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:04,203
You understand me?

936
01:21:31,734 --> 01:21:33,395
Que pasa, fellas?

937
01:21:35,702 --> 01:21:40,662
Oh, just "turbulencia,"
you know.

938
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:51,949
Get that for you.

939
01:21:57,622 --> 01:21:59,647
Oh! I didn't tell you?

940
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:01,732
My girlfriend
lives near the airstrip.

941
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:06,212
Yeah. And we went to the Red
over there in Barstow...

942
01:22:06,103 --> 01:22:10,096
Some drinks...
Cerveza, nachos,

943
01:22:10,006 --> 01:22:11,564
couple of laughs.

944
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:16,729
You guys need to relax.

945
01:22:20,663 --> 01:22:21,789
No, you got to...

946
01:23:02,072 --> 01:23:03,369
Damn!

947
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,960
Let's go! Let's go!

948
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,202
Straight ahead.

949
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,698
They stopped.

950
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:56,602
I thought we
closed this place down, man.

951
01:23:56,568 --> 01:23:58,968
I know a way in.

952
01:24:32,218 --> 01:24:34,516
We separate,
we meet back here.

953
01:25:58,747 --> 01:26:00,180
Shut up!

954
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,453
I'm going left.

955
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:19,378
Yo, man,
if anything happens to you...

956
01:26:19,323 --> 01:26:20,915
I'm going left.

957
01:26:23,739 --> 01:26:26,173
Nothing's gonna happen.
You're going home.

958
01:27:14,204 --> 01:27:15,637
Diablo.

959
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,058
So this is what
the devil looks like.

960
01:27:27,772 --> 01:27:28,864
Why?

961
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,871
Why'd you take my wife?

962
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,795
You think I am the one.

963
01:28:34,781 --> 01:28:36,942
You should have stayed
out of Mexico,

964
01:28:36,926 --> 01:28:40,589
and perhaps your wife
would still be alive.

965
01:30:07,647 --> 01:30:09,239
Die!

966
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,557
Come on.

967
01:31:26,593 --> 01:31:28,458
Let's go.

968
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:30,280
It's not over.

969
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:36,301
Sean, come on! Keep moving!

970
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:37,881
Stay with me. Come on.

971
01:31:37,889 --> 01:31:39,151
Stay with me.

972
01:31:39,169 --> 01:31:40,830
Shit! Come on.

973
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:46,821
Keep moving!
Come on. Let's go.

974
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,068
From the wreckage,
officials believe

975
01:31:52,033 --> 01:31:54,228
the gunmen attacked
with semiautomatic weapons,

976
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:56,143
killing two
Bureau of Prisons officers

977
01:31:56,129 --> 01:31:57,721
and injuring several others.

978
01:31:57,729 --> 01:31:59,663
The specifics are being withheld

979
01:31:59,649 --> 01:32:01,742
until the investigation
is complete,

980
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:03,663
but we believe that
the gunmen were able

981
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:06,015
to spring cartel leader
Memo Lucero,

982
01:32:05,985 --> 01:32:08,249
who was serving
two life sentences

983
01:32:08,225 --> 01:32:11,217
for a string of murders
and trafficking of narcotics.

984
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:12,865
The prisoner
was being transferred

985
01:32:12,866 --> 01:32:15,198
to a maximum
security prison outside L.A.

986
01:32:15,169 --> 01:32:16,864
I signed the transfer.

987
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:19,959
It is not your fault
that Lucero busted out, okay?

988
01:32:19,906 --> 01:32:21,999
Yeah,
but I recommended it.

989
01:32:21,985 --> 01:32:25,079
They say he's
somewhere in Mexico, man.

990
01:32:25,026 --> 01:32:27,460
He's not in Mexico,
Demetrius.

991
01:32:27,426 --> 01:32:28,859
How do you know that?

992
01:32:28,866 --> 01:32:31,801
I'm taking Frost's advice.
I'm taking a little time.

993
01:32:31,745 --> 01:32:33,542
Sean, where you at?

994
01:32:33,538 --> 01:32:36,769
Don't worry. I'm in a good place.
I'm recovering.

995
01:32:36,706 --> 01:32:38,640
Just give me
a call soon, all right?

996
01:32:38,626 --> 01:32:39,650
Okay.

997
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:49,880
This will only take a second.

998
01:35:52,517 --> 01:35:54,508
I got all the time in the world.

999
01:35:56,069 --> 01:35:58,697
I tracked you for seven years.

1000
01:36:00,198 --> 01:36:02,689
You never went
to the same place twice.

1001
01:36:04,294 --> 01:36:05,852
Until you came home.

1002
01:36:06,822 --> 01:36:08,756
I told you you had no idea

1003
01:36:08,742 --> 01:36:10,676
what you were
getting yourself into.

1004
01:36:12,582 --> 01:36:14,675
If you'd stayed
out of my business,

1005
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:16,561
your wife would still be alive.

1006
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:24,505
Your arrogance killed her,
not me.

1007
01:36:25,318 --> 01:36:27,684
Like your arrogance coming here!

1008
01:36:27,653 --> 01:36:33,057
Do you think you can come
into my domain and kill me?

1009
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:53,652
If I wanted you dead,
you would be.

1010
01:37:09,062 --> 01:37:11,087
Finish the job.

1011
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:48,112
I know that you're
with me in spirit.

1012
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:57,520
But I still miss you.

1013
01:39:17,353 --> 01:39:18,547
You okay?

1014
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:27,204
Who picked the stone?

1015
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,762
We all did.

1016
01:39:29,769 --> 01:39:31,862
Yeah, she would have
liked that.
