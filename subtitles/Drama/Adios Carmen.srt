1
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,694
He's wrong, Juanito.
He mustn't do it. Listen to me.

2
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,135
What did he say?

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,939
Juanito, as I told you before,

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,614
there is too much violence in the world.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,010
And beside that, there's another reason.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,411
I don't want our friend Sabata to get hurt now.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,458
But the Murdocks deserve to die, Padre

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,532
You know the Murdocks
stole everything from us here.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,214
- They should be punished.
- Juanito.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,531
Have you forgotten what I taught to you?

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,930
You must try to forgive,

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,295
not s nk nto revengo

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,248
- I know, Father.
- Go tell Sabata this.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,890
He shouldn't risk his neck
for those Murdock brothers.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,699
Tell him our prayers are his.

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,055
He doesn't need to fight.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,098
But as our Good Book often says,

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,535
"The Lord will provide."

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,691
Yes, Father.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,257
I beg you to be careful, my son.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,050
- The Lord be with you.
- The Lord is Sabata.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,292
Too much violence.

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,175
Order arms!

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,456
Left face!

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,451
Forward march!

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,295
- 20 dollars.
- 10 dollars on the Murdocks.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,178
Right.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,174
100 dollars on the Murdock brothers.
Ain't nobody betting on the challenger?

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,050
- How about you, Ballantine?
- 100 dollars. On the black.

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,020
You can spare a dollar, can't you?

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,853
Just to keep this shut up, hm?

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,933
Black's my favourite colour, friends.
I always win on black.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,612
It's best if we all get the hell out.
Might get a little hot.

34
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,695
I'm looking for a certain man
for a special job. Sabata.

35
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,816
Not now Co m o o n

36
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,939
We're all set for you to go out in style.
Haven't you noticed?

37
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,810
Sabata! You better make him turn!

38
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,534
Hey! Begin the shooting when it stops.

39
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,210
Sabata likes them lying down.

40
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,335
Guess Murdock's nailed for good.

41
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,491
Know w h at m oa n?

42
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,812
- Huh?
- Ah.

43
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,458
Sorry.

44
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,331
That blasted bird needs oil. Here, you go do it.

45
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,699
- No oil, no money.
- Give me that, you little runt!

46
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,172
- Hey, the man you wanted...
- I think I can find him.

47
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,137
Let's go.

48
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,134
You know what Colonel Skimmel looks like.

49
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,098
How about it? Will you accept?

50
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,175
I hoped you'd be able to do this job for me.

51
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,171
Thank you.

52
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,295
Adiós

53
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,849
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need my help.

54
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,580
M ay go w t h yo u??

55
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,619
Ma ko very good tort as
have a not h oryob for yo u

56
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,131
Deliver this to Father Mike.

57
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,491
Tell him that the Murdocks
have found their... great reward...

58
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,898
...and wish to make a contribution.

59
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,532
Hello.

60
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,731
Well... how much did you make, Ballantine?

61
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,056
A mere bagatelle.

62
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,973
I'm here for something more important.

63
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,210
Colonel Skimmel.

64
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,134
We could... work together.

65
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,058
Hey, you!

66
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,849
We Austrians have eyes everywhere.

67
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,253
If you want some advice,
forget about those Mexicans.

68
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,969
Oh!

69
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,779
Hey! Hey, what is this? Get me down!

70
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,171
You pig, you! Do you hear? Cut me loose!

71
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,776
I'll kill you for this, you dirty American dog!

72
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,410
I swear I'll make you pay, filthy Yankee!

73
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,536
Hang around. I'll be back.

74
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,294
You bastard, I'll get you when I'm down!

75
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,530
You play that rotten!

76
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,258
Reach that gate and you're a free man,
subject to the colonel's marksmanship.

77
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,010
Give them a chance. Release
two, three, four of them, altogether.

78
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,255
Long live the revolution!

79
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,134
We appreciate your aid, Garcia.

80
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,178
Colonel Skimmel will be
most generous with you.

81
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,331
Garcia Moreno?

82
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,732
Ah, you did very well, dear Garcia.

83
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,017
You helped us expose
this filthy revolutionary plot.

84
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,617
You also saved my life.
It has not been forgotten.

85
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:28,255
Our beloved emperor, Maximilian,
and this humble soldier, are very grateful.

86
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,096
In the drawer under the model ship,
you will find your 20 pieces of gold.

87
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,418
Thank you.

88
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,056
The key is there.

89
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,017
Open it.

90
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,574
- Perfect.
- Mm-hm.

91
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,537
As usual.

92
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,615
Ho wo rsst k nd o f nfo rm or. For go d

94
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,811
Everyone here?

95
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,650
M anuo Ga rc a Oto o!

96
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,856
Juan De Los Angeles.

97
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,211
Jesus Rivalta!

98
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,130
Luis Miguel Cortejo.

99
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,778
They're all good men. Yours for the mission.

100
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,014
- I hope you approve.
- Aha.

101
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,011
European money.

102
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,136
Who bought you?

103
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,938
Did you sell out to that pig Skimmel?

104
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,496
He's a spy, Ocano.

105
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,696
Septiembre!

106
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,420
Stand back from the traitor.

107
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,338
Gitano!

108
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,612
Gitano!

109
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,370
The flamenco of death.

110
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,213
No!

111
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,778
Gitano and Septiembre
are all the men I'll need.

112
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,176
That gold will buy us guns.

113
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,413
We'll get stronger than their soldiers
and nobody can stop us then.

114
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,219
The man who'll be helping you is a soldier.

115
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,814
A soldier of fortune.

116
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,448
He'll find out
when the gold leaves Guadalupe

117
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,736
and what road you must follow.

118
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,097
He's made the arrangements
with the men that sell guns.

119
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,979
He's waiting for you in Kingsville, Texas.

120
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,735
- And don't forget the password. Hear?
- I know.

121
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,859
There's still another thing
that I keep worrying about.

122
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,296
Mu st wo oave t h o revo u t o n
up to a so d or o f fort u no??

123
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,011
This one, yes.
He's all right, Escudo. It's Sabata.

124
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,775
Ah. It's very good.

125
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,530
Tequila, a bottle.

126
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,770
It stinks in here.

127
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,534
Smells like pigs are around.

128
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,094
Here, you smell anything, Septiembre?

129
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,373
Your friend has no nose, or he's a liar.

130
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,457
All you mangy pigherders smell disgusting.

131
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,772
You're too full of it to be a judge, my friend.

132
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,371
Well?

133
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,176
Well?

134
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,371
Any time.

135
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,938
Uh-uh.

136
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,534
Isn't it enough you lost a friend?

137
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,852
Aw.

138
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,328
Have a beer!

139
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,020
The smell doesn't bother him any more.

140
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,411
From now on, he's going to learn to smoke.

141
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,649
Thank you, hombre. Many thanks.
If friends are what you need?

142
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,454
Anything for Benito Juarez.

143
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,373
This is our man. This one's Sabata.

144
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,895
Amigo, Ocano sent us to meet you.

145
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,812
N co toc h nkqu o, h u h??
Tco m os w t h b ract co

146
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,096
The last time I played this...

147
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,011
Ah, here it is.

148
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,375
Los Palos, St Christopher's Day.

149
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,899
I've got a bad memory.
Write everything down in the book.

150
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,132
Nover w t h o u t t
Wa t fo r m o o u ts do

151
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,176
Colonel Skimmel appreciates
an artistic type like myself.

152
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,175
Relaxes with me.
In Guadalupe, I'm like one of the family.

153
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,572
Out at the fort every day.
Seeing things, hearing things.

154
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,655
Do you know Colonel Skimmel?

155
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,017
He challenged me to a shooting match once.

156
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,777
- Hard man to beat.
- It remains to be seen.

157
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,858
With four hands, it would be perfect, huh?

158
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,376
I play solo.

159
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,374
Such a pity.
Colonel Skimmel has two pianos.

160
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,135
Why not join me?

161
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,856
I'll play the melody.

162
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,012
Hey, amigo. Is your pal
in there at the piano with us?

163
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,093
He'll keep out of this thing if I can help it.

164
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,449
- What about them? Are you sure they're OK?
- Sure. Who do you think they are?

165
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,771
Hoso two?? Ro octs fro m t h o oca m u so u m
j

166
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,139
Huh, them? They're very good men.
They're my two falcons, two hawks, two eagles.

167
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,212
Two fighting buzzards.

168
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,495
Don't you believe me?

169
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,619
Hey!

170
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,938
See that?
What did I tell you?

171
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,172
And this one is Septiembre.

172
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,814
You want to see something great? Look.
Go ahead.

173
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,972
- Hey, you loco?
- You have nothing to worry about.

174
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,971
If we get the gold.

175
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,096
Lieutenant Stejer!

176
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,653
Easy now. There we are.
Here we go. There she is.

177
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,218
Detail... forward!

178
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,291
Go!

179
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,050
Colonel Skimmel, I'll never finish your portrait.
This is your twentieth sitting.

180
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,770
Ah, I see you write everything down.
That's a good idea.

181
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,135
M a ny g reat art sts h ave bad m o m ories

182
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,088
- Time is money.
- That's what you Americans think.

183
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,892
But I'm an Austrian.
And for an Austrian, time does not exist.

184
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,255
Oh, no. I don't frown like this.
My face is more joyful.

185
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,493
- Loosen the mouth a trifle.
- You smile so pretty, Colonel.

186
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:02,292
Packing off a wagonload of grain made you
as happy as sending a shipment of silver dust.

187
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,293
You don't miss very much, friend Ballantine.

188
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,214
As I've told you, Colonel, my mind never rests.

189
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,053
The peons are shouting for vengeance.

190
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,780
M ox co 's a h otbod o f revo u t on.

191
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,295
We shall crush them.

192
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,974
I've already taken the necessary precautions.

193
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,770
We Austrians know exactly what we are doing.
It's all been worked out.

194
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,570
It has been planned, pre-arranged and studied
down to its last detail.

195
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,575
It is inevitable and mathematically perfect.
We Austrians are men of steel.

196
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,050
- Colonel, please.
- We never go back on our word.

197
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,340
Our beloved Emperor Maximilian
is our model and our strength.

198
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,252
There. Much better.

199
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,055
Now

200
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,532
Whoa!

201
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,089
Somebody's moved in on our game.

202
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,375
Take cover! Quickly! We're surrounded!

203
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,894
- Long live liberty!
- Long live free Mexico!

204
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,617
What's going on?

205
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,979
Let's get out of here. Come on!

206
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,410
Adiós amigos

207
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,172
José!

208
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,571
Jesus! Juan! My brothers, my friends!

209
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,777
Amigos, may you be received
by the Lord above!

210
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,053
M ay yo u r m ot h or wve o n h o rsso d u ng!

211
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,778
Two falcons without wings.
I was the greatest high-jumper long ago.

212
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,774
- Shame on you for such lies.
- Let's go get the gold.

213
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,371
Austrian.

214
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,337
Let's go.

215
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,818
Hy-hoo!

216
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,532
Hah!

217
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,332
Hey!

218
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,936
Hey! Hey!

219
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,976
Wait for me! Give me a hand, Gitano!

220
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,773
Good. We made it, Sabata, eh?

221
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,137
A chest full of gold... to buy arms with.

222
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,259
Buy arms! Buy them to kill Maximilian
and drive the Austrians home.

223
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,174
- Long live Mexico!
- Long live the revolution!

224
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,373
Hey, Escudo.

225
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,579
Doos h o ook ko t h at boca u so
ho 'd ko a t h o go d to h m so f?

226
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,609
No, not h m Natu ra y g oo m y
o was bo rn w t h a faco t h at ong t's t h o t rut h

227
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,138
When he was born, there was a great
rainstorm. Your birthday's the 2 September?

228
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,096
You're wrong, amigo. It must be
the 2 of November, All Souls' Day.

229
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,053
Well done, Lieutenant.
Traitors should be shot in the back.

230
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,135
Escudo was in command of the Mexican rebels.
I also saw Sabata with him.

231
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,495
I know him. He's a great shot.

232
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,299
They were headed for Texas.

233
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,054
- Thank you, Lieutenant. You can go.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,576
Writing table.

235
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,294
- We're in very serious trouble.
- They won't get very far.

236
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,418
We have an efficient intelligence service
in Texas.

237
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,218
Hm.

238
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,369
It'll be easier to hide individual sacks of gold
than a clumsy chest like that.

239
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,418
Mu c h oas o r
hs c h ost m u st n' t bo u nloadod

240
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,209
Not at t h s t m o h at's o u r ordorss
Rg h t W o ca n' t obon it

241
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,779
Whoa.

242
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,578
Whoa.

243
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,733
Wait for me at the San Juan Monastery.

244
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,457
I'm heading in to Kingsville.

245
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,578
The gunrunners will be waiting for me there.

246
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,096
- And so will Ballantine.
- Ballantine? I...

247
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,537
The piano player.

248
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,652
So long.

249
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,456
It's Sabata.

250
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,658
Gentlemen.

251
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,616
Your gun, please.

252
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,779
Gunrunning is a dangerous profession,
isn't that right?

253
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,216
I faint at disagreeable sights.
That's why they wear hoods.

254
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,929
You're an intelligent man, Sabata.
I respect you.

255
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:55,255
- Why do you join up with scum?
- They are more my kind. You're not.

256
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,300
- Mind if I smoke?
- Mm.

257
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,497
Oh, I forgot. I took the last one myself.

258
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,779
- I can buy some more with your gold.
- I shan't even ask you where it is.

259
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,693
I shall use a little Austrian logic.

260
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,855
In fact, it's discovered already.

261
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,057
When you have gold,
there aren't many places to hide it.

262
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,973
Like the San Juan monastery.

263
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,052
Sorry, I don't belong to that parish.

264
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:34,568
Even so, we will see you have
a respectable funeral here, in Kingsville,

265
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,095
as will all your Mexican friends.

266
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,329
I'll be back, I assure you.

267
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:50,689
You'd be smart to relax a little bit,
while we wait for Mr Folgen to return.

268
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,697
No, t h a nks W o do n' t d rin k w t h t h o doad

269
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,455
I drink only with friends...
except for you.

270
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,775
Don't mind my back, gentlemen.

271
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,649
Forget it, Sabata.
It's your home, after all.

272
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,579
Septiembre,
come on in and have a shot.

273
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,538
That won't work with us. Try again.

274
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,170
- Your brother?
- Mm-mm.

275
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,816
The sun is high.

276
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,091
And where is he?

277
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,814
I don't like this place. It's too quiet.

278
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,413
Silent as death.

279
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,738
Only Escudo's footsteps
can be heard on the dry earth.

280
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,176
Everybody else is dead.
Even you seem to be dead.

281
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,570
Ah, go to hell.

282
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,736
And the gold, right out there.

283
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,849
The way things are now,
this is the perfect chance to take it.

284
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,218
- Whose chance?
- How would I know that?

285
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,569
It could even be my chance.

286
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,700
You believed it, didn't you?

287
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,814
Why not mine?

288
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,651
Manuel...

289
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,371
We're surrounded. I'll try to draw them off.
You take care of the cart.

290
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,049
These American guns aren't very good,
are they?

291
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,618
Escudo!

292
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,659
- First we must think of the gold.
- To hell with the gold. Gitano!

293
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,380
Gitano!

294
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,098
Stop! Don't shoot!

295
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,970
G ta no, aam go, m ay yo u r so u bo reco ved
by t h o ord above

296
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,132
Idiot!
You want me to have a heart attack?

297
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,897
- Come on, amigo. Hurry!
- Don't try anything. You're covered.

298
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,618
He tricked us. The Austrian bastards will kill us.

299
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,169
- Get your hands up.
- No, you first.

300
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,019
Amigo

301
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,856
Oh.

302
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,530
They have the gold, huh?

303
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,573
Hey, Blondito, where do you think you're going?

304
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,336
Sabata, I'm glad you showed up.
Tell him I wasn't stealing it.

305
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,732
I just thought one of us
oughta take care of the gold.

306
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,933
Huh?

307
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,617
Gitano, the flamenco of death.

308
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,896
Why did you stop me?

309
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:09,295
It's only fair. After all, he's the one who gave us
the information about the gold shipment.

310
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,893
Him?

311
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,132
He said he was trying to protect the gold.

312
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,019
No reason w h y s h o u d n' t bo ove h m

313
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,732
No??
No

314
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,368
The gunrunners have been wiped out.

315
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,330
- All we can do is turn the gold over to Ocano.
- We'll take care of that.

316
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,254
I think I'll come along.
I got the rest of my pay coming.

317
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,059
Me too. From him.

318
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,257
Don't worry. Now let's get moving.

319
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,856
Every Austrian in the territory
will be looking for us now.

320
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,252
We'll make our first stop at Eagle Pass
on the Mexican border.

321
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,573
You can thank Sabata
we didn't kill you this time, Blondito.

322
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:56,133
If your crazy stunt had worked,
they would have taken their revenge on me.

323
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,256
You saved my life.

324
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,050
Fyo u save a m a n' s fo, yo u 're
resbo nss b o fo r h m for t h o rest o f h s days

325
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,688
It makes me feel quite secure.

326
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,418
About the gold.

327
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,219
You and me. Fifty-fifty?

328
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,575
Hey, what's he say?

329
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,489
- He wants us to try a new idea.
- His ideas are nothing.

330
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,811
Mot h m a nd k now ng h t away
ho was no good

331
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,815
You know why?
Because he's got a big mouth.

332
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,172
All OK.

333
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,855
Admit it's a good idea
to hide the gold here.

334
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:59,732
- Think he's trying to trick us?
- Just don't let him get out of your... rifle range.

335
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,209
Come on!

336
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,139
Ballantine, hi.

337
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,976
It's been so long.
I'm still your favourite model, aren't I?

338
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,053
We... never quite finished that picture, did we?

339
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,898
Sabata! Come on out
with your filthy friends

340
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,779
or we'll kill everyone in the place!

341
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,178
Hey, hold it!

342
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,011
All right, we're leaving.

343
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,258
Sabata.

344
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,578
- What are you doing here?
- I got information for you.

345
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,689
The Austrians are falling back. Our people
just took Las Palomas and Trincheras.

346
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,294
- How do you know?
- I'm Mexican. I know.

347
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,020
How long have you been following me?

348
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,136
Go home.

349
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,655
Go back to Father Mike.

350
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,851
- If you say so, Sabata.
- All right, watch your step.

351
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,774
Be with you in two shakes, huh?

352
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,778
Escudo! Where is the cart?

353
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,330
For the last time, where is the cart?

354
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:57,779
Manuel, it has been in a good cause and
also may your soul be received by the Lord.

355
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,455
You stand honoured by your deeds,
up to the end.

356
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:07,138
Yes. And you shall be a model
held in honour among our men.

357
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,929
José, Juan, Jesús.

358
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:16,417
They shall sing your praises in Mexico
in all the days to come.

359
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:21,290
If I should forget, let me be thrown
into the deepest pit of hell.

360
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,258
Hey, I almost forgot! Where's Ballantine?

361
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,858
Hyah!

362
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,499
We were just gonna
go look for you fellas. Right?

363
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,334
Take it. Here.

364
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,456
It's yours.

365
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,978
With a load of gold like this,
split three ways,

366
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,177
three happy hombres
living in peace and plenty.

367
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,657
Shall we go?

368
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,979
Hm.

369
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,294
- We stay.
- Ballantine!

370
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,258
Now wo m ay a oave

371
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,138
Whoa!

372
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,133
Hyah!

373
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:02,451
- But it's for the revolution.
- Oh, sure! The revolution.

374
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,738
All this beautiful gold turned into rifles,
cannons and death.

375
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,371
- I'm not touching it.
- How about trying to buy peace with it?

376
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,338
A load of gold could be divided five ways.

377
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,776
What a contribution to my favourite charity: Me.

378
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:23,412
No! T's only go ng to t h o revo u t o n
ho A u st ria nss a re ret reat ng h oy 've d u t

379
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,172
- How do you know that?
- There are ways.

380
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:31,413
- You're just talking. I don't believe you.
- OK, don't.

381
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,778
Yo u b a nn od t h s n Texas
bu t wo n' t ot yo u rob u s o f a revo u t o n

382
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,853
Mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts,
all weeping and all blaming you.

383
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,090
M o?? W h y b a m o m o??

384
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,570
You want to change
this harmless gold to death and destruction.

385
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:52,179
Remember your dead friends,
Juan, José, Jesús... Manuel?

386
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,537
No! H oso m o n a re doad

M ox co m u st bo bo ratod!

388
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,577
Long live Mexican liberty!
Long live the revolution!

389
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,256
All right, you win.

390
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,771
- I think it does belong to the people.
- Comes the revolution!

391
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,056
- Ah!
- Yeah!

392
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,972
Ah... Hey, Senor Gold!

393
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,055
"Today, April 26th, I am finally rich!"

394
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,735
Gold! Gold!

395
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,693
Sand.

396
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,216
We risk our lives, let them kill our men.

397
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:56,295
For what? A box of sand?
God, we must be crazy.

398
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,371
Well...

399
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,417
Easy come... easy go.

400
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,773
Let's look at the Austrians' logic.

401
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,977
A load of gold is shipped from Guadalupe.

402
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:18,010
A band, not of Mexicans but Austrians dressed
as Mexicans, attacks and steals the gold.

403
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,694
The blame falls on the revolution.

404
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:26,571
Bu t Co ono SSk m m o d d n' t f g u re on o u r r a d
Now h o knows t h at wo know

405
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,735
He may be an officer,

406
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,539
bu t do n' t oxboct h m to bo a gont o m a n

407
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,817
One measly sack of the real stuff...

408
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,255
...on top.

409
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,618
Skimmel. That lousy thief. Pah!

410
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,616
Wo, gont o m on, t's boon f u n,
bu t ca n' t wasto a ny m ore t m o

411
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,296
I want to wish you all the... very best of luck.

412
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:59,739
Especially you, Escudo. You're gonna have
a hard time convincing the revolutionaries

413
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,131
that you didn't steal the gold.

414
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,530
And you know what'll happen?

415
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,817
You might end up dripping fat into the fire

416
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:14,179
with an apple up your big mouth
and a spit up your caboose.

417
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,694
Save your bullets for the revolution.

418
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,533
Adiós

419
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,338
!A diós!

420
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:48,609
I know what's on your mind. I just tell Ocano
the men who stole the gold were those two.

421
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,773
Both of you are cowards.
They trust me. I don't have to lie.

422
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,534
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.

423
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,295
Senor Ocano,
the French at Candelas and Atienza

424
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,099
are getting reinforcements
from Colonel Skimmel's army.

425
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:12,732
We could attack the fort from the rear,
from Texas, across the bridge at Guadalupe.

426
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,212
The revolution is not going to
cause an international incident.

427
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:26,250
Gaviota will fall, then we're set.

428
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:31,858
As soon as those precious new weapons arrive,
we'll strike at Candelas and at Atienza too.

429
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,736
As for Skimmel's Austrians,
to cross the Sierras is impossible.

430
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,972
But they could slip out, north, into Texas

431
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,700
across the only bridge the Austrians control,

432
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,420
this one, at Guadalupe.

433
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,815
Perdito, it's a job for you.

434
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,335
Blow up the Guadalupe bridge.

435
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:11,015
Kngsville s t h at way
Bu t SSk m m o

436
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,933
I'd like to collect
the money on his portrait.

437
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:18,651
How much are you asking for it?
A chest full of gold?

438
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,859
You kidding? I'd end up before a firing squad.

439
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,090
- I got a plan.
- Forget it.

440
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:29,219
No, m oa n it. W o go f fty f ryy

441
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,019
We'll split it in five equal shares.

442
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,369
But how?

443
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,656
Those three?

444
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,732
God knows where they are. Hey!

445
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,051
- Where are you going?
- Guadalupe Bridge.

446
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,410
Forward march!

447
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,016
Skimmel!

448
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,817
Skimmel, we must be quick.
Gaviota's about to fall to the revolutionaries.

449
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,208
Major Metternich! Open up!

450
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:55,772
Bofore nig h tfa, t h o ont re ga rr son w bo
ma rc h ng towa rd Ca ndo as to a d t h o renc h

451
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,889
We shall go to Texas at daybreak in civilian
dress, posing as honest beer merchants.

452
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:07,329
- The rebels are blocking the way.
- As soon as we cross the bridge, we blow it up.

453
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,337
Hello.

454
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,778
I've brought a present for Colonel Skimmel.
It's Sabata.

455
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,616
Just in case.

456
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,858
Hey!

457
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:22,493
We just put those in there to bed.
Don't go. We have plans for you too.

458
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:29,891
Perdito! Leave Sabata alone.
He works for us.

459
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,212
The bridge must be blown up.
It's Ocano's orders.

460
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:37,133
Well, I admire your loyalty, friend.

461
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:42,249

462
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:46,049
We've just arrived now.
We've new orders from Ocano.

463
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,369
Adiós. And good luck.

464
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,375
Now, m y B ond to

465
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:05,135
An apple in my mouth?
I'll show you who's on a spit!

466
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,939
Escudo!

467
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,537
You're always butting in.
This time I'm going to punch him in the jaw.

468
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,453
We need him. He knows where the gold is.

469
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,649
Blondito, huh?

470
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,731
Ha!

471
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:19,252
Four hours till daylight.
No time to waste.

472
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:28,171
Ca rr y a m oda fonk uck f yo u want,
bu t not m y watc h

473
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,971
It's not because it's yours.
Septiembre likes music.

474
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,729
Soldier, Lieutenant Stejer wishes to see you.

475
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,290
He's expecting you in the orderly room.
Homeward bound at last.

476
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,614
- It's about time, sir.
- Of course it is. In fact, it's way past time.

477
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,050
M g u o! Do n' t wo over oat a ro u nd h ore??

478
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:14,498
This is a forgotten town.
The commandant doesn't care if we live or die.

479
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:19,415
You're right. They blame us for all their defeats.
You men, follow me!

480
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,650
There's no other way.

481
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,212
Septiembre.

482
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,816
Who's there?

483
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,976
All gone, eh?

484
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,329
Well, you picked some time
to be without ammunition.

485
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:23,420
Hey! You clown.

486
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,333
Take the sentry's place. You too, Gitano.

487
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,451
Listen.

488
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,578
It's impossible to cross the camp square.

489
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,538
I'm gonna open the back door to the depot.

490
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,090
From there, there's a short cut to the gold vault.

491
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,058
Phew!

492
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,649
- Hi.
- Good evening, Mr Ballantine.

493
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,934
Let's move. The gold's right next to us.

494
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,489
Ah, you're crazy.

495
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,652
It's not where I would have left it if I'd stolen it.

496
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,492
That's safest.

497
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:58,051
I'd make a hiding place no one would find.
In the ground, a cemetery.

498
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,814
M aybo ove n in s do t h ore

499
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,448
- Can you read that?
- Beer.

500
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,857
Let's go.

501
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,294
Forgot your book.

502
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:47,020
Thanks for picking it up for me.

503
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,376
- We made it.
- Halt! Don't move!

504
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,690
Hm.

505
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:18,370
You're the last person I would have suspected,
my... cultured friend.

506
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:22,171
Search them.

507
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,060
No, SSorgoant ot h m koob t

508
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:50,088
You may write your last wishes.
I'll see that they're respected.

509
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:06,737
I would not have given you the honour
of being executed by a firing squad.

510
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:11,496
Squad halt. Left face.

511
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,569
Order arms!

512
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,135
Soldier, come here.

513
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,096
Write it down in your book, Blondito.

514
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,252
- I'll make a date with you in hell.
- It's too late.

515
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,536
Squad! Load arms!

516
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,416
Open it.

517
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:20,050
That's right. I left them.
Come on, idiot.

518
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:22,415
Ready... aim.

519
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,897
Major Metternich!

520
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,736
'D ko t h s d a ry to bo fo rwa rdod to
my m ot h o r

521
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,816
No Do n' t bot h or, M a jo r
' toss t to yo u

522
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,938
Run for it!

523
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,011
Cover me, Septiembre!

524
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:18,734
One more blast
from that cannon and we're all dead.

525
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,053
I thought so.

526
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:01,978
Crook.

527
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:07,056
It's not mine now. I won't need it any more.

528
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,290
The gold...

529
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,691
The gold... Tell the others.

530
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,612
The gold...

531
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,972
The gun.

532
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:34,377
All right.
What's the proposition?

533
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,693
What makes you think there is one?

534
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:43,619
If there was no proposition,
you would have killed me by now.

535
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:45,657
Indeed.

536
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:49,130
- Order your men to leave.
- They've come too far, Colonel.

537
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,495
They want their gold.

538
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:58,054
Hmph! Only I know where the gold is.
And you won't get it.

539
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,133
Unless... you make a deal with me.

540
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,730
Sorry. No deal.

541
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,736
I remember our marksmanship contest
in Louisville.

542
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:15,859
You're the only man
who ever defeated me, Sabata.

543
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:21,609
Pity you won't have
another chance to beat me.

544
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:25,819
- Nothing can beat a superior people.
- Who knows?

545
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:28,369
Sometimes an idea's enough.

546
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:56,654
Folgen confessed.
The gold is under the ship model.

547
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,054
- Huh?
- Just as you are, reach and pull.

548
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,533
Say, you got a great little brain.

549
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,060
Oh, Septiembre can use this!

550
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:31,051
Folgen. He wanted me
to open this and get killed.

551
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:48,136
- Have you any other tricks for me?
- You're wrong.

552
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,691
This is a big mistake.
I did my job. My job.

553
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:56,091
- It's not my fault.
- Cowardly pig!

554
01:33:56,260 --> 01:34:00,492
Don't kill me.
You can't do it.

555
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:02,776
You... You can't do it.

556
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:39,056
Now s u bboso yo u to m o w h ore t h o go d s

557
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,256
Well...

558
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,811
Hey, where's Ballantine?

559
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,499
How could you do it?

560
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:45,176
He robbed Blondito.

561
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,615
Ah, poor Ballantine.

562
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:50,578
To die in the moment of our triumph.

563
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:54,016
So artistic, so generous.

564
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:59,492
And the most honest of us all.
I weep for him.

565
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:06,251
May his good soul go to heaven
and be greeted by our Lord above.

566
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,289
Wait. This means there's only four of us.

567
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:15,009
So we divide his share between us. Eh?

568
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,456
What's this?

569
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,019
M y God

570
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,891
Gold! It's gold!

571
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:41,860
Septiembre, where were you?

572
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:04,852
What are you looking for?

573
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,057
Saw the best of us, didn't he?

574
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,576
Come on, let's go.

575
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,499
Hyah!

576
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,173
Hyah!

577
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,179
Hyah!

578
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:10,854
Hyah! Hyah!

579
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,648
Hyah!

580
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,449
Hyah! Go!

581
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,332
!Adiós!

582
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:49,937
Oh, no! Oh, no!

583
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,812
Oh, no!

584
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,615
Hey, Blondito! Too bad
you can't get away with it, huh?

585
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,329
Hey, no! You can't do this to me!

586
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:08,572
- I'm on your side!
- You phoney double-crosser!

587
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:15,333
Ballantine's share goes to my favourite charity.

588
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:21,859
M o
Yo u 're as b g a t h o f as h o s, yo u son o f a

589
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:26,093

I never knew your mother, did I?

590
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:31,937
Oy, fo ows! A re yo u go nn a ot m o
