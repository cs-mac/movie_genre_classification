00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,040
Krystyna?

12
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
l wanted to see you again.

13
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,800
l'll go there later.

14
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,160
l brought you papers.

15
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Coffee.
Have a coffee.

16
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,040
Get busy, Kuba.
And stop worrying.

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
l knew you'd come.

18
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,920
You always come
when l think about you.

19
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,880
l was so scared l decided
to take the next train.

20
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Yes.

21
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,520
Has this woman
been here today?

22
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,120
- What woman?
- The cleaner.

23
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,400
Could she have done it?

24
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
- Krystyna.
- Perhaps we're not fair.

25
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,480
She couldn't have stolen it.

26
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
Then who?

27
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,400
We looked everywhere.

28
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,920
Kuba, please,
you deal with it.

29
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,840
l can't do it.

30
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,560
Say nothing, just ask her
not to come anymore.

31
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,920
Yes.

32
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
Krystyna...

33
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
- l want to tell you...
- Don't say anything.

34
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,920
lt doesn't matter.

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,800
- Krystyna...
- We'll leave this city.

36
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,040
Tomorrow.
Everything will change, you'll see.

37
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,120
We'll live together.
You'll only be with me.

38
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Away from the city,
the people, from it all.

39
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,360
- Nothing bad will happen.
- When are you back?

40
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
After 5 p.m.
l'll be here at six.

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,360
lt's only a few hours.

42
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,360
l'll wait at home,
it's just that...

43
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,480
lt's frightening to think
it's such a long time.

44
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,000
People will phone.

45
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,800
Somebody called at night.

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
l'm scared.

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,720
l wish it was over.

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,520
You have to stay here
and wait.

49
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,920
And you can't do what
you're thinking about.

50
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,320
l know, but l wish
it was six.

51
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,440
Kuba, you know
l love you.

52
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,920
l can't bear what's
happening to you.

53
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
lt will end.

54
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,880
lt's got to!

55
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,640
We can't go on like this.
l can't.

56
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,720
You have to understand!

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,920
Don't think about it.

58
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,840
l'll come at 6 o'clock.
We'll go there together.

59
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
May l?

60
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,160
Please.

61
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
You had a good time yesterday,
mister.

62
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,240
Done. l repaired it here,
only the stain remained.

63
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,400
No problem.

64
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,440
l can't pay you today.
l've no...

65
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,200
lt's been paid.
The lady paid yesterday.

66
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

67
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,320
Not much to do now.
You're not going out?

68
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,160
No.

69
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,920
l want to be at home.

70
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,000
The weather's so bad...
Believe you me, Mister Kubus,

71
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,160
l couldn't cope without it.

72
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,280
But that's no good.

73
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,280
When you think about it,
you've got to let it go.

74
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,560
Like l did.

75
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
Listen:

76
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,480
you're wasting
your health.

77
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,360
l'll never stop drinking
unless l stop thinking about it.

78
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,040
lt'll be over at six.
l just can't do what l want.

79
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,840
l have to wait.
Krystyna comes at six,

80
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,720
we'll go to the doctor.

81
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,160
She'll get the pills.
They wouldn't give them to me.

82
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,720
She'll be giving them to me.
She'll start to treat me.

83
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,880
lt'll help, right?

84
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
- Helps some people.
- lt will help me.

85
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,240
Will people forget
if l stop drinking for a year?

86
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,000
lt takes even less
than a year.

87
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,400
Very well,
l won't drink for a year

88
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,480
and l won't crave for it anymore.

89
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,720
l'll start afresh, won't l?

90
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Yes.

91
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,400
l won't take any more
of your time.

92
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,240
Good bye.

93
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,400
- Recognise me?
- Sure.

94
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,080
Horrible day.
Looks like rain.

95
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,880
- Was it raining at night?
- l don't know, l wasn't out.

96
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,840
You weren't out?
You stayed home?

97
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
- l was home.
- lmpossible!

98
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,720
- You didn't drink?
- No!

99
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,840
- You're joking.
- Promise.

100
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
l decided to try again.
Either it works, or it doesn't.

101
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,320
But it should work, eh?

102
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,440
- lt should.
- Right.

103
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,560
Some people make it,
so maybe l will, too.

104
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,040
Krystyna comes at six,
we'll see the doctor.

105
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
l'll stop drinking!

106
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,480
After a year people
will forget l drunk.

107
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Won't they?

108
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes.

109
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
All the best, then.

110
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,160
See you, Kuba.

111
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
See you.

112
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,440
ls that you?

113
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
Am l bloody happy
to hear it!

114
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,560
What happened?

115
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,040
Janek told me
you're giving up drinking.

116
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,080
Yes, that's true.

117
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,680
You know how difficult
things got.

118
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,320
l haven't got friends anymore.

119
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,560
- Everybody left me.
- My God, am l glad!

120
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,000
You're going to get those pills
with Krystyna?

121
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,520
- Yes, we decided to go.
- All right.

122
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
She's great,
she loves you so much.

123
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,320
She's left you
so many times, and...

124
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
always came back.

125
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,960
Many women
wouldn't take it.

126
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,240
How good you finally
saw sense.

127
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,480
Krystyna is such a brave lady.

128
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,960
l won't keep you.
Good luck!

129
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,440
- And see you!
- See you.

130
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,160
And what's the name of the pills
you're getting?

131
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
Antabus.

132
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,200
Antabus? Antabus. Antabus.
Auto-bus.

133
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,160
l have to remember. Bye.

134
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,920
Bottles!

135
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,280
What do you want?

136
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,960
l brought money. That's all
l managed to borrow.

137
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,160
Close the door.
What a draft!

138
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,200
l know it's a loss.

139
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,320
You said it was a souvenir,
you couldn't buy it now.

140
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,560
l did not take it, but l'll pay.

141
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,280
Just don't sue me, please!

142
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,160
Leave me! Now!
Do you understand?

143
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,080
You see, l can't afford to pay it
all at once,

144
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,400
but l'll try to bring more
next month.

145
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Although l didn't take it, sir.

146
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,680
Please, leave me alone, OK?

147
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,600
Don't come here any more.

148
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,920
Do you understand?

149
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,880
- Going to work?
- No, l took a day off.

150
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,600
l must see to something.

151
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,840
Who are you kidding?
l had a few drinks, too.

152
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,560
Brother in law came.
He had a bottle, l had a bottle...

153
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
and

154
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,560
you know...

155
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
City's in bloom,
we're in the gutter.

156
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,560
- You know my brother.
- No, l can't remember.

157
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,000
He surely knows you!
He drove you many times.

158
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,320
How do you mean,
you don't? He's this guy...

159
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,880
He is always asking me about you!

160
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,680
He likes you.
He's in a wheelchair.

161
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,240
Hell of a guy! Down to earth,
been through a lot...

162
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,840
We could go for one,
if you want.

163
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,120
No, l've no time.

164
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,640
You know how it is...

165
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
We, drinking guys,
must stick together.

166
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,640
You got so pale!
Or am l seeing things...

167
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,080
- No, you are pale.
- l'm not well.

168
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
Sour milk
helps after a binge.

169
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,160
Hair of the dog,
eat something warm.

170
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,560
Pickle juice helps.
l may have some at home.

171
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,440
No, thanks.
l'm in a hurry. Good bye!

172
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,200
Look!

173
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Plastered so early.

174
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,240
l know him. He lives here,
in the tailor's house.

175
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,840
- Drunkard.
- lt's like he lives on a grave.

176
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,960
Why are we sober, then?

177
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,880
Watch it!
Learn to walk in the street!

178
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,440
Kuba?

179
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
- How are you?
- Morning.

180
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,240
You've no idea
how happy l am.

181
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
- About?
- l've seen Wladek.

182
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,400
"You heard?'" he says.
'"What about?"

183
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,600
He goes:
"You know who called me? Kazio!

184
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,640
And you know what?
Thought l'd die!'"

185
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,080
'"Well, tell me."

186
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,000
"He stopped drinking!"

187
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,880
Kazio saw him.
'"Will he make it?'"

188
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,160
"Why wouldn't he?" l said.
That shut him up!

189
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,280
You'll make it, right?

190
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
- Yes, l will.
- That's my man!

191
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,640
The first few days are bad.

192
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,240
Remember poor Edzio?

193
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,160
What a character he was.

194
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,600
Remember? Tall, slim,
poured many glasses at one go.

195
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
That was drinking, eh?

196
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,560
You offended his wife.
She got flirty and you went:

197
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,720
"Shut up, you redhead idiot!'"
What a punch up.

198
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,880
Then he slapped you,
it all ended at the police.

199
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,320
Remember?

200
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,720
Those were the days.

201
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
What?

202
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,240
Can you tell me
what time it is?

203
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,040
What time? Of course!
One moment.

204
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,200
- Almost eleven.
- Thank you.

205
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,920
Yes. And then you got sacked,
right?

206
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,160
- That's when it was.
- Are you sure? l seem to remember.

207
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,320
l don't.
l can't remember a thing.

208
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,160
l don't want to remember!

209
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Hey, what's wrong?

210
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,960
Well. All the best, then.

211
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,560
Regards to Krystyna.
Things she has to go though.

212
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,600
- What's the name of the pills?
- Pills?

213
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,320
- The ones you'll get.
- l don't know.

214
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,520
A bus, finally.
Good bye!

215
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,680
l may pop in later,
we could talk. Bye!

216
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,640
lt's not over yet, sir.

217
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,480
l know.

218
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,240
- What happened?
- An accident.

219
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,120
- Whatever happened?
- Accident, accident!

220
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,280
- He was drunk.
- Really?

221
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,560
Drivers drink a lot.

222
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
There's no punishment!

223
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,040
- Drunk, was he?
- How can l tell?

224
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,160
l was just passing, like you.

225
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Seven hours.

226
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,200
l must wait
seven more hours.

227
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,120
Just a few moments.

228
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
Then we'll go there

229
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,600
and l won't be
scared of time anymore.

230
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,760
l will not drink

231
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,440
even if l wake up
late at night.

232
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,240
Or when l won't be
able to sleep.

233
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,840
When l'll dream about walking
through empty streets.

234
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,960
lt's so easy to drink then,

235
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,760
but l won't anymore.

236
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,400
And if l shall go back
to anything,

237
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,240
l'll go back to life.
l'll be among people.

238
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,600
That is a lot.

239
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,080
lt must all change today.

240
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,560
lt's past noon.

241
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,400
See, Miss Zosia?
lt got better now.

242
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,440
Look at the clouds.
lt'll rain all day.

243
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,840
Why, you're going somewhere?

244
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,920
Stop bothering me, get on with it.

245
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,720
Guests start turning up.

246
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,880
Miss Zosia?
Coffee, please.

247
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,360
A large one.

248
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,320
Right.

249
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,520
"Love is red. We sing it from
the stars, like from the score.

250
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,840
Why do we need phones?
Get the scissors, cut the line.'"

251
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,080
That's not right!
Listen carefully:

252
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,160
you should play when you hear

253
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,920
"Get the scissors, cut the line."

254
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
There.

255
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,560
That fast.

256
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,720
We made a decision.
"Our work is our testimony."

257
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,200
What?

258
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,840
You shoud wear it
on your neck.

259
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,560
- Wear what?
- City is full of people like me.

260
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,920
- We have them, too.
- Where?

261
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,600
Over the counter:
"Our work is our testimony."

262
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,480
"Bringing vodka in - forbidden!"

263
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,920
- lt's behind you, too.
- Thank you.

264
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,960
DOGS NOT ALLOWED!

265
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,480
Pretty sings.

266
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,880
We had one more.
The '"dogs" one is different.

267
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,360
This drunkard, Lewandowski
the painter, broke it.

268
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,000
What a laugh!
You know Lewandowski?

269
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,900
He's loud! He almost scared
the guests away.

270
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,040
Get away from here, now!

271
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,560
Get away from the signs!

272
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
What's wrong?

273
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,040
A headache.
After yestarday.

274
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,960
Look! That's how
it should be.

275
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,200
"Get the scrissors,
cut the line.'"

276
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,640
Hell with that '"Telephone'"!
OK...

277
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,800
Sit down!
Let's try something else.

278
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,920
What have we got...

279
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,920
Maybe:
"lt's got to be wonderful".

280
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
There.

281
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
ls that you?

282
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,680
Fancy the meeting!

283
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,440
- You're as pretty as back then.
- You're as nice as always.

284
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,280
How do you know?

285
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,800
You haven't seen me
for a long time.

286
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,080
Some people can resist things
that would turn others bitter.

287
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,200
Naturally.

288
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,440
"To be with you is wonderful,
To be - just the two of us..."

289
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,880
l'm glad we've met.

290
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,960
Really. You have no idea
how happy l am.

291
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,760
l am happy, too.
When have we seen each other last?

292
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,920
Long time ago.
Maybe 7 years.

293
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,640
- And then you left.
- l had to.

294
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,920
- Do you still live there?
- l do,

295
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,000
but things have changed.

296
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,440
Would you want to go back?

297
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,720
You know, it's hard to tell.

298
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,560
But l felt good in there sometimes.

299
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,280
l don't want to go there,
find out it won't be back.

300
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,680
Has the old church been rebuilt?

301
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
Partially.

302
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,800
Will you sit here?

303
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,640
May l?

304
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,080
Of course.

305
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,800
How are you? Tell me.

306
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,000
l work, l live.
Everything's fine.

307
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,120
Remember...

308
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,560
Remember anything
of those days?

309
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,880
- Everything.
- Me?

310
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,680
- That, too.
- Good.

311
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,120
l want you to remember me.
Women need that.

312
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,440
But l doubt you remember it all.

313
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,680
l surely do.

314
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,400
Ask about anything.

315
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,120
The night you walked me home
after a movie.

316
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,760
- There were many nights.
- But only one like that.

317
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,760
Yes. That's when it was...

318
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,960
l remember.

319
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,160
You said a poem.
Remember?

320
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,800
l didn't believe it then.

321
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,000
"l know how much of deadly crop
death gets. Death, unforgiving...

322
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,960
How quickly we forget,
how little love mourns us.'"

323
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,320
Why remember that?
lt's so kitch!

324
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,880
Yes, but don't stop.

325
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,920
l want to remember it all.

326
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,240
l hate my memories,
but l want to remember that.

327
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,640
We were young,

328
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,680
we didn't know what to talk
about by the river. At night.

329
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,680
Today we wouldn't talk at all.

330
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
lt doesn't matter.

331
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,680
l lived on a little street,
with trees on both sides.

332
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,600
You liked to sing,
but you were out of tune.

333
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,200
You were 21.

334
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,720
Go on.

335
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,280
What happened?

336
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,800
<i>What happened?</i>

337
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,400
Time.

338
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Yes.

339
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Did you know l got married?
l shouldn't be saying it.

340
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,880
lt won't be back,
there is no help.

341
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,160
You can't start
your life again.

342
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,920
l realised l don't love
my husband.

343
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,120
l don't know why
l haven't left him.

344
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,920
Can l tell you
something funny?

345
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,600
l loved you back then.

346
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,600
l thought about you
a lot.

347
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,440
Maybe we should
have waited.

348
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,840
Why haven't you told me?

349
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,280
- Back then?
- Back then.

350
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,840
Can l have
a cigarette?

351
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,560
Why do you smoke
horrible cigarettes?

352
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,800
l got used to it.

353
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,280
Why do you smoke?

354
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,680
You didn't, before.

355
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,080
Have l changed a lot?

356
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,600
- You're interesting.
- You're wrong.

357
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,960
Only young people are.

358
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,440
Later you only repeat
experiences of others.

359
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,080
- Why cling to that?
- l loved.

360
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,520
You said nothing.

361
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,880
lf you said a word,
all would be different.

362
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,920
l was scared.
Afraid of what people said.

363
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,880
l regret it.

364
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,680
- What did they warn you of?
- Vodka.

365
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,520
They said you drunk a lot,
you'd become a drunkard.

366
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,560
lt frightened me.

367
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,000
l've bad memories.

368
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
Father destroyed
my mother's life.

369
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,080
She waited for him,
he promised to change.

370
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
He got home drunk.

371
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,520
Why do l tell you that?
You'll never understand.

372
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,760
l only wanted to tell you
l loved you back then.

373
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,280
l really regret we're not together.

374
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,040
You don't have to remember that,
it will be easier.

375
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,920
Forget about it.

376
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,600
Regret nothing.

377
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,840
l ruined my own life.

378
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,040
l feel sick whenever
he gets close to me.

379
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,480
l cheat on him
every second Sunday.

380
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,880
lf he even guessed that.

381
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,840
Sad, docile idiot.

382
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,200
Why do l live
if l don't love?

383
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,520
Pretty story.

384
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,880
l heard many stories like that.

385
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,640
"They loved each other,

386
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,080
they met years later, she was
a hooker, he was a thief."

387
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,800
l don't give a damn!

388
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,360
l want no memories!
l want no regrets!

389
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,160
No things left behind!

390
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,360
Kuba.

391
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,680
You sick?

392
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,240
That's the one who
had a go at us earlier.

393
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,840
He's drunk.

394
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,920
You slave 1 5 hours a day,
he rolls from bar to bar.

395
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,600
- Damn him.
- Wait! l'll tell him!

396
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,520
You scum! What is it?
Nothing to eat, no clothes?

397
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,800
- Talking to me, thug?
- Getting into a fight?

398
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,640
Take me, go on.
l don't care.

399
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,800
- Come on.
- Leave him.

400
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,320
lt's the drunkard's fault!

401
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,560
He attacked my friend.
God be my witness!

402
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,720
Let's go for a walk.

403
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,360
Move it!

404
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,760
You, too.

405
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,760
Early start today.

406
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,040
Only half past two.

407
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,640
Damn, it's late again.

408
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,400
Don't lean against it.

409
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,360
Your lDs.

410
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,240
- l'll explain...
- lD! You'll talk later.

411
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,120
Name?

412
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,080
Drunkard.

413
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,480
- Family name?
- Drunkard.

414
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,960
Profession?
Drunkard?

415
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,160
Yes.

416
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,400
Nice.

417
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,600
Your lD says
your name is Kowalski.

418
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,040
l used to be Kowalski,
but it was a long time ago.

419
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,120
There are thousands of
Kowalskis.

420
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,600
Sometimes the name is
Kwiatkowski or Piotrowski, or...

421
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,120
- But it doesn't matter.
- Ever done time?

422
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,400
No.

423
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,320
You will do now.

424
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,160
Fought in the street.
Fancy that - in broad daylight!

425
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,160
They were just playing.
He was obnoxious.

426
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,800
Number 3, right?

427
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,640
Yes.

428
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,720
Used to be number 1 ?

429
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,200
As usual, citizen Rybicki.
Get your clothes off.

430
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,080
Get undressed!

431
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,640
l knew it will come to this,
sergeant.

432
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,920
l always get number 3.

433
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,040
Well...

434
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,320
What was l to do?

435
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,280
My wife has just died.

436
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,520
So can l be drunk or not?

437
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,960
Calm yourself down, Rybicki.

438
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,200
Last time you were
mourning your daughter.

439
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,440
He had
a wake for his wife, too.

440
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,120
lt's a terrible year
for him.

441
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,000
Get undressed!

442
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,240
My belt, too?

443
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,760
Of course! You know
good old number 3,

444
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,880
you go to sleep
with no belt on.

445
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,760
A belt could be
dangerous.

446
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,080
What would your wife's grave do
if you made a loop?

447
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,920
Who would attend to it?

448
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,880
Yes. My good luck with women
got me in trouble.

449
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,400
- Shoe laces, too?
- No, shoe laces stay.

450
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,440
l will not die in number 3,
sergeant, will l?

451
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Never.

452
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,360
He's signing "Andalucia'".

453
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,320
As usual.

454
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,920
He'll have a fit now.

455
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,200
- ls he bound?
- Yes, hands and feet.

456
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Should we call
an ambulance?

457
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,720
As if they picked every
drunkard in town!

458
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,840
Damn it! Handcuffs,
police stations, fines...

459
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,200
lt won't help.

460
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,880
l was a guerilla in the war.
l thought once it was over,

461
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,240
you'd live differently.

462
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,800
l never thought l would be
a police sergeant

463
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,080
taking your belts away.

464
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,440
Go to hell!
All of you!

465
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,440
There goes.

466
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,600
lf only he would shut it.

467
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,000
- Where have you got drunk?
- l am not drunk.

468
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,560
Nobody's drunk. lt was me,
l hit that man.

469
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,320
What was it about?

470
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,640
- Nothing.
- So why did you hit him?

471
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,840
l got upset.

472
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,480
l could keep you here,
that would teach you.

473
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,840
But l don't want
you here.

474
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,200
You'll probably
make up now.

475
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,440
That's how it goes.

476
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
You're free.

477
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,840
What time is it?

478
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,440
We have a while,
let's get a drink.

479
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,120
l think you have guts.

480
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,240
- What time is it?
- 3:25 p.m.

481
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,360
- You coming?
- No, l've no time.

482
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,640
Don't bear a grudge.

483
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,840
l don't.

484
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,120
To hell with it all!

485
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,800
- Where's the nearest bar?
- An Eagle, round the corner.

486
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,640
Where?

487
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,880
There. Not far.

488
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,960
A large one.

489
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,160
- A snack?
- Yes, please.

490
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,040
Herring?

491
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,880
- Beer?
- OK.

492
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,840
We've only got stout,
no other beer.

493
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,760
We get beer at 5 p.m.,
and now it's...

494
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,880
only 3:30 p.m.

495
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,120
- Give me the stout!
- What's the hurry?

496
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,760
- Thin or thick glass?
- Doesn't matter.

497
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,800
- l'm not a drunkard.
- Clients have their whims.

498
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,400
Some folk won't drink

499
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,480
out of a thick glass,
no matter what.

500
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,560
- What else?
- Just this. Then, home.

501
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,920
That's it.

502
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,840
Or perhaps...

503
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,360
Give me one more,
right away.

504
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,160
One more.

505
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,560
- Quite a drinker, are you?
- Will you drink with me?

506
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,920
Happy to.

507
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,880
But l've nothing.

508
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,280
My treat.

509
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,720
- l don't know you.
- l know you.

510
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,520
- Me?
- Yes.

511
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,200
You're Kowalski.

512
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,280
That's wrong, my name is...

513
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,160
Does it matter?

514
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,440
What is my name...
Everybody knows us.

515
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,600
We're humans.

516
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,960
That's a noble thing.

517
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,520
Two vodkas!

518
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,880
That'll be six.

519
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,000
Right. l am ready.

520
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,920
All the best!

521
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,200
The best!

522
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,160
Put the light on, dear.

523
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,280
And over the tables.
Gentlemen are waiting.

524
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,440
One more.

525
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,080
One more!

526
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,080
When you say "8'",
l'll take my life today.

527
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,160
Eight.

528
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,400
Let's drink!

529
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,760
You know what?

530
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,920
Let's drink
Bruderschaft.

531
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,840
l had a hard life,
believe you me.

532
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,160
l like men like you.

533
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,080
OK?

534
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,080
- l am Kuba.
- l am Wladek.

535
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,520
Order vodka, Wladek.
On me.

536
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,720
Two vodkas!

537
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,200
Hurry up, we're late
for school.

538
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,960
Drink.

539
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,000
An everyday sort of a day.
Everyday gloomy day.

540
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,000
Tap is leaking,
it's foggy outside.

541
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,280
Raindrops beat against
dirty windows,

542
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,840
a neighbour plays
a piano out of tune.

543
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,280
Tell me, girl,
Why aren't you here?

544
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,720
To hell with it!

545
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,600
l like songs like that.

546
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,480
A gloomy day,
only vodka will let you forget.

547
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,880
You play well.
l really like songs like that.

548
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,160
- Shall l play '"Francois'"?
- No, l hate waltzes.

549
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,480
- "Tamara'"?
- What else can you play?

550
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,080
- l can explain dreams.
- Hear that, Wladek?

551
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,440
He understands dreams.

552
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,720
l had a weird one.

553
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,280
lf you could explain it...

554
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,760
You only have
a dream like it once.

555
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,600
Tell, tell, tell...

556
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,240
A squeeze box player
will tell you.

557
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,680
lt was a weird dream.

558
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,240
l dreamt...

559
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,440
That l was a drunkard,
my name was Kowalski,

560
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,560
l had a telephone at home.

561
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,720
You see?

562
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,160
l dreamt l wanted to forget
about drinking.

563
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,760
Leave people l drunk with,
bars, memories.

564
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,080
lt happens in dreams, right?
But in a dream...

565
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,600
You can't get away.

566
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,680
And that's the worst.

567
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,440
Exhausting dream.

568
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,360
l dreamt of much more:

569
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,960
land - strange,

570
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,400
difficult, hard land.

571
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,720
A country where you have
to work hard,

572
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,120
have so much hope,
so much heart.

573
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,320
That's my nightmare.

574
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,960
Horrible.

575
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,720
Just a dream, eh?

576
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,960
lmpossible in real life.

577
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,920
Life isn't that hard, right?

578
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,920
- You don't need bad dreams.
- What can l do...

579
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,680
to forget?

580
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,440
Get a vodka.
lt will all pass.

581
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,280
Everything does.

582
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,720
No worse dream than a life.
That passes, too.

583
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,360
Sorry, l have to play,
clients are waiting.

584
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,400
Beer!
Make a space!

585
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,120
5 o'clock.

586
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,000
Are you sick?
Feeling bad?

587
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,040
l never felt that well.

588
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,400
Wladek.

589
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:33,240
What do the nice folk do
at 5 o'clock?

590
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,840
Go home,

591
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,320
work,

592
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,160
- read, play with kids.
- No matter, my man.

593
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,040
What do good folk
do at 5 o'clock?

594
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,840
Good folk at 5 o'clock

595
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,440
drink straight vodka.

596
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,600
With a red label,
at the Eagle.

597
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,440
The Eagle.

598
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,520
Babe! Two vodkas here.

599
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,640
Just a moment.

600
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,440
They used to have a poster here:

601
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,320
'"Have no worries -
the Police watches over you!"

602
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,560
l can't remember
the picture.

603
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,880
Pour these vodkas,
will you?

604
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,840
How do you know?

605
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,280
l've drunk here for years.

606
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,600
l've seen

607
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,880
many people in here.

608
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,960
You've no idea.

609
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,680
Yes or no, boss?

610
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,240
Anything good
came out of it?

611
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,560
Not everything
has to end well.

612
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,320
That would be boring.

613
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,400
Yes or no?

614
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,920
Men, men...

615
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,360
Who are you?

616
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,760
A little Pole.

617
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,840
Seriously:
who are you?

618
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,520
Who l was.

619
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,320
- You're pissed.
- Doesn't matter.

620
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,280
l am your dear friend
from the Eagle.

621
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,560
- Why do you drink?
- lt doesn't matter.

622
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,800
We, drinkers, know
it doesn't matter - why.

623
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,000
Maybe l'm lonely.

624
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,320
Or a hooker l can't live
without cheated on me?

625
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,360
No matter.

626
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,120
There's no such bad luck,

627
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,000
no loneliness, no woman,
for whom it is worth to drink.

628
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,560
But only those know it,
who lost all to drinking.

629
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,440
Those who
have to drink.

630
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,640
Those who start drinking
have no idea.

631
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,960
Vodka is the truth

632
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,640
one always understands
when it's too late.

633
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,320
l had a bad day.

634
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,240
A bad day in town.

635
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,880
But it is over.

636
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,280
l have

637
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,720
one more hope

638
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,360
l hold on to.

639
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,560
Let's drink, Wladek!

640
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,560
Yup...

641
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,000
lt's good that you have hope.

642
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,640
l've no hope.

643
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,480
l don't believe there's a way
out of this hell.

644
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,240
lt's nothing.

645
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:26,600
l started just like that boy.

646
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,480
Love, betrayal.

647
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,640
All sorts of shit.

648
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,200
l used to be

649
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,480
the best saxophone player
in the country.

650
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,440
Saxophone player?

651
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,520
You? A saxophone player?

652
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,520
You don't look like it.

653
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,920
That's who l was.

654
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,320
Don't you believe me?

655
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,360
Nobody played here
like l did.

656
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,760
So what?

657
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,720
Nothing.

658
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,040
And what?

659
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,120
Nothing, too.

660
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,160
Why do you tell me that, then?

661
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,120
l'm not telling you,

662
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,960
l'm speaking.

663
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,640
Speak. What is the end?
The end is important.

664
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,840
The point, you see?

665
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,960
l'm not the best player
anymore.

666
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
That'll do.

667
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,680
lf everybody told their
stupid life story so quickly

668
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,800
it'd be much better

669
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
but

670
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,280
if you want to tell me your story,
go ahead.

671
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:23,120
Go on, l like wise
life stories.

672
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,640
lt's a short one.

673
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,520
- l loved...
- Now that's a novelty!

674
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,320
She left me,

675
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,440
and now

676
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:53,320
l am no longer the best saxophone
player in town.

677
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,960
This town...

678
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,400
hasn't got one decent
saxophone player.

679
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,400
They're all poor.

680
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,920
Screw it, screw it!

681
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,040
No need to buy a brewery
if you want one beer.

682
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,040
lt'll all pass like a bad dream.
Seriously.

683
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,960
Gienek!

684
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,280
Go after them!

685
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,960
Even if he gets his girl,

686
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,680
his luck will run out,

687
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,440
unless he stops to drink.

688
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,680
Silly little lady

689
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,680
will follow him, get him out
of bars or friends' homes.

690
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,520
How do you know that?

691
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,200
lt always comes to that
if a woman looks after a drunkard

692
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,120
she loves.

693
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,640
l had a woman
who loved me once.

694
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,280
- And?
- Hospital...

695
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,920
l went there
because of her.

696
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,240
And?

697
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,160
Go away!

698
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,320
She left.

699
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,920
Finally, she went to hell.

700
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,120
And never came back.

701
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,040
She was a good woman.

702
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,680
All's lost.

703
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,560
All's lost?

704
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,880
Whoever drinks,
will drink.

705
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,000
lt's a game with no end.

706
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,200
Now - pills, vitamins,
conversing with doctors,

707
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,000
who could maybe
treat horses.

708
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,240
Then...

709
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,120
a madhouse.

710
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,160
A white room you can not leave.

711
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,840
Four walls and you,
and your memories,

712
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,760
hangovers.

713
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,280
You can cry, beat your head
against the wall, curse, pray,

714
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,400
but you will not get the key.

715
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,240
You're stuck in a room.

716
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,720
Memories, memories, memories -
day and night,

717
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,160
day and night.

718
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,000
At night you receive visits

719
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,280
of different people

720
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,360
but

721
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,200
when you reach out

722
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,880
there's nothing there.

723
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,840
and you are alone again.

724
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:38,640
When the doctors come,
you beg them to let you out.

725
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,800
Stop!

726
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,440
- You kiss their hands.
- Stop!

727
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,840
But beg you can.
Scream day and night...

728
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,000
You can swear on your knees
you've changed.

729
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,320
And you've strong will.
They'll check your pulse

730
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,720
and leave.

731
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,680
- But people do get out!
- Yes.

732
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,920
But only to return.

733
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,560
You lie!

734
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,560
l was there.

735
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,680
And l will be.

736
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,840
Rooms with no door handles,
yet again.

737
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,920
Finally, the day will come

738
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,120
when l won't need
or feel anything...

739
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,160
l will turn into a pile
of rotten meat.

740
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:39,160
But before that happens,
there's still many, many...

741
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,400
Gienek!

742
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:21,360
Calm down, gentlemen.
Nothing's happened.

743
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,680
Poldek, play a song:
'"A day for a day"!

744
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,560
Hell with him.
Check his pockets.

745
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,280
Nothing so far.

746
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,280
Damn! lf you've no money,
go to church, not to a bar.

747
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,840
And?

748
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,320
Got it.

749
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,560
- Enough?
- Think so.

750
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,440
What else have you got?

751
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,200
l don't know.

752
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,400
Have a look.

753
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,560
Stolen?

754
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,040
No, he doesn't look it.

755
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,200
lt's not worth much,
but can get us in trouble.

756
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,320
Let's leave him.

757
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,160
He'll be back.
ls anyone coming?

758
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:53,200
l'll treat him, all right!
That'll get him home.

759
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,880
Damn, it's going to rain again.

760
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,040
Go away!

761
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,120
Mister Kubus, don't you know me?
l'm Kostek.

762
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,440
Had too much.

763
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,760
Have a drag.

764
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,480
lt'll help.

765
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,800
Where...

766
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,200
are they?

767
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,680
Went away.

768
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,880
l know you.

769
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,000
You're Kostek.

770
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,680
Exactly.

771
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,040
Come, l'll get you home.

772
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,760
ls that you?

773
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,120
l waited for you
a long time.

774
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,240
Give me the key.

775
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,280
Go to your room!

776
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,760
l'll be there.

777
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,040
Please.

778
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,600
l drunk...

779
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,280
l'll wipe you hands,

780
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,960
l drunk...

781
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,200
get you a coffee.

782
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,520
l drunk...

783
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,400
Have l slept long?

784
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,480
Just a moment.

785
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,240
Drink, it's hot.

786
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,640
- You want to know?
- No.

787
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,320
They phoned first thing.

788
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,640
l had to leave.

789
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,640
l'll go now.

790
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,400
You're leaving?

791
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,800
l'm going.

792
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,680
l'll come in the morning.
First thing.

793
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,360
What time?

794
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,600
- What time?
- At eight.

795
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,120
And?

796
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,400
You'll get treatment!

797
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,920
Krystyna!

798
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,040
lt won't help.

799
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,640
- We'll try.
- How long?

800
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,080
Until the end.

801
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,120
That's no good.
Go away!

802
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,880
Go and don't come back.

803
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,440
Pity is a bad feeling,
Krystyna.

804
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,400
Kuba, listen to me:

805
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,000
l'll come here at 8 o'clock.

806
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,560
l'll ring three times,

807
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,480
that's when you'll open.

808
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,720
lf anybody else turns up,
don't open.

809
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,800
When you first came here,

810
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,720
you sounded different.

811
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,920
Looked different.

812
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,200
lt'll never come back.

813
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,240
Don't open and remember:
three times.

814
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,360
Krystyna!

815
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,880
- Don't go, l'm scared.
- You know l have to.

816
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,440
Sleep well, Kuba.

817
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,200
Until tomorrow.

818
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,760
There you are, slut.

819
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,400
Good day to you.

820
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,680
Yes?

821
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,600
- Kuba?
- Yes.

822
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,040
<i>Kuba, Kuba...</i>

823
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,600
<i>That's, that's...</i>

824
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,720
<i>We talked yesterday,</i>

825
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,480
<i>you said: enough.</i>

826
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,240
That's it: enough.

827
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,920
And in the evening l heard

828
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:54,080
they saw you drunk,
rolling in the street.

829
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,880
We want to help you,
We all want to help you.

830
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,200
We want to save you,
save your talent, your love.

831
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,000
And you drink again.

832
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,520
Tough, you can't be trusted,

833
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,200
drunkards can not.

834
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:25,160
Don't be angry at me,
who else would tell you the truth?

835
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,120
See...

836
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,280
l was so sure about you.

837
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,040
What does that make me?

838
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,400
What?

839
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,800
Doesn't matter.

840
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,720
l'm only sorry the picture's broken.

841
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,320
lt's a pity.

842
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,200
l knew you would come.

843
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,560
You always do

844
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,120
when l'd rather
not think about you.

845
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,200
You know...

846
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,240
that my life turns to hell,

847
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,320
addiction to endless waiting.

848
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,920
Poisoning every moment
of my solitude.

849
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,720
You don't know vodka.

850
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,880
Don't know.

851
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,360
Don't know.

852
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,680
Don't know that
horrible feeling.

853
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,720
That fear that chokes
your brain.

854
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,120
When l think that
all's not lost,

855
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,320
that l can go back,
start afresh...

856
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,600
l know l'm crumbling down.

857
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,840
l walked into a void.

858
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,000
l'm weak.

859
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,040
Damn weak.

860
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,840
l'll never be able to fight
the world.

861
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,400
Squash obstacles,
work, love, live...

862
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,000
Live a pure life.

863
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,080
l need to leave.

864
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,080
Leave memories.

865
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,920
Leave the fools

866
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:10,360
who lost track of time
and only regulate their watches.

867
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,640
Good you're here
with me now.

868
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,760
You know...

869
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,920
l have to go there.

870
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:33,000
l'll never have to fear
questions or words.

871
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,440
Never be frightened of time.

872
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:45,640
l'll go there and the world
will cease to exist.

873
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,440
lt has to be.

874
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,480
Eight.

875
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,480
<i>THE END</i>
