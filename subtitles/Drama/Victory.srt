{1285}{1366}Man: There was an island|called Samburan
{1367}{1440}and a man called Axel Heyst.
{1442}{1513}Nobody had actually seen him|for over two years,
{1514}{1568}although we all knew|he was there,
{1570}{1609}alone in the Java Sea
{1611}{1701}with the ruins of his Tropical|Belt Coal Company.
{1703}{1784}Heyst the businessman,|Heyst the dreamer
{1786}{1850}had turned into|Heyst the hermit.
{1852}{1922}[Water crashing]
{1924}{1977}Samburan.
{1979}{2036}Which way around?
{2038}{2104}Uh, same as usual,|I suppose.
{2106}{2166}The long way around.
{2638}{2708}When Heyst and his partner,|Morrison,
{2710}{2750}first started the coal mine,
{2752}{2813}my fellow traders were afraid|that steam power
{2815}{2896}was going to put them and their|sailing ships out of business.
{2898}{2972}So when Morrison disappeared|and the mine closed,
{2974}{3005}they were delighted.
{3006}{3066}But I had always liked Heyst|myself,
{3068}{3152}so I made a point of passing|his island once a month,
{3154}{3241}just in case he'd changed|his mind and wanted to leave.
{3242}{3349}But there was never any sign|of the man until that day.
{3458}{3509}I'll be damned.
{3642}{3682}Captain Davidson.
{3684}{3752}This is very kind of you.
{3754}{3789}Well, well, Heyst.
{3790}{3842}Getting out at last, eh?
{3844}{3878}Well, no, actually.
{3880}{3963}I've got some belongings|to pick up in Sourabaya.
{3965}{3998}Furniture.
{4000}{4046}Furniture?
{4047}{4080}- You mean...|- Yes.
{4082}{4117}My father's things.
{4119}{4190}They've been in storage|in America for years.
{4218}{4253}Davidson:|It seemed incredible,
{4254}{4330}but the man was apparently|planning to come straight back
{4332}{4377}and live like a hermit forever.
{4378}{4461}Heyst: I'm done with doing,|Captain Davidson.
{4463}{4523}I think people|should be left alone.
{4525}{4581}Davidson:|That's what he said to me.
{4582}{4657}And that's just what wasn't|going to happen.

{5300}{5358}Captain Davidson,
{5360}{5413}you do understand|how grateful I am?
{5415}{5456}Oh, it's nothing,|nothing.
{5458}{5485}Think nothing of it.
{5486}{5522}Well, I thank you.
{5596}{5646}I'm here if you need me,|Heyst.
{5648}{5715}It was just before|Christmas, 1913,
{5717}{5793}the year before the world|changed forever.

{8440}{8483}Davidson: There was|an all-women's orchestra
{8485}{8555}staying in Schomberg's hotel|for the holidays,
{8557}{8626}run by a certain|Mr. And Mrs. Zangiacomo.
{8627}{8668}[Translation]|Mrs. Bantia...
{8670}{8761}Davidson: It was a sad business,|common enough for the time.
{8762}{8808}Not all the girls were|prostitutes,
{8810}{8853}though most of them were.
{8855}{8925}White slaves, poor things.
{8926}{8990}[Clanking continues]
{9022}{9083}Good afternoon,|Mrs. Schomberg.
{9085}{9136}I'd like a room,|if that's possible,
{9138}{9169}for a couple of weeks.
{9210}{9264}Oh, I remember.
{9266}{9332}Payment in advance.
{9334}{9408}Davidson: Mrs. Schomberg was|famous for her silence.
{9410}{9498}It was said that she hadn't|spoken a word for years.
{9500}{9532}Thank you.
{9534}{9637}Davidson: Mr. Schomberg took a|suspicious view of most people,
{9639}{9708}but with Heyst,|it was more than that.
{9710}{9793}What the hell|is he doing here?
{9795}{9835}Of all the nerve.
{9871}{9923}[Bird chirping]

{11150}{11207}Who is he anyway,|this hermit?
{11209}{11232}I've never heard of him.
{11234}{11263}That's surprisingly|hard to say.
{11265}{11301}Schomberg: He stays|on that island
{11302}{11395}because he's ashamed to show|his face anywhere else.
{11397}{11454}Look what he did|to his partner.
{11456}{11485}Poor Morrison.
{11487}{11544}He probably killed the man
{11546}{11589}just to get|all of his money.
{11591}{11646}I say|he's worse than a Jew.
{11648}{11701}[Gong chimes]

{14706}{14760}He had lived in Borneo|and Kalamata
{14762}{14812}and with the cannibals|in new Guinea.
{14814}{14853}And yet it seems
{14854}{14944}that the vileness of his own|race could still move him.
{15527}{15580}Excuse me.
{15642}{15677}Are you all right?
{15712}{15779}T-That woman...

{16358}{16392}You want me to leave?
{16394}{16432}I didn't say that.
{16434}{16472}[Woman laughing]
{16474}{16549}She pinched me because|I didn't get down here|quick enough.

{17437}{17517}I think I saw you in the garden|this afternoon.
{17518}{17568}You were...

{18178}{18273}So how did you get involved|with this lot?
{18275}{18318}[Indistinct conversations]
{18320}{18386}Bad luck.
{18442}{18546}I didn't know what it meant...
{18548}{18618}when I signed up with them.
{18619}{18682}These men aren't here|for the music.
{18763}{18849}So, have you decided|about the girl?
{18851}{18894}It's a generous offer, no?
{18896}{18958}I am still considering it,|Mr. Schomberg.
{18960}{18999}[Inhales deeply]
{19001}{19048}She's very special,|that one.

{19178}{19261}A nobody... a nothing.
{19263}{19326}Zangiacomo takes us|from the ship to hotel
{19328}{19398}and keeps us locked up|till it's time to go on.
{19399}{19441}I never know|where I am, even.

{19506}{19570}Sourabaya.
{19572}{19601}Do you have any family?
{19603}{19652}No.

{19692}{19757}My father was in the musical.
{19758}{19825}He tried to take care of me.
{19827}{19933}Then he got ill,|and I was on my own.
{19934}{20025}Suppose I agreed to sell her|to you, Mr. Schomberg.
{20026}{20068}What about your wife?
{20070}{20102}[Laughs]
{20104}{20176}I'll send her back|to her own people in Europe.

{75426}{75490}[Breathing heavily]
{75578}{75641}You must be feeling weak.
{75642}{75693}Just a little.
{75695}{75737}Where were you sailing to?
{75739}{75787}To the Malaccas.
{75823}{75861}Then we saw the volcano.
{75863}{75929}That's what... gave us courage.

{77475}{77505}What happened to Wang?
{77507}{77537}He ran off.
{77539}{77596}Perhaps he's been startled|at last.
{77598}{77633}What do you mean?

{111730}{111777}Maybe it's my duty, even.
{111778}{111804}No, no.
{111805}{111890}We better go down...

{112389}{112460}Mr. Ricardo, my dear.
{112462}{112544}I didn't expect|you here to help.
{112611}{112654}At your service, ma'am.
{112656}{112733}Pedro told me|there was a lady about.
{112734}{112772}Would you like some water?|You must need it.

{112981}{113014}Had a pleasant walk?
{113017}{113064}Yes, and you?
{113065}{113100}Ain't budged all afternoon.
{113101}{113166}It wouldn't be safe for you,|as a matter of fact.
{113168}{113192}Oh?
{113193}{113256}Oh, you mean the Chink?|He ain't much.
{113258}{113293}He has a revolver.
{113294}{113325}So do you.
{113326}{113400}Yes, but I'm not afraid|of you.
{113450}{113521}You got a queer way|of putting things sometimes.
{113638}{113684}[Metal rattling]
{113875}{113919}[Wind gusting]
{114081}{114163}You and the governor|ought to get along well.

{114273}{114317}But he's not well.
{114319}{114389}Have to think about|getting away from here soon.

{114490}{114521}[Laughs]
{114522}{114593}Only he can't|make up his mind to leave
{114594}{114661}without having a talk|with you first.
{114662}{114741}He asked me to invite you over|for a game of cards.

{115460}{115491}No.
{115493}{115544}Oh, you want poor,|harmless Pedro out of the way

{120395}{120477}Something drove you out,|I suppose, like me,

{122112}{122139}Yes.
{122141}{122191}You need a man, a master,
