1
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,294
Here.

2
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,064
What are you doing?

3
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:34,764
(5 minutes before Dong Hyuk came to Young Ae's rescue)

4
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,094
There's someone I know.

5
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:38,224
- Please begin. 
- All right.

6
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:41,194
Blowfish is fibrous.

7
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:42,894
You have to slice the fish as thinly as possible.

8
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:44,424
Isn't this so thin?

9
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:48,824
We didn't order this.

10
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,894
Your boyfriend ordered it before he stepped out.

11
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:52,294
He said it's one of your favorites.

12
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:54,564
Boyfriend?

13
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:57,794
Ms. Lee, are you in a relationship?

14
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,824
I guess your boyfriend stepped out.

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,724
You'll introduce me to him when he's back, right?

16
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:08,994
Gosh, I'm really curious what kind of man you're seeing.

17
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:15,164
What? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?

18
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,734
You didn't even finish the food.

19
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,924
Well, something came up.

20
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,064
What's the rush?

21
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,364
Where are you going in the middle of dinner?

22
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:27,764
My gosh. Look who's here.

23
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:32,494
You have to finish the food.

24
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:34,664
Sit.

25
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:36,624
What is going on?

26
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,094
Does this mean...

27
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,124
Mr. Cho is...

28
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:43,124
your boyfriend?

29
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,324
Yes.

30
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:48,024
I'm her guy friend.

31
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:49,724
Her male friend.

32
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:52,194
Aren't I right?

33
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,864
Yes.

34
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:59,064
We're friends, you know. We went to elementary school together.

35
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,594
So you two are just friends?

36
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,764
My gosh! Mr. Lee, what brings you here?

37
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,394
Well, I was just...

38
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,764
We should get going. Let's go.

39
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:16,664
Come on. Enjoy your dinner.

40
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:18,594
- All right. 
- Bye.

41
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:25,164
Mr. Lee.

42
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,564
Don't you think there's something going on between those two?

43
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,394
They're saying that they're just friends,

44
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:33,694
but they got all flustered and ran away...

45
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:37,424
Where did he go?

46
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,594
When did Mr. Lee leave?

47
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:45,524
Goodness, every single thing he does irks me.

48
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:53,324
(Episode 5: A Jealousy-filled Day)

49
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:54,664
Hey, wait!

50
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,594
What happened?

51
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,094
Why did you show up...

52
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:05,564
Aren't you two dating secretly?

53
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:06,964
What?

54
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,394
How did you know that we're dating?

55
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:12,264
Young Ja, did you tell him?

56
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:14,964
No, why would I?

57
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,224
At the last work dinner you guy had,

58
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,064
I saw you two holding hands together.

59
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:20,924
I see.

60
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,524
Mr. Cho and you are not on good terms.

61
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,064
I wanted to help because I didn't want it to affect the project.

62
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:28,824
I see.

63
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:31,364
Thanks.

64
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,064
- I better get going now. 
- Bye.

65
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:46,464
See? I told you that we shouldn't stay in the neighborhood.

66
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,094
Dong Hyuk saved us.

67
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,494
Young Ja, were you and Mr. Cho close?

68
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:56,124
No, I didn't see him for 30 years.

69
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,364
I couldn't even recognize him at first.

70
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,194
Really? I'm surprised.

71
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:04,494
He helped you even though you guys aren't close.

72
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:07,224
He doesn't look like the type to do that.

73
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,194
He said he helped because of the project.

74
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:15,164
Gosh, I left all the shrimp sushi because of Mr. Cho.

75
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:16,424
What a waste.

76
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:18,424
I'll buy it for you again.

77
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,964
(She pulled an all-nighter!)

78
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,824
Young Ae, I'm coming in.

79
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:34,324
(She pulled an all-nighter!)

80
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:38,164
She's not here.

81
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:39,824
Is she in the bathroom?

82
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,624
Why is her room so messy?

83
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,594
Is this what she's working on these days?

84
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:54,824
What are you doing in my room?

85
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:58,624
I'm sorry. I came in to speak to you about something.

86
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:02,394
Young Ae, I got a project for you.

87
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:03,794
What?

88
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:06,564
My friend came to see me to sell me insurance,

89
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:08,794
and I got him to get promotional materials done through us.

90
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:10,324
Seriously?

91
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:12,324
I'm impressed.

92
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,264
You sold our service to a salesman.

93
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:18,024
I used the skills I learned from you to persuade him.

94
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,364
I said, "Your promotional materials are so ugly."

95
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,594
"I can't trust your service because of them." Then he placed an order.

96
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:26,594
Right.

97
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,824
You got us many orders when we were in Jeju Island, too.

98
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,194
You have a great sense of humor. You look friendly as well.

99
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,464
I know.

100
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:39,524
Looking back, those were the fun times.

101
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:40,864
Don't you agree?

102
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:44,494
You're right.

103
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,694
You and I were...

104
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:50,364
such a great team.

105
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,994
You designed, and I took care of the sales.

106
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:56,564
We were.

107
00:05:58,394 --> 00:05:59,964
Speaking of which,

108
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,394
why don't we...

109
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:06,794
I have to get dressed and head out for work.

110
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,764
Sure.

111
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,124
He must want to work with me again.

112
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:26,994
But I couldn't take him to Nakwon Printing.

113
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,624
Should I have told her straightforwardly...

114
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:33,494
that I want to work with her again?

115
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:38,294
Why can't she take a hint?

116
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,764
You've been staying at home for six months now.

117
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,194
Why can you still not even cook rice?

118
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:48,424
(Her husband gets on her nerves from the morning.)

119
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:51,494
Close the lid and push the "start" button.

120
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:55,564
Then it'll say "It starts now."

121
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:57,394
It doesn't?

122
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,224
Did you lock the lid?

123
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:04,464
You have to turn the lock.

124
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,924
There's only one thing you can turn.

125
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:08,794
You're driving me crazy.

126
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,224
Hang up.

127
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:13,964
What are you doing?

128
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:15,794
After peeping at my text,

129
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,524
now you're listening to me talk on the phone?

130
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,464
I didn't mean to.

131
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,924
You were just speaking too loud.

132
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,794
Let me tell you again.

133
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,624
I don't want others to talk about my family matters.

134
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:30,864
So...

135
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:37,024
if you say anything about my husband losing his job,

136
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,564
I'll lock your mouth with this.

137
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,524
I get it. Don't worry.

138
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:49,164
Seo Hyun regrets getting to know about Mi Ran's family matter.

139
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,694
Among the revised versions,

140
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,294
which is your favorite?

141
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:58,694
Are they really revised versions?

142
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:00,724
They all look the same to me.

143
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,664
Is this a "spot the difference" quiz or something?

144
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:05,294
Can't you tell the differences?

145
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,064
I stayed up all night working on it.

146
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,594
Is your eyesight getting bad?

147
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:13,624
She worked on it all night. They can't look the same.

148
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,264
This one is like this.

149
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,294
That one is like that.

150
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:25,494
This one is like this.

151
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:28,464
They all look the same to you as well, right?

152
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,224
Ms. Lee, are you sure you worked on it all night?

153
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,894
They're all the same.

154
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,524
That's not true. They're all different.

155
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,864
This one has a bigger belly.

156
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:42,624
This one has a bigger horn.

157
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,864
This one has more hair.

158
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,124
This one has bigger nostrils.

159
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:49,724
I like the first one the most.

160
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,324
Really? That's my favorite, too.

161
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:57,324
I can see why you're a designer.

162
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,594
I wonder why Ms. La couldn't tell the differences.

163
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:03,794
I did.

164
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,664
I pretended because I wanted to cut Ms. Lee some slack.

165
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:10,364
What are you talking about?

166
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:13,864
Ms. Lee is not a slacker like you.

167
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,124
I'm not a slacker.

168
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:19,164
I'm so proud of you, Ms. Lee.

169
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:22,764
You revised it in a day.

170
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:27,494
You even had a date yesterday.

171
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:29,794
A date?

172
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,064
- With who? - That's right.

173
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:34,594
I saw Mr. Cho from the bar with her yesterday.

174
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:37,224
It was just a dinner.

175
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,424
Don't start a false rumor.

176
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,694
I have to stop by at the print shop.

177
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:50,534
She had dinner with Mr. Cho yesterday?

178
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,034
Yes.

179
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,224
They had dinner just by themselves at an expensive Japanese restaurant.

180
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:57,924
They looked so close.

181
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,724
Right. You saw them, too.

182
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,224
They looked like they were just friends.

183
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,534
That's not true.

184
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,394
Including what happened regarding the poster,

185
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:10,964
he's always been taking Ms. Lee's side.

186
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:13,094
I'm sure there's something going on between them.

187
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:15,364
They went to the same elementary school.

188
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,294
Could they be each other's first love?

189
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,324
Like in "Autumn in My Heart" or "Rain Shower."

190
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:24,194
I've never seen such an unattractive heroine in my life.

191
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:30,064
I've never seen such lazy employees in my life as you.

192
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,894
Cut it out and go back to work.

193
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:42,624
What was that? He usually takes the employees' side.

194
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,224
(Hyuk Kyu is wearing a suit. Something funny must happen.)

195
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,124
What's taking him so long?

196
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:55,564
Hyuk Kyu is asking around for a job.

197
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,534
Yong Ju! I'm here.

198
00:10:57,534 --> 00:11:00,564
Hyuk Kyu came to meet Yong Ju after a long time.

199
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:03,094
You can't show up at my workplace on such short notice.

200
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:05,324
I don't have so much time as you do.

201
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:08,194
Yong Ju doesn't seem happy to see Hyuk Kyu.

202
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:10,594
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,194
By the way, your office is so cool.

204
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:16,594
Of course. I went to a nice university, and I'm good at English.

205
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:18,494
I quit working at the government...

206
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,064
to come to this company.

207
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:25,494
You're right.

208
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,464
Yong Ju, have you had lunch yet?

209
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:28,694
Why don't we have lunch together?

210
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:31,624
- I have something to tell you. 
- I'm busy. Just say it now.

211
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:34,624
I see.

212
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,024
The thing is, Yong Ju,

213
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,064
can you ask around for a job for me?

214
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:46,264
- What? 
- You worked in the government,

215
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:49,064
and now, you work at a big company. You must know a lot of people.

216
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:53,994
Hey, you're as stupid as I remember you used to be.

217
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:56,024
Why would they want you?

218
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:57,864
What?

219
00:11:58,194 --> 00:11:59,764
Isn't that too harsh?

220
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:00,994
Did I say something wrong?

221
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:03,764
I have some important business to take care of.

222
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,124
I have to go.

223
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:07,624
Hey.

224
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:10,224
Mr. Lee.

225
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:13,524
I asked you to get some cigarettes for me. What are you doing here?

226
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:15,624
- Well, 
- Cigarettes?

227
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,064
I'm on my way right now.

228
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:21,594
You were so fast when Mr. Park asked you.

229
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,794
Do you look down on me because I'm from a mediocre university?

230
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:29,664
That's not true. How could I look down on you?

231
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,864
You're...

232
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,064
this much ahead of me.

233
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,994
I mean this much.

234
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,094
- Gosh. 
- No.

235
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,624
- This... 
- Yong Ju!

236
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:47,364
Yong Ju!

237
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:50,194
Help.

238
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:51,764
What should we eat?

239
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,124
I'm not sure.

240
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,564
- What about some stew? 
- That sounds good.

241
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,164
- Let's have fermented skate. 
- Fermented skate?

242
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:58,424
I don't think so.

243
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:00,824
What do you want to eat, my...

244
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,224
What do you want to eat, Ms. La?

245
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,964
I want to eat pasta.

246
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,094
Buy me pasta, Mr. Lee.

247
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,594
I was just playing along.

248
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:25,094
He's becoming weird after getting a girlfriend.

249
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,224
I know.

250
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,364
Gorae Caress Bar has started serving lunch.

251
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,924
- Why don't we try it? - Sure.

252
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,964
Ms. La, I'll have to buy you pasta some other time.

253
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:36,094
All right.

254
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:37,624
- It's only five dollars. 
- It's cheap.

255
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,324
Gosh.

256
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:41,994
Let go.

257
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:44,064
Your exam is only a few days away. How can you skip classes?

258
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,264
The teacher said I should rather go home.

259
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:50,164
What did you do to make her say that?

260
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,524
It hurts.

261
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,094
Isn't that a bit too violent?

262
00:13:57,494 --> 00:14:00,494
I know. Stop it. You'll hurt him.

263
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:01,624
My goodness.

264
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:03,094
Are you taking your nephew's side?

265
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:05,624
Is it because you'll be his aunt?

266
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:07,894
That's not it.

267
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:10,194
Please help me.

268
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:11,864
He'll kill me.

269
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,024
Soo Hwan.

270
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:15,564
- Come here, will you? 
- I won't.

271
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,394
You're a professional fighter.

272
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:19,494
A professional fighter?

273
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:21,964
Were you an athlete?

274
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:23,564
Didn't you know?

275
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:26,624
My uncle was a famous mixed martial arts fighter.

276
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,464
He even won a championship once.

277
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,324
He won a championship?

278
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:32,824
Shibasaki.

279
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:37,264
(Cho Dong Hyuk Won by Choking Shibasaki)

280
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:38,324
It's unbelievable.

281
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:39,764
He won against him?

282
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:45,164
In the UFC 2007, he won against Shibasaki,

283
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:47,864
who had a much higher rank than him.

284
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,494
I thought Shibasaki was a curse word.

285
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,864
How do you know all that?

286
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:58,894
Girls usually don't like mixed martial arts, but maybe you do.

287
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,724
I remember it because it was a match against Japan.

288
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:03,864
Fagayaro Shibasaki.

289
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:06,064
- Fagayaro? 
- I see.

290
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,624
I've never seen a mixed martial arts champion in real life.

291
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:11,964
It's an honor.

292
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:14,124
You do have extraordinary muscles.

293
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,864
Oh my. It's so hard.

294
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:18,524
Oh my goodness.

295
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:20,394
- Enjoy your food. 
- Okay.

296
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:23,994
Ms. La, don't touch Ms. Lee's boyfriend's arms.

297
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:26,464
Mr. Cho seems embarrassed.

298
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,894
Stop teasing me.

299
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:39,164
Hello, Mr. Kim.

300
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:40,994
Yes.

301
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:44,794
Anyway, Ms. Lee is so lucky.

302
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:48,594
A man in mixed martial arts is the manliest man possible.

303
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,264
On top of that, he's handsome.

304
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,124
You're right.

305
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:54,294
His bar is doing well, too.

306
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:55,724
He's reserved and earnest.

307
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:58,324
Even as a guy I can tell that he's a good catch.

308
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:00,894
This seafood soft tofu stew is just as good.

309
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,324
Good? No way.

310
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,564
It's salty.

311
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,224
No, it's perfect.

312
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,624
I eat my food bland.

313
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:10,964
This is salty. It's too salty.

314
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:14,094
- My goodness. 
- What are you doing?

315
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:15,664
Hey.

316
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:22,864
That's better.

317
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,324
Thanks to Seung Joon's jealousy,

318
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:29,764
Nakwon Printing staff had to eat extremely bland stew.

319
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,094
Yes, Sir.

320
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,664
Not at all.

321
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,864
A little. It's just a little scratch.

322
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:47,264
Yes, I can get back to work tomorrow.

323
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,124
Yes, Sir.

324
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,964
They said you have a fracture. You have to stay here.

325
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:54,624
How will you go to work?

326
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,794
Just tell him you'll take a few days off.

327
00:16:58,124 --> 00:17:00,294
What if someone replaces me? Are you going to be responsible?

328
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:02,024
A low-ranking staff like me...

329
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:05,064
is more than replaceable at a big company like that.

330
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:07,564
I'll crawl to work if I have to.

331
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,194
You used to boast about yourself all the time.

332
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,624
You really changed.

333
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,924
The world changed, so I should, too.

334
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:19,324
It doesn't matter what university you went to,

335
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:22,494
and how fast you passed the civil service exam any more.

336
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:27,424
What can a man like me do, then?

337
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,524
Here is your dinner.

338
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:31,664
Thank you.

339
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:35,734
- Give it to me. 
- That's an early dinner.

340
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:37,294
Yong Ju, let's eat dinner.

341
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,994
Forget it. How can I eat right now?

342
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:45,024
I have reports due tomorrow.

343
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:48,294
You should eat and get energy to get better.

344
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:49,364
Come on.

345
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:52,764
Jangjorim and rolled omelet?

346
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:55,194
Hospital food is pretty good.

347
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:03,924
You really won't eat it?

348
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:08,124
If you're going to throw it out, I'll eat it.

349
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:12,964
You're right. I should eat and get better as soon as I can.

350
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,124
If I can't get out of bed, someone else will take my place.

351
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:20,924
I'm going to eat.

352
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:22,594
I'll eat...

353
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:25,194
and go to work.

354
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:27,764
Bottoms up.

355
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:36,194
(You can act like you worked overtime in the winter.)

356
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:38,994
No one's there to greet me at home.

357
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,524
Do you want to go for soju?

358
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:43,894
Is your wife still at your in-laws'?

359
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:47,594
Gosh, life is so easy with my mother-in-law babysitting.

360
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:49,664
Well? How about it?

361
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:55,194
I'm not sure. I think I have to go on a date.

362
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:57,394
Young Ae.

363
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:00,194
- Do you have a minute? 
- What is it?

364
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:02,234
I need to talk to you about the night market.

365
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:04,924
Sure. Let's go.

366
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:08,364
- You guys go ahead. 
- Okay.

367
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,064
Okay.

368
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,794
What was that? Was he waiting for her to get off work?

369
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:19,864
That's what I'm saying.

370
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:21,324
Right?

371
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:23,234
Let's go home and drink soju.

372
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:26,424
I thought you had a date.

373
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,324
I said I thought I might. I never said I did.

374
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,394
My girlfriend texted me and said she's busy.

375
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:32,524
Let's go!

376
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:34,564
Okay.

377
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,594
Why is he taking it out on us?

378
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,024
I'm not sure.

379
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,524
It's not our fault she's busy.

380
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,194
I'm sick of this.

381
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:44,864
- Are you going to quit? 
- Are you crazy?

382
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,524
This should go in the fridge.

383
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:50,964
(The working mom's day never ends.)

384
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,464
Here, eat this. Here.

385
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,564
Good. Good girl.

386
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,624
All finished.

387
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:03,464
I thought you were tired from working. What are you doing?

388
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:06,424
We ran out of baby food for Hae Jin.

389
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,764
Leave it. I'll do it later.

390
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:12,164
It's okay. You were babysitting all day long.

391
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:16,164
I'm home.

392
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,494
- Are you back? 
- Yes.

393
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:18,794
- Honey, are you home? 
- Yes.

394
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:20,064
Dad.

395
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:21,794
Hae Mil, did you have fun today?

396
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:24,464
My goodness.

397
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:28,194
I told you to take Hae Mil back and forth from day care.

398
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,734
Where have you been all day?

399
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:33,594
I went to see a friend...

400
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,734
to ask him for a job.

401
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:39,264
Do you remember Yong Ju? He tutored Young Min.

402
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:40,624
Yong Ju?

403
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:43,894
Sure, the graduate from Yonsei University?

404
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,394
Yes. He's working for a big company.

405
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,794
And?

406
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:56,794
Did you ask for a favor?

407
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,094
Pardon?

408
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:00,094
Well...

409
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,264
He's in a sticky situation, too.

410
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,924
Really? Why?

411
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:06,494
Of course he is.

412
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,464
Birds of a feather flock together.

413
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:11,734
He's your friend, so of course he's not doing well.

414
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:14,294
Mom, don't be so harsh.

415
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:16,064
I agree.

416
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:18,564
Did you eat?

417
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:20,394
We just finished.

418
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:22,734
Of course he ate.

419
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:28,164
Yes. Of course I ate...

420
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,264
Hyuk Kyu doesn't dare say...

421
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:37,024
that he hasn't had a meal all day.

422
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:43,324
(Let us introduce you to Mr. Yoon's pet.)

423
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:46,064
All right, let's eat.

424
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:47,234
Gosh.

425
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,694
What about the saury stew? Is it still boiling?

426
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,364
Right.

427
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,464
- Gosh. - What? What is it?

428
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,624
Are you adding something?

429
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:02,564
Why are you putting in water? It was perfect.

430
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:03,864
Gosh.

431
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:06,664
Didn't you just see Mr. Lee at lunch?

432
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:10,864
He's in a bad mood. We should cheer him up.

433
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,024
Let's see.

434
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:18,794
It's so bland.

435
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:21,024
It's perfect.

436
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:28,494
It tastes like you did laundry with kimchi.

437
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:29,924
Gosh.

438
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,164
Young Ja, what are you doing? Are you done yet?

439
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:34,564
No.

440
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:37,724
The night market is coming up, so we have a lot to discuss.

441
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:41,094
- Should I just look at these? - Sure.

442
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:42,564
Are you still at his bar?

443
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:47,494
All right, good luck.

444
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:53,594
I thought it was going to be quick.

445
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,324
She's working, so I can't say anything.

446
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,464
This is so annoying.

447
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:00,864
I can't take it.

448
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:06,994
- Mr. Lee. 
- Mr. Lee, try the stew.

449
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,964
I made it just for you.

450
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:14,494
Here you go.

451
00:23:17,494 --> 00:23:19,794
What is this? Do you have diabetes?

452
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:21,924
This is so bland.

453
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,924
- Are you leaving? - None of your business.

454
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:35,294
I thought he liked it bland, so I made it bland.

455
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,664
Gosh.

456
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:40,664
You're right. If he wasn't going to drink with us,

457
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,224
why did he ask me to come?

458
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:44,594
Gosh.

459
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:47,564
Do you have a dip for this?

460
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:56,864
Why did I ask him to move in?

461
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,494
It's so tiring.

462
00:23:58,694 --> 00:23:59,694
You're right.

463
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:02,794
What are you doing? Get me a small saucer.

464
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:03,924
Okay.

465
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:10,024
Seriously, he should be nicer since you're doing him a favor.

466
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:11,894
That's what I mean.

467
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:15,664
I will never let anyone move in again.

468
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:19,564
Why do I have to be uncomfortable at my own home?

469
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:20,564
Hey.

470
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,894
What are you doing? You got it all over me.

471
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,494
- My goodness. 
- I'm sorry.

472
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:27,724
Gosh.

473
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:30,794
This might stain. Hurry up and wash it.

474
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:33,064
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

475
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:34,864
My goodness.

476
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:38,264
Hold on a minute.

477
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,664
You should know your place.

478
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:43,324
You always come over because your place is far.

479
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,664
These are my pants. Why are you overreacting?

480
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,864
Go. Go home.

481
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:50,294
- Just go home. 
- I should eat the stew.

482
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,594
I don't have any for you.

483
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:53,494
I'll give it to a dog. Go.

484
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:57,594
Then everything else is good to go...

485
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,924
as long as I add a talent show in the list, right?

486
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:01,424
Yes.

487
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,294
I'm sorry I called you so suddenly.

488
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:06,594
It's okay. People change things the day before all the time.

489
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:08,364
Young Ja.

490
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:12,664
Mr. Lee. Why are you here?

491
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,724
Why do you think? I came to drive you home.

492
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,594
You didn't have to.

493
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,224
Of course I should.

494
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,064
I should take care of my girlfriend.

495
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:26,624
Young Ja, are you tired? Drink this.

496
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:32,564
Give it to me.

497
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:44,624
That was easy for you because I already did all the work.

498
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:47,794
- Let's go, Young Ja. - Okay.

499
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:54,164
Young Ja, shall we stop by the diner for a bowl of udon?

500
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:56,124
You know the diner we go to all the time.

501
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:57,394
Shall we?

502
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,864
See you around.

503
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:06,164
See you.

504
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:10,294
Let's go!

505
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,294
What was that about? What's with him?

506
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:20,694
(What time is it now?)

507
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:24,424
(It's about time I get very hungry!)

508
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,294
I should've just had dinner earlier.

509
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:29,424
I can't sleep because I'm too hungry.

510
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:32,724
Is there anything I can eat?

511
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,664
It's braised ribs.

512
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:37,924
They must've had braised ribs for dinner.

513
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:40,994
Wait a second.

514
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:45,724
Young Ae likes this style of braised ribs with radish.

515
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:50,024
Mother might get mad at me if I eat this.

516
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:52,394
I shouldn't touch this.

517
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:54,324
Is there anything else I can eat?

518
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:00,794
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

519
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:03,724
You woke up.

520
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:06,464
I'm hungry, so I'm cooking up some food for myself.

521
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:10,594
Gosh, just eat whatever we have. Why are you cooking at this hour?

522
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,724
It looked like you're saving the braised ribs for Young Ae,

523
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,394
so I'm just using the leftover vegetables in the refrigerator...

524
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:19,094
to make some fried rice for myself.

525
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:20,624
Leftover vegetables?

526
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:24,364
You're making fried rice with these vegetables?

527
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:26,294
They're for Hae Jin's food.

528
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:28,794
Sorry? Well...

529
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,294
These are ingredients for Hae Jin's food?

530
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:33,394
Yes.

531
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:35,764
You should've just had the braised ribs.

532
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:38,294
Why are you using the ingredients for your baby's food?

533
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:41,424
Young Chae spent so much time to chop all those vegetables.

534
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,224
You get nothing right.

535
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:50,494
Are you ignoring me right now?

536
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:54,624
I'm sorry. I didn't want to burn the rice.

537
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:56,924
You annoy me so much.

538
00:27:57,394 --> 00:28:00,064
You're worried about burning your fried rice,

539
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,794
yet you're not worried about making my blood boil.

540
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:06,794
Do you study how to make me angry or what?

541
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,364
Why do you have to be like this, seriously?

542
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:15,764
Hyuk Kyu is hungry, uncomfortable, and sad.

543
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:32,394
Hyuk Kyu, what are you doing here?

544
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:34,864
Aren't you cold?

545
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:37,764
I'm not cold at all.

546
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:39,924
Our place feels a lot colder.

547
00:28:40,724 --> 00:28:43,064
It feels as cold as Siberia in there.

548
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,524
What's wrong? Did something happen at home?

549
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,094
The same thing as always.

550
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:53,994
I feel so incompetent and uncomfortable because I'm jobless.

551
00:28:58,224 --> 00:28:59,324
Cheer up.

552
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:01,924
You'll be able to find a job soon.

553
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:05,964
Can you...

554
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:08,024
get me a job?

555
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:09,794
What?

556
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:12,794
Let me work with you.

557
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,694
You saw how good I am in sales when we were in Jeju Island.

558
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,424
I also got you a project this morning.

559
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,064
But...

560
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:22,494
I can't help you right now because my situation isn't ideal.

561
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,324
My situation is a lot worse. I really cannot stay at home.

562
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:28,524
Just give me something to do. I'll work very hard.

563
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:31,924
Just pay me whatever you can. Please?

564
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:34,764
I'm sorry, Hyuk Kyu.

565
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,694
I'll keep my eyes open for a good position for you.

566
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:41,124
I'm going in.

567
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:42,764
Young Ae, Young Ae!

568
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:47,524
I practically begged her.

569
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:50,094
Have some mercy, seriously.

570
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:56,524
- Really? 
- Yes, I'm serious.

571
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:57,964
(A few days later)

572
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:02,124
Why do I have to work at the market on my precious weekend?

573
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:03,524
That's what I'm saying.

574
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:07,664
Isn't Mr. Cho going overboard to win the organizers over?

575
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:10,624
Yet it's always us who do all the work.

576
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:13,764
Hey, you opened a booth there.

577
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:15,394
You have to be there anyway.

578
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:17,124
Stop whining already.

579
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:21,294
By the way, why isn't Young Ae here yet?

580
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,394
She went to the market early in the morning...

581
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,124
Mr. Yoon. That's what you told me earlier, right?

582
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,024
Pardon me?

583
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:30,994
I said that?

584
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:34,124
Yes! Are you becoming senile already or what?

585
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:38,624
I must say, Young Ae looks like a newly-enlisted soldier these days.

586
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,594
She has been working so hard lately.

587
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:44,024
You haven't served in the army. What do you know about being a soldier?

588
00:30:44,524 --> 00:30:47,024
I don't have to taste night soil to differentiate it from doenjang.

589
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:50,224
You totally sound like a Korean. It's giving me goose bumps.

590
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:54,624
Oh, hello.

591
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:56,624
- Hello. - Mr. Cho.

592
00:30:57,424 --> 00:31:00,324
Why are you dressed in a suit?

593
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,064
You look dashing.

594
00:31:03,924 --> 00:31:07,194
There will be high-up officials including the chief of the borough.

595
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,464
I have to look presentable, you know.

596
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:11,624
Hence, I thought I should dress up.

597
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:15,124
Oh, my. It looks like you also got your car cleaned.

598
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:18,294
- It looks like a new car. 
- Hey! Hands off!

599
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,724
I spent 60 dollars to get it hand-washed.

600
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:22,494
I even got it polished.

601
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:24,764
How dare you try to touch it with your grimy hands.

602
00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:27,064
I'm sorry.

603
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,764
I'll meet you guys there.

604
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:31,794
Don't be late.

605
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:33,224
- Okay. - Okay.

606
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,064
Goodness gracious.

607
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:44,724
My hands are clean. That was so mean.

608
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:47,064
Your hands are grimy.

609
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:49,064
Look at your dirty nails.

610
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,164
- Whatever. - Open the door.

611
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:02,594
(They designed this banner.)

612
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:05,224
I must say, the character is so cute.

613
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,264
Young Ae did a great job.

614
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:08,894
Yes, it looks great.

615
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,594
Why do you keep taking photos of Food Monster?

616
00:32:14,524 --> 00:32:15,564
Just because.

617
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:20,124
He wants to record everything about Young Ae's first character.

618
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:25,724
Hey, shouldn't you be offering help even if you don't mean it?

619
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:27,464
I'm sorry.

620
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:28,964
My hands are tied.

621
00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:35,864
It looks like Ms. Lee met up with Mr. Cho using work as an excuse.

622
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,264
They're actually on a date now.

623
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:42,394
Next to Mr. Cho who is a big guy,

624
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:45,464
Young Ae looks dainty and delicate like Kang Susie.

625
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:47,064
She won the lottery.

626
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:48,864
Meeting a guy like Mr. Cho, that is.

627
00:32:48,864 --> 00:32:50,864
Mr. Cho, enough with your corny jokes.

628
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:55,424
But this one was actually funny.

629
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:58,164
- Yes. - I know, right?

630
00:32:58,164 --> 00:32:59,564
She won the lottery.

631
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:02,394
- You made it. 
- Yes.

632
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:04,194
You two are working so hard.

633
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:07,594
Young Ae, the leaflets are here. Take a look.

634
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,664
- Oh, sure. 
- Nice.

635
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:09,924
- They're finally printed. - Oh, my.

636
00:33:10,194 --> 00:33:11,194
- Let me see. 
- Here.

637
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:18,794
The leaflet looks amazing, too.

638
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:20,764
Really? Is the design okay?

639
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,424
Not really. It's not okay.

640
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:25,624
What's wrong? Is there an error?

641
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:29,294
The talent show segment is missing in the event details.

642
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:30,724
- What? - Seriously?

643
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:32,464
You're right.

644
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:34,524
What happened?

645
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:36,694
I gave you the revised design.

646
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:39,764
I guess I printed the first design. I'm sorry.

647
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:43,794
- You forgot because of your booth. 
- Gosh, seriously.

648
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:45,494
Sazal, you're useless!

649
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,764
I'm sorry.

650
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,324
No, it's okay. I should've double-checked.

651
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,864
- I should go design a sticker... 
- No, it's okay.

652
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:57,394
We already posted a notice on the website...

653
00:33:57,564 --> 00:34:00,794
and received applications from the merchants, so it'll be fine.

654
00:34:01,724 --> 00:34:04,994
But still, if the talent show is missing on this leaflet,

655
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:06,864
people who just come here won't know about it.

656
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,394
They'll gather when they hear it going on.

657
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,394
Don't worry and just get other things done.

658
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:15,164
I'll go tell people at the association.

659
00:34:19,134 --> 00:34:21,994
I'll go with him and apologize to them.

660
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,164
All right. Go on.

661
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,634
Mr. Cho is so sweet.

662
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:31,564
I thought he was going to get mad at her, but he comforted her instead.

663
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:33,164
I know.

664
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:36,764
"Don't worry and just get other things done."

665
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:38,664
He's such a heartthrob.

666
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:42,024
- Don't do that, please. 
- What is this?

667
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:47,064
- Let's go. 
- Where is this supposed to go?

668
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:04,394
Hello, Sir. Thank you for coming.

669
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:06,264
Hello, Mr. Cho.

670
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:08,264
Mr. Lee, what are you doing? Say hello.

671
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:09,764
- Your business must be going well. 
- Yes.

672
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,224
- Thank you for coming. 
- Hello.

673
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,264
There are many delicious snacks inside. Please check them out.

674
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,464
There is a photo zone over there. Don't forget to take a picture.

675
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:23,024
There's a talent show taking place at 7pm. Please participate.

676
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:24,764
Please feel free to browse around.

677
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:27,264
Come try our traditional cookies. They're delicious.

678
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,994
Where is Sazal's booth? What's he selling?

679
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,324
I didn't ask.

680
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,524
He'll probably sell Korean food, right?

681
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,634
I'm curious.

682
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:40,894
Try tasty Indian curry.

683
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:43,464
Have some tasty Indian curry.

684
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:46,094
Sir, ma'am, try it.

685
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:49,024
Try some tasty Indian curry.

686
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,294
Mr. Yoon and Mr. Jeong.

687
00:35:52,594 --> 00:35:54,964
Is this your booth?

688
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:59,694
You're not from India. You're from Bangladesh.

689
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:01,994
We eat curry in Bangladesh, too.

690
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:04,224
You've never made it for us.

691
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:06,134
Do you even know how to make it?

692
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:11,224
Hey.

693
00:36:13,524 --> 00:36:15,164
What's the big deal?

694
00:36:15,324 --> 00:36:18,634
These days, instant curry tastes quite all right.

695
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:23,924
Try some tasty Indian curry.

696
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:25,094
Gosh.

697
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:27,324
There you are. I've been looking for you.

698
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:30,364
I thought you were with Mr. Cho.

699
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:33,594
He can't stop flattering people.

700
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:34,894
I had to leave him.

701
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:36,364
Aren't you hungry? Let's get something to eat.

702
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:39,864
Try some traditional Indian curry.

703
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:43,164
Are you selling curry? What happened to your pronunciation?

704
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:46,024
- Wait. 
- We shouldn't eat it.

705
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:50,564
We could have had Sazal's food.

706
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,164
Something smells so good.

707
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,594
I think it's the skewers.

708
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:02,264
It must taste great. There are so many people.

709
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:04,264
It looks so tasty. Let's have it.

710
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:06,794
That's Mr. Cho.

711
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:11,194
That was why there were so many female customers.

712
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,264
He's so good-looking.

713
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:16,964
Look at that.

714
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:26,634
It's not the skewers that are burning.

715
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:29,424
It's the ladies' hearts.

716
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:32,794
Shouldn't Ms. Lee drive them away?

717
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:36,794
Why is he selling skewers?

718
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:41,634
Is it because Ms. Lee loves skewers?

719
00:37:42,224 --> 00:37:45,194
Maybe. Are they really going out?

720
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,964
I smell something fishy between those two.

721
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:52,364
It's not from those two.

722
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:53,994
Your mouth stinks.

723
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,464
Keep your mouth shut. Stop talking.

724
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:01,694
What is he talking about?

725
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,094
Does it smell bad?

726
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:08,724
Are you not brushing your teeth with your wife away?

727
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:10,764
Gosh, that almost killed me.

728
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:20,294
Take a picture with Food Monsters.

729
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:23,064
(Work like there's no tomorrow.)

730
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:25,664
Please attend our talent show, too.

731
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:26,964
Okay.

732
00:38:29,494 --> 00:38:30,764
The pictures turned out great.

733
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:33,864
My chin hurts a bit, though.

734
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,224
Her chin hurts?

735
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:47,364
It feels okay.

736
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:52,894
What's wrong?

737
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:55,364
What are you doing?

738
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:58,364
It's nothing.

739
00:39:00,494 --> 00:39:01,864
Wait, Dong Hyuk.

740
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:04,994
What?

741
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:09,224
Help me. My face got stuck.

742
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:10,794
Really?

743
00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:13,464
Let me see.

744
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:17,464
Take it easy.

745
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:20,864
Try not to damage the print.

746
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:22,794
We could just cut it.

747
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:24,724
- No, we can't. 
- Fine.

748
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:31,264
We need to say hi to those in high positions.

749
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:33,524
Why do you keep disappearing?

750
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:35,494
You're doing fine without me.

751
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:36,864
(They're dressed like people from the countryside.)

752
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:39,264
Wait.

753
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:41,224
What's going on?

754
00:39:41,794 --> 00:39:44,194
Mr. Lee, look at that.

755
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:46,424
Why? Did you spot someone important?

756
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:50,724
What are those two doing?

757
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:52,424
Oh my.

758
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:54,724
They look so sweet.

759
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:59,094
To me, it just looks like he's trying to get her face out.

760
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,224
- Sorry? - We should help.

761
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:04,794
Leave them alone. Let them have some fun.

762
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:09,864
Gosh.

763
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:11,494
- Hey. 
- What?

764
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,664
Can't you make your face smaller?

765
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:17,024
How could I make my face smaller so suddenly?

766
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:24,364
That hurt.

767
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,724
It worked.

768
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:32,024
Oh my.

769
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,364
It's "Love and the Night Market."

770
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:41,964
Mr. Lee, did you get what I said?

771
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:46,224
You've heard of the drama, "Love and Ambitions," right?

772
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:49,064
It's a parody of that.

773
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:51,364
"Love and the Night Market."

774
00:40:52,724 --> 00:40:54,364
Do you understand now?

775
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:58,634
Where did he go now?

776
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:01,224
Gosh, that brat.

777
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:04,024
Gosh.

778
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:07,024
Why does Mr. Cho keep linger around Young Ja?

779
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:09,264
I wish I could stop him.

780
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:11,364
(It's hard to stay reasonable when you're in love.)

781
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:13,964
Hey, did you see that man who's selling skewers?

782
00:41:14,494 --> 00:41:16,524
His arms are so big.

783
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:17,894
- Where is he? - Over there.

784
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:19,664
He's so good-looking.

785
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:21,194
- Let's take a closer look. 
- Okay.

786
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:22,294
It's not tasty.

787
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:23,494
- Sorry? 
- Sorry?

788
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,524
His skewers are way too salty.

789
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:29,764
Try Indian curry instead. Don't eat his skewers.

790
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:32,964
- Let's go. 
- Don't have the skewers.

791
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:35,611
What are you doing?

792
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:37,951
Why do you spread a false rumor?

793
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,381
I didn't.

794
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:41,881
I said it because it is salty.

795
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,681
You haven't even tried it.

796
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,351
I can tell just by looking at it.

797
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,011
Do you have something against me?

798
00:41:47,981 --> 00:41:50,881
Why would I?

799
00:41:51,281 --> 00:41:55,151
I know you're trying to make me look like a petty person.

800
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:58,321
Your skewers do look salty.

801
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:00,711
He's blinded by jealous.

802
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:02,151
That was so salty.

803
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:03,911
Those skewers are so salty.

804
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:06,711
Seung Joon has become too childish.

805
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:08,951
What can you do if I have something against you?

806
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:11,611
Gosh.

807
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:13,381
What's going on?

808
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:15,151
They're participating in the talent show...

809
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:16,751
to win 50 dollars from Ms. Lee.

810
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:18,351
What do you mean?

811
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:22,351
She left out the information about the talent show in the leaflets.

812
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:24,951
She probably felt bad that not many signed up.

813
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,481
Ms. La, it's our turn soon.

814
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:33,051
I live near here. I hope no one will recognize me.

815
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:35,481
Let's go. Let's get ready.

816
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:36,481
Oh my.

817
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:41,451
I'm impressed by Ms. Lee. She's spending her own money.

818
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,711
Where is she?

819
00:42:44,611 --> 00:42:45,681
Where is she?

820
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,111
Ma'am, go next.

821
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:50,311
I don't want to do it.

822
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:53,811
Everyone seems to know that you love to have fun.

823
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:56,481
Please do it for the sake of the night market.

824
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:57,951
I don't think I can do this.

825
00:42:58,051 --> 00:42:59,551
You can do it just like that.

826
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:07,751
(A fantastic collaborative performance)

827
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:09,051
(Night Market Talent Show)

828
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,681
What are they doing?

829
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:45,051
They're humiliating our company.

830
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:47,411
Can't you stop the music?

831
00:43:54,151 --> 00:43:55,251
Why?

832
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:58,781
Those important guests seem to be loving it.

833
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:00,481
Is that right?

834
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,711
Should I have signed up, too?

835
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:07,651
No.

836
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:10,211
That would have really humiliated our company.

837
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:12,551
What did you just say?

838
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:21,051
Encore!

839
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,011
Really? Okay.

840
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:24,651
Ms. Lee, I'm sorry.

841
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:26,581
- I don't think I can do it. 
- Pardon?

842
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:28,151
I have a huge group coming in.

843
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:31,051
Wait, it's your turn now.

844
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:33,051
I'm sorry. I have to go.

845
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:34,881
Wait! Ma'am!

846
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:41,911
What do I do? My goodness.

847
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:44,581
Our next contestant, please come up.

848
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:47,281
- What's taking them so long? - Next up, she's from Aunty Jokbal.

849
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,011
Aunty Jokbal, are you here?

850
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:57,311
(You can always trust in Young Ae.)

851
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:58,311
What is this?

852
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:02,881
Why does the owner of Aunty Jokbal look like Ms. Lee?

853
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:07,011
No, she doesn't look like Ms. Lee. That is Ms. Lee.

854
00:45:07,311 --> 00:45:08,311
What?

855
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,681
You're right, it's Ms. Lee.

856
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:15,851
She was looking for participants, so she went up there herself?

857
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:23,211
Young Ae is working hard to pay back for her mistake.

858
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,381
Young Ae is so good. The crowd is loving her.

859
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:29,911
Those VIPs at the front are all laughing.

860
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:32,081
Really?

861
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:35,381
What is this? She told us to go on stage,

862
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:37,311
then she goes after us?

863
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:41,011
Who cares. All we need is the money.

864
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:45,651
I've never seen anyone look so good...

865
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,151
with pig's feet in her hands.

866
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:51,481
Why does she have her stomach out like that?

867
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:57,351
Ms. Lee, put that belly fat away!

868
00:45:58,311 --> 00:45:59,681
They look like her own hands.

869
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:02,611
They're a part of her.

870
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,681
What's wrong with him? Why is he smiling at Young Ja?

871
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,481
She used to be so shameless during childhood. She's still the same.

872
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:31,781
- Go, Aunty Jokbal. 
- Go, Aunty Jokbal.

873
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:35,611
Thank you for such a passionate stage.

874
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,381
Please give her a round of applause.

875
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:40,851
Next up, we'd like to invite Mr. Shin over...

876
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,081
- Are you here? 
- Hey.

877
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,111
Yes?

878
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,181
Your armpits are ripped.

879
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:46,981
What?

880
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:52,981
It's okay. It's hardly visible.

881
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:58,181
Right, can I borrow your truck to move Food Monsters later?

882
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,481
What?

883
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:03,551
That punk.

884
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:09,281
All right. For the success of the night market.

885
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:12,251
- Cheers! 
- Cheers!

886
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:13,451
- All right. 
- Okay.

887
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:19,781
Gosh.

888
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:24,481
Curry doesn't go well...

889
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:26,181
with rice wine at all.

890
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:30,311
It's what Sazal had left over from his stand.

891
00:47:31,111 --> 00:47:32,381
It's so watery.

892
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:34,981
It's disgusting.

893
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:36,751
I know that.

894
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:38,911
There's no need to tell me again.

895
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:41,911
- Gosh. 
- My goodness.

896
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:44,311
You must have worked hard to prepare the night market.

897
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:47,211
We didn't do much.

898
00:47:47,481 --> 00:47:49,251
We just did what we ought to.

899
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:53,811
Especially Ms. Lee. Great job.

900
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,751
Not at all.

901
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:58,211
Thank you for trusting us.

902
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:00,281
The ward official seems very pleased with you.

903
00:48:00,451 --> 00:48:01,811
He was complimenting your work.

904
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,311
Please keep up the good work.

905
00:48:05,011 --> 00:48:07,081
- Of course. 
- All right, then. Good night.

906
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:08,281
- Enjoy. 
- Thank you.

907
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:10,311
- Bye. 
- Bye.

908
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:16,111
Ms. Lee, you should treat us.

909
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:20,111
Shopping District Association and the ward office all like you.

910
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:21,781
You're right.

911
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:25,181
After this is over, Lee Young Ae Design...

912
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:26,981
might take over all the work.

913
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,751
That won't happen.

914
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:31,951
Ms. Lee. Didn't you say that you got rid of...

915
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:34,581
your Seoul office when you moved to Jeju Island?

916
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,651
Pardon? Yes.

917
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:38,951
Do you have to find a new office?

918
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:41,381
Office rentals are expensive these days.

919
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:44,551
I looked into some, but they were all expensive.

920
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:49,351
What do you think about sharing office spaces, then?

921
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:52,811
Pardon? The Nakwon Printing office?

922
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:54,111
Yes.

923
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:57,651
We have to keep working together on the night market.

924
00:48:58,081 --> 00:48:59,951
It'd be good to work in the same space.

925
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,281
Really?

926
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:08,981
I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

927
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,211
What's there to think about?

928
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:15,081
Yes, Dong Hyuk. What?

929
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:18,681
I can't hear you. I'll call you back.

930
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:24,681
She wants to talk to her boyfriend...

931
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,381
in secrecy.

932
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:31,311
Are they really dating?

933
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:32,751
I think so.

934
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:37,181
I saw his eyes fixed on Ms. Lee during the talent show.

935
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:39,581
He has such strange taste.

936
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:42,151
Here's another person with weird taste.

937
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:47,311
Ms. Lee, isn't acorn jelly weird with curry?

938
00:49:47,811 --> 00:49:49,981
No. They taste good together.

939
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:51,181
Do you want to try it?

940
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:53,411
That's disgusting.

941
00:49:53,751 --> 00:49:57,481
- Sazal, you should've made jelly. 
- Eat slowly.

942
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,611
Really? How long do you want me to wait?

943
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:04,151
Wait for what?

944
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:05,411
What's wrong?

945
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:08,651
The job is done. Why are you asking her to wait?

946
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:12,025
I can't bear to see you with Young Ja any more.

947
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:13,495
You better be careful.

948
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:17,665
What's wrong with him?

949
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,565
Mr. Lee, what are you doing?

950
00:50:23,795 --> 00:50:26,595
- What did Dong Hyuk do? - Dong Hyuk this, Dong Hyuk that!

951
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:29,365
I thought you guys weren't close. Why do you keep saying his name?

952
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:32,225
You still call me Mr. Lee when we've dated for a year.

953
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,565
That's because I met you as my boss.

954
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:40,025
Are you jealous?

955
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:41,765
Yes, I am! What are you going to do?

956
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:44,525
How can I not be jealous?

957
00:50:44,995 --> 00:50:47,525
People keep saying that you two look good together.

958
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:50,195
I keep seeing you and him together because of the night market.

959
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,695
How can I just walk around laughing?

960
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:57,425
We have to work together, that's why.

961
00:50:57,425 --> 00:50:59,265
Then why did he whisper into your ear?

962
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:00,925
Whisper?

963
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:03,625
Right after the talent show!

964
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:05,165
I saw everything.

965
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:08,095
I saw him talk into your ear.

966
00:51:10,295 --> 00:51:11,725
That's...

967
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:16,795
See, see, see? You can't say anything because there's something.

968
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:20,595
There isn't anything.

969
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:24,895
He told me my armpits ripped while I was dancing.

970
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:26,365
Here! Look! Happy?

971
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:33,725
Gosh. I didn't want to tell you because I was embarrassed.

972
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:37,695
Then why did he ask you to wait?

973
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:42,925
That's... I asked him to move Food Monsters with his truck.

974
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:44,495
I need to edit something on it.

975
00:51:47,995 --> 00:51:51,165
Then why did you ask him and not me? I can move it for you.

976
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,865
- How can you carry this? 
- I can do it.

977
00:51:57,425 --> 00:51:59,795
Like this. See?

978
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:04,295
- What are you doing? Put it down. - Let me carry it to the office.

979
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:06,965
You don't think I can do it? I'll show you I'm capable.

980
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:08,095
Don't try to stop me.

981
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:10,325
Seriously.

982
00:52:19,895 --> 00:52:21,225
What was that, Young Ja?

983
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:26,895
You're so cute, Mr. Lee.

984
00:52:30,895 --> 00:52:34,095
I only have you, so please don't worry.

985
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:36,725
Okay?

986
00:52:43,965 --> 00:52:45,065
Okay, I understand.

987
00:52:57,495 --> 00:52:59,325
She's shameless to no end.

988
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:05,425
Just throw out that curry.

989
00:53:05,695 --> 00:53:08,395
I'll get going, then. My boyfriend is picking me up.

990
00:53:09,095 --> 00:53:10,195
Bye.

991
00:53:10,195 --> 00:53:11,195
- Bye. 
- Bye.

992
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:15,295
Gosh, my kids have to go to school early tomorrow.

993
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:18,265
Do you want to give this curry to your kids tomorrow?

994
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:21,795
No, thanks. That curry isn't even good. I don't want it!

995
00:53:21,925 --> 00:53:24,195
- Bye, everyone. 
- Take a little bit at least.

996
00:53:24,195 --> 00:53:25,225
- Bye, Ms. La. - Good night.

997
00:53:25,765 --> 00:53:28,865
Well, I called a designated driver.

998
00:53:29,065 --> 00:53:30,725
- You guys should get going. 
- Okay.

999
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:32,965
All of you better come to work on time tomorrow!

1000
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,225
- Of course. 
- Good night.

1001
00:53:35,365 --> 00:53:36,365
Get home safely.

1002
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,595
Can he let us come in a little late tomorrow?

1003
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:42,865
Cho Deok Jae, that piece of...

1004
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:44,425
Darn it!

1005
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:48,095
What's wrong, Mr. Cho?

1006
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,425
Who did this?

1007
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:51,995
Who did this to my car?

1008
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:55,325
- Pardon? What happened? 
- What's going on?

1009
00:53:55,395 --> 00:53:57,625
- My gosh! 
- Oh, no. This is...

1010
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,765
Gosh, it looks like someone bumped your car from behind.

1011
00:54:00,765 --> 00:54:01,825
Mr. Cho.

1012
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,595
Did the driver leave a note anywhere?

1013
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:04,625
No!

1014
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:07,325
This is certainly a hit-and-run case.

1015
00:54:07,765 --> 00:54:10,625
Who did this? What kind of jerk did this to my car?

1016
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,495
Mr. Cho, is there a black box in your car?

1017
00:54:15,025 --> 00:54:16,025
That's right!

1018
00:54:16,325 --> 00:54:20,425
It must've recorded everything that happened here.

1019
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:21,425
Exactly.

1020
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:23,995
I didn't buy it to save money.

1021
00:54:24,665 --> 00:54:25,695
Darn it!

1022
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:28,695
If he had a black box,

1023
00:54:28,695 --> 00:54:31,065
it would've recorded us kissing here earlier.

1024
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:32,925
I know. We would've been caught.

1025
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:35,365
Wait a second.

1026
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:38,195
Mr. Cho's truck is right there.

1027
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:42,825
The black box in his car must show this area.

1028
00:54:44,725 --> 00:54:45,925
- You're right! 
- Yes.

1029
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:47,595
What should we do?

1030
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:49,365
I don't know. This is crazy.

1031
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:50,565
Mr. Cho.

1032
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:54,525
Show us your black box footage.

1033
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:56,295
Pardon me?

1034
00:54:57,425 --> 00:54:58,425
What for?

1035
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:02,095
A prick hit my car from behind and ran away.

1036
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:04,595
The whole thing must've been recorded in your black box footage.

1037
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:07,325
What are you talking about?

1038
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:10,495
There's no black box in his car. Aren't I right, Mr. Cho?

1039
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:12,265
What are you saying?

1040
00:55:13,295 --> 00:55:16,795
That thing with the blinking light. That's your black box, right?

1041
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:20,465
Gosh, he is saying that he doesn't have one.

1042
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:22,565
- Let go. What's your problem? 
- I'm just...

1043
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,065
- My gosh! 
- Oh, no.

1044
00:55:24,465 --> 00:55:26,765
- Gosh! 
- Are you okay, Mr. Cho?

1045
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:29,225
What was that about? Goodness gracious.

1046
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:31,925
I almost broke my back because of you, Ms. Lee!

1047
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,295
Why are you trying to stop me?

1048
00:55:33,665 --> 00:55:36,095
He's saying he doesn't have a black box, but you're not listening.

1049
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:37,625
He has it! Stop being so annoying.

1050
00:55:38,665 --> 00:55:41,195
Mr. Cho, show me your black box footage.

1051
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:45,025
- Mr. Cho, please be careful. - I don't have a black box.

1052
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:46,595
What?

1053
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:48,565
What are you talking about?

1054
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,665
There's a holder for it right here.

1055
00:55:54,165 --> 00:55:56,225
I used to have it, but I got rid of it recently.

1056
00:55:56,995 --> 00:55:58,065
I don't have one now.

1057
00:55:58,365 --> 00:56:01,795
That can't be. I saw a light blinking earlier.

1058
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:05,925
Hold on a second.

1059
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:09,165
Did you do it, Mr. Cho?

1060
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:11,025
Is that why you got rid of it?

1061
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:13,895
That's probably why Ms. Lee tried to stop me.

1062
00:56:14,465 --> 00:56:16,565
Mr. Yoon and Mr. Jeong. Go find it.

1063
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:17,695
- Okay. - Okay.

1064
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:19,695
- Search the truck. - Okay.

1065
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:42,995
Where did you hide it? Where is your black box?

1066
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:50,795
What? You're not holding it.

1067
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:53,525
Where on earth did you hide it?

1068
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:01,925
Thank you.

1069
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:05,925
Where is it?

1070
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:13,695
Young Ja, thanks for all of your hard work today.

1071
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:15,665
- It was my pleasure. 
- Good night.

1072
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,425
Let's go for a meal with Mr. Cho next time.

1073
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:20,525
I'll buy the most expensive black box for him.

1074
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:21,865
What?

1075
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:24,825
You had steam coming out of your head because you were so jealous.

1076
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:28,595
Well, that was just because of a misunderstanding.

1077
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:31,325
I actually think he's a great guy.

1078
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:35,065
- Get home safely. - Thanks.

1079
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:37,595
Oh, Young Ja. You forgot this.

1080
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:40,695
See you!

1081
00:57:41,995 --> 00:57:42,995
My goodness.

1082
00:57:56,095 --> 00:58:00,095
There have been many ups and downs in Young Ae's life,

1083
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:03,925
but she now wants to be successful in both work and love.

1084
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:08,365
The greedy Young Ae's love story will be continued...

1085
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:22,095
Will it be continued?

1086
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,225
Rude Miss Young Ae's risky love story...

1087
00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:28,295
will be continued in the next episode.

1088
00:58:47,365 --> 00:58:49,095
(Rude Miss Young Ae)

1089
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:53,495
So Mr. Lee Seung Joon was the creditor?

1090
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:58,065
You're turning 40 soon. How can you date secretly?

1091
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:00,625
You must be looking for a place to live together.

1092
00:59:01,265 --> 00:59:03,725
It looks like your boyfriend wants to get married.

1093
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:07,265
Have coffee with me.

1094
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:10,795
Promise me

1095
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:13,565
It looks like you're seeing someone seriously. Why didn't you tell me?

1096
00:59:14,025 --> 00:59:15,025
We broke up.

1097
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:16,925
I wanted to marry her,

1098
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:19,465
but she didn't feel the same way.

1099
00:59:19,825 --> 00:59:21,065
- Gosh, seriously. 
- My goodness!

1100
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,725
Mom.
