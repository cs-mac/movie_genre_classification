1
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:25,779
Nixon? Yes.

2
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,780
You remember?

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,446
Of course I remember.

4
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:32,113
That's funny how many people forget.

5
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:34,879
It wasn't so long ago.

6
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,745
Ten years.

7
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:42,645
What was happening in
Wetherby ten years ago?

8
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,013
He was a distinguished
member of my own profession.

9
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:52,345
- What, liar?
- No, not liar. Solicitor.

10
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:55,947
Well, lawyer. He trained as a lawyer.

11
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:58,345
Liar or lawyer.

12
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,146
Is there a difference?

13
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:05,212
I wonder, have we got
time for another drink?

14
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:10,611
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if Nixon walked in now?

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,644
Right now!

16
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:19,312
You just can't help it.
It would cheer everybody up.

17
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:24,412
Oh, I can't go on.
Oh, Stanley.

18
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,713
Oh, we've lived in this
town for too long.

19
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,512
Aye.

20
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,780
Time, gentlemen, please.

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,446
I'll tell you the best
thing about Nixon.

22
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:43,779
Shouldn't you be getting
back to school?

23
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,113
No. No, listen.

24
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:48,512
I'll tell you the one story
about Nixon. All right?

25
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:51,947
When he first met pat,
she didn't like him very much.

26
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:55,846
So, after a bit, she said she
didn't want to see him anymore.

27
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:58,679
"well," he said,
"it breaks my heart, pat.

28
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,846
I'll only stop seeing you on one
condition." "what's that?" she said.

29
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,213
"that I can always be the chauffeur".

30
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:07,946
When she went out with men, say,
to the cinema, he'd drive them.

31
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:10,646
He'd drive them all the
way to the cinema.

32
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:14,445
They'd go in, her and her date,
and he'd wait outside.

33
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:18,046
He'd wait outside
during the whole film.

34
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:23,913
With a packet of popcorn
or a piece of chewing gum.

35
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:27,945
And then they'd come out,
and he'd drive them home.

36
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,912
I ask you, what does that
tell you about Nixon?

37
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:41,845
Jean, I ask you, what does
that tell you about pat?

38
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,612
If you want to be loved in life,

39
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:05,513
There's no use in having opinions.

40
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,213
I think you're right.

41
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:10,379
People who get loved are easy.
Easy to get along with.

42
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,113
Jean.

43
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:16,012
Have we lost the corkscrew?
I can't do the bloody thing!

44
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:21,946
There's a new girl
at work, at the library.

45
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:25,512
The sort of girl men fall for.
Vacant.

46
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:27,113
Cool?

47
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,279
Yeah, distant.
That's right.

48
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,779
She doesn't really
have a personality.

49
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,278
She just has a way
of suggesting to men

50
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,013
That she'll be whatever
they want her to be.

51
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,446
Not a person.
Not a real person.

52
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,813
What's she done, this girl?
Well, I'll tell you...

53
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:45,712
Just being this thing you object to,
or has she done anything wrong?

54
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:47,147
She exists.
She's young?

55
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,147
Yes, if you like.
She's young. So w...

56
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,046
It's an offense.

57
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:54,579
But there's no her!
There's nothing which is her!

58
00:03:56,446 --> 00:04:00,879
I look at the young,
truly, and I'm mystified.

59
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,846
They want nothing. They need nothing.
They have no ambition.

60
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,445
Get married, have children,
get a mortgage.

61
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:13,146
A hundred thousand years
of human evolution.

62
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,113
Brontosaurus, tyrannosaurus, man.

63
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,546
And the sum ambition?

64
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:23,779
Two up, two down in the
west riding of Yorkshire

65
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,546
On a custom-built
estate of brick and glass.

66
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:29,612
That's not right. Is it?

67
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,512
Well, can anyone tell me?

68
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:37,278
She's young. That's all
you're saying. She's young.

69
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,479
I think it's fixed.
Thank you.

70
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,779
A slate fell off in the
middle of the night.

71
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,512
I was frightened to go up.
It's all right.

72
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,945
Shall we go down?

73
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,178
I knew you'd say that.
I knew you would.

74
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,812
Lethal.

75
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:18,179
It wasn't Heath Phelps.

76
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,013
It was!
No, no, no.

77
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:23,179
It was. Don't you remember
the size of the hailstones?

78
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,746
There weren't any hailstones, Stanley.
Don't be ridiculous.

79
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:30,945
Yes, it was! It was pissing
with rain! Ah, coffee.

80
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,679
Whether our faces show.
This is the question.

81
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,513
We read a face.
We look into a face.

82
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:42,445
Into that face all sorts of
things we claim to read.

83
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,345
Mary here.

84
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:50,078
Or John.

85
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,413
John's got a sly face.

86
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:56,078
He has, too.
He has got a sly face.

87
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,646
He's got sly features.

88
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,679
Is John a sly boy?

89
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:02,479
He's sly, all right.
Right.

90
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,045
Do we become the way we look?

91
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:08,412
Or do we look the way we really are?

92
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,578
"if thou hast eyes to see..."

93
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:27,112
It's about the play.
Will you be needing me?

94
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:30,579
I'll be needing you, all right.
Will you do it? I should think so.

95
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,279
Good day, miss.

96
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:43,279
See you.

97
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,746
Miss Travers, I was wondering,

98
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,278
Do you have time for a chat?

99
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:08,412
Miss Travers, do you
think there's any point

100
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,579
In my going on in the sixth form?

101
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,112
Of course. Don't be silly.
What makes you say that?

102
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:17,012
It's just that everyone
seems to end up unemployed.

103
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,012
Not everyone.

104
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:21,779
But, um, I do know what you mean.

105
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,046
You get a university degree,
like in french. Then what?

106
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,146
Maybe you get to be a secretary,
and that's if you're lucky.

107
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,145
Honestly, I've really
thought about it,

108
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,613
And I don't really think
it's worth it, you see.

109
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:37,712
That's not what
education is, though, Suzie.

110
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,646
If you're thinking, "I must
use education for a career,"

111
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:44,446
Then you're already thinking of
education... In the wrong way.

112
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,779
Education...
Is a thing in itself.

113
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,479
It's a way of fulfilling
your potential,

114
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,813
Looking for ways of
thinking about things...

115
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,746
Ways which, if you're lucky,

116
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,513
Will help not just your career,
but your whole life.

117
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:59,311
What ways?

118
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,911
Well...

119
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:08,346
Ways of being
more ordered, I suppose,

120
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,012
Of having more discipline
in the way you think.

121
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:14,012
Not always being bullheaded,

122
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,079
Learning not to rush into things.

123
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:18,313
Do you think uneducated
people do that?

124
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,712
Well, I don't. No.

125
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,713
Not necessarily.

126
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,712
I mean...

127
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:26,679
Sometimes.

128
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,613
Are they inferior for not
knowing how to think?

129
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:32,512
No. Of course not.

130
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,413
But if you have something...

131
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,979
What you call a way of
thinking... which they don't,

132
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,012
Surely you're saying you're superior.

133
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:44,346
No, Suzie.
I wouldn't say that.

134
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,178
What, then?

135
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:47,646
Different.

136
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,545
Better or worse?

137
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,978
I brought you some pheasants.

138
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,311
Am I disturbing you?

139
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,278
Well, I'll make some tea.

140
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:12,645
I love the slow evenings,
when summer begins to come.

141
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,611
It doesn't get dark until 8:00.

142
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:38,077
Are you staying long with Marcie?

143
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:42,045
No.

144
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,212
I don't know Marcie.

145
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,545
What?

146
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,045
But you said...

147
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,546
What?

148
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:52,045
When you came to dinner.
I met her on the doorstep.

149
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:53,879
I thought...

150
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,845
Who invited you?

151
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,812
No one.

152
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,379
Are you saying...

153
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:04,446
it's not possible.
Are you saying...

154
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:07,046
I met Marcie on the doorstep.

155
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,046
I introduced myself.

156
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,979
I thought you came with her.

157
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,412
No.

158
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:15,045
It's not possible.

159
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:17,178
Then I said John Morgan,
if you remember.

160
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,845
Yes.
And you shook my hand.

161
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,612
Come on.

162
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,446
Come in, come in.
The more, the merrier.

163
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:26,244
And you accepted me.

164
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,346
I'll lay an extra place.

165
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,513
Thank you.

166
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:41,945
It's absurd. It's impossible.

167
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,978
No.

168
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,345
No!

169
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,413
No!

170
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,778
Yes! Yes!

171
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:00,279
No.
Yes!

172
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,446
Don't you mean yes?

173
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,911
I mean yes! Yes!

174
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,546
Let me see.

175
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,579
Let me look at you.

176
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,212
You're not meant to.

177
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,078
I know.

178
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:05,379
Do you fly these?
Not a chance.

179
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,546
Engine fitters don't get to fly.

180
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:10,546
It's three years before you
get to go on a flying course.

181
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:13,513
Longer, maybe,
and then not one of these.

182
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:17,246
Really? They take the troops
out in these... To the jungle.

183
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,745
Oh!
To the war.

184
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:23,145
You come down seven times
before you get to Malaya.

185
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,145
It takes over a week.

186
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:29,578
By the time you get there, you know
you've been traveling. I'm sure.

187
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,012
Did you realize you might have
to fight when you joined?

188
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,946
You're an airman, you want to fly.

189
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,279
You're a soldier, you want to fight.

190
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,645
Not much point else.

191
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,378
No.

192
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,044
I'll walk you home.

193
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:22,211
Happen if I were killed,
I'd still say fine.

194
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,712
I joined to fight.
Didn't have to.

195
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,012
Could just have done
national service,

196
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,712
Tramped the parade ground.

197
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:34,045
We're not even at war.

198
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:37,212
Well, not properly at war.

199
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,213
Half a war.

200
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,244
Malaya's half a war.

201
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:45,545
But I liked the idea.

202
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:52,445
Is your mum in bed?

203
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,311
I think so.

204
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:02,811
If she ever asks,
we saw the third man.

205
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,112
Jean?

206
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,346
Still awake?

207
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,478
Yes. How was it?

208
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,512
Good.

209
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:46,045
Orson wells killed
all these children,

210
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,478
Then they shot him
in a sewer in the end.

211
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:49,846
That's good.

212
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,945
Yes.

213
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,144
Good night.

214
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:02,212
Never dreamt...

215
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:06,346
Never thought any such
happiness possible.

216
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,712
Hiding in the dark.

217
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:12,744
Loving a man in the dark.

218
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,078
Never knew any such
happiness possible at all.

219
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:45,245
How bad is it?

220
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,778
Why did he do it?

221
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,012
Depressed, I suppose.

222
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:25,044
So why did he do it in here?

223
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,411
I love the warm evenings.

224
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:43,344
Something.

225
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,477
Tea?

226
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,711
Doesn't get dark till eight.

227
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:09,245
How long are you staying with Marcia?

228
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,745
I'm not.

229
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:13,912
Shock.

230
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:16,178
Moves towards him.

231
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,478
What do you mean?

232
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,445
He explains.

233
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:26,545
Unbelievable.

234
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:29,078
Right pocket.

235
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,111
That's it.

236
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:55,211
There seems little point...

237
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,712
Ah!

238
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,112
My goodness!
I'm sorry, you startled me.

239
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,879
New lock?

240
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,911
The chances of the same
thing happening again...

241
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:09,245
Anyway, I let him in.

242
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:13,745
Well, it doesn't matter
how well you're locked up.

243
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,777
At times you're always going
to have to let people in.

244
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:28,012
Are you all right?

245
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:29,745
Yes.

246
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,912
I've been trying to sleep,
as best I may.

247
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:35,745
Yes, I'm sorry.
We don't clean up afterwards.

248
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:38,744
We just take the body away.

249
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,045
It seems a bit callous, I know.

250
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:45,378
But the thinking is...
That if we always had to clear up,

251
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:49,011
The police would spend their
entire life on their knees.

252
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,278
How are you getting on?

253
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,278
Well, we have something.
He was a student.

254
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:59,278
I see.

255
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:01,846
Yes. He was working for his doctorate

256
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:03,678
At the university of Essex.

257
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:07,177
He came to the town a few
days ago and rented a room.

258
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,411
Are you a graduate yourself?

259
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:13,311
Yes. A subject of much mirth.
A graduate policeman.

260
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:16,278
This man wasn't my generation.
He was younger.

261
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:18,578
He was only 25.

262
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:22,678
He came to research at the
British library down the road.

263
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,877
A blankness.

264
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,978
A central, disfiguring blankness.

265
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,844
That's what people who
knew him describe.

266
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,744
Yes, it's true.

267
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:43,178
I've been trying to remember.

268
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,377
He said so little at dinner,
until late in the evening.

269
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:54,510
He s-seemed already set on a path.

270
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,445
It's funny.
I mean, looking back,

271
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:05,111
I took it for granted
that he was there.

272
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:06,445
Yes. Well, that's right.

273
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:08,878
I mean, I've often
been out to dinner,

274
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:11,345
And not been quite
sure who somebody was.

275
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,045
No.

276
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,577
Quite.

277
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,310
Though, usually, it is different
if you're the hostess.

278
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:26,712
Anyway, it turns out it wasn't
completely out of the blue.

279
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,711
Um, the day before,
he'd seen Marcia Pilborough.

280
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:32,846
As you know, she works
at the library. Oh, I see.

281
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:36,245
And he'd, um, gone up to her.
They'd had a conversation.

282
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,611
He wanted to borrow a book.

283
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,845
Afterwards, we think,
he probably waited

284
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,877
And started to follow her.

285
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:48,845
Oh, well, I see.
It's beginning to make sense.

286
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:51,244
Well, would-would you say...

287
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:54,478
I'm sorry. I know these
things are very difficult,

288
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,878
But would you say that
Marcia was, in any way,

289
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:01,244
A woman who was
likely to have been...

290
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,345
Deliberately provocative?

291
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:08,845
Look. I mean, is lying,
and brought him to dinner...

292
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:12,077
Deliberately, or as a joke?

293
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:13,745
Oh, I'm sorry.

294
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:17,411
I don't mean to be rude,
but Marcia's my best friend.

295
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:20,644
I don't think that would
be possible at all.

296
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,845
He said I'm the best
builder in Wetherby.

297
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:30,845
He said that.

298
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,845
I knew you'd like it.

299
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,044
When did you take it?

300
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:40,445
And he said to me...
He said he'd come around...

301
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:44,512
Look everyone.
Look what Marcia's brought me.

302
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:46,712
A picture of my house.
Lovely.

303
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:48,011
Do you like it?

304
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:50,143
Clever girl. Hmm.

305
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,478
It's great.

306
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,844
Jim...

307
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:06,244
Jim, no. Don't, for goodness sake.

308
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,245
Goodness.

309
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:10,277
Is this a party wall?

310
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,145
Jim?

311
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:17,745
What?

312
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:19,912
Please. It's undignified.

313
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,745
Unladylike.

314
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,777
Yes.

315
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:34,011
Jim! Oh, lord, it's my mother.

316
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:35,678
What?

317
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,710
Let me down.

318
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,478
I want to make love to you.

319
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:50,510
Jim.

320
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:08,045
Jean, are you home?

321
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:10,077
I'm home.

322
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:13,445
Is there anything you need?

323
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,144
No. No, I'm fine.

324
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:40,944
Do you know how long
you'll be staying?

325
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,643
Uh, just a couple of days.

326
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:03,078
Oh, well done, Stanley.

327
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:04,843
Thanks.

328
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,877
Jean?

329
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:10,944
We brought you some breakfast.

330
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:13,610
Thank you, Marcia.
I'm just coming down.

331
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:20,011
Take the paper, Stanley.
Hide it.

332
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:22,109
We've got you bacon and eggs!

333
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:27,312
Why hide it? I thought she
was there when it happened.

334
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:30,611
Well, she doesn't want to
be reminded. Would you?

335
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:36,511
Good morning.

336
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:41,210
No paper, I'm afraid.
I think there's a strike.

337
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:46,111
All right?

338
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:48,378
Well, I'm not in the pink.

339
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,944
Oh, I shouldn't wonder.

340
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:51,278
Did you sleep?

341
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:53,310
I had dreams.

342
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:57,645
Does anyone know why he did it?

343
00:28:57,745 --> 00:29:01,877
And why on earth should he come
and choose to do it to you?

344
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:04,645
It was me who met him first.

345
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:08,777
I don't know why I didn't
think of it at the dinner.

346
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:12,545
I'd met him already.
He could have done it to me.

347
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:14,811
I think the lonely
recognize the lonely.

348
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:17,212
Well, you're not lonely.

349
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:19,211
I only want coffee.

350
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:22,345
Stan, do you mind? Would you
go and do something useful?

351
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:25,776
Do you know how to
do it with a filter?

352
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:54,579
Well, have you searched
back over all your behavior?

353
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,578
Did you offend him in any way?
That's what I've been thinking.

354
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:01,078
Or perhaps we upset him.

355
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:03,811
Perhaps you looked like his mother.

356
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:06,845
No, it is possible.
I read in a book.

357
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:09,278
No, I think it was
more what we shared.

358
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:10,944
What's that?

359
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:14,512
I told you.
A feeling for solitude.

360
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,777
Well, you may have thought that,
but to shoot your head off...

361
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:21,844
Oh, please.
Marcia, the bacon's too much.

362
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:24,245
Oh, god. Oh, it
hadn't occurred to me.

363
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:26,478
I'm sorry, Jean. I...
I just didn't think.

364
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:28,777
I'll take it out.
Oh Jean, I'm sorry.

365
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:31,377
It's out.
It's almost out.

366
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:53,044
If you're frightened of
loneliness, never get married.

367
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:56,077
I'm not frightened.
I'm hardened by now.

368
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,210
Come in, come in.

369
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,744
Nice to meet you.

370
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:16,245
This is Jean.

371
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:18,577
Mrs. Mortimer.

372
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,611
And this is Jim's father. Hello.

373
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,944
Please, sit down, sit down.

374
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:28,945
I've baked you some scones,
and there's Battenburg cake.

375
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:30,378
You're looking very thin, lad.

376
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:32,410
Nay, I've... I've been fine.

377
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:37,211
And so you'd be giving
up college, then?

378
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,445
No, I don't think so, Mr. Mortimer.

379
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,877
Ah.

380
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:44,677
Jim thought as he'd be away
for so long and so often,

381
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,711
It's better if I occupy myself.

382
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:50,778
I think I have a place at
the university of hull.

383
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:52,643
Are you sure?

384
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:57,710
You don't think a woman
who's going to get married

385
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,278
Should be thinking of going
off away from her home.

386
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:03,144
But Jim won't be there.
He'll be in Malaya.

387
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:05,644
He'll want to know
you're where you belong.

388
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:09,044
What difference would it
make if he'd not be with me?

389
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,010
He'll want to know you're at home.

390
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,412
I can't honestly see it'd
make any difference.

391
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:21,610
Any home life we have is bound
to be interrupted at the start.

392
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,911
We'll see each other
so little for a bit.

393
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,078
Seven years?
Is that right?

394
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,710
Well, not necessarily.

395
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,243
Doesn't Jim speak?

396
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:35,644
The air force will
give me a house later,

397
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,011
When I'm back from active service.

398
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:41,876
For now it's nice if Jean
goes on with her books.

399
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:54,877
More Battenburg?

400
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:56,878
Did you bake it yourself?

401
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:58,743
Don't be daft.

402
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,211
You shouldn't worry.

403
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:05,211
They made me feel stupid.

404
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:06,710
Why?

405
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,378
Perhaps it is silly.
Impractical.

406
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:11,977
Well, we're always so happy together.

407
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:15,844
It never occurs to us there's
a world of people out there.

408
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:20,043
We can't spend our life with
the sheets up over our heads.

409
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,278
How can you make Battenburg?

410
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,211
No one can make Battenburg.

411
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:28,477
Half of it's pink!

412
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:31,311
Jim, I know. I was
frightened, that's all.

413
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,344
You know nothing.

414
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:59,711
The angle...
Yeah.

415
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:03,311
Of the body means murder
is probably discounted.

416
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:09,510
There's forensic
evidence, fingerprints.

417
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,543
Nobody else touched the gun.

418
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:17,442
At the inquest, I shall
be arguing it's suicide.

419
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,544
You look disappointed.

420
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,576
No. Not at all.

421
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:27,977
Where is it?

422
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:30,410
Derby.
That's where he came from.

423
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,911
All right.
Lads need the space.

424
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,344
New fire hose demonstration.

425
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,145
Not in here, for Christ's sake.

426
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,278
Not real fire hoses, idiot.

427
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,377
Slide show.

428
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:42,877
No problem, all right?

429
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:45,910
Stick your thumb up
your bum for a bit.

430
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,643
Do fuck-all anyway.

431
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,311
Hey mike, look at this.
What is it?

432
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:58,111
Famous people without their
clothes on. Celebrity nudes.

433
00:34:58,211 --> 00:35:00,811
Jesus, look at her.
Sergeant, what do you mean?

434
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:03,477
Celebrity nudes here, look.
It's Jackie Kennedy.

435
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:05,911
Jackie Kennedy.

436
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:07,744
All women?

437
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,011
Yup.
No men?

438
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:11,678
Hey, isn't that suppose
to be, um, Britt Ekland?

439
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,811
It's a bit of a bad likeness.
He must have been in the bushes.

440
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:19,643
No. Men'd be taking the joke
much too far, wouldn't it?

441
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,711
It's cilla black.

442
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:24,778
You don't need to take flowers.

443
00:35:24,878 --> 00:35:26,945
I can't explain it.

444
00:35:27,045 --> 00:35:29,143
I just thought I would.

445
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:36,610
Jean, I'm sorry.

446
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,310
I was just settling your class.
We weren't expecting you.

447
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,744
I thought I'd feel
better if I came in.

448
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:44,677
I gave them some books
and told them to shut up.

449
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:47,044
Hmm. Good.

450
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:50,344
Well, uh... You must
come around to dinner.

451
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,344
Yes. I'd like to.

452
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,078
I... I mean, uh...

453
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:57,943
We must have you back.
We don't see enough of you.

454
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,542
Bye.

455
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,777
Right. Come on.
Heads out of the books.

456
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,778
Please everyone, that's not
how I teach, as you know.

457
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:15,944
Mr. Braithwaite said you weren't
going to be here today, miss.

458
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:18,911
You have a pleasant surprise.
Board please, Marjorie.

459
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,343
Please, miss, I forgot
to hand in my book.

460
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:24,110
Shut up. Sit down.
Open a window.

461
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:31,676
Uh, miss, you've still got
your fag in your mouth.

462
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:42,476
Good.

463
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,410
Right. Today...

464
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,944
We address ourselves to the question,

465
00:36:57,044 --> 00:37:01,976
Is Shakespeare worth reading
although it's only about kings?

466
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:42,377
Hello.

467
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:45,044
Sorry. I don't mean to surprise you.

468
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,710
It's all right.

469
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,509
I should have rung.

470
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:55,144
I've come from the funeral.
I'm a friend of John Morgan's.

471
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,542
Come in.

472
00:38:12,877 --> 00:38:16,610
I had a kind of inkling he
might do something silly.

473
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,377
I always thought he was weird.

474
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:22,310
Were you at the same university?

475
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,744
He was post-graduate.
I'm just a first-year.

476
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:29,577
Had you...
Been going out with him?

477
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:31,577
No. I never slept with him.

478
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:34,411
Went to the cinema twice.

479
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:36,977
Seen that film about the Indian.

480
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:38,443
Gandhi?

481
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:41,011
That's right.

482
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,744
Afterwards, he couldn't stop talking.

483
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:46,577
He thought this and he thought that.

484
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:50,177
The philosophy of
nonviolence and so on.

485
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:53,176
And I really didn't think anything.

486
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:56,043
Except that, obviously,
the film was very long.

487
00:38:57,744 --> 00:39:00,409
In that way, we weren't even suited.

488
00:39:01,744 --> 00:39:04,477
I think he was trying to impress me.

489
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:06,676
He chose the wrong way.

490
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,978
I like people who are
just themselves.

491
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:13,743
Not talking rubbish all the time.

492
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:21,077
I know I shouldn't say that
about anyone who's dead, but...

493
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:24,077
Anyone who did what
they did to you...

494
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:29,343
He certainly upset me.

495
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,977
Yes. I can tell.

496
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:36,544
Then he started to pester me.

497
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:41,544
I had to go to his professor
to ask him to stop watching me.

498
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:44,242
The worst was in the laundrette.

499
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:51,844
I think it was me he
wanted to do it to.

500
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:55,376
And just by bad luck,
he did it to you.

501
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:17,644
Are you going back?

502
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:18,845
When?
This evening.

503
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:21,376
I don't really have any plan.

504
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,844
I only came up on an impulse.

505
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:28,176
Then a policeman at the
funeral gave me a lift.

506
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:29,844
Who was that?

507
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,810
He was called Langdon.

508
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,210
I'd never have thought of it.

509
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,044
It was his idea I should come.

510
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:20,710
So how long had you known him?

511
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,044
Who?
John Morgan.

512
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:25,043
Oh, him.

513
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:27,076
I don't know.

514
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:32,511
Do you have a television?

515
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:35,876
Yes. I've got one.
It's behind the chair.

516
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,544
I hardly ever watch it.

517
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:41,244
I watch it most evenings.

518
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:43,277
At university?

519
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:46,010
They have a room you can sit in.

520
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,876
Do you mind if I get it out?

521
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:56,477
I held a very important position.

522
00:41:56,577 --> 00:42:00,009
Pull yourself together,
for god's sake.

523
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:29,943
I've finished in the bathroom.

524
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:31,976
Good night.

525
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:46,910
How was the funeral?

526
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,010
Ghastly.

527
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,009
I had to go to derby.

528
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:54,476
And it started to rain.

529
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:59,244
There's only his mother left alive.

530
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:03,244
She had no idea why he'd done it.

531
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:06,175
Seems as if neither do you.

532
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,010
Have you been riding?

533
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,477
Hmm. That's why I fell asleep.

534
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:15,976
We broke in a new horse.

535
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:18,309
So, I'm saddle-sore.

536
00:43:23,443 --> 00:43:25,910
The problem is...

537
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,244
No crime has been committed.

538
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:33,510
Killing yourself is legal,
even in front of somebody else.

539
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:37,210
Hmm.

540
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,877
Unless she did something
to provoke him.

541
00:43:40,977 --> 00:43:42,576
Yes.

542
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:50,577
She'd only known him 24 hours.

543
00:43:50,677 --> 00:43:54,144
She is...

544
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:56,010
What?

545
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:00,744
A teacher, obviously good at her job.

546
00:44:00,844 --> 00:44:04,377
Loved by her pupils.

547
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,909
Did she teach you?

548
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,744
No. But I remember her.

549
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:11,744
She was nice.

550
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:15,243
A good woman...
Chosen, for some reason,

551
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:19,243
As the victim of the
ultimate practical joke.

552
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:22,343
I told Stanley not to get drunk.

553
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:24,243
It's true, it's true.

554
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:27,809
I don't watch that.
I watch that thing on Sundays.

555
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:30,010
Hello, Verity.
Hello, darling.

556
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,544
Roger won't watch it

557
00:44:31,644 --> 00:44:34,377
Because he says it's full
of jokes about blacks.

558
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:35,977
No. I didn't say that.

559
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:39,076
It's just that particular
kind of joke about blacks.

560
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,743
Hello, Stanley.

561
00:44:41,843 --> 00:44:44,442
Oop! I need some more wine.

562
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:47,743
Ta-da.

563
00:44:47,843 --> 00:44:50,611
Oh. No, red, it's for cooking.

564
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:52,043
Well, you're wrong.

565
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:55,643
I think if they want to
be accepted as British,

566
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,644
Then they'll have to put up
with the fact that they will

567
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:02,110
Be the butt of peoples' humor...
Just like mothers-in-law.

568
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,411
Do you know who that bloke is?

569
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:07,710
Stanley, don't be rude.
He's a friend of Jean's.

570
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,444
Here we are.
Stan, will you open this?

571
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:12,577
Yes.

572
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:15,377
Roger... Do you know, uh, John?

573
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:17,444
Uh, yes.

574
00:45:17,544 --> 00:45:18,877
This is Verity.

575
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:21,709
And if you actually don't
make jokes about blacks,

576
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:25,244
It's reverse discrimination
saying they don't really belong.

577
00:45:25,344 --> 00:45:28,611
No, you have to say...
I don't have to say anything.

578
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:32,311
Jews make jokes about Jews.
It's called "jewish humor."

579
00:45:32,411 --> 00:45:34,244
When we do it,
it's called anti-semitism.

580
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:35,611
Don't you agree?

581
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:38,743
You do realize this is an
emotional argument? So?

582
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,809
It has no basis in logic whatsoever.

583
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:42,977
Oh, logic.

584
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,411
Yes! You know, logic,
that holds society together.

585
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:48,244
Logic that says people shouldn't
go around killing each other.

586
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:49,243
Quite right.

587
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:51,343
And that also tells us...
Look...

588
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:54,344
Please! I've started,
so please let me finish!

589
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:56,578
Magnus magnusson.

590
00:45:56,678 --> 00:46:00,676
Logic also tells us that
there must be constraints,

591
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:04,244
And that, if people went around
saying exactly what they feel,

592
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,476
The result would be barbarism.

593
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:11,578
And I prefer civilization.

594
00:46:11,678 --> 00:46:13,609
That's all.

595
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,975
Thank you.

596
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,477
Roger dislikes anyone being
allowed to express themselves.

597
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,511
He sees it as a threat
to property values.

598
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:31,511
I don't think that's quite fair.

599
00:46:31,611 --> 00:46:35,110
He won't allow a firework display for
fear a rocket falls on our thatched roof.

600
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,177
Now you're raising a different
point. Life is dangerous!

601
00:46:38,277 --> 00:46:41,176
Don't you realize?

602
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:44,376
And sometimes,
there's nothing you can do!

603
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,343
That's not true.

604
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,043
I think you can always
limit the danger.

605
00:47:01,477 --> 00:47:03,742
What do you say, John Morgan?

606
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:09,177
Speak up. Intercede.

607
00:47:09,277 --> 00:47:11,576
It's a marriage.

608
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:14,610
You must adjudicate
between warring parties.

609
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,342
Well, I can see both
sides, I suppose.

610
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,610
Oh, well, goodness.

611
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,543
How are you?
This is a coincidence. Um...

612
00:49:13,643 --> 00:49:15,542
Chrissie, this is Jean Travers.

613
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:17,276
Hello. Hello. Is this a coincidence?

614
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:20,476
Good lord, yes. I've given
up thinking about you.

615
00:49:20,576 --> 00:49:23,876
Oh, yes. Um, do, please.
Or would I be interrupting?

616
00:49:23,976 --> 00:49:25,909
No. Not in the slightest.

617
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,543
Uh, Chrissie came into Leeds
to pick up some gear.

618
00:49:30,643 --> 00:49:32,211
I ride horses.

619
00:49:32,311 --> 00:49:35,710
I said I'd take her and
we'd go to the cinema.

620
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,177
Yes. Thank you.

621
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:38,643
A beer please.

622
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,643
Yes, and me.

623
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:42,977
So, what are you doing?

624
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:45,410
Oh, I don't know.

625
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,343
I've already ordered.

626
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,376
Right.

627
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:01,677
I'm afraid I got frightened.

628
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:03,677
Frightened?
Yes.

629
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:05,610
Are you living on your own?

630
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,442
No, as it happens, I'm not.

631
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,676
This girl came to stay with me.
Oh, she stayed?

632
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:14,244
Yes. A friend of John Morgan's.
Have you heard about this?

633
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,376
Yes.
So you know what I mean.

634
00:50:17,543 --> 00:50:20,476
And then today...

635
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:23,344
I just... I was going
to go home and...

636
00:50:23,444 --> 00:50:27,576
Then I somehow, I couldn't
face it; I just had to get out.

637
00:50:27,676 --> 00:50:29,610
Why does she frighten you so much?

638
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,610
It sounds silly.

639
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,509
Well, I can't get hold of her.

640
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:37,244
She arrived on my doorstep,

641
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:40,143
And I thought, "oh, she
really wants to speak to me,"

642
00:50:40,243 --> 00:50:44,443
Because we've had a similar
experience, I suppose.

643
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:47,942
But it's as if she had
a faculty missing.

644
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:53,309
She seems to say something
and then it just slips away.

645
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:01,176
She has no curiosity.

646
00:51:07,643 --> 00:51:11,776
Also... She asked if she could
stay the night. I said fine.

647
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:16,310
The next day she didn't leave
and yesterday she asked to stay.

648
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:27,977
It's hard to say, but...

649
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:32,242
I can understand how Morgan
became obsessed with her.

650
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,676
Did he?
Yes.

651
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:40,608
Violently, I think.

652
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:46,943
She's the sort of girl that
people become obsessed with.

653
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:48,976
Excuse me.

654
00:52:52,944 --> 00:52:56,676
Well, I mean, I can hardly
wake her up and say,

655
00:52:56,776 --> 00:52:59,309
"this is my friend the policeman,

656
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,743
And he offered to come
around and tell you to leave."

657
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:04,608
No.

658
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,609
Um, I don't know.

659
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:12,642
Everything gets to seem spooky.

660
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:16,809
Is that where the tile was?

661
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:20,543
Yes.

662
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:24,010
And he fixed it?

663
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,077
What?

664
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,109
How did he fix it?

665
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:32,042
From the inside?

666
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:49,308
Chrissie's waiting for you.

667
00:53:51,476 --> 00:53:53,777
Yes.

668
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:56,475
Thank you for driving me home.

669
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:48,309
I have a list of books I
was hoping to borrow.

670
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:49,677
I'm sorry.
You've been misinformed.

671
00:54:49,777 --> 00:54:52,008
This isn't a lending
library, you know.

672
00:54:53,443 --> 00:54:55,676
It's the British library,
lending division?

673
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:57,910
Yes, I know.
But we don't lend books.

674
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,109
Or, only under very
special circumstances.

675
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:04,043
I have a letter from my professor.

676
00:55:04,143 --> 00:55:08,076
Well, that won't be nearly
special enough, I'm afraid.

677
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,610
Or just to look at the books,
not borrow them.

678
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,843
Oh, yes, yes.
You can look,

679
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:20,176
As long as you're a registered user.

680
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,308
But you need authorization
from London.

681
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,509
Yes. Well, I'll get that.

682
00:55:30,143 --> 00:55:32,475
Then I'll come back.

683
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,042
Go to bed. Bed!

684
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:40,944
We're off now, Stanley.

685
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:43,408
Don't forget to unthaw the lunch.

686
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,977
Clearing out all that jumble
began to upset me.

687
00:56:48,077 --> 00:56:50,209
Really?

688
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:52,043
Didn't you feel like that?

689
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,710
The past, you mean?

690
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,510
Mmm.

691
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,543
That isn't like you.

692
00:56:57,643 --> 00:56:59,576
Second-hand clothes.

693
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,009
They say that murderers are
drawn to the second-hand.

694
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:07,843
I hadn't heard that.

695
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:09,676
Yes. There's a book.

696
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:11,509
You like murder, roger.

697
00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:15,242
Yes, oh god, yes.
I'm addicted.

698
00:57:15,342 --> 00:57:18,976
Yes. There's a theory that
murder is characteristically

699
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:22,009
Committed by people who
handle other peoples' things

700
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,542
In second-hand clothes shops,
junk shops, markets.

701
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:29,843
Self-improvement.
That's another hallmark.

702
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:32,877
People who teach themselves
things at home, at night.

703
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:35,808
Theories they only half understand.

704
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:39,108
Informal education.

705
00:57:41,009 --> 00:57:43,409
A fantasy life of singular intensity.

706
00:57:43,509 --> 00:57:45,743
Didn't you go to
Switzerland last year?

707
00:57:45,843 --> 00:57:47,743
Yes. I, uh...

708
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:50,509
Yes. A package tour.

709
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:53,009
To the Reichenbach falls.

710
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:55,776
There were 40 of us
from all over England.

711
00:57:55,876 --> 00:57:59,342
To see where Moriarty pushed
Sherlock Holmes over.

712
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,409
Wonderful countryside.

713
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:03,776
What did Verity think?

714
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:05,643
Ah.

715
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:08,075
She didn't come with me.
No.

716
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:15,475
A colleague from home
economics came along.

717
00:58:28,676 --> 00:58:31,109
Do you like murder?

718
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:33,209
Not much.

719
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,109
But I prefer it to romance.

720
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:38,109
Hello, Lil. Sorry we're late.
The dog was sick.

721
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:39,009
Oh, dear.

722
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:41,009
It's on a high-fiber diet.

723
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:44,708
You know what it's like.
I don't think it likes mueslix.

724
01:00:12,908 --> 01:00:15,142
The river flows dark
tonight, sir Thomas.

725
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:16,808
Will you take my boat?

726
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:20,009
Boatman, though I do not mean to
deprive you of your livelihood,

727
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:21,410
I cannot take your boat.

728
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,342
For if I travel tonight,
I shall travel to the tower.

729
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:27,843
They say that is a place from
which no man can return.

730
01:00:27,943 --> 01:00:28,976
Aye, not alive.

731
01:00:29,076 --> 01:00:32,343
But boatman, we are put on
this earth to serve god's will,

732
01:00:32,443 --> 01:00:35,809
And if I do it tonight,
and in the fullness of my heart,

733
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:38,842
He shall protect me and
lead me to a better place

734
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:41,175
Than any we have known in the world.

735
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:43,342
I wish you good fortune, sire.

736
01:00:43,442 --> 01:00:46,875
Thank you, boatman.
You are lucky to know no kings.

737
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,875
Here, take gold.

738
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:51,974
Remember me in your prayers.

739
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,442
So what do you do?

740
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:51,076
Well, come on. Answer me.

741
01:01:51,176 --> 01:01:54,209
I don't want Janice to
take "a" level English.

742
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,410
Because we want her to get on.

743
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,342
We bought her a home computer.

744
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,309
Surely you can tell
me what your name is?

745
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:05,341
Now, look!

746
01:02:09,076 --> 01:02:11,009
Excuse me.

747
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:13,009
She's cut her hand.

748
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:15,708
I wasn't saying anything!
I didn't do anything.

749
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:17,775
What's your problem, man?

750
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:20,475
Please, Mr. Varley, come back!

751
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:28,009
What did he say?

752
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:30,342
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

753
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:32,208
Why can't people leave me alone?

754
01:03:58,476 --> 01:04:00,376
What did he want?

755
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:02,975
Who?
That parent.

756
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:09,742
Nothing. He just asked questions.

757
01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:11,841
What kind?

758
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:16,874
Oh, you know. Who was I?
What was I doing here?

759
01:04:20,742 --> 01:04:23,008
That sounds quite innocent.

760
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:29,909
It's just... I hate it.
All this asking that goes on.

761
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:32,176
People digging around.

762
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:35,375
The way people have
to dig into one another.

763
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:38,508
It's horrible.

764
01:04:49,942 --> 01:04:52,875
Did you say that to John Morgan?

765
01:04:54,609 --> 01:04:56,509
Yes.

766
01:04:56,609 --> 01:05:00,041
Well... I did.

767
01:05:11,276 --> 01:05:13,676
No wonder.

768
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,375
I think you drove him crazy.

769
01:05:21,143 --> 01:05:23,408
I don't know what you mean.

770
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:29,908
No, well... Exactly. That's why.

771
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:36,708
Goodness, I don't mean deliberately.
I don't mean you meant to.

772
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:40,607
I never do anything!
I never say anything!

773
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,475
Karen.

774
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:38,875
Karen?

775
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:46,143
It's me.

776
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:49,875
Karen, listen to me, please.
Get out of here.

777
01:06:49,975 --> 01:06:51,309
I only want to talk.

778
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:53,209
Fuck you! Get out!

779
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,708
No, look. You must
listen to me. Please!

780
01:06:59,076 --> 01:07:02,743
I want some feeling!
I want some contact!

781
01:07:02,843 --> 01:07:05,343
I want you fucking near me!

782
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:07,108
Ah!

783
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,141
Oh!

784
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:14,640
Please don't go.

785
01:07:16,275 --> 01:07:19,176
You make an effort.
You try and be nice!

786
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:21,409
Try and do anything!

787
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:23,975
You just get your head chopped off.

788
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:26,007
Why try?

789
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:32,542
Anyway... Tell me.

790
01:07:32,642 --> 01:07:35,542
Go on, tell me,
since you're so clever.

791
01:07:35,642 --> 01:07:37,408
What did you do?

792
01:07:38,942 --> 01:07:40,842
Oh, Karen.

793
01:07:40,942 --> 01:07:43,375
If it wasn't an accident,

794
01:07:44,842 --> 01:07:47,375
I'd love to know what you did.

795
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:50,375
Oh, Karen.

796
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:52,408
Karen...

797
01:07:52,508 --> 01:07:54,607
Come back!

798
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:16,842
If I had the guts,
I'd just say to him,

799
01:08:16,942 --> 01:08:20,909
"look. I don't want you to go.
I need you."

800
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:22,875
Why don't you say that?

801
01:08:23,043 --> 01:08:24,676
Because to him, it's everything.

802
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:27,042
Being an airman is everything.

803
01:08:27,142 --> 01:08:29,042
Until he gets to Malaya,

804
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:31,976
He isn't going to feel
being an airman is real.

805
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:33,176
What do you feel?

806
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,609
I don't know.
Of course I don't like it.

807
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:38,308
Are you frightened he's
going to get killed?

808
01:08:38,408 --> 01:08:40,341
No.

809
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:44,542
No, of course not.
I hadn't even thought of it.

810
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:46,809
Why'd you say that?

811
01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:49,574
I'm sorry. I didn't think.

812
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:55,642
With him I can't talk.

813
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:58,740
With him I can't say anything I feel.

814
01:09:00,275 --> 01:09:02,342
Because I read books,

815
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:06,142
I feel, for some reason,
I'm not allowed to talk.

816
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:09,008
There's always a gulf.

817
01:09:12,942 --> 01:09:15,742
Doesn't seem a very
good basis for marriage.

818
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:17,941
No, I suppose.

819
01:09:24,475 --> 01:09:26,407
Perhaps...

820
01:09:28,675 --> 01:09:31,076
Perhaps sex isn't everything.

821
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:33,108
No.

822
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:37,675
It's time that you talked to him.

823
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:40,407
Soon he'll be gone.

824
01:09:44,242 --> 01:09:46,409
Jim.

825
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:48,441
Jim, it's hopeless.

826
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:52,009
How can it work anymore

827
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:55,742
Snatching time when
my mum's out at cards,

828
01:09:55,842 --> 01:09:59,076
Knowing we can't get married
because of your parents?

829
01:09:59,176 --> 01:10:01,775
We'll get married.

830
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,942
Eventually, yes.

831
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:07,008
When you finally get
back from Malaya.

832
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,974
But it's so long, it makes
everything seem pointless.

833
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:17,808
Don't you think we
should be sensible?

834
01:10:48,109 --> 01:10:50,041
No.

835
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,474
Hmm.

836
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:43,075
Hello, boy.

837
01:11:50,009 --> 01:11:52,775
There's a man out here to see you.

838
01:12:08,508 --> 01:12:12,108
...At its most basic.

839
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:14,842
Or at least not conveying the sense.
That's a possibility.

840
01:12:14,942 --> 01:12:16,575
You've got to take
that into account.

841
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:18,776
Yes, I understand.
I don't want to press you.

842
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,775
No. Go ahead.

843
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,375
Hello. How are you?

844
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:23,475
...Your arms above your head.

845
01:12:23,575 --> 01:12:25,241
I'm just taking that as an example.

846
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,842
Does that necessarily
mean you're happy?

847
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,942
You look shattered.

848
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:30,475
...Happiness in certain circumstances

849
01:12:30,575 --> 01:12:33,108
According to those
circumstances, certainly, yes.

850
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:36,074
Or, it can mean release, or triumph.

851
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,674
I'm afraid I've had
some trouble at home.

852
01:12:49,976 --> 01:12:52,807
Chrissie went back to her husband.

853
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:56,142
She had one already?

854
01:12:56,242 --> 01:12:57,507
Oh, yes.

855
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:01,909
Who she told me she
never saw anymore.

856
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:03,941
But all the time...

857
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:09,042
I don't know.

858
01:13:09,142 --> 01:13:12,041
It turns out I was a subplot.

859
01:13:12,141 --> 01:13:15,375
The real story was
happening elsewhere.

860
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,407
That's a terrible feeling.

861
01:13:18,975 --> 01:13:20,907
Yeah. The worst.

862
01:13:25,308 --> 01:13:29,175
It's shaken my whole idea of myself.

863
01:13:29,275 --> 01:13:33,408
You know, what I'm
doing as a policeman.

864
01:13:33,508 --> 01:13:37,241
I mean, if the day was
no good, if it was...

865
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:41,774
Awful or silly, I could always
go back to Chrissie and laugh.

866
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:46,742
Now it turns out that
she wasn't really with me.

867
01:13:46,842 --> 01:13:48,809
She laughed...

868
01:13:48,909 --> 01:13:51,174
But she was elsewhere.

869
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:58,141
What's he like?

870
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:00,475
Awful.

871
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,407
He's the sort of man who keeps sheep.

872
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:07,308
I mean, for god's sake,

873
01:14:07,408 --> 01:14:11,173
If you want wool,
go and buy it in a shop.

874
01:14:14,775 --> 01:14:17,175
Listen.
I'll tell you why I'm here.

875
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:19,342
I was piecing together the evening.

876
01:14:19,442 --> 01:14:20,908
Can't you leave it?

877
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,274
Well, yes.

878
01:14:24,742 --> 01:14:26,608
This is just an amateur's interest.

879
01:14:31,308 --> 01:14:33,908
All right.

880
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:38,140
It's just that...

881
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:43,575
There was food...

882
01:14:43,675 --> 01:14:46,308
Then there was talking...

883
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:48,340
Then you went upstairs.

884
01:14:50,308 --> 01:14:53,941
Didn't you have a few
moments alone with him?

885
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,175
When you were together...

886
01:14:56,275 --> 01:14:58,409
What did you talk about?

887
01:14:58,509 --> 01:15:00,508
Fixing the roof.

888
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:05,908
It's just that roger...
your colleague, roger... says...

889
01:15:06,008 --> 01:15:09,808
That when you came back,
he remembers that you'd changed.

890
01:15:09,908 --> 01:15:11,508
Changed?

891
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,375
Not, uh... I don't mean...
I'm not saying...

892
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:18,375
As a person.

893
01:15:18,475 --> 01:15:21,041
Your clothes.

894
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:24,407
Well, I put on my trousers.
I'd snagged my stocking.

895
01:15:26,575 --> 01:15:28,507
Oh, gosh.

896
01:15:34,374 --> 01:15:36,341
Poor you.

897
01:15:36,441 --> 01:15:38,908
So, how are you managing alone?

898
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:43,574
Don't you think you should tell me?

899
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,808
What happened?

900
01:15:52,175 --> 01:15:54,341
Was it your fault?

901
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:01,575
I th... I think.

902
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:03,941
In a way.

903
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:14,040
It's because he was a stranger.

904
01:16:16,975 --> 01:16:19,574
No. I'm not sure I can explain.

905
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,474
Because I didn't know him.

906
01:16:31,275 --> 01:16:34,708
Now I can feel him dragging me down.

907
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:41,742
I thought I could get over it,

908
01:16:41,842 --> 01:16:45,107
But now, everywhere,
the darkness beckons.

909
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:49,375
These things become real.

910
01:16:49,475 --> 01:16:51,841
He wants me down there.

911
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,008
Well, you have to fight.

912
01:16:55,108 --> 01:16:57,207
Well, I have fought.

913
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,808
How dare you?

914
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:06,174
I fought for three weeks,
and you didn't help.

915
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:11,408
Sending me that
miserable little girl.

916
01:17:11,508 --> 01:17:14,107
What gives you that right?

917
01:17:16,608 --> 01:17:18,541
To meddle?

918
01:17:21,942 --> 01:17:25,207
Police always bring sadness.

919
01:17:44,008 --> 01:17:45,940
I'm going to sit here.

920
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:50,542
I won't go away.

921
01:17:50,642 --> 01:17:54,842
Now, Stanley...
Don't drink too much, please.

922
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:57,341
Last night, you were stupid with gin.

923
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:59,374
I like gin.

924
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,908
Oh.

925
01:18:02,008 --> 01:18:03,642
I rang the bell.

926
01:18:03,742 --> 01:18:06,340
Well, she can see us
through the window.

927
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:12,007
Jean?

928
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:14,040
I'm John Morgan.

929
01:18:18,309 --> 01:18:19,575
Hello.

930
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:22,108
Oh, you brought an extra.

931
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:24,708
Come on. Come on in.

932
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:25,808
The more, the merrier.

933
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:28,142
John Morgan.

934
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:31,007
I've already told Stanley
not to get drunk.

935
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:37,873
What?

936
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,807
Revenge.

937
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:50,774
That's what it is. Revenge!
That's what she's doing!

938
01:18:50,874 --> 01:18:53,174
Who?

939
01:18:53,274 --> 01:18:55,207
The prime minister.

940
01:18:56,974 --> 01:19:00,973
She's taking some...
Terrible revenge for something.

941
01:19:02,675 --> 01:19:06,441
Some deep damage. Something
inside. God knows what.

942
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:11,840
For crimes behind the privet hedge.

943
01:19:13,242 --> 01:19:17,175
And now the whole
country's suffering!

944
01:19:17,275 --> 01:19:19,241
Yet we've done nothing to her.

945
01:19:19,341 --> 01:19:21,108
Do you think that?

946
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:23,275
Yes, I do.

947
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:24,575
Coq au vin.

948
01:19:24,675 --> 01:19:26,541
Oh! Wonderful!

949
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:28,542
Stanley, you're drunk.

950
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,375
One drunk?

951
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:32,375
Yes, I am.
Drunk and disorderly,

952
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:34,008
Where once I was orderly.

953
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:35,408
Who's first?

954
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:38,942
I used to keep my thoughts
in neat rows like vegetables.

955
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:40,942
All pegged out under cloches.

956
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:44,941
I kept my thoughts under cloches.
Now, they grow wild.

957
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:46,941
Marcia?

958
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:49,208
Oh, sorry.
You wouldn't know.

959
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:51,342
I am the local solicitor.

960
01:19:51,442 --> 01:19:54,841
The town's official
sanctifier of greed.

961
01:19:54,941 --> 01:19:57,008
Those little unseemly transactions.

962
01:19:57,108 --> 01:19:59,342
I'll just take some of this.
Verity.

963
01:19:59,442 --> 01:20:01,875
I see people as they truly are.

964
01:20:01,975 --> 01:20:04,409
Nonsense.

965
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:06,841
Oh, this smells marvelous.

966
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:10,875
I remember once, my father,

967
01:20:10,975 --> 01:20:12,941
Also a solicitor,

968
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:18,175
Said, "I have learnt never to judge

969
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:23,807
Any man from his behavior with
money and the opposite sex."

970
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:31,341
Yet it is my own saddened experience

971
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:35,441
That those are the only
ways to judge them.

972
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:36,675
Salad?

973
01:20:36,775 --> 01:20:38,108
Thank you.

974
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,108
Stanley thinks good of nobody.

975
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:42,075
Not true.

976
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:44,208
I expect good of nobody.

977
01:20:44,308 --> 01:20:45,908
Thank you.

978
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,540
And I'm sometimes
pleasantly surprised.

979
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:52,108
There we are.

980
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,307
And when I find good,

981
01:20:56,175 --> 01:20:58,075
My first feeling

982
01:20:58,175 --> 01:21:00,774
Is one of nostalgia for
something we've lost.

983
01:21:00,874 --> 01:21:03,140
Here, take.
Thanks.

984
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:07,775
Ask John Morgan.

985
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:09,807
John.

986
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:14,341
Well, I don't know.

987
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:16,008
Go on.

988
01:21:16,108 --> 01:21:19,008
I only know...

989
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:22,640
Goodness...

990
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,308
And anger...

991
01:21:25,408 --> 01:21:28,541
And revenge...

992
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:30,574
And evil...

993
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:34,473
And desire.

994
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:38,541
These seem to me far
better words than

995
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:42,008
Neurosis and psychology and paranoia.

996
01:21:42,108 --> 01:21:44,541
These old words.

997
01:21:45,008 --> 01:21:48,707
These good, old words
have a sort of... Conviction,

998
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:54,374
Which all this modern apparatus
of language now lacks.

999
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:58,908
Ah, well, yes.

1000
01:21:59,008 --> 01:22:01,508
We bury these words.

1001
01:22:01,608 --> 01:22:04,442
These simple feelings.

1002
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:06,807
We bury them deep.

1003
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:11,408
And all the building over
that constitutes this century

1004
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:14,374
Will not wish these feelings away.

1005
01:22:16,908 --> 01:22:19,708
Yes, well, you'll have to say
what you really mean by that.

1006
01:22:19,808 --> 01:22:22,309
Would I?

1007
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:25,007
Yeah.
Define your terms.

1008
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:29,341
They don't need defining.

1009
01:22:30,908 --> 01:22:34,940
If you can't feel them,
you might as well be dead.

1010
01:22:47,741 --> 01:22:51,275
Well... What do you think?

1011
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:54,639
Well, of course, you look wonderful.

1012
01:23:02,874 --> 01:23:05,207
You don't like me going.

1013
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,075
What makes you say that?

1014
01:23:10,175 --> 01:23:12,374
I've never said that.

1015
01:23:13,741 --> 01:23:15,641
I've encouraged you.

1016
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,174
I can see it's your happiness.

1017
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:22,540
You've never been happier than today.

1018
01:23:23,841 --> 01:23:27,773
I've always told you,
you must do what you want.

1019
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,541
Yes.

1020
01:23:31,641 --> 01:23:35,407
You supported me, and...
And I've been grateful.

1021
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:40,007
I'll come back.
We'll have a house.

1022
01:23:47,908 --> 01:23:50,641
If you want to stop me, you can.

1023
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:53,674
No. I'll study. I've lots to do.

1024
01:23:57,974 --> 01:24:00,073
Are you being true with me?

1025
01:24:01,707 --> 01:24:03,440
True?

1026
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,473
What's it mean?

1027
01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:18,773
If you've anything
to say, speak it now.

1028
01:24:23,974 --> 01:24:25,907
Nothing.

1029
01:24:36,741 --> 01:24:40,240
Good-bye.

1030
01:26:22,808 --> 01:26:25,675
Oh!

1031
01:26:25,775 --> 01:26:27,207
Where'd that come from?

1032
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,541
Oh, god.

1033
01:26:29,641 --> 01:26:31,707
It looks as if your
roof is in trouble.

1034
01:26:31,807 --> 01:26:33,573
I'm very practical.

1035
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:37,873
Right.

1036
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:00,707
Show me your money.

1037
01:27:14,474 --> 01:27:16,573
Put that in your shoe.

1038
01:27:27,142 --> 01:27:29,074
Let's go in.

1039
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,908
What you said...

1040
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:42,272
What you said about those
feelings, it made such sense.

1041
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:46,808
Yes. I thought you'd understand me.

1042
01:27:46,908 --> 01:27:48,840
It's here.

1043
01:28:06,374 --> 01:28:10,340
Take part in your game.

1044
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,474
We would like to.

1045
01:28:13,574 --> 01:28:18,273
We have heard, the best
game of poker in Malaya.

1046
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:30,306
Okay.

1047
01:28:47,474 --> 01:28:49,506
Thanks very much.

1048
01:29:01,608 --> 01:29:03,508
I think it's fixed.

1049
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:05,206
Thank you.

1050
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,373
Shall we go down?

1051
01:29:12,474 --> 01:29:13,574
What have you given him?

1052
01:29:13,674 --> 01:29:15,407
Okay. It's okay.
I have something.

1053
01:29:15,507 --> 01:29:16,974
- Oh!
- Don't drag him!

1054
01:29:23,641 --> 01:29:26,273
Who runs this game?
I thought you were the boss!

1055
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:29,040
No fighting, please.

1056
01:29:31,308 --> 01:29:32,407
I have something.

1057
01:29:32,507 --> 01:29:35,008
Step in here.

1058
01:29:35,108 --> 01:29:38,073
I will give you some
medicine for him.

1059
01:30:27,707 --> 01:30:31,974
I love the slow evenings
when summer begins to come.

1060
01:30:33,474 --> 01:30:36,407
It doesn't get dark until 8:00.

1061
01:30:39,574 --> 01:30:42,407
Absurd. It isn't possible.

1062
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:44,841
No.

1063
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:47,073
English airman...

1064
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:37,874
Listen...

1065
01:31:37,974 --> 01:31:39,842
I know you're in trouble.

1066
01:31:39,942 --> 01:31:41,274
What?

1067
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:43,707
You're in trouble...
Like me.

1068
01:31:43,807 --> 01:31:46,608
No. No, I don't know what you mean.

1069
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,307
Come on.

1070
01:31:48,407 --> 01:31:50,675
I... No.

1071
01:31:50,775 --> 01:31:52,675
You're lonely.

1072
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:55,808
Yes, well, I'm lonely,
but I'm not in trouble.

1073
01:31:55,908 --> 01:31:57,174
Please don't argue.

1074
01:31:57,274 --> 01:32:00,674
All that hope coming out of you,
all that cheerful resolution.

1075
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:03,040
All that wonderful enlightenment...

1076
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:06,307
For what? For nothing.

1077
01:32:06,407 --> 01:32:07,841
You know it's for nothing.

1078
01:32:07,941 --> 01:32:10,174
Don't tell me that
cheerfulness is real.

1079
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:11,372
Yes, of course.

1080
01:32:12,674 --> 01:32:17,006
You and I...
We understand each other.

1081
01:32:17,106 --> 01:32:19,073
What? No. What?

1082
01:32:19,173 --> 01:32:23,407
You fake. You fake
all that cheerfulness.

1083
01:32:23,507 --> 01:32:26,674
No! I don't. It's who I am.

1084
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:28,741
Then why did you lead me up here?

1085
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:29,973
I didn't.

1086
01:32:30,073 --> 01:32:32,006
Liar!

1087
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:38,341
You know. You know
where you're looking.

1088
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:40,174
No, I don't.

1089
01:32:40,274 --> 01:32:43,107
You've been here, where I am.

1090
01:32:43,207 --> 01:32:45,139
No, I haven't.

1091
01:33:12,274 --> 01:33:14,107
I'm sorry.

1092
01:33:14,207 --> 01:33:17,841
But I haven't been more ill.

1093
01:33:17,941 --> 01:33:19,874
I have to change.

1094
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:20,907
No.

1095
01:33:21,007 --> 01:33:23,906
Yes. Oh, please.

1096
01:33:27,074 --> 01:33:29,006
You will!

1097
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,273
Out into the night,

1098
01:33:42,373 --> 01:33:46,073
And then good night again.

1099
01:33:46,173 --> 01:33:49,374
Oops!

1100
01:33:49,474 --> 01:33:53,240
Oh! The drinking of whisky
the drinking of gin...

1101
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,039
It's been very pleasant.

1102
01:34:01,474 --> 01:34:04,640
Would you mind
if I came around again?

1103
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:43,773
There. Hold me tight.

1104
01:35:41,574 --> 01:35:43,807
Jessica, aren't you coming with me?

1105
01:35:43,907 --> 01:35:45,740
Yes. On the 16th.

1106
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,574
I can't go on the english trip.

1107
01:35:47,674 --> 01:35:48,972
Oh, yes, you can.

1108
01:35:50,207 --> 01:35:52,872
Right then, everyone.
Good morning.

1109
01:35:54,107 --> 01:35:55,840
Window, please.

1110
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:58,373
Gosh. A dirty
blackboard already.

1111
01:36:06,907 --> 01:36:10,274
Where's Suzie, please?

1112
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:12,341
Anyone know?

1113
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:14,274
She's run away to London, miss.

1114
01:36:14,374 --> 01:36:17,974
With Alfred Egerton in science fifth.

1115
01:36:18,074 --> 01:36:20,973
Has she been in touch
with her parents?

1116
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:22,307
Yes, miss.
Good.

1117
01:36:22,407 --> 01:36:24,640
She said she couldn't
see the point of school.

1118
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,506
No?

1119
01:36:28,608 --> 01:36:31,873
Well, sometimes,
I have that problem.

1120
01:36:31,973 --> 01:36:34,007
Anyone else?

1121
01:36:34,107 --> 01:36:36,373
Anyone else want to go?

1122
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,974
Right, then.

1123
01:36:44,074 --> 01:36:46,807
For those of us still remaining...

1124
01:36:46,907 --> 01:36:50,807
Us maniacs, assorted
oddballs, eccentrics,

1125
01:36:50,907 --> 01:36:55,606
Folk who still think
education is worthwhile...

1126
01:36:55,706 --> 01:36:57,805
I suggest we keep trying.

1127
01:36:59,474 --> 01:37:01,473
All right, everyone?

1128
01:37:02,707 --> 01:37:04,640
Good.

1129
01:37:09,107 --> 01:37:11,039
Then, let's work.

1130
01:38:41,407 --> 01:38:43,340
How are you?

1131
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:50,074
How are you?

1132
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:52,106
I'm better.

1133
01:38:58,007 --> 01:38:59,939
How's Marcia?

1134
01:39:01,941 --> 01:39:03,872
Tremendous.

1135
01:39:05,441 --> 01:39:07,372
Oh, yes.

1136
01:39:09,207 --> 01:39:12,972
The charity bridge tournament
takes up all her time.

1137
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:43,174
When you're a boy, you think,
"oh, it's so easy."

1138
01:39:43,274 --> 01:39:46,139
Always wipe the slate and move on.

1139
01:39:47,874 --> 01:39:51,940
Then, with the years, you find

A girl ran away this morning.

01:39:55,707 --> 01:39:57,940

01:40:00,441 --> 01:40:02,706
