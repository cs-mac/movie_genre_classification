<i>Episode 19</i>

3
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,560
Why did you do it?

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,886
Why did you?

5
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,533
Why?

6
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,610
Shi Won.

7
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:37,386
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

8
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,346
You're not...

9
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,645
The son of the doctor?

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,346
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,684
Don't move.

12
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:34,570
Are you okay?

13
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,805
Who are you?

14
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,493
Who are you?

15
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,265
Trust me.

16
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,087
Stay here.

17
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:12,942
It was you?

18
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,320
It was you. Wasn't it?

19
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,231
You killed Kyung Mi.

20
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:25,425
Who are you?

21
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,289
No!

22
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,618
<i>How did it go?</i>

23
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:58,074
What happened?

24
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,237
How did you know about this?

25
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,185
I got the intel from the agency.

26
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:03,906
I see.

27
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,658
What happened to you, sir?

28
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,814
We didn't have time. We had to call the
SWAT team to take control first.

29
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:12,023
You could have told me.

30
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:15,598
Like you said, it could have been
too late if I did.

31
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,329
This was about catching Chairman Cho.

32
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:23,268
Unfortunately, we lost him.

33
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,108
But we found the narcotics factory.

34
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,466
Good work, sir.

35
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,365
It's too dangerous for you.

36
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:24,866
Why?

37
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,996
Because I know you? Or...

38
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:34,473
Because you know me?

39
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:39,437
I want to know more.
Can you tell me?

40
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,646
Why? Why did you save me?

41
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:51,103
My sister.

42
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:54,887
Did you really kill her?

43
00:07:56,253 --> 00:08:00,722
Why aren't you talking?
You don't even have an excuse?

44
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,435
I'm here thinking that
you killed my sister.

45
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:07,519
Why aren't you saying anything?

46
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,994
I...

47
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:19,242
I didn't kill Detective Lee Kyung Mi.

48
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,723
You could have told me earlier.

49
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:33,013
I could have killed you!

50
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:40,061
If I had shot you. If I had killed you.
How would I live with that?

51
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,255
It's been a long time.

52
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,862
Yes.

53
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,064
Please take a seat.

54
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:47,277
Forgive me for not being
cooperative with the police.

55
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,883
The fellows that escorted me here.

56
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:57,087
Are they your private team?

57
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:00,691
Did you enjoy the hospitality?

58
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:06,697
I did very much.
They were well-mannered.

59
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:15,105
I think we can really
get along from now on.

60
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:19,910
What do you think, Mr. Min?

61
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,513
I totally agree with you sir.

62
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:26,116
Do you now?

63
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:32,923
Then there is something I'd like for
you to take care of.

64
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:40,104
Take the attention away from me to
Moon and Doctor's Son.

65
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:45,335
How I will help you will

66
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:53,543
depend on how much you can
help me with this.

67
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:57,547
Mr. Cho.

68
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:02,352
Please cut the crap.

69
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:07,557
You're finished.

70
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:09,159
I'm sure that you've noticed.

71
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,763
Your bribed prosecutor
turned away from you.

72
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:15,766
The son of the doctor, Safari,
Moon Duk Bae, and Ji Hyung Min.

73
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,567
They are all out to get you.

74
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:21,571
That's why you called me to
beg for your protection.

75
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,974
Isn't that right?

76
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,579
If you want to live, you'd better
duly note what I have to say.

77
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:35,986
The only way for you to live is to
help me to attack the D.A.

78
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:42,593
You want to know about the district
attorney's secret closet.

79
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:48,398
Not just the D.A. The people
whose asses he kisses too.

80
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:50,601
Oh.

81
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:53,804
I will be protecting you from now on.

82
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:59,752
The service done by the prosecution
will now be done by the police with me.

83
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,613
I like the idea.

84
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:09,219
Unfortunately, Safari
took all those documents.

85
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,626
I'm sure that you have
the original copy.

86
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:19,029
Original copy?

87
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,831
There is no such thing.

88
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:25,035
You're the one hanging by
the string here. Not me.

89
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:38,849
You and I are in the same boat.

90
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,463
You killed Kyung Mi. Didn't you?

91
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:57,467
Who was it?

92
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,082
<i>I had no other choice.</i>

93
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:22,492
Are you sure that
he didn't see you?

94
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,293
Yes sir.

95
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:27,698
You couldn't handle the body?

96
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,899
I'm sorry, sir.

97
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:29,900
What about the phone?

98
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,302
The situation went badly.
I couldn't take care of it.

99
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:33,904
How did it go?

100
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,112
Go back and watch him.

101
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,715
Make sure that you don't get seen.

102
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,516
Yes sir.

103
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,156
Thank you.
For saving me.

104
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,378
Thanks.

105
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,985
I'm really glad that it wasn't you.

106
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:07,998
Hey.

107
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:11,401
You're drinking again?

108
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,804
Would you like some?

109
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:15,806
Sounds good.

110
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:27,017
What about the doctor?

111
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:29,620
No news yet.

112
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:32,823
Have you heard?

113
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:33,824
Hear what?

114
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:36,827
The narcotics factory that Kang Mok
wanted to get was fake.

115
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:41,431
Something big happened to the police and
the D.A.'s office at the same time.

116
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,433
Did you hear this from a friend?

117
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,835
There's something else.

118
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:48,839
Cho's original factory was
raided by the police.

119
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,842
It was done by Director Min.

120
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:53,043
Don't you think that it's strange?

121
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,845
What is?

122
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,247
Safari was working for Cho.

123
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,651
How did Min know about the factory?

124
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,900
Get out.

125
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,102
Yes ma'am.

126
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:05,515
Are you going to
make her like Hae Su?

127
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:12,121
You know the girl that saved your life.
Did Mr. Cho introduce her to you?

128
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:19,930
May I ask who that person is?

129
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,735
You know, the politician.

130
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,770
Staying with Ji Young Min
will be safer.

131
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,372
What about you then?

132
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,975
Go.

133
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:07,578
You're also in danger.

134
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,980
You can quit.

135
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,782
You're asking me to leave.

136
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,784
But why can't you quit?

137
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:18,188
Even if I'm not the one
that killed your sister

138
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:21,191
I'm still Doctor's Son.

139
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,194
Get out of the car.

140
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,624
As you all probably know, Kang Mok's
testimony was false.

141
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:58,009
We have found Cho's real factory with the
intel received from the secret agency.

142
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,430
Now that Cho has fled the scene

143
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,435
all we can do now is to prove
that the factory belongs to Cho.

144
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,638
Interrogate the staff
arrested at the factory.

145
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:11,041
We have to track all the documents
and cash the traffic of Bokam University.

146
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,644
Let's get going.

147
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:14,445
Inspector!

148
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,045
Yes?

149
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,848
Have we identified the dead body
found at the university?

150
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:18,649
No, not yet.

151
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:22,252
We're finger printing right now.
We will have it by tomorrow.

152
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:23,454
Report to me ASAP.

153
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,255
Yes, sir.

154
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:28,859
Yes?

155
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,261
Yoon Su Min will go in now.

156
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:37,668
Don't ever send her out again.

157
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:38,869
I'm counting on you.

158
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,071
I understand.

159
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:56,286
Why didn't you answer the phone?
Do you know how worried I was?

160
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,889
I'm sorry.

161
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:08,098
You didn't...

162
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,705
No, I couldn't shoot him.

163
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,914
He saved me.

164
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:29,319
The target was not the son of
the doctor, but it was you?

165
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:36,527
Yeah. He took the bullet for me.

166
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,929
His name is...

167
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,535
Jung Shi Won.

168
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:48,739
Jung Shi Won.

169
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:53,944
You had known him all along?

170
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:57,748
Yeah, but I didn't know that
he was Doctor's Son.

171
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,876
How?

172
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:01,552
When I worked at the convenient store...

173
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:09,960
Kyung Mi also knew Doctor's Son.

174
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,163
What are you talking about?

175
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:17,367
When he talked about Kyung Mi

176
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,970
he sounded like he had known her.

177
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,573
Su Min.

178
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:31,582
It's all over now.
You've done a great job.

179
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,586
I'm sorry for everything.

180
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:01,011
Wow! Just wow.

181
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,032
<i>Su Min! I have to get going.</i>

182
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,237
Keep the door locked.

183
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:32,843
Call me when you
have to go out. Okay?

184
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,845
Where are you going?

185
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,448
Where else? Work.

186
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:39,049
Call me if you need anything.

187
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,050
See you.

188
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,253
Wait.

189
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:46,457
I want to go see Ji Sook.

190
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,258
Can't I?

191
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:50,861
Su Min.

192
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,864
I think you'd better stay.

193
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:58,469
Just forget it and think about your safety.

194
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:03,874
Just for the last time.
I will just go see Ji Sook.

195
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,700
Hi Ji Sook.

196
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,502
Where are you?

197
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:34,905
<i>I'm at your office.</i>

198
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:37,508
Then come up to my room.

199
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,332
Sit down.

200
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:27,558
Can I borrow your clothes?

201
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:28,358
What?

202
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:29,159
No?

203
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,565
No, it's just.
You're clothes are better.

204
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:40,170
Yeah, my clothes are prettier.

205
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:43,974
Should we go out?

206
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:44,775
Where?

207
00:25:37,227 --> 00:25:39,029
Ji Sook.

208
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,634
Actually I...

209
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:46,437
Since when?

210
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:47,438
Huh?

211
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:53,844
How long have you
known Shi Won?

212
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:57,047
Tell me.

213
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,453
Before I had met you.

214
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,658
At the convenient store
that I used to work...

215
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:10,060
Was it since then?

216
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:13,063
I...

217
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:19,470
Do you love Shi Won?

218
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:28,078
Yes.

219
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,682
I'm sorry.

220
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,097
Su Min.

221
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,305
I'm sorry.

222
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,312
I'm really sorry.

223
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,527
I'm not ready yet.

224
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:24,334
Can you give me some time?

225
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:34,605
What happened at the factory?

226
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:36,807
Exactly what you saw.

227
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,809
Who did it?

228
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,211
Can you handle it
if I tell you?

229
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:42,413
Say it.

230
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:43,814
Yeah...

231
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:49,420
You're Doctor's Son.
There is nothing you can't do.

232
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:55,225
Who do you think sent
me as an undercover here?

233
00:28:56,827 --> 00:29:00,631
It was Min Hong Ki.
Did you know?

234
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:01,432
No.

235
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:03,033
Yeah.

236
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:11,660
It was Min Hong Ki that sent me
to Busan to get Cho at Busan.

237
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:13,243
It was him that abandoned me.

238
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:17,448
It was also Min Hong Ki that
tried to shoot and kill me today.

239
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:29,660
Then? Was it Cho that killed
Detective Lee Kyung Mi?

240
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:38,669
No, I lied so that you would help me.

241
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:43,273
Why? Why?

242
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:49,880
Why are you telling me now?

243
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,882
I'm sorry.

244
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:20,911
What are you doing?

245
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:24,915
How long are you going to work
for the man that killed your mother?

246
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:29,520
You will not be enrolled.

247
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:36,326
What will happen if Moon finds
out that you're a cop?

248
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:39,329
You will never be able to catch him.

249
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:42,733
You could even get killed.

250
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:46,937
Then your revenge...

251
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:54,745
You will be an undercover.

252
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:59,750
No one will know that you're a cop.

253
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,353
Your life will depend on it.

254
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:04,955
Do you understand?

255
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:09,359
Why did you send Kyung Mi there?

256
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,162
Who was it?
Who killed Kyung Mi?

257
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:20,771
We're currently investigating.
You're the prime suspect.

258
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:22,973
You have to join the
organization in Busan.

259
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:28,779
That's the only way you can get
Safari and Busan.

260
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:36,186
You have to find out
who killed Kyung Mi.

261
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,202
Shim An Ju. He was a former cop.

262
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:56,006
He got his hands on some drugs
while being undercover.

263
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,008
He was one of the best shooters
in the academy.

264
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:02,212
He had won all the competitions.

265
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,616
We couldn't find his rifle.
But a bullet shell was found on the rooftop.

266
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:08,419
7.62 mm NATO bullet shell.

267
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:17,027
Undercover, first-class sniper,
NATO bullet shell.

268
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,830
And sir...

269
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,835
He was part of the
narcotics team five years ago.

270
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:31,642
But it was Min Hong Ki
that organized the team.

271
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:40,851
Shim An Ju.
What about him?

272
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:44,655
I just want to know
how he's doing.

273
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:47,257
Shim.

274
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:51,462
I have never seen him after
he quit for something he had done.

275
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:54,064
Is that right?

276
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:56,266
Why do you ask?

277
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:59,069
He died yesterday.

278
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:02,473
Did he?

279
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:03,273
How?

280
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:08,479
He was found dead next to
Cho's narcotic factory.

281
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:13,684
Was he?

282
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:21,291
He ended up joining a cartel.

283
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,715
Ji Hyung Moo. That bastard.

284
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,380
I heard from Su Min.

285
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,980
Why did you save Su Min?

286
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:01,450
Because you were going to think that
I had killed her too.

287
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,390
You were right.

288
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,400
Shim An Ju was a former cop.
First-class sniper.

289
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Did you kill him?

290
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,200
Never mind.

291
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,210
You wouldn't have asked me to
look into him if you did.

292
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,610
Bye.

293
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,810
Shim An Ju killed Kyung Mi?

294
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,010
That's what I want to find out.

295
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,070
Orphanage director! Hi, this is Su Min.

296
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,680
Do you know Jung Shi Won?

297
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,280
<i>Jung Shi Won?
Of course I know him.</i>

298
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,680
<i>The smart kid.</i>

299
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,480
<i>He liked Kyung Mi a lot.</i>

300
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,290
<i>Kyung Mi liked him as if
he was her brother.</i>

301
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,490
<i>Of course, you wouldn't know.</i>

302
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,090
<i>He ran when you were just a baby.</i>

303
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,290
<i>That house! Kyung Mi's house.</i>

304
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,900
<i>Shi Won had bought that place for her.</i>

305
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,700
<i>Whenever Kyung Mi was going through
a hard time, he came to help.</i>

306
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,100
<i>Kyung Mi became a
cop because of Shi Won.</i>

307
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Get rid of her.

308
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,330
Yes, sir. Understood, sir.

309
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,140
Hi.

310
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,350
I'm sorry. I'm trespassing here.

311
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,960
Do you know Ju Young?

312
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,170
Ju Young likes you a lot.

313
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,970
Please take good care of her.

314
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,780
Can I wait here for a sec?

315
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
What the hell is wrong with you?

316
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm sorry.

317
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Are you betraying me
like Jung Shi Won did?

318
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
No sir. I'm not.

319
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,610
Remember! You're a cop.

320
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,210
Do you understand?

321
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,010
Yes, sir.

322
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,230
Go back and stand-by for the next order
before it looks suspicious.

323
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:13,640
The actually owner of the narcotics
factory turned himself in.

324
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,440
What do you think?

325
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,050
The D.A. has the final say like always.

326
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,460
I heard that you had found
Cho's factory yourself.

327
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,620
I just think that it's a pity that
your efforts have been wasted.

328
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,260
It was not in vain.

329
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,070
I got something more important.

330
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:48,670
About the information
between you and Cho.

331
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,680
It was very useful.

332
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,280
It even has information about Senator Cha
being behind your back.

333
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,880
Excuse me Min!

334
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,090
I think you'd better keep it quiet.

335
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,490
Fine. What is it that you want?

336
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,100
You want me to back away?

337
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,500
I'm finally seeing your true colors.

338
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,500
You can't back out now.

339
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,510
There is only one thing that I want.

340
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,910
I want the police to have equal
power as the D.A.'s office.

341
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:34,380
It is thanks to the D.A. that
Korea has gotten so corrupt.

342
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,720
You should choose
your words carefully.

343
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,330
Corruption?

344
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,930
Don't you know that that word
isn't even allowed in this world?

345
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,390
What the people want, and
what they live for...

346
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,940
Think about where the
people place their values.

347
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,950
Do you think that the police can fulfill that?

348
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:06,350
People like you are only
making the world more chaotic.

349
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:11,360
You don't understand what we
have been sacrificing for.

350
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,160
I had maintained the
orders and values.

351
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:24,970
Fine! I will acknowledge your work so far.

352
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,570
But it's about time that we change.

353
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,780
I will make the change.

354
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:38,380
You will need to help me
from now on.

355
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,390
See you.

356
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,210
<i>Sir?</i>

357
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:16,220
Min lost his last chance.
Do you know what I mean?

358
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,020
I understand.

359
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,630
<i>Do not make a mistake.</i>

360
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,830
Yes, sir.

361
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,230
What did he say?

362
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,830
Is it serious?

363
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,640
You don't need to know.

364
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
I need to go out.

365
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,650
Where are you going?

366
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,050
Kim Pong.

367
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,650
Sir?

368
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,860
Just go back home and farm.

369
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,900
What happened?

370
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,300
Were you worried about me?

371
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
Worried, my ass.

372
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,710
I haven't seen anyone as
vicious as you are.

373
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,930
There is nothing to worry about.

374
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:45,410
You didn't worry just one bit?

375
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,110
<i>Geez.</i>

376
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:52,520
I get sick sometimes too.

377
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,320
What happened at the factory?

378
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,120
Min Hong Ki came to the factory.

379
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,930
And?

380
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:07,330
It's better for you that
Min Hong Ki raided the place.

381
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,140
That's good enough. Isn't it?

382
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,140
What are you talking about?

383
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Min Hong Ki.

384
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:26,750
You think I didn't know
about you and Min Hong Ki?

385
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,360
<i>Whatever.</i>

386
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,960
Min Hong Ki and me...

387
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,770
We are all just losers to you.

388
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,570
Jin Sook.

389
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,970
Why?

390
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,170
I love you.

391
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:05,390
I love you, but you
wouldn't understand.

392
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,050
Yeah.

393
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,050
I have something to say.

394
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:03,850
What?

395
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:09,460
What should I do with Cho?

396
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,460
What do you mean?

397
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,060
It will be hard to get
Cho now. Won't it?

398
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
But we still have to do it.

399
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,260
I had been thinking.

400
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,470
I'm just going to kill Cho.

401
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,870
Shi Won.

402
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,680
I will.

403
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
We need to talk.

404
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,690
I have something to tell you in person.

405
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,910
Mr. Cho?

406
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,310
Yes?

407
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:06,710
I found out where the doctor's son is.

408
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,320
Really? That's great news.

409
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,740
<i>Shi Won! Look!</i>

410
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Hey Ju Young!

411
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,610
Su Min! Ki Cheol wanted me
to tell you something.

412
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,610
Where?

413
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,010
Okay.

414
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,020
It's me.

415
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,820
Yeah.

416
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,420
Okay. I will be right there.

417
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,090
<i>Shi Won! Look over there.</i>

418
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,560
Damn it.

419
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,370
I knew this would happen.

420
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,400
Are you all right?

421
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,600
Damn! Damn it!

422
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,410
Let me take a look.

423
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,420
Ki Cheol.

424
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,220
Sorry, boss.

425
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,830
Was it Min?

426
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
Sorry.

427
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,450
Answer me! Answer...

428
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,260
If you were going to betray me, then you should
have done it before I noticed.

429
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,490
Mister!

430
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,900
I'm fine.

431
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,300
Shi Won!

432
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,900
The doctor's son! Jung Shi Won.

433
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:46,710
Take this. I don't
need this anymore.

434
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,510
You can use it.

435
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,320
It's all in here.

436
00:53:52,320 --> 00:54:01,340
There is a list of everyone that
received bribes from Cho.

437
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,730
Take it.

438
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:16,940
You went through a
lot of trouble for me.

439
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,150
This is my token of appreciation.

440
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:27,350
Shi Won! Why did you
become a cop?

441
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:30,560
To get revenge?

442
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,160
I'm sorry.

443
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,760
That's enough.

444
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:51,380
I just regret that I
couldn't get Min Hong Ki.

445
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,180
So why did you abandon me?

446
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,390
When?

447
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:07,390
Oh back then?

448
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,000
Because I felt bad.

449
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,400
I was the one that
got you in this mess.

450
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,610
I felt so bad that I couldn't
tell you that I was a cop.

451
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,010
I'm sorry.

452
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,220
Geez...

453
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,620
Shi Won.

454
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,430
Mister!

455
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,030
Wake up! Hey!

456
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,630
Wake up!

457
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,640
Hey!

458
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:58,640
Why couldn't I just leave you alone?

459
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:06,050
Why couldn't I just leave?

460
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:21,060
I should have just left when I thought
that it was going on the wrong tracks.

461
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:25,070
Why couldn't I?

462
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,480
Let's go to Ji Sook.

463
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,690
I miss her.

464
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,300
Okay.

465
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,510
What the hell?

466
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,710
What happened?

467
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,520
What happened to him?

468
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:23,530
What happened to him?

469
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,940
Hey!

470
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,150
Wake up.

471
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,550
Wake up!

472
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,960
Stop kidding around and wake up.

473
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,560
Wake up!

474
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,970
I'm calling you!

475
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,770
I'm calling you!

476
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,970
I'm calling you!

477
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,380
Wake up!

478
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,180
Wake up now you asshole!

479
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:32,400
What should I do?
What should I do?

480
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Shi Won!

481
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:41,610
I feel so bad for him.
I feel so bad.

482
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:10,440
Yeah, it was me.

483
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:17,140
<i>You were trying to kill me right?</i>

484
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,750
<i>You betrayed the police.</i>

485
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,650
I did?

486
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,650
<i>Yes.</i>

487
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,860
There is something I really
want to ask you.

488
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,470
Why did you do it?

489
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,870
Do what?

490
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,270
Kyung Mi.

491
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,880
<i>You promised that you
would protect Kyung Mi.</i>

492
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:02,290
Why? Why?

493
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:11,100
I did so to protect you.

494
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,100
Kyung Mi knew about you more than anyone.

495
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,900
Everything would have been over
the minute you were exposed!

496
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,310
The undercover agent, Safari, and Busan!

497
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,710
Everything would have been over!

498
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,110
I had to protect you.

499
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,910
I had done it all to protect you!
Do you understand?

500
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,410
No.

501
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,720
That wasn't for me.

502
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,330
It was for your own good.

503
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:49,130
I just wanted to change
this corrupted world.

504
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,340
Stop!

505
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,550
Don't you say another word from now.
I'm the one talking.

506
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:11,160
I will not forgive you.

507
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,360
So...

508
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,160
<i>Don't you dare have regrets or
ask for forgiveness.</i>

509
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:23,370
Just stay where you are.

510
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,570
I will kill you.

511
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:33,180
You are going to betray me?

512
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:43,990
Okay, fine. Try.

513
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:47,390
I'll kill you first.

514
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,800
Just wait.

515
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,610
Yeah, take your shot.

516
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:20,010
