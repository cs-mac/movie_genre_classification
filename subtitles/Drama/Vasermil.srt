1
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,256
Keto!

2
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,626
Keto! Where are you?

3
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,328
Got a cigarette, bro?

4
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,566
Where is she now?
I'm done for.

5
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,281
Keto!

6
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,483
Where the fuck is she?
Fuck it!

7
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,434
Keto!

8
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,685
Dima, take me for a spin.
Get out of here.

9
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,596
C'mon, take me for a ride.

10
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,427
If you fuck with me,
I'll screw your mother.

11
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,126
- Understand?
- Okay.

12
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,983
What the...?

13
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,155
Son of a bitch!

14
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,449
- Did you see who that was?
- No.

15
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,516
Damn it!

16
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,927
- Are you stupid?
- I swear to you, I saw nothing.

17
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,707
Didn't I tell you
not to go there?

18
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,185
What were you looking for?

19
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,347
Are you gonna answer
today or what?

20
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,288
It's always either school
or soccer.

21
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,656
There's a limit to how much
I can take, Mr. Shlomi.

22
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,422
Give me a break.

23
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,293
I've got hungry clients
and only two scooters,

24
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,127
what do you mean
give me a break?

25
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,791
Why haven't
the orders left yet?

26
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,098
They're going out,
stop yelling already.

27
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,661
Haim, I need to work.

28
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,264
I swear, I was on my way
to the address.

29
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,536
Did you lock it?

30
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,840
Sure.
Don't you know me, Haim?

31
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,540
I can work on the counter.

32
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,083
- I need the money.
- $0 do I.

33
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,814
Fuck you, you're all trouble.
You're breaking my heart.

34
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,288
Easy now!

35
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,350
Go home. I've got no wheels
for you. We'll see later.

36
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,862
Why are you still here?

37
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
C'mon, let's go.
What do you mean let's go!

38
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,423
No one is giving rides here.

39
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,058
Calm down, I'll walk.

40
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:40,196
Don't tell me to calm down,
I'll fuck you in the ass, come here!

41
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,400
If you come here again,
I'll take your eye out.

42
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,340
Who needs your fucking place?

43
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,709
Pay me what you owe me and you
won't see me again, you fat fuck.

44
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,908
Pay for the scooter first.
I'll give you money for a tombstone.

45
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,417
If it wasn't for your father,
you'd be dead now.

46
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,750
- Don't talk about my father, asshole.
- I'll say What I Want.

47
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,414
What's so funny, you fuck?
Beat it!

48
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,254
- Get out of here, you fat bastard.
- Asshole motherfucker!

49
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:05,423
You too? Come here!
Where are you going? C'mon.

50
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,965
Come back here!

51
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:09,301
- Adiel, goal.
- He's alone again?

52
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,327
- Adiel, goal.
- He's alone again?

53
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,704
You call yourself a goalie?

54
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,682
Don't let him through.
Guard him, guard him.

55
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,787
Look at him go.

56
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,615
Watch him go past all of you.
What a goal.

57
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,388
He got it in
right between your legs.

58
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,793
- Start playing.
- It's over, we Won.

59
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,923
Wasn't there an extension?

60
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,934
We said one extension.
Me and Adiel gotta go.

61
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,165
- You're going, Adiel?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

62
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,332
Meir, you owe me a game.

63
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,878
Next time whoever plays against Adiel
gets three points in advance.

64
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,848
- Naomi, are you going home?
- Yes, are you coming?

65
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,946
Do you mind taking Yonatan?

66
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,253
- Okay. C'mon.
- Thanks.

67
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,507
Here.

68
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,645
Did you see
how pissed off he was?

69
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,179
It's cause you always win.
He's just a shitty player.

70
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,316
He thinks he's Rolandinio.

71
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,520
How can he talk that way
because of soccer?

72
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,955
You do, you always win.

73
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,697
You should play on a real team.

74
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,935
You're talking nonsense.

75
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,369
C'mon, Meir, let's go.
I'm hungry.

76
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,218
Listen. bro.

77
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,322
I'm dead tired.

78
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,169
- Say...
- What?

79
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,731
What's with Naomi?

80
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,801
I think she likes you.

81
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,541
She wants you
to make her feel good.

82
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,545
Check it out.

83
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,679
Wow, just like Africa.

84
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:55,057
One love, one heart,

85
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,324
Let's get together...

86
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,991
What? What's the matter?

87
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,133
What's so funny?

88
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,503
Africa?
You were born right here.

89
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,222
Beautiful.

90
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,127
I like that song.

91
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,032
How about it, Eva?
Does your brother play Well?

92
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,070
Let's go to sleep.

93
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,504
- Give me a piggyback ride.
- C'mon, piggyback.

94
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,851
Good night.

95
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,443
Check this out.

96
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
You think it's a pizza?

97
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,320
I swear it is.

98
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,322
God sent it.

99
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,809
How long has this been here?

100
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,869
I don't know.

101
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,438
- I don't care, I'm hungry.
- Me too.

102
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,779
You thought I Wouldn't find you,
you bastards?

103
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,287
- Pizza, eh? You Want pizza. Here!
- We didn't do it.

104
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:13,161
- Then who did? Tell me.
- We found the scooter here.

105
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,167
Who dared to steal the scooter?
Who?

106
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,328
Talk, you fuck!
Tell me who took it, talk!

107
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,237
- Leave him alone.
- Fuck off!

108
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,140
- You son of a bitch.
- Let him go, Shlomi!

109
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,576
We found the bike, enough!

110
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,183
Move.

111
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,886
Are you okay?

112
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,323
C'mon, get up.

113
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,885
C'mon, let's go.

114
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,557
- Wait. Let him apologize.
- Are you crazy?

115
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,123
- What did you say?
- Nothing, nothing.

116
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,533
- Apologize.
- I'll kill you, I swear.

117
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,904
Can't you see they're stoned?
Enough already!

118
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,138
Take your friend
before things get out of hand.

119
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,442
- We're not thieves, you hear me?
- But you're a fucking nigger.

120
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,109
Enough already.

121
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,845
Move.

122
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,552
Son of a bitch!

123
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,652
- You think it's in good condition?
- I think so.

124
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,698
Take it to Haim
tomorrow morning.

125
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,331
I'm so tired.

126
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,201
I work the morning shift
tomorrow.

127
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,071
- Did you work the evening shift today?
- Yeah.

128
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,474
I love when you play that song.

129
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,573
It's so beautiful.

130
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,448
- It's always the same song.
- So what?

131
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,421
It's beautiful.

132
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,491
By the way,
Where were you today?

133
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,655
Sophi called.

134
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,891
Sophi called? Yes.

135
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,992
I'll talk to her.
She shouldn't have called.

136
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,401
Thank God she did.

137
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,406
You have to stop cutting school
and start studying.

138
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,135
You want to be like your father?

139
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,700
I won't be like him.

140
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,440
So stop cutting school
and start studying.

141
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,473
I'll be okay. I'm saving money.
I'll go to Germany.

142
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,076
Uncle Jenia
will arrange everything.

143
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,553
Why are you laughing?

144
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,590
Germany...

145
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,716
you're such a boy, Dima.

146
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,775
Hello.
What took you so long

147
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,810
to get here?

148
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,436
Smart ass.

149
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,648
Hi.
Hi.

150
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,744
- How are things?
- Okay.

151
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,914
Thank God.

152
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,782
I'm so tired.

153
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,954
Does Daddy get a kiss?

154
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,602
Vlada, stop it, the boy's here.

155
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,497
Boy, why aren't you asleep?

156
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,474
Go to sleep.

157
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,773
You go to sleep.
Look at yourself.

158
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,474
Just like your papa.

159
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,006
Don't dare talk about my father,
you idiot.

160
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,610
Please, not in front of the kids.

161
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,451
Don't make noise,
Eva is asleep.

162
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,990
"Eva is asleep."

163
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,583
You only care
about these lazy bums.

164
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,528
- You don't give a damn about me.
- Don't talk to her that way.

165
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,532
See? That's your upbringing.

166
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,761
Is that any way to talk to a father?

167
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,736
What are you talking about?
Have you found a job yet?

168
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,340
A job?

169
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,805
Do you really give a damn

170
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,505
- if I find a job or not?
- Vlada...

171
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,207
Why don't you teach me
how to live?

172
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,273
stand up when you talk
to your father.

173
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,650
- Stop it. Please, Eva is asleep.
- Don't touch me.

174
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,417
- Calm down.
- Is this how you brought him up?

175
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,583
Is this any way to talk
to a father?

176
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,627
You're all against me.

177
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,255
What are you looking at?

178
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,662
Vlada, please,
this isn't necessary.

179
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,996
He's sitting there, staring at me.

180
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,896
Dima, where are you going?

181
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,440
He's a lazy bum.

182
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,272
- Dima, stop.
- How can you?

183
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,870
What are you whispering
out there?

184
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,383
Dima, please,
go to sophi tomorrow.

185
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,784
- Please, for me...
- How can you? How?

186
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,488
Dima, don't stay out late.

187
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,529
Let him go--
stinking piece of shit.

188
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,559
Go to your Germany already.

189
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,063
- Go to your Germany.
- I'll go to my Germany.

190
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,633
And what will you do here?
You'll crawl on your knees

191
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,906
begging me to take you
to Germany.

192
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,914
Dimwit.

193
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,417
- Did you run away from them?
- No, I Went for the hills.

194
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,958
- Then I saw it.
- What did you see?

195
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,561
It's 9:00 already.
You have to go to sleep, c'mon.

196
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,188
No, tell me what you saw.

197
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,290
I'll tell you tomorrow. It's late.
Mom will be mad.

198
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,995
Mom doesn't care.
All she does is sleep.

199
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,167
Okay, but promise,
not a word to anyone.

200
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,302
I promise.
Don't just promise, swear to God.

201
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,972
No, it's not allowed
to swear to God.

202
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,516
So swear on my life.

203
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,678
I swear on your life.
Go on, tell me.

204
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,348
You know the antenna?
That new tower in the fields,

205
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,790
- the one you can see from the pitch.
- The blue one?

206
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,326
It's not an antenna.

207
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,658
- What is it?
- It's a rocket.

208
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,858
No way, in the fields.
There are no guards.

209
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,130
I know. I wondered
Why there were no guards.

210
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,639
But I noticed the tennis court guard
keeping an eye on it.

211
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,833
Besides, this way it doesn't
arouse suspicion.

212
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,469
- So?
- I climbed the tower

213
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,571
- Do you know how high it is?
- What did you see?

214
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,242
There was a rocket inside,
a huge silver rocket.

215
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,444
I was blinded by it.

216
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,646
Really? Swear.

217
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,313
- I swear.
- Whose rocket is it?

218
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,688
It's our rocket, Israel's.

219
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,284
I think it can reach outer space.
Outer space.

220
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,727
Who's gonna fly it?
Who's gonna be the pilot?

221
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,526
What do you mean, who?

222
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,898
Little Yonatan ran to the garden...

223
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,367
C'mon, let's go.
Mom will be worried.

224
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,581
Besides,
you have to go to sleep.

225
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,785
- Are you all set?
- Yes.

226
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,502
Adiel, will you take me
to the rocket?

227
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,371
Sure I will.

228
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,637
Good night.

229
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,679
Adiso, bring me
a glass of water.

230
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,929
Here.

231
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,398
Is Yonatan asleep?

232
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,440
Yes.

233
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,805
I'll be back soon.

234
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,910
Where are you going?

235
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,615
That woman called again.

236
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,916
I've had enough.

237
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,494
You have to study.

238
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,794
Look at your brother Joseph.

239
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,802
Why can't you be more like him?

240
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,566
I'm not going back
to the Yeshiva boarding school.

241
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,938
So study, don't bum around.

242
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,772
Okay, Mom, I'm going out.

243
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,778
Don't be late.

244
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,747
You're taking Yonatan to school.

245
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,011
I'm going
to the doctor in the morning.

246
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,417
Okay, good night.

247
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,114
Good night.

248
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,459
Last card.

249
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,064
- I won this time.
- Well done, Sivan...

250
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,473
I think she's cheating.

251
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,170
Me?

252
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,873
No way.

253
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,540
- One more game.
- Okay.

254
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,680
And you, how are you?

255
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,618
She's all right.

256
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,919
- Can't Mom answer?
- Stop it, both of you.

257
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,928
- Itzik, Why don't you come back home?
- No Way.

258
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,199
I'm all right.
Don't Worry about me.

259
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,667
- How's school, Sivan?
- Okay.

260
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,227
- All of a sudden, you're interested.
- Enough, Shlomi.

261
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,242
Sivan, sweetheart, go to bed.
ltzik will come to say good night.

262
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,574
- You'll come?
- Sure I will.

263
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,613
Go on.

264
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,251
Good night, sweetheart.

265
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,581
Good night.

266
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,486
Aren't you going to say
goodnight to Daddy, Sivan?

267
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,494
Come here, sweetie.

268
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,526
Good night.

269
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,526
Since when is he her father?

270
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,571
Since you stopped being
her brother.

271
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,836
- You better watch it!
- ltzik, enough, please.

272
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,907
She's only got one father.
What's the story?

273
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,847
And you stand by
and say nothing?

274
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,318
And you come here
and pretend you care?

275
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,823
- Stop it, both of you.
- It's my house, you little punk.

276
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,622
- Itzik, please, enough.
- Get out of here.

277
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,239
Take it.

278
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,414
How's soccer?

279
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,543
Will you try to get
into Hapoel team this year?

280
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,643
Maybe. I don't know.

281
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,120
Why don't you tell him to stop
and go to school.

282
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,590
- He only has soccer on his mind.
- Cut it out, Mom. Enough.

283
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,787
- He stopped going to school?
- He goes and does nothing.

284
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,263
You want me to learn bullshit?

285
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,300
Why? It's not a trade?

286
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,132
Now you're on my case too?

287
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,468
Let's see you
when I make the pros.

288
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,872
Pros!
You've raised the new Pele.

289
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,466
Maradona.

290
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,940
Okay, get off my back.
What about you?

291
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,384
Where did you disappear
for two weeks without a word?

292
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,717
When are you coming
back home?

293
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,358
It'll be okay.

294
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,663
Go say goodnight to Sivan.
She really misses you.

295
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,774
- What's up?
- Come here for a second.

296
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,444
Wow! Someone
got a hell of a beating.

297
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,316
Meir, you abandoned
your friend?

298
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,948
No way,
that prick really fucked me up.

299
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,753
Why don't you go in?

300
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,351
The Russian bastard won't let us in.

301
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:27,296
Who did you call a bastard?
I'll be damned if I let you in now.

302
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,696
Yehuda, that's not nice.

303
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,168
He won't let us in.
He's a piece of shit.

304
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,899
Now, you won't get in
even with your mother.

305
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,736
Don't talk about my mother,
understand?

306
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,300
Shut up, Yehuda.
What's wrong with you?

307
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,744
Calm down. Here.

308
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,552
Some friends you've got.

309
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,387
Forget him. He's all fucked up.
Are the girls inside?

310
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,222
Ages ago.
she asked about you.

311
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,354
Can we go in?
Without Yehuda.

312
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,365
And don't make a racket.

313
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,848
You kept me waiting forever.

314
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,641
C'mon, what's with you?

315
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,953
- Do you love me?
- sure I do.

316
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,922
- What do you think this is?
- What do you want from me?

317
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,981
If my clad finds out about this,
he'll murder me.

318
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,354
- Do you love me?
- That has nothing to do with it.

319
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,058
Sure it does. If you were
really in love, you'd...

320
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,534
- Cut it out, Adi.
- But you promised.

321
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,868
We've been together
for four months already.

322
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,137
- It has nothing to do with it.
- sure it does.

323
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,168
Look at Jacob and Edna.

324
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,705
Jacob and Edna?
What did Jacob tell you?

325
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,082
Tell Jacob not to blab so much.

326
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:32,613
Okay, forget Jacob.
What about Sarit and that guy?

327
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,181
Sarit?

328
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,751
You want me to sleep around
like she does?

329
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,319
Go to her, go ahead.

330
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,297
What's gotten into you today?

331
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,807
Will you come tomorrow?

332
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,775
I'll see if my dad lets me.

333
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,836
You're such a little girl.
We're going to the Chika Club.

334
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,178
My dad doesn't like me
going out on Sabbath eve.

335
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,511
But everyone's coming.

336
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,887
Well?

337
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,924
We'll see.

338
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,773
Haim!

339
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,557
It doesn't look too good.

340
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,869
Give me the key.

341
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,473
Who took it?

342
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,838
I thought it was the Ethiopians,
but I'm not sure now.

343
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,537
- What do you want, eh?
- What are you doing?

344
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:04,241
You want to make amends,
you assfucker.

345
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,580
- Are you nuts?
- Now you need me, right?

346
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,587
- Get off me!
- You threaten me?

347
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,555
You owe me a month's salary,
you prick!

348
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,616
I'll fuck you and your brother,
you fucking smalltime punk.

349
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,857
- Why are you hitting him?
- Mind your own business, Drora.

350
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,455
Shame on you!
You'd better watch out!

351
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,434
Are you crazy? Get off him!
Esther!

352
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,629
Esther,
your brother's gone berserk.

353
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,730
Haim, what are you doing?

354
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,240
Haim, leave him alone.

355
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,435
What are you doing, Haim?
Leave him alone.

356
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,068
What are you doing?

357
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,238
Son of a bitch.
What are you doing?

358
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,782
Look What he did to the bike.
Let me through.

359
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,613
He's only a boy.
Are you crazy?

360
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,119
- I'll smash your face in.
- Motherfucker.

361
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,624
Watch your mouth.
Get into the store I said, get in!

362
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,560
Haim, get into the store!

363
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,562
Son of a bitch.

364
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,495
Are you crazy? Beating a kid!

365
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,093
You want to get arrested again?

366
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,967
- Get into the store already.
- Okay.

367
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,371
Bring me a glass of water.

368
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,349
Are you religious?

369
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,985
No.

370
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,893
So why the yarmulke?

371
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,591
No special reason.

372
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,099
You put it on your head
for no reason?

373
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,137
I went to a religious school
before I came here.

374
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,503
- So you believe in God.
- Yes. I mean...

375
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:41,375
I'm a Rastafarian, it's the same God
but like... a little different.

376
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,504
How can I explain it to you...

377
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,207
It's complicated, eh?

378
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,878
Not at all. Rasta is for peace,
love, that kind of stuff.

379
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,828
So you're not Jewish.

380
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,887
I'm as Jewish as you are.

381
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,591
I'm not Jewish.

382
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,691
Is your mother Jewish?

383
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,202
- Yes.
- So you're Jewish.

384
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,974
There is no God.

385
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,312
Come in.

386
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:31,226
Okay. I wanted to speak
to you because...

387
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,696
You're aware of the situation.

388
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,666
Both of you don't come
to school regularly--

389
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,794
- I was here this week.
- Dima, don't interrupt me.

390
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,864
I don't think you're aware
of the gravity of the situation.

391
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,673
This is your last chance
and it's an understatement.

392
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:52,239
So I've asked Mann--
who knows you-- to help.

393
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,444
- I have a comment.
- Yes, Dima.

394
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,147
I'd like the protocol to show
that I don't play soccer.

395
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,689
Okay, we heard you.

396
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,157
Now you listen to me
for a change, both of you.

397
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,923
From now on
you're my responsibility.

398
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:08,659
You come to school every clay
and report to me.

399
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,362
At the end of the day you come back,
so I can see your pretty faces.

400
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,204
In the afternoon you go to
the community center for practice.

401
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:22,212
If you cut school or miss practice
once, you're finished.

402
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,646
- If you check the protocol--
- Dima!

403
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,981
There is no protocol.
There are two paths,

404
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,782
one leads to Matan;
the other one, out.

405
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,754
Don't worry.
We'll find something for you.

406
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,818
Adiel.

407
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,921
What do you want,
I'm on your team already.

408
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,989
On my team?

409
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,591
You haven't shown up
for practice for two weeks.

410
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,795
They don't pass me the ball.

411
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,501
If they don't pass it, come to me.
It's no reason not to come.

412
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,911
What have you decided?

413
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,677
Will you forget everything?

414
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,582
It's up to you.

415
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,014
I want you to know
that I don't play soccer.

416
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,719
Very good.

417
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:13,594
- See you on the court at 3:00.
- But it's Friday.

418
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,429
Don't worry. You'll get
to the synagogue on time.

419
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,196
Go on, out.

420
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,169
Dima, wait here for a minute.

421
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,368
Adiel, Adiel.

422
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,647
- How's your mom?
- Okay.

423
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,809
- Did it Work out with the doctor?
- Yes, I think so.

424
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,821
Adiel, you know
you can always talk to me.

425
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,652
Go to class.

426
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,652
You promised
not to talk to my mom.

427
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,856
I didn't see you all week.

428
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,826
Your mom said that you started
playing the piano again. Is that true?

429
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,930
I don't know
What you're talking about.

430
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,966
We talked about you performing
at the Memorial Day ceremony.

431
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,171
What?
What did you talk about?

432
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,941
I won't play.

433
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,643
It made her very happy.

434
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,653
She said you play
"Friendship" beautifully.

435
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,281
I promised her that you
would play it at the ceremony.

436
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:16,316
How could you have said that?
Can I go?

437
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,862
I told Orna you'd come
to rehearsals on Sunday.

438
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,898
Dima...

439
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,459
you're an intelligent boy.

440
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,267
It's your last chance. It would be
hard to convince the principal

441
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,706
- if this doesn't work out.
- It won't!

442
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,476
Hi, Dima, what's up?
Did you bring me some?

443
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,455
Forgot to do your homework?

444
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,790
What's up?
I looked for you this morning.

445
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,921
- They said you're--
- What?

446
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,931
- You're being kicked out of school"
- So?

447
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,399
- I thought--
- That I don't want the money?

448
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,095
No, that you weren't up to it.

449
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,799
Listen, they're not kicking me out
and I'm up to it. Give me my money!

450
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,671
But I don't have it on me.

451
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,474
Wait. Dima,
What are you doing? Wait!

452
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,523
- You said 51.
- shut up!

453
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,850
You think I'm playing games?
I'm not.

454
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,123
I'll slice open the next one
who fucks with me.

455
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,028
I'm not your friend.

456
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,265
Fuck.

457
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,669
Dima, wait a minute, Dima.

458
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,674
- Did you bring me any?
- What?

459
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,175
You know.

460
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,814
- C'mon.
- Where's the money?

461
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,550
- Is that all?
- I'll sort you out, you know.

462
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,744
Matan, how come there's
practice on Friday?

463
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,614
Got a problem with it,
Eldad?

464
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,678
If you do, you can go home
for Kiddush.

465
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,082
You all know Adiel.

466
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,228
And this is Dima.

467
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,256
Guys, we've finalized the terms
for the Independence Day tournament.

468
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,567
It's been decided that the team
waiting for us at the finals is

469
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,006
Hapoel Be'er Sheva youth,
coached by Jackie Dekel.

470
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,478
Enough.

471
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,278
I spoke to Jackie personally
and he promised to be there

472
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,841
and keep his eyes wide open.

473
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,853
So, that's why you brought
these two?

474
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:57,979
Shlomi...

475
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,489
You speak when I ask you to,
is that clear?

476
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,186
As the captain of the team...

477
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,455
on behalf of everyone, I say
that we don't need the Ethiopian.

478
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,093
He hasn't practiced for ages...
Adiel, sit down.

479
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,338
I've got news for you, captain.

480
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,842
His name is Adiel,
and he'd better not only adjust,

481
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,643
but become a part of the team.

482
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,478
Is that clear?

483
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,150
10 laps to warm up.
Go on, beat it!

484
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,625
Why 10? Damn...

485
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,493
Adiel, pass the ball,
don't do it alone!

486
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,507
It's okay, nothing happened.
Get, up! Continue.

487
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,356
Hey, what is this?

488
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,954
Why am I here?

489
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,591
You?

490
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,430
You're in charge
of team administration.

491
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:55,563
You bring water,
clean the locker room,

492
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,906
take care of the balls, nets.
You do everything I don't want to.

493
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,278
No problem, Dima.

494
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,080
One phone call to Sophi,
then your mother and it's all over.

495
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,452
Just give me a reason.

496
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,754
What's wrong with you, Matan?
I'm getting drinks, it's hot.

497
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,021
With plenty of ice, Dima.

498
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,863
Listen good.

499
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,270
Adiel better be here on Sunday
or I'm canceling the tournament.

500
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,536
Do you understand me?

501
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,840
I'll forfeit our spot.

502
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,539
Am I responsible
for the Ethiopian?

503
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,777
Shlomi, if you continue this,
you're off the team too.

504
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,445
He'd better show up for practice
on Sunday. Understand?

505
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:51,657
Okay, pay attention.

506
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,755
I managed to set up a practice game
on Sunday with Brom

507
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,891
from the job placement league.

508
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,632
Get a good rest on Saturday

509
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,937
'cause from now on there's
no fooling around. Any questions?

510
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,307
- Have a good Sabbath.
- Have a good Sabbath.

511
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,317
Does it hurt?
I saw What they did to you.

512
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,190
They didn't do anything.

513
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,492
Blind is he who chooses
not to see.

514
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,963
- Are you going to the synagogue?
- No.

515
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,529
- The Yarmulke is back...
- What do you Want from me?

516
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,574
I don't want anything.

517
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,239
You shouldn't let those jerks
get away with it.

518
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,840
We Rastas believe
that only serenity brings peace.

519
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,613
Doesn't Rasta tell you to fuck
whoever wants to fuck you first?

520
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,713
Whoever wants to make you his slave
isn't worth playing soccer for?

521
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,155
Who's a slave?

522
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,285
Don't think I don't see you
selling ecstasy and stuff on Fridays.

523
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,387
Hey, better watch
what you're saying!

524
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,024
You think they took you
because of your pretty face?

525
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,091
These people just use you
and throw you away.

526
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,694
And you sell ecstasy
because of my pretty face?

527
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,703
Just a slave.

528
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,993
How long do we have
to Wait for you?

529
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,325
Nobody asked you to wait.

530
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,661
The way you look,
I shouldn't have waited.

531
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,724
shut your mouth.
Who told you to come anyway?

532
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,066
Enough! Are you changing here
or at Chika's?

533
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,197
- We're not changing at the club.
- Hurry up.

534
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,732
- Why are you so uptight?
- Let's sit down.

535
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,547
Wow, Dima.

536
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,387
See that blonde?

537
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,586
I'd screw her.

538
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,991
Forget it.

539
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,194
I'd fuck her...

540
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,632
real good.

541
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,351
Everything"; cool...

542
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,494
Talk to me

543
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,365
before I go to the Forum.

544
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,425
Chill out.

545
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,598
Careful the vodka
doesn't go to your head.

546
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,665
Relax, everything will be okay.

547
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,059
Great music.

548
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,254
You have to drink that?

549
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,456
It's nothing. Why ruin things?

550
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:55,169
Can't you enjoy yourself without it?
You're like all the stoners here.

551
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,503
Anyone who heard you
would think you're a saint.

552
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,978
What did you say?
You have a problem?

553
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,982
I don't have a problem.
I'm having a good time.

554
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,177
Everybody enjoys Watching you
dance that Way.

555
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,346
What?
You never complained before.

556
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,222
Why should I? You look good.
Everyone likes to watch bitches, no?

557
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,260
Get away from me.

558
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,239
Is everything okay?

559
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,277
I told you my boyfriend is here.

560
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,441
This is your boyfriend?

561
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,810
This is your boyfriend.

562
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,411
- You can come along if you want.
- No, it's okay.

563
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,486
Get your hands off her.

564
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,654
What did you say?

565
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,698
Don't mess with me, understand?
I'll cut your balls off.

566
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,328
Outside.

567
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,739
Beat it!
Get the hell out of here!

568
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,373
son of a bitch, Why are you pushing?
Fuck you.

569
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:55,248
Beat it before I call the cops.
Get back inside.

570
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,152
Girls, how old are you anyway?
Beat it, go home.

571
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,092
Happy how?

572
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,957
You little shit.

573
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:09,897
Let's settle this now, c'mon.
Get out of here, you midget!

574
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,459
Are you coming? Beat it...
shut your mouth.

575
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,129
I'll fuck you.

576
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:20,340
- Just you Wait, you Russian cunt.
- Did you fall, sweetheart?

577
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,140
C'mon, get up...

578
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,046
Who's a bastard?
Who did you call a bastard?

579
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,417
Get out of here, you prick.

580
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,685
- You didn't have to do that.
- You'd have kicked ass yourself, eh?

581
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,451
- How old are you? Why?
- Leave them alone.

582
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,259
Go on, take them home,
take them home, Adiel.

583
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,765
Why? I would have shown her
a white dick made in Russia.

584
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,132
- Cut it out.
- Why not?

585
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,329
And you. Superman.

586
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,497
Next time I see you get into a fight

587
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,870
I'll kill you.

588
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,408
You'll ruin my business.

589
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,205
Get inside the club.

590
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,985
Let's go.

591
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,207
Look how big they are,
We're dead.

592
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:29,404
Look at their goalie, bro.
What is that thing? Scary!

593
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,970
Forget the goalie,
look at the size of that one.

594
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,279
Enough,
What are you, children?

595
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,818
That looks like a goalie to you?

596
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,012
That fatso,

597
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,352
I can circle him 10 times
before he knows what hit him.

598
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,415
Don't worry,
everything will be okay.

599
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,891
Avi, get the ball.

600
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,571
Relax, they're only kids.

601
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,513
Move in!
Move in!

602
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,142
What's wrong with you,
don't you have a yellow card?!

603
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,194
Never mind, never mind.

604
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,104
Relax, Shlomi, relax.

605
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,171
Move in.

606
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,512
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

607
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,882
They're half your size.
They're kids.

608
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,980
Do you want to kill them?

609
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,168
I spoke to the referee
and told them to calm down,

610
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,034
but that's no excuse
for what happened.

611
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,803
What's Wrong with you?
It gets a little physical, so you break?

612
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,106
- What about Eldad?
- What about him?

613
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,477
If you had defended your goalie,
he wouldn't have gotten hurt.

614
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,140
Disgrace, that's what it is.

615
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:50,277
It's a massacre, that's what it is.
At this rate there won't be a team.

616
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,413
Scared about getting hurt,
Ashkenazi?

617
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,515
Continue this way and you Won't
be playing in the finals.

618
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,526
If we continue this way,
nobody will be playing in the finals.

619
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,084
We'll end up in the hospital.

620
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,029
Avi, you're out.
Adiel, you're in.

621
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,397
Why me?
They didn't pass me the ball.

622
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,732
Avi, one more word...

623
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,998
I swear, just one more word!

624
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,303
Adiel, I want everybody
to help on defense.

625
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,743
- Nobody waits for the ball.
- What?

626
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,145
- What about Eldad?
- What about Eldad?

627
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,843
Eldad?

628
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,317
Are you kidding?
He busted my shoulder.

629
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,480
Okay, that's enough.

630
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,019
Dima, put the cigarette out.

631
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,300
- Dima, you're in the goal.
- What?!

632
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,273
- Eldad, give him the vest and gloves.
- What's that?

633
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,366
You heard me.
C'mon, we're out of time.

634
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,638
He doesn't know how to play.

635
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,909
The last time I checked,
I was the coach here.

636
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,916
Eldad,
What are you Waiting for?

637
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,713
Dima, don't let the ball in.

638
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:56,912
I'm not playing.

639
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,547
He never even practiced with us.

640
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:01,557
Dima.

641
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,718
You know how to fight?

642
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,159
- I know.
- Good.

643
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,461
So do whatever you can to keep them
from scoring a goal.

644
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,704
No problem, boss.

645
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,375
Pass it to Adiel! To Adiel!

646
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,519
Very good, Dima.

647
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:44,129
Kobi . . .
Yes, yes. Exactly.

648
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,930
Shlomi! Pass it to Adiel!

649
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:48,800
Shlomi, I said pass it to Adiel!
I'll take you out.

650
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,841
- I'm warning you, Shlomi.
- Okay, I heard you!

651
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,342
Behind you!

652
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,646
Referee!

653
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:08,422
Adiel, get your foot in, that's it!
Kobi, get inside.

654
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,460
Wide, wide, Adiel!

655
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:17,461
Great! Great!
Way to go. Yes!

656
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,488
What's wrong with you?

657
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,531
Start defending.

658
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,264
Who can beat us now? Who?

659
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,303
Bring the juniors, bring Juventus,
we'll fuck them all.

660
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,133
What a goalie.

661
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,640
Did you see Matan fight
that goalie?

662
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,643
- That was far out.
- Where's that Russian?

663
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,807
- So long.
- Bye, Adiel.

664
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,610
Adiel!

665
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,654
Wait a second,
I'll be right back.

666
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:54,328
- Going home?
- Yes.

667
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,827
- Did you ever try out for Hapoel?
- No.

668
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,928
- Why not?
- No reason.

669
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,973
Don't you want to be
a soccer player?

670
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,007
No. I don't know.

671
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,748
I think you should go.

672
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:16,308
- Don't you enjoy playing?
- I like it. That's not it.

673
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,513
It's everything around it,
I don't know.

674
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,887
When you turn pro, it gets tough
and you stop enjoying it.

675
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,789
Didn't you enjoy today?

676
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,623
I did, but...

677
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,663
I don't know.

678
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,426
Cut the crap.

679
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:33,333
It's a shame to miss out.
There's lots of money in soccer.

680
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:36,133
I'll see. Maybe.

681
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,174
Matan thinks so too.

682
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,550
You know, we didn't take your bike.
We only found the pizza.

683
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,681
I know.

684
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,056
Sometimes I lose it.

685
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,458
- Are you coming tomorrow?
- Yeah.

686
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,660
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

687
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,714
Police!

688
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,879
Idiot.

689
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,888
What are you doing here?

690
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,447
Dimon, what are these clothes?

691
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,994
You play soccer?
I didn't know.

692
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,927
You're so dirty.

693
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,966
- You're a goalie.
- Cool uniform.

694
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,730
- Beautiful, Dimon.
- What do you want?

695
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,637
Oh! He isn't friendly today.

696
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,609
Dima, why don't you invite us in?

697
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,939
We can have coffee

698
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,912
with your mom and dad

699
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,845
and talk politics.

700
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,645
Ah!

701
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,413
Can't you say anything else,
asshole?

702
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:57,544
I'll kill you!

703
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,215
Relax. Okay.
Both of you relax.

704
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,350
You have no idea
what's going on?

705
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,018
- None?

706
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,858
I decided to come to you

707
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,923
for the money
and save you the trip.

708
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,298
- I'll be right back.
- Go on.

709
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,712
Vladik, stop it.

710
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,519
Everything will be all right.

711
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,581
You hear me?

712
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,422
Nothing will be all right.

713
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:39,826
I don't believe it anymore.

714
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,091
Stop it, you can't give up.

715
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,430
You'll see, everything will work out.

716
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,528
That's why I work all those shifts.

717
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,836
But I'm not working.
I can't live here.

718
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:56,773
Maybe if I went to Germany,
to Yivgeni, I'd make it there...

719
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,974
Forget Germany already.

720
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,710
Your family is here.

721
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,377
Who needs you there?

722
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,711
Dima, is everything all right?

723
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,878
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

724
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,352
I'll be right back.

725
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,547
Sophi called.

726
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,556
Why?
I was in school today.

727
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,489
I know you were.

728
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,120
She wanted to invite me 
to the ceremony.

729
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,699
Dima, is it true?
Did you agree?

730
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,999
Can Eva come too?

731
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,973
What will you play?

732
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,168
I don't know.
"Friendship," maybe.

733
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,168
Thank you, Dima.

734
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,848
Everything will be okay.

735
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,019
Excellent.

736
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,563
Well done.
Now we can talk.

737
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,437
Nice one.

738
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,948
Here, buy your mother
something nice.

739
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:44,852
Do you still have
my mobile phone?

740
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,921
No. Keep it.

741
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,853
There's a party.

742
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,556
A rave
on Independence Day eve,

743
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,997
I'll need you to pick up
a delivery in the afternoon.

744
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,830
We'll be able to sell
the stuff easily

745
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,962
at the party.

746
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,166
- Can I Work at the party too?
- Why?

747
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,334
Pressed for money?

748
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,970
- Are you paying as usual?
- Of course.

749
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,241
- I'll be there.
- Let's go.

750
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,839
A party, a delivery.

751
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,782
Someone around here
needs money.

752
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,582
When's the delivery?

753
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:22,887
At noon as usual.

754
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,960
We're leaving for the rave
at 10:00.

755
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,759
Okay? A kickass party.

756
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:31,061
Is that all this asshole knows
how to do,

757
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,659
repeat everything you say
like a jerk?

758
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,795
Dima, this time you're wrong.

759
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,271
You're wrong.

760
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,069
Go home now,

761
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,043
before I release the bulldog.

762
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,854
- Did you play yesterday?
- Yeah, with the team.

763
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,191
Really?
You're back on the team?

764
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,289
You won?
How many goals?

765
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,698
It was a tie, but we played
against the big guys.

766
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,794
- Did you score a goal?
- Yeah, three.

767
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,498
And we have a new goalkeeper.

768
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:13,133
You know Dima, the Russian
who lives in the nearby block.

769
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,905
He's not scared of anything.
He's crazy.

770
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,740
- Wow, three goals?
- Yes.

771
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:22,785
You should've seen them.
They were so fat they could hardly run.

772
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,912
Wednesday we're playing in
the Independence Day tournament

773
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,117
against Nitzanei Gimel.
If we beat them,

774
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,684
we'll play against Hapoel
Be'er Sheva Juniors in a stadium.

775
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,957
Really? The Hapoel stadium?

776
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,090
Yeah, I'll tell Mom to take you.

777
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,862
Will you play for Hapoel?

778
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,734
Maybe.
shlomi says I have a chance.

779
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,297
They'll also be coming from
the Netanya soccer boarding school.

780
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,606
The boarding school again?

781
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:51,772
Don't jinx it. It's the best
soccer school in the country.

782
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,009
They'll only take me
if I'm good enough.

783
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,177
But you're good, you're the best.
Even Meir says so.

784
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,050
You'll leave us again?

785
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:02,057
Forget it, I don't stand a chance.
Don't even think about it.

786
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,854
Here. Put it in your bag.

787
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,063
What are you worried about?

788
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,865
Besides, I like Hapoel better.
Okay?

789
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,865
Go on, eat.

790
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,867
Is this what I pay you for, Eyal?

791
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,402
You let some kid
make fun of you...

792
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,746
I'm talking about 7,000 NIS
in damages. Go see for yourself.

793
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,786
He's a piece of shit...
Who says he did it?

794
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,117
- Then who did?
- Plenty of people choked on your shit.

795
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,885
Cool him down
before I do.

796
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,554
- 7.000?
- 7,000. Check out the mess he's made.

797
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,065
Independence Day is in two clays.
What will I do?

798
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,636
How much
do you pay these guys?

799
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,973
51 NIS per hour plus tips.

800
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,974
He'll be here Wednesday.

801
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,449
He's yours until he pays up.

802
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,646
7,000 at 51 NIS per hour.

803
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,520
7,000? Come on...
What's the deal, Eyal?

804
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,355
Be honest with me, bro...

805
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,418
Is it because
he's his brother?

806
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,465
- Fuck you, if you dare touch him...
- Go get the jeep.

807
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:17,931
Go on.

808
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,302
He'll be here Wednesday.

809
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:30,135
- Haim beat him up in front of everyone.
- What?

810
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,875
What did you just say, ltzik?

811
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,008
I'm bending over
backwards for you.

812
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,746
You know what would happen
if it were someone else.

813
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,220
He'd better be there.
Let's go.

814
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,327
Go on, Adiel, go on.

815
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,902
Cut, Kobi. cut!

816
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,814
Adiel, look at the line, Adiel.

817
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,498
Take it.

818
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,737
Never mind. Very good.

819
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,111
Come here, everybody.

820
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,757
Tomorrow is Memorial Day.
There's no practice.

821
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,658
Wednesday, Independence Day,
you get to the game on your own.

822
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,661
The first game is at 9 p.m.

823
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,197
I'll let you know
Who's playing tomorrow.

824
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,325
You're starting to look like a team
and that's good.

825
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,769
Don't let it get to your head.

826
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,330
Don't worry, Matan,
everything will be okay.

827
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,569
We'll screw those wimps.

828
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,474
Do I look worried to you?

829
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,875
Go on, go home.

830
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,526
Adiel! Dima!

831
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,433
Come on.

832
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,106
So you're playing
against the juniors tomorrow?

833
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:15,143
We'll kick their ass.
They don't stand a chance.

834
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,907
What about you, nigger?
What do you play?

835
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,948
Why talk that way?

836
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,075
Striker.

837
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,517
- Is he any good?
- You better believe it.

838
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,418
He's Zidane.

839
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,722
Nice one.

840
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,090
What about the Russian?

841
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,129
The Russian is chilling out.

842
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,823
You look like it.

843
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,162
Say, how's my brother?

844
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:41,032
A real pro, right?

845
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,628
Your brother's fucking excellent.
He's a captain.

846
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,300
Right, he's got potential.

847
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:50,244
Well, he's an Adani,
not just anybody.

848
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:55,874
Look at the nigger suck on that,
as if it was a pussy.

849
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,547
Hey, relax, Kunta Kinte,
pass the joint.

850
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,857
He's got potential.

851
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,198
- Bye ltzik. Bye.
- Bye Shlomi. Bye Avi.

852
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,206
Shlomi, wait a minute.

853
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,178
Why didn't you tell me
about Haim?

854
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,584
- What are you talking about?
- Don't fuck with me!

855
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,849
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Get your hands off me.

856
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,220
The motherfucker hit me.

857
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:13,250
- What were you thinking?
- It's Haim. And Haim means Eyal.

858
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:16,628
If you have trouble with him come
to me. You don't just pay him a visit.

859
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,065
- I'd have killed the motherfucker.
- Shut up!

860
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,294
What's happening, ltzik?
Problems?

861
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,362
Everything's cool.

862
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,866
- He wants to see you Wednesday morning.
- I've got a game.

863
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:32,141
I don't think you get it. Tomorrow's
Memorial Day. There's no business.

864
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,148
But Wednesday morning,
you've got a shift.

865
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,481
- I've got a game, don't you get it?
- I don't give a fuck!

866
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,182
I'm not going.

867
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:43,225
What do you mean, not going?
ltzik, get into the car.

868
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,261
Remember what I said.

869
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,222
Next time, come to me.

870
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,526
Go home! Go on!

871
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,173
Damn it, ltzik, c'mon...

872
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,913
Think about your brother
next time.

873
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,851
Think about your mother next time,
assfucker.

874
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,823
You prick. Fuck!

875
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:22,364
Such a beautiful boy

876
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:28,667
Went to the angels

877
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:32,173
Up in heaven

878
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,335
And in the silence

879
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:41,714
His mother's cry was heard

880
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:46,346
Our hearts stopped beating

881
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,049
Wings...

882
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,251
Yes.

883
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,294
Where are you?

884
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,291
I'll be right over.

885
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,195
Is everything okay?
Where's Dad?

886
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:03,638
If you don't come, I won't play.

887
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:32,062
They say time heals all wounds...

888
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,302
Here you are. Orna is looking for you.
Where did you disappear to?

889
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,965
Have you spoken to your mom?

890
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,134
- Dim.
- What do you want?

891
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,802
She said she'll try to come.

892
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,847
I asked Orna to call you last,
right after the principal, okay?

893
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,406
I asked everyone to come
half an hour earlier to help.

894
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,815
He was with Matan.

895
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,614
I'm glad somebody
bothered to tell me.

896
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,746
Dima is here.
Everything worked out.

897
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,290
This is no way
to conduct a ceremony.

898
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,758
How was I supposed to know
Where you are?

899
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,224
I'm here now.
$0 what's the problem?

900
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,323
You should do something
about your attitude.

901
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,664
Orna, it was my mistake.
I didn't tell you.

902
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:11,672
Einav! What are you doing
with the wreath? Put it back.

903
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,372
Who does she think she is?

904
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,641
Never mind.

905
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,410
Everything will be all right.

906
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:20,433
- He didn't come to any rehearsal.
- Some things are more important

907
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,568
- than a ceremony.
- More important?

908
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,806
That's just the attitude
that makes him behave this way.

909
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,407
These things will bring him
closer to his heritage.

910
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:33,012
Yes, but Dima has to do it
at his own pace...

911
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,268
On Memorial Day?
While the sirens were sounded?

912
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:51,738
Next to the names of the 31
fallen soldiers from this school?

913
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,604
Disgrace.

914
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,406
Where do you think you're going?

915
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,309
Don't you have to get on stage?

916
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:03,579
I'm going.
Take an example from your goalie,

917
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,677
and he wasn't even born here.

918
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,289
Report to me at the end of the clay.
Go back now.

919
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:13,658
Before we begin our
Independence Day celebrations,

920
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:16,391
I ask that we all remember

921
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:20,458
the people that have allowed us
to be a free nation in this country,

922
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,367
celebrating Independence Day.

923
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,373
I'd like to invite one
of our students to the stage

924
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:27,500
to play the song of friendship
for us,

925
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:30,841
a song loved by one of our greatest
Prime Ministers,

926
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,746
a man who symbolized
the immortal lyric:

927
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,148
"The Beautiful
of Mind and Body,"

928
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,686
Mr. Yitzhak Rabin,
of blessed memory.

929
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:43,054
Coming up to the stage is Dima,
a new immigrant from the former USSR

930
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:46,390
who symbolizes the revival
of the Jewish nation in this country.

931
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,089
Dima, please.

932
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:59,025
You're through here!
Don't ever bother to come back!

933
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:16,080
My manager said, either you order
something or he calls security.

934
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,885
Tell your manager to come out
and say it himself.

935
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,962
Hi. Look who's here?
Rolandinio, no less.

936
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:35,697
What's wrong with you?

937
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,364
You didn't come today.

938
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,602
We had a ceremony.
What happened?

939
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,702
We had a game today.

940
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:48,773
I didn't forget, bro, I didn't think
anything would happen today.

941
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,342
Forget it,
he's got White friends now.

942
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,819
Was I talking to you?

943
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,482
Is that what you think of me, Meir?

944
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,549
I haven't seen you since Friday.

945
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:02,028
You disappeared then too.
Lay off already!

946
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,394
Meir, you know the score. I gotta play,
otherwise they'll kick me out.

947
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:11,269
I think you care more about
your white mates than your friends.

948
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,035
Is that so, Meir?

949
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:22,475
You're not coming
to my game tomorrow?

950
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,784
Cool, I get it.

951
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,319
Let him go. Fuck him.

952
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,628
Did you see the Jacuzzi
they have over there?

953
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:47,141
That's no Jacuzzi.
It's a therapeutic tub for injuries.

954
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,905
Forget that, did you see
the senior"; locker room?

955
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,445
Has anybody seen Matan?

956
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:53,538
I saw him talking
to Jackie Dekel outside.

957
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,344
Hey, anyone have a shin guard?

958
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,544
You lost it again.
What's with you, Berger?

959
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,644
- Adiel, you happen to have one?
- No, bro.

960
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,348
Take it from somebody
who's not playing.

961
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:02,617
Take one from Assaf.

962
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,455
He only plays if the whole team
is injured, including Matan.

963
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,553
Anybody would think you've been
playing since Adiel came back.

964
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:12,726
We're a team. No one plays alone,
have you forgotten?

965
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,860
Maybe you'll be the goalie, Assaf?

966
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:17,303
Hey, Shlomi, who's the goalie?

967
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:20,239
- How should I know?
- Eldad.

968
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:24,143
I told Matan I'm still in pain,
but he told me to come anyway.

969
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:27,306
He really went berserk
on Memorial Day.

970
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,615
No matter what you say, that Russian
asshole really knows how to play.

971
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,450
Who are you calling an asshole?

972
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,046
Dima!

973
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,689
The pianist.
Did you come to play for us?

974
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,230
Did you talk to Matan?

975
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,426
- What have I got to say to him.
- He'll let you play?

976
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,095
- I'm part of the team, aren't I?
- So you spoke to him.

977
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,162
Who spoke to whom?

978
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,679
- What are you doing here?
- Matan,

979
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:00,772
- Eldad is still hurt.
- Was I talking to you?

980
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,749
- What are you doing here?
- There's a game, isn't there?

981
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,055
Why are you all
giving me puppy eyes?

982
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,698
Go on, go Warm up.
Get dressed.

983
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,333
Shlomi. Shlomi, come here.

984
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,840
Listen, I just spoke
to Jackie Dekel.

985
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,350
He's got his eye on you.

986
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,887
- Take us to the finals.
- Don't worry, Matan,

987
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:43,447
- I don't miss opportunities.
- Go already!

988
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,260
Hello.

989
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,632
I'll be there.

990
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,603
I said I'll be there.

991
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:01,399
I'll be outside at 2:00.

992
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,137
Nag.

993
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,513
That was my mom.
she said she might come.

994
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:10,073
I think she'd better come,
for our sake.

995
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:54,619
Shlomi, what did I tell you?

996
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:57,290
- You're coming with me right now.
- Forget it.

997
01:18:57,365 --> 01:18:59,595
Fuck you.
I said something, didn't I?

998
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,499
I'm not going.
What'll you do to me, eh?

999
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,868
C'mon already!
Haim's Waiting for you.

1000
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,133
Beat it.

1001
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,300
- Move before I...
- Before what?

1002
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:12,574
- Let him go.
- Matan, it has nothing to do with you.

1003
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:15,673
How's that?
He's the captain.

1004
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,913
- Leave.
- shlomi, for the last time,

1005
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,614
- come with me.
- I'm not going.

1006
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,919
Now beat it!

1007
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,356
Remember this, Shlomi.

1008
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:31,558
I tried.
It's out of my hands now.

1009
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,331
- Don't come to me when Haim...
- Haim, what?

1010
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,703
What will he do?

1011
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:43,343
Go on, get lost.

1012
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,674
Go.

1013
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,946
Sit in the stands and watch
your brother make a life for himself.

1014
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,884
Go.

1015
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:00,860
Well, go on.
Warm up.

1016
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,527
Shlomi, Shlomi!
Remember this.

1017
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:16,744
Avivim!

1018
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:29,356
We're going to toss for it.
Ball or side?

1019
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:30,823
Side.

1020
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:36,463
You win. You start.
Good luck. Good luck.

1021
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:02,352
Get down.
It's nothing.

1022
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:24,445
Nothing happened, Ref.

1023
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,980
Meir, I swear,
nothing happened.

1024
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,160
Get out, I said, get out.

1025
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,566
They wouldn't have
scored a goal!

1026
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,947
Meir!
Substitution.

1027
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,775
Quiet down.

1028
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:41,914
Calm down.

1029
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,781
Preserve your energy.

1030
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,687
Okay, you played well,

1031
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:51,521
you proved who you are,
you proved you're a team.

1032
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,083
Very nice.

1033
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,625
The final is in three hours.

1034
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,632
It's going to be
a whole different game.

1035
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,600
The deputy mayor will be here,

1036
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,158
the seniors will be here.

1037
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:07,533
I don't doubt that you can
beat the juniors, no doubt.

1038
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,005
Enough.

1039
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,281
Go say hello
to your friends,

1040
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:19,115
family and drink
plenty of water.

1041
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:27,358
Where are you going, Dima?

1042
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,691
Don't worry, I'll be back.

1043
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:30,355
Don't forget, eh?

1044
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:31,660
Is that what you think?

1045
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,928
The referee blows the whistle
at 4:00.

1046
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:24,811
- Oh God, Yonatan isn't with you?
- What happened?

1047
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:27,514
I don't know where he is.

1048
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,318
What do you mean?

1049
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,652
We went to buy
something to eat.

1050
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:32,192
Your mom came back
and we couldn't find him.

1051
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,694
- How come?
- He wasn't there.

1052
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,662
What's the matter with you?
Answer me!

1053
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,325
I have no idea.
I turned around and he was gone.

1054
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,698
- I thought he was with you.
- Where were you?

1055
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:43,361
At the falafel stand.

1056
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,338
Can't you even watch him!?

1057
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:47,533
We'll go home and look for him.

1058
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,060
Are you playing?

1059
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:19,436
Soon. In the finals.

1060
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,012
Know somebody named Adani?

1061
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,154
Matan!

1062
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:39,926
Dimon.

1063
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,296
See those white stairs?

1064
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,626
So?

1065
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,826
Go up to the second floor,

1066
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,869
you'll see a door on the right.

1067
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:51,030
There's a small bag on the floor.

1068
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:53,539
Take it.

1069
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,838
- Is that all?
- No, that's not all.

1070
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,741
You take it,

1071
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,439
but you don't come back here.

1072
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,175
You go to Tanya.

1073
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,547
Behave yourself
and she'll blow you.

1074
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:06,246
- Real class.
- Asshole.

1075
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,482
Where do you find them?

1076
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,183
Until you grow up.

1077
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:12,783
I have to hang outwith idiots.

1078
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,489
I'll get to Tanya. And?

1079
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:20,466
Tanya will explain everything.

1080
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,366
There's no time. Go.

1081
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:26,796
Don't forget.

1082
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,535
I have to be back
at 3:30.

1083
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,544
Don't worry, Maradona.

1084
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,599
Yonatan!

1085
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,710
Yonatan!

1086
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,753
I'm over here.

1087
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:02,696
I didn't want you to win.

1088
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,570
I didn't want you to go
to boarding school.

1089
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,442
Don't worry, I'm not going.

1090
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:17,645
Where's the rocket?
There's no rocket, you made it up.

1091
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:22,088
There was one, I swear to God,
I think the army took it.

1092
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:28,523
You're not allowed to swear to God,
He'll punish you.

1093
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,290
Where's your yarmulke?

1094
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:37,762
Did it fall off?

1095
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:06,323
You bastard,
I'll fuck you, you bastard!

1096
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:13,805
Have you seen Keto?
Have you seen her?

1097
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,866
You lost your sister again?

1098
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:17,638
Give me a cigarette.

1099
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:29,979
Go home, you crazy fuck.

1100
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,394
Mamuka loses everybody.

1101
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:39,631
Keto! Keto!

1102
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,999
Bastard, I'll fuck the shit
out of you, just wait.

1103
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:45,499
Keto!

1104
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:50,503
Stop!

1105
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:58,745
