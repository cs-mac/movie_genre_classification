2
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,425
I do believe in fate.

3
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,991
I do believe in family.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,503
I believe in telling the truth...

5
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:21,194
and that your actions have consequences.

6
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:28,254
I do believe that you can turn
for one second and miss a lifetime.

7
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:34,091
That you can connect.

8
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:37,047
That you should follow your heart.

9
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:41,067
- Hey. Jack Edwards?
- He's right over here.

10
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:46,172
Hi, cutie!

11
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:50,294
Hello, dude. Hi.

12
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:54,082
I believe in not giving up
on what you think matters

13
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,790
and what's worth fighting for.

14
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,137
I do.

15
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:03,878
Come on, guys. Seriously, though. What?

16
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:04,923
What's so important

17
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,075
that you came all the way over
the Brooklyn bridge to see me?

18
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,215
Mya, will you do the honors?

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,584
Okay. Jack,

20
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:12,454
your brother and I...

21
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:13,850
You're gonna be an Uncle, dude!

22
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:16,284
Shut up! That's brilliant!

23
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,872
Finally knocked the old girl up.

24
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:20,138
And to think, I only married
her for the green card.

25
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:23,260
Wow. Till death do us part.

26
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,810
That's charming, Peter.

27
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,138
And we were thinking

28
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:27,963
that we might like to name the baby

29
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,165
after mom or dad.

30
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,482
Oh, I like that.

31
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,580
That'd be nice.

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,800
Yeah, I think they would have loved it.

33
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,223
This is going to be great!

34
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:39,838
We're gonna be our own little family.

35
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,540
Is there anything else
I can get you right now?

36
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,917
Uh, no. We're good. Thank you.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,518
She's been checking you
out since we got here.

38
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,740
Yeah, he's handsome.
You should ask him out.

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,779
He is handsome, but I'm
not gonna ask him out.

40
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:57,774
Do you want me to?

41
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,901
- No, I don't want you to.
- No, not for me!

42
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,797
For you!

43
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,781
Ugh. I have to pee again.

44
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:06,515
It's one of the wonders of being pregnant.

45
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:12,792
- So, Peter... you're gonna be a dad.
- I know.

46
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,393
It's great.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,239
What?

48
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,542
All of a sudden, there's all this...

49
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,137
pressure.

50
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,834
Like I'm finally conforming

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,492
to something that was expected of me.

52
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,845
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love Mya. I do. But...

53
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:32,468
Sometimes I wish I were gay.

54
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:33,563
Wha...?

55
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,230
Well, you guys, you have no

56
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:39,333
responsibility, no ordained path.

57
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,437
Us straight guys, we got to jump
through all those bloody hoops.

58
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,656
Peter, it's gonna be fine.

59
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:47,174
You have a beautiful wife.

60
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,741
You'll have an amazing kid.

61
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,299
I'd switch with you in a heartbeat.

62
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,731
What'd I miss?

63
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,027
Nothing. Nothing.

64
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:55,316
No, we were just...

65
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,792
talking about Jack as the gay uncle.

66
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:58,853
Gay Uncle here.

67
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,730
- That's the same guy!
- I know.

68
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:05,526
Yes! Here we are.

69
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:07,302
Oh, well done.

70
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,423
Oh, hang on a second. What?

71
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:16,718
I think I've lost my wallet.

72
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:17,931
He can't find his wallet.

73
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:20,034
Super. Well, I'll just wait here, shall I?

74
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,623
In the cold and the rain and the wet.

75
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:24,813
I found it.

76
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:25,996
Peter!

77
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:27,372
Peter!

78
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:35,627
Hey, chicken!

79
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,383
How was school?

80
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:37,384
We made cupcakes.

81
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,756
You did? Do I get any?

82
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,868
- No?!
- Hi.

83
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,196
Hello. I see you every day

84
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,824
picking up your little girl from school.

85
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,841
- Tara.
- Tara... right.

86
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,538
I just wanted to come introduce myself.

87
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:48,735
I'm Catherine.

88
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:51,746
God, she is such a cutie.

89
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:53,661
She really has your smile.

90
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,992
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

91
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,133
- Bye.
- Bye.

92
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,948
See ya!

93
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,520
- Bye!
- Bye!

94
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,499
We're home, mommy!

95
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:03,862
Hey, Petunia!

96
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,563
Hi.

97
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:06,667
- How was school?
- Great.

98
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,700
- She made cupcakes.
- Oh, yeah?

99
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:09,717
But we don't get any.

100
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:12,605
- How come?
- Because it was someone's birthday.

101
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,463
Hey, Tara, why don't you go and help mommy

102
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,389
and take the school books off the table?

103
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,497
Okay. No, I got it.

104
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,242
Why don't you go wash your
hands for dinner, okay?

105
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:19,798
Okay.

106
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:20,713
I got groceries.

107
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:22,134
Jack, you can't keep doing that.

108
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:23,341
I'm getting paid tomorrow.

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,398
I'll write you a check, okay?

110
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,767
It's fine. Just feed me.

111
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,276
Tara, eat your vegetables.

112
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,814
- They taste yucky.
- I don't care.

113
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,611
You have to eat them.

114
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,038
You know what?

115
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,070
What?

116
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,035
You know what happens when
you don't eat your vegetables?

117
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:48,848
What?

118
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:49,881
You don't poo!

119
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,376
Jack!

120
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:54,846
And you know what?

121
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:55,910
What?

122
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,224
Do you know what happens
when you don't poo?

123
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,044
What?

124
00:06:58,112 --> 00:06:59,908
You fill up and up and up...

125
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,560
and then you explode!

126
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:05,045
Now, that's just silly.

127
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,216
It happened to a friend
of mine. It's a true story.

128
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:08,960
Okay.

129
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,032
I promise...

130
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:14,198
that if you eat all your vegetables,

131
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,864
you can have as much cake
for dessert as you want!

132
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,857
- You promise?
- I promise.

133
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,878
Brilliant parenting, Jack.

134
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,829
Look, she's eating.

135
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,562
Yeah, you don't have to
deal with the fallout.

136
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,645
Little sugar monster.

137
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,178
I'm done, mommy. See?

138
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,543
Okay.

139
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:38,001
"And the very next day, the prince
and the princess were married,

140
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,674
and they lived happily ever after."

141
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,537
Wow! That's brilliant!

142
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,790
- All right. Time for bed.
- Can I read it again?

143
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,410
No, you have to go to bed.

144
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:49,194
- Can you check for monsters, please?
- Okay.

145
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:55,707
Nope. Not a sausage.

146
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,065
Now get some sleep.

147
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,123
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

148
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,668
Good night, sweetheart.

149
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,220
Good night, mommy.

150
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,626
8.0. 125.

151
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,810
That's great, guys. Okay,
so, I just want one more.

152
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,723
Okay?

153
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,831
Last looks, everyone.

154
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,539
We'll be moving on to
formal wear after this.

155
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:51,659
- Here.
- Great.

156
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:52,975
All right, you got it? Great.

157
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,352
Clear the set, please!

158
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,166
For God's sakes, smile!

159
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:59,088
This is supposed to be the
happiest day of your life.

160
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,827
That's much better.

161
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:02,055
Beautiful.

162
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,511
Now you're in love.

163
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,824
All right.

164
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:05,945
Hey.

165
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,097
Are you coming tonight?

166
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,598
Because if not, I totally understand,

167
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,862
but I would be really upset,

168
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,069
and Christina and I are fighting,

169
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,527
so I'll probably be a total mess.

170
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,719
I'm coming.

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,686
Great.

172
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,709
It should be fun.

173
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:16,704
Sounds like it.

174
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,474
Who knows? Maybe you'll meet a cute boy.

175
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,340
- I'll see you at 8:00.
- Mm.

176
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,443
Come on. What happened to the smile?

177
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:24,394
All right.

178
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,332
Beautiful.

179
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:27,228
All right. Beautiful.
Beautiful. Look at each other.

180
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:35,912
Oh, my God, it's freezing!
Why didn't you wait inside?

181
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,852
'Cause I said I'd wait outside.

182
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,403
So, she dumped me.

183
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:40,727
No!

184
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,457
And she asked me to move out.

185
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:43,632
Are you okay?

186
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:44,627
Yeah.

187
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:47,380
Just... slightly heartbroken.

188
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:49,036
Come here.

189
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,574
Coat check, alco...

190
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,961
Alcohol, coat check.

191
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,152
Shall we?

192
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,677
Thank you.

193
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:11,893
Can I have another one?

194
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,401
Thanks.

195
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,711
Aah! Bollocks!

196
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,222
- You okay, down there?
- Yeah.

197
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,024
I'm just a clumsy oaf.

198
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,754
Here. Come over here.

199
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:31,990
Thank you.

200
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,279
I do this every time.

201
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,705
I have a wine in one hand...

202
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:37,858
just messy...

203
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:41,825
Hello. Hi.

204
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:44,884
I like your hair. It looks really good.

205
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,118
- You look good in red. I like it.
- Thank you.

206
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:50,853
- You having a good time?

207
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,786
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

208
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,186
You have an accent.

209
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,351
You have an accent.

210
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:57,041
- I don't have an accent.
- Yes, you do.

211
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:58,442
I do.

212
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,173
I'm from England.

213
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,658
I'm from Spain.

214
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,943
We have to go.

215
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,529
- You okay?
- Nope.

216
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,079
Clams and champagne. Come on.

217
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:08,733
Um... okay, well, we have to go.

218
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,331
- It was nice to meet you.
- Don't forget your wine.

219
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,137
Um... I got to go.

220
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:19,145
I gotcha. I gotcha.

221
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,819
- Thank you.
- For what?

222
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,185
I can trust you. You're
always there for me.

223
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:31,901
Well, I held your hair back, didn't I?

224
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,292
- Good night.
- Night.

225
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:46,772
Oh, my God.

226
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,838
I feel like I drank a
bottle of paint stripper.

227
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:53,078
Who was that guy you were
talking to last night?

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,073
Which guy?

229
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:57,020
The tall, handsome one
you were drooling over.

230
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,735
- Oh, that guy.
- Oh, that guy.

231
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,235
He was cute.

232
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,270
Mnh. Sorry. It's all I've got.

233
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:11,329
I'll stick to my coffee.

234
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,154
You should have asked him out.

235
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,069
We should get going.

236
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,181
- Jack, it's jammed again.
- I'll grab the spare.

237
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,952
Uh... how are we lighting this?

238
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:50,928
I don't know!

239
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:53,500
- You're the lighting expert.
- Michael, the client needs to see you A.S.A.P.

240
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,745
Do the setup you did for the Clarent job.

241
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,190
- I loved that.
- Okay.

242
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,736
Go. Go, go.

243
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,335
I'm sorry, Jack.

244
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,531
But you said it was just a
question of me renewing my visa

245
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,209
and then I could apply for my green card.

246
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,174
After 9/11, all the rules have changed.

247
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,425
What exactly does that mean?

248
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:25,751
You'd have to go back to England

249
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:27,053
and start the whole process again.

250
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,754
No! That's impossible.

251
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,706
I did everything you told me to do.

252
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:33,972
Well, how long would I have to go back?

253
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,896
I mean, how long would
I have to be in England?

254
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,099
Some of my clients' cases
have been pending for years.

255
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,342
Years?

256
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:41,706
With a denial on your record,

257
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,923
it'll be almost impossible
for you to get another visa.

258
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:46,685
You could come here as a tourist.

259
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:48,906
- A tourist?
- I am so sorry.

260
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,565
Well, what if I was to
overstay, work under-the-table?

261
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:54,736
Jack, I know your situation.

262
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,683
If they find you living without papers,

263
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,172
they'll deport you right away.

264
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:01,031
You'd be banned from entering
the states for 10 years.

265
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:02,526
You wouldn't want to put
your family through that.

266
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:03,953
I'm not leaving, Gloria.

267
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,389
I shouldn't say this,

268
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,328
but if you have a girlfriend,

269
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,337
now would be a good time to marry her.

270
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,763
I love you, Tara.

271
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:38,377
You know that?

272
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,378
I know. You say it all the time.

273
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,381
Right.

274
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,983
Come on in.

275
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:54,413
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

276
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:55,476
I'll be right outside.

277
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,072
Can you leave the door open?

278
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,349
Of course.

279
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,027
- Night-night.
- Night-night.

280
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:07,520
- She go to sleep?
- Yeah.

281
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:11,961
Mya, there's something I have to tell you.

282
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,059
Is Tara okay?

283
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,279
Yeah, she's fine.

284
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,353
It's me.

285
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,055
My visa got denied.

286
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,175
What?

287
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,371
I spoke to the lawyer today,

288
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:21,947
and she told me that the only

289
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,486
choice I have is get married.

290
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,756
Get married?

291
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:25,820
For my green card.

292
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:28,016
- You know that's not legal.
- Right.

293
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,162
So... You're not gonna do it.

294
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,733
Jack.

295
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,648
Well, it's not like I want to do it,

296
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,118
but I don't really have a choice.

297
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,431
I mean, what are you and Tara gonna do?

298
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:38,933
We'll figure something out.

299
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:40,047
Well, I can't go back to England.

300
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,198
I don't know anyone.

301
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:42,599
I haven't been there
since I was a teenager.

302
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,428
I don't think that's
gonna fly with the I.N.S.

303
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,739
Well, what about you and Peter?

304
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,078
Well, you married him for his green card.

305
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,280
That's completely
different. We were in love.

306
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:54,447
Who would you marry?

307
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,431
Well, I was thinking Ali,
and then maybe I thought

308
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,622
me and you could...

309
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,040
You thought we could?

310
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,036
You didn't think about,
what if they caught us?

311
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,701
I could go to prison. What about Tara?

312
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,472
Okay. It was a stupid idea.

313
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,731
- How long do you have?
- Two months.

314
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:08,120
And you're sure there's no other option?

315
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,559
Then there's overstay.

316
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,368
All right, I don't want Tara
knowing anything about this.

317
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,857
Of course.

318
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,423
Okay, I'll figure it out.

319
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,548
Shut up!

320
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,164
Jack!

321
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:38,096
Hi!

322
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,598
Hi. Hello. Let me turn the music down.

323
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:41,862
Okay.

324
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,721
That's better.

325
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,604
What's with the eggs?

326
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,964
Oh, those damn taxis blasting their horns.

327
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,123
Surprised you can hear
them over all the music.

328
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:57,635
So, I come bearing gifts
with ulterior motives.

329
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,042
It's, uh...

330
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:02,453
It's red, and it has stature.

331
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:05,189
Okay. Well.

332
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,157
Uh, you didn't pick this one out, did you?

333
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,659
No, the shop person did.

334
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:09,822
Very nice.

335
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,555
Very nice.

336
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,250
What do you want?

337
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,890
It jammed.

338
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,202
I tried the whole jiggle thing,

339
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,273
but I think I made it worse.

340
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,281
That happens if you jiggle too much.

341
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,902
That, it does.

342
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:22,709
Looks like there's some

343
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,680
life in the old girl yet.

344
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,732
You talking about you or the camera?

345
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,096
Charming.

346
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,142
So, how's the little one?

347
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:31,393
She's fine.

348
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:32,200
What's up with you?

349
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,297
You look like you got smacked
in the face with a wet fish.

350
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,130
My work visa got denied.

351
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,527
- Oh, Jack.
- Yeah.

352
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,325
But I'm not gonna leave.

353
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,560
Of course not.

354
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,106
I'm gonna get married.

355
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,224
- Who's the lucky guy?
- Very funny.

356
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:50,357
I was married once, you know.

357
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,403
But I was straight back then.

358
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,681
Sally Anne.

359
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:56,683
We loved each other, naturally.

360
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:59,579
But, well, nature took its course.

361
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:03,396
I remember standing there at the
ceremony thinking my father did this,

362
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,030
his father did this, his father before him.

363
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:07,601
I felt

364
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,247
my whole ancestry stretching back.

365
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,786
Like that bad Donna summer video...

366
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,025
the one with all the mirrors.

367
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:15,259
It's true.

368
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,704
It was the first time

369
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:22,028
I ever felt a connection to
any sense of family of history.

370
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm gonna have to give
this a real diagnostic.

371
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,988
Okay.

372
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:31,813
Remember, Jack, a woman's
heart is infinitely more complex

373
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:33,045
than a man's.

374
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,752
What are you gonna do?

375
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,485
I need to get married.

376
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,405
Well, who to?

377
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,239
Oh, Jack, me.

378
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,914
I know it's a lot to ask, but

379
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:06,195
we do it properly, and

380
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,085
we could live together,

381
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,256
and then we'd have all the
right paperwork for immigration.

382
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,052
Look, I know this is totally illegal,

383
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,686
but I don't know what else to do.

384
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:22,021
I probably wouldn't even still be
living here if it wasn't for you.

385
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,115
I mean, you've

386
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,105
always fought for me to get hired...

387
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:25,975
every job you do.

388
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:27,389
That's not because you're
my bestie. It's because

389
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:28,935
you're bloody good at what you do.

390
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,525
I mean, maybe a little bit
'cause you're my bestie.

391
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,972
There's really no other way?

392
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,986
I'd have to move in with you.

393
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:37,745
Well, you need a place right now.

394
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,979
To hell with it. Let's do it.

395
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:41,899
- Really?
- Yes.

396
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:43,820
Let's do it now, before I change my mind.

397
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:47,191
Ready?

398
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,471
Alison Bethany Federman,

399
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,570
do you take Jack Edwards to be
your lawfully wedded husband...

400
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,742
to have and to hold,
until death do you part...

401
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:59,987
According to the laws
of the state of New York?

402
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,108
I do.

403
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:29,368
Mr. Edwards.

404
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,270
I do.

405
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,593
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

406
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,510
Thanks.

407
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,709
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- What? What, what? What?

408
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,380
- Come here.
- What?

409
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,163
Ohh! Jack.

410
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,864
You're pretty light for a lesbian.

411
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,116
Asshole!

412
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,510
Wait, Jack, oh!

413
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,426
- Oh.
- I mean, ohh!

414
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,953
Hello, wifey.

415
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:38,745
This one or this one?

416
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,816
Jack.

417
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,383
That one. The other makes you look too gay.

418
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,344
I like this one.

419
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,436
- Jack!
- What?

420
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,321
Go.

421
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:48,479
Close the door!

422
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:54,711
Come on, Ali.

423
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,332
- So, how was school?
- Great.

424
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,359
Hey!

425
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,523
Wondering when we were finally
gonna get to meet your wife.

426
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,137
Sorry. This is Catherine.

427
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:03,845
- Hi. I'm Alison.
- Hi.

428
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,747
We were trying to figure him out for weeks.

429
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:06,942
We called him the dill.

430
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:08,512
Nice to meet you.

431
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:09,345
Yeah.

432
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,972
Nice to meet you. I'd better go.

433
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:01,181
Right.

434
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,835
I'm hungry.

435
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,551
You ready to ace this test?

436
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:09,052
What's "ace" mean?

437
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,004
It means we're gonna
get every answer right.

438
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:12,086
- Okay.
- 100%.

439
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,380
- Ready, Freddy?
- Ready, Freddy.

440
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:15,612
Okay, what's this.

441
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:19,730
Uh... Mommy, I don't think
we'll get this one right.

442
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,512
Deltoid. That's an easy one.

443
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,190
It's the shoulder. What's this?

444
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,592
Arm.

445
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,711
That's the bicep,

446
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:29,897
which is connected to the
flexor digitorum superficialis.

447
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:30,841
The arm.

448
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:31,830
What's this?

449
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:32,712
Nose.

450
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:34,420
Well, this is totally useless.

451
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,649
- You want me to help?
- Please.

452
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:44,101
This is why I could never be a nurse.

453
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,178
There's no way I could
learn all this stuff.

454
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,452
So, Ali...

455
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:53,611
is it true that dress sizes
have been artificially lowered

456
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,495
to make us think we're skinnier?

457
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:55,933
Yeah.

458
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:57,848
Actually, they've been
doing that for years.

459
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,156
You know what really gets me,

460
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,175
is the size zero.

461
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,758
I can't believe anybody falls for it.

462
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,085
I mean, surely you would just
make the adjustments in your head

463
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,725
and figure out you're exactly the same

464
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,196
skinniness or fatness that you were before.

465
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,722
Do men notice dress sizes?

466
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:10,481
I do.

467
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,343
Uncle Jack?

468
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,299
Yes, Tara?

469
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,227
Are you and Ali married now?

470
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,614
Why would you say a thing like that?

471
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,466
Because I saw matching
rings on your wedding finger.

472
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:22,660
Ring finger.

473
00:24:23,024 --> 00:24:25,252
They just got similar styles, honey.

474
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,599
Well, she's gonna find out at some point.

475
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:30,726
Find out what?

476
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:33,497
Uh, me and Ali are married.

477
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,844
But you like boys.

478
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:36,907
Right.

479
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:39,516
Um, but we're not really married.

480
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,107
Sweetheart, you remember when I told you

481
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,396
that Uncle Jack is originally from England?

482
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,556
You said he was from a island
off the coast of Europe.

483
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:48,795
Yeah... England.

484
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,797
Even though Uncle Jack has been

485
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,930
in this country since before you were born,

486
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,514
he still has to get special permission

487
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,161
so that he can stay here.

488
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,229
Stay here?

489
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,731
Mm-hmm... in America.

490
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,270
And they told him recently

491
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:03,873
he couldn't stay here anymore.

492
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,093
You're leaving?!

493
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,760
I'm not leaving. I promise.

494
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,605
Because you married Ali?

495
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:13,006
Because I married Ali.

496
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:24,409
Jessica's mom married someone
so they can get a green card.

497
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,543
I get it.

498
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,155
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

499
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,626
Tara, Mya... the whole thing.

500
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:39,620
I mean, you're practically her dad.

501
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,946
I'm not her dad. I'm the gay uncle.

502
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:44,936
Doesn't she have any
family that can help out?

503
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:45,958
Who, Mya?

504
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,758
None that will speak to her.

505
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,830
Ugh. I have to go.

506
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,716
Don't wait up. I'll be home late.

507
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,723
Okay.

508
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:55,735
- You're staying?
- I'm staying.

509
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:56,714
Okay.

510
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,085
Well, don't get into any mischief, hubby.

511
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,524
Bye.

512
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,911
Another one.

513
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:13,726
'Sup, stranger?

514
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,728
- Hey!
- I missed you.

515
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:17,956
- I bet you have.
- I missed something.

516
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,466
Oh, is that why I haven't heard from you?

517
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:24,206
Uh... No, but I am a married man now.

518
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,102
Shit. I knew it.

519
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,618
I turned you straight.

520
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,919
Yes, you did.

521
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,852
And you need to respect
my marriage, fucker.

522
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,084
You're breaking my heart.

523
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,023
Shut up.

524
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,074
Green card?

525
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:35,931
No, me and my wife are very much in love.

526
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,633
Mm. Right. Yeah.

527
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,286
Do you shag her morning, noon, and night?

528
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:41,594
Morning, noon, and night.

529
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:43,033
She can't get enough of it.

530
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:45,273
She's beggin' for it.

531
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:56,241
You moving or something?

532
00:26:56,954 --> 00:26:57,824
Shut up.

533
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,800
So, she's moving in?

534
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,665
You think?

535
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:14,454
It's a big deal.

536
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,066
Yeah... huge.

537
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:18,465
I'm serious. I lived with a girl once.

538
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,104
It was a total nightmare.

539
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,449
She got all clingy.

540
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,164
Little different than
your situation, though.

541
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,032
Right.

542
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,241
So... you still have my number?

543
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:34,213
- Craig...
- Relax.

544
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:36,791
We're not drifting into
boyfriend territory. I just...

545
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,010
I like you.

546
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,369
I like that.

547
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,515
I would kiss you goodbye, but

548
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,261
I want to be respectful of your marriage.

549
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,562
Fuck off.

550
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:49,784
See ya next time.

551
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:14,803
Sam?

552
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,581
Sam?

553
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:19,790
Sam!

554
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,126
Sam?

555
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,657
- Sam!

556
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,621
- What?
- You scared the shit out of me!

557
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:26,816
I thought you were dead!

558
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,019
I was just resting my eyeballs.

559
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:31,817
I came by to pick up the camera.

560
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,486
It's right over there.

561
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,030
Thanks.

562
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:42,226
That reminds me...

563
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,241
I found something in the back of the closet

564
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:46,197
you might be interested in.

565
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,853
This belonged to Avedon.

566
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:54,451
Here. It won't break.

567
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,382
It was incredible back then.

568
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,405
I mean, we didn't have any of this
digital thing that we have now.

569
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:06,283
If you wanted an elephant in the shot,

570
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,027
you actually had to ship one in.

571
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,288
You couldn't just sit at the
computer and click, click, click.

572
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,735
It's beautiful.

573
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,182
Yeah.

574
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:16,974
She's seen a thing or two, this one.

575
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:19,625
You really should be shooting again.

576
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:23,012
You know, I always said you had an eye.

577
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,172
Right. I'm off.

578
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,289
Oh, Jack!

579
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:30,105
I'm having some friends
over tonight for cocktails,

580
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,959
and I'd love it if you'd come.

581
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,978
It won't just be a bunch
of old farts, like me.

582
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:36,917
Bring the wife.

583
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:38,757
Okay.

584
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:51,121
These are the folks I
was telling you about.

585
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:52,597
Hi, guys.

586
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:55,306
I want you to meet Mano Alfaro.

587
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,672
He's my architect, and he's from Spain.

588
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:58,867
We've met before.

589
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:01,532
- Yes, we have, at the, uh...
- The gallery.

590
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,427
- Right.
- Yeah.

591
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:04,777
The night Ali threw up on my shoes.

592
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,378
Thank you for reminding me.

593
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,098
How are you guys?

594
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,266
We're great.

595
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,638
- Sam, you were at the stonewall riots?
- Oh, yes, my dear.

596
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:16,039
I threw the first shoe.

597
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,465
- Show me the other one.
- I will.

598
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:19,342
I keep it by the bed at all times.

599
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:21,806
- So...
- So...

600
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:25,079
I was hoping that you
would come back that night

601
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,787
after you helped your friend...

602
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:27,695
Ali?

603
00:31:27,815 --> 00:31:30,302
Yeah. Sorry. My English is not so good.

604
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,218
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

605
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:34,489
Oh, wow. You're...

606
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:36,078
Yes.

607
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,979
- To...
- Yeah.

608
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:39,843
Oh, I...

609
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,789
- There was a problem with my...
- Green card.

610
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:43,172
- Exactly.
- Wow.

611
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,150
So, you, um, build buildings?

612
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:47,244
- Design.
- Right.

613
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,579
Um, are you more of an
office-block kind of guy,

614
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,009
- or do you design homes?
- Homes,

615
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,197
mainly. I used to... I've
done a few buildings, but it's

616
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,862
so sucking, you know, it's...

617
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,751
"So... so sucking"?

618
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:00,533
- Soul sucking.
- Yes, both of them.

619
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,212
So, are you really from Spain,

620
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:04,582
or you just bring the accent on?

621
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:07,523
Oh, no, I just put this on
so I can pick up married men.

622
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:10,457
Well, uh, it's working.

623
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:12,477
Wow. Yeah.

624
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,880
You live here?

625
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:15,781
New York?

626
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:16,348
Yeah.

627
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:18,277
Um... since I was 17.

628
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,692
Oh, wow, that's a long
time to be away from family.

629
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:21,962
Yeah.

630
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:23,720
Are you on holiday?

631
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,641
No, I have a place uptown.

632
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:27,328
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

633
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,680
You want to go outside and get some air?

634
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:30,280
Yeah.

635
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:32,308
Me too.

636
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:41,568
So, do you have a green card?

637
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:44,239
Actually, I was born here in America.

638
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,391
At St. Vincent's hospital.

639
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,264
No way.

640
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:49,063
So you are an American.

641
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,822
I'm a citizen, yes. My
mother's an American.

642
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,537
So you're faking the accent.

643
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:56,070
No.

644
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,093
My mother met my father when, uh,

645
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:01,264
she was stationed in Madrid.

646
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,225
So, how old were you
when you moved to Spain?

647
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:07,020
- 4.
- Wow.

648
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,987
America was just a dream, you know?

649
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:12,431
I heard all about it from my mother.

650
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:14,008
She used to tell me these

651
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,991
fantastic stories about...

652
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:21,622
hot dogs and skyscrapers and subways.

653
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,563
Couldn't wait to leave Spain.

654
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:26,728
And you come here,

655
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,368
and after a while, it's just...

656
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,033
hot dogs and

657
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:34,367
skyscrapers and subways.

658
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,463
Do you miss Spain?

659
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:37,784
I miss my family.

660
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:39,904
Sometimes I wish

661
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:43,140
I could throw a rope over the ocean

662
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,661
and pull Europe closer.

663
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,445
Anyway, I'm talking off your ear.

664
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,341
No, no. I like it.

665
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,066
Mano! We need you in the kitchen!

666
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,805
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, yeah.

667
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:08,703
You're leaving so soon.

668
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,405
Yeah, we have an early call time.

669
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:13,098
Well, can I get your phone number?

670
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,948
I will be outside.

671
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,621
Um, how about you give me yours?

672
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:20,509
You don't want to see me again.

673
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:21,741
No, Mano, I do.

674
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,642
It's just, you seem like a great guy.

675
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:25,370
My life's complicated.

676
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,059
Jack, we're not gonna get married.

677
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,280
I just want to go out sometime.

678
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:32,778
That's my business card.

679
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,054
Thanks.

680
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,400
I hope you use it.

681
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:42,608
Did you call him?

682
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:43,809
Call who?

683
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,292
Come on, Jack.

684
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:47,625
You couldn't take your eyes
off him the whole night.

685
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:48,939
Was it that obvious?

686
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:50,587
He's a good guy.

687
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,906
Sam, I can't date someone.

688
00:34:53,026 --> 00:34:54,320
Why not?

689
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,221
It's all right for a few weeks,

690
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,161
and then they find out, and...

691
00:34:57,737 --> 00:34:59,001
Besides, I don't want Tara to

692
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,709
be introduced to a string of guys.

693
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:03,230
Oh, stop using the kid as an excuse.

694
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,234
I met Harry in the '60s.

695
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,711
We lived together for 32 years,

696
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:09,688
until he died.

697
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,422
And dating back then was tough.

698
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,892
We had to keep it hidden.

699
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,271
But when I first saw him, I thought,

700
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:17,283
"my God.

701
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,192
There he is. He's the one."

702
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,337
And he was.

703
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,721
But only because I took a chance.

704
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,888
I let myself be loved.

705
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:26,289
It's not easy.

706
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,002
But if you find love, true love,

707
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:31,035
even once in this life,

708
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,757
you're a lot luckier than most, Jack.

709
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,659
Sam, that is the most

710
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:38,762
beautifulest thing I've ever heard.

711
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,033
Shut it, you little shit.

712
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:42,379
I'm hanging up.

713
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,448
- 'Sup, stranger?
- Hey.

714
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,388
You don't write. You don't call.

715
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,472
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't see you again.

716
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,214
Here I am.

717
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,310
Do you want to...

718
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,469
Take this back to my place?

719
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,608
Yeah...

720
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:07,991
I mean...

721
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,386
I do, but...

722
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:10,907
hey, don't get all sappy on me.

723
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,184
I mean, if you do, you do.

724
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,716
If you don't, you don't.

725
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,682
I got to go.

726
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:19,641
Don't be like that.

727
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,058
See ya, Craig.

728
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,090
Hi.

729
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,342
He's right there.

730
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:57,831
Hey.

731
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:00,022
You called.

732
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:01,586
- I did.
- Look at you.

733
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,555
So, you're from Madrid?

734
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,406
No, actually, I'm from
a vineyard in the Rioja.

735
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,844
It's been in my family
for a few hundred years.

736
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:13,585
Just a few hundred?

737
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,328
Yes, just a few hundred.

738
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,090
What about you?

739
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,470
The englishman in New York.

740
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,815
I always wanted to study photography, and

741
00:37:25,128 --> 00:37:26,198
as soon as I was old enough,

742
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,945
I got a student visa and never looked back.

743
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,727
And what about your

744
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:31,982
mother and father?

745
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:33,763
They died when I was really young,

746
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:34,976
so my brother brought me up.

747
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:36,084
So he's here?

748
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:38,437
No, he died about seven years ago.

749
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:39,371
Got hit by a car.

750
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,688
I'm sorry to hear that.

751
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,064
Yeah, it's all right.

752
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:50,097
It fucking sucks.

753
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:52,544
Every day, actually.

754
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:54,465
All the time.

755
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:59,352
Sometimes I feel like I got off at the
wrong station or something, you know?

756
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,316
I know.

757
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,534
It's my sister-in-law.

758
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,480
It's okay.

759
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,476
Hello?

760
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,924
No, no. It's fine. It's fine.

761
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:18,028
I can be there in half an hour.

762
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,831
Okay, bye.

763
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,333
It's my niece, Tara.

764
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:24,814
She's in the hospital.

765
00:38:25,947 --> 00:38:27,261
I think I need to go.

766
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,687
Okay.

767
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,939
No, please.

768
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,680
I got it.

769
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,595
Don't be stupid. I just
ruined a perfectly good date.

770
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,563
It's okay. It's okay. It's fine.

771
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,695
- Family comes first. You go.
- Okay.

772
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,292
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

773
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:39,474
It's okay.

774
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:49,221
Mya.

775
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,942
- What happened?
- She suddenly got this fever

776
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:53,008
that wasn't going down,

777
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:54,122
and she wasn't making any sense,

778
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,155
and there was this rash
that I didn't see before.

779
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:56,987
What did the doctors say?

780
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:58,057
They haven't come out yet.

781
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:00,247
- Where is she?
- She's in I.C.U.

782
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,818
- Mrs. Edwards?
- Yes.

783
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:12,484
She has bacterial meningitis.

784
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,142
Did the lumbar puncture come back positive?

785
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:14,505
Yes.

786
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:15,952
And you've put her on antibiotics? Yes.

787
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,384
Is there an increase in ICP?

788
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:18,454
Well, you certainly know your stuff.

789
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:20,036
Is there an increase in ICP?

790
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:22,708
No, look, we caught it
early. She's gonna be fine.

791
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,927
When can we see her?

792
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:25,598
Are you the, um, father?

793
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:26,811
Yes, he's the father.

794
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,295
She's on isolation right now,

795
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,999
but we'll let you know as
soon as you can see her.

796
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,405
Thank you.

797
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:48,730
Did you mean that earlier?

798
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:50,551
What?

799
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,140
About being the father.

800
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:56,151
You know you mean the world to us, Jack.

801
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:16,897
Jack.

802
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:20,826
- Hi.
- Hey.

803
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:22,768
What are you doing here?

804
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,030
I talked to Sam. He told me everything.

805
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:27,282
Is she okay?

806
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,147
Yeah. Oh, she's fine.

807
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:31,410
She's gonna be fine.

808
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,927
I got you some coffee.

809
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:41,660
Oh, Christ.

810
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,268
I need a shower.

811
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:44,745
You're fine.

812
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,706
Have you eaten?

813
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:51,922
I went to my favorite
deli. I got you a bagel.

814
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:54,243
Thank you.

815
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:57,253
Oh, and I got you some clothes, too.

816
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:58,842
We're about the same size.

817
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,796
I got Mya some stuff, too, but
I don't know what size she is.

818
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:04,286
Where did you come from?

819
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:05,950
Spain.

820
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:07,126
La Rioja.

821
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:08,778
La Rioja.

822
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,619
Mano...

823
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:14,921
this is my life.

824
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:18,006
With Mya and Tara

825
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:22,386
and homework and sleepovers
and emergencies and

826
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,080
monsters under the bed.

827
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:30,826
I like your life.

828
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:32,653
You do?

829
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,267
It's life, no?

830
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:37,339
Homework, sleepovers,

831
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,754
monsters under the bed.

832
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,981
Maybe not monsters under the bed.

833
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,515
Okay, well, maybe not
monsters under the bed.

834
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:51,485
Do I smell?

835
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:53,143
Yeah.

836
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,717
But it's okay.

837
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,398
Where'd you get that scar?

838
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:44,047
My father caught me in bed
with the neighbor's son.

839
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:49,290
Did it hurt?

840
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:53,857
Not as much as the fact that
I haven't talked to my father

841
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,453
in years as a result.

842
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:00,359
He doesn't approve of my life choices.

843
00:43:03,036 --> 00:43:04,444
That's too bad.

844
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:07,784
Family's important.

845
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,885
Morning!

846
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,726
- Hey.
- You hungry?

847
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:33,890
Yeah.

848
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:35,385
I thought we'd get pancakes at that place.

849
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:36,949
Sure. Whatever.

850
00:43:38,163 --> 00:43:39,183
You okay?

851
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,267
Yeah. I'm fine.

852
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:42,612
Pancakes.

853
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:43,475
Yeah.

854
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:45,452
- I'll go get dressed.
- Okay.

855
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:46,584
Eugh!

856
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:49,774
Do you want kids one day?

857
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:51,040
I don't know.

858
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:53,180
It's not really something
I've thought about.

859
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,770
I mean, I know you have Tara, but...

860
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,240
Do you want your own?

861
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,899
Is that a loaded question?

862
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:02,565
Quit it.

863
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,356
- Shit.
- What?

864
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:07,020
It's evil ex.

865
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:10,356
- Christina!
- Ali.

866
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:11,676
Jack.

867
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,692
I hear there's congratulations in order.

868
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,788
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna call immigration.

869
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,170
How are you doing?

870
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:20,866
Good, actually.

871
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:22,574
You guys enjoying the married life?

872
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:23,783
Yeah, it's great.

873
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:26,362
Well, you both look good.

874
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:27,918
Must be working for ya.

875
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,876
- Christina, I'm...
- Unh-unh-unh.

876
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:32,079
I didn't want to ruin
a perfectly lovely day

877
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:33,756
with you and your husband.

878
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,221
I just wanted to come by and say hi.

879
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,517
Take care of yourself, Ali.

880
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,563
Jack.

881
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,142
You okay?

882
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,958
Yeah.

883
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:50,447
I'm fine.

884
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:01,989
This is from my family's vineyard.

885
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,554
It's a pretty good year.

886
00:45:03,674 --> 00:45:05,005
It's the year I moved to America.

887
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:06,100
Sam, you want to do the honors?

888
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,132
I would love it.

889
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:08,346
Please.

890
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,297
Great nose.

891
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:18,745
Spectacular color, lots of black.

892
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:27,986
Very fruit-forward... black cherry,

893
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:30,013
persimmon, earth,

894
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:32,303
bark, cinnamon...

895
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:34,029
and a...

896
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,631
whoosh of halia.

897
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:38,610
What? What'd I say?

898
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,080
Okay, you're coming with me to Spain.

899
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:43,034
Well, you do get to take
one bag for free, darling.

900
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:00,890
I'm Jewish.

901
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,150
My father's more upset
that I wasn't bat mitzvahed.

902
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:05,989
You still talk to your dad, right?

903
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:08,135
Yeah. He's very proud of me.

904
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:10,281
I'm a gold-star lesbian.

905
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:11,376
A what?

906
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,858
"gold-star lesbian" means

907
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:15,380
that Ali has never had sex with a man.

908
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,050
Perfect-10 lady gay.

909
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:19,352
They should give out awards for that.

910
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:20,684
They do.

911
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:23,246
But he did choose his new family over me.

912
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:25,152
Well, what was he supposed to do?

913
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,166
You want him to be happy, no?

914
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,870
'Course I do.

915
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,105
I mean, it still hurts a lot.

916
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:36,726
He replaced me with pod people.

917
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,260
- They're just very...
- Normal.

918
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,249
Thank you.

919
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,266
Well, who wants to be normal, eh?

920
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:44,416
Hear, bloody hear.

921
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,055
Sam, you're empty!

922
00:46:46,093 --> 00:46:48,282
Sweetheart, will you get a
bottle of wine in the back?

923
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:49,005
Sure.

924
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:51,110
You're going to trust
him to choose the wine?

925
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,042
He'll be fine.

926
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,244
The good ones are in the back.

927
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,445
Are you coming home tonight?

928
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:38,403
No, I'm gonna stay and clear up here.

929
00:47:38,628 --> 00:47:39,942
Okay.

930
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:43,414
I'll have to call my mother and tell her.

931
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:45,148
That was amazing.

932
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:47,075
Thanks for a great night.

933
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,632
Great wine.

934
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:50,053
- Thanks.
- Night, darling.

935
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:51,661
Thank you.

936
00:47:52,562 --> 00:47:54,138
Thank you.

937
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,297
Bye.

938
00:47:56,928 --> 00:47:58,874
- Good night, guys.
- Bye, guys.

939
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,978
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

940
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:33,792
There's my girl! 

941
00:48:38,757 --> 00:48:40,871
Have you heard yet about your interview?

942
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:42,216
Nope.

943
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:43,974
Not yet.

944
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,390
What was it like for you and Peter?

945
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:48,571
It was pretty easy.

946
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,635
We had our first interview

947
00:48:50,642 --> 00:48:52,863
about nine months after
we sent in the paperwork.

948
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:54,921
What about the second interview?

949
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:57,843
We didn't make it to the second interview.

950
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:01,240
I'm sorry.

951
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,361
It's great, isn't it?

952
00:49:04,162 --> 00:49:04,925
What?

953
00:49:05,113 --> 00:49:06,132
Jack?

954
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:07,840
Settling down?

955
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:10,525
Oh. Yep.

956
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,771
- Finally.

957
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:15,955
He always hoped he
would... you know, Peter.

958
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:21,624
Get her! Get her! 

959
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:25,759
Are you nervous?

960
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,443
About the interview?

961
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,102
A little.

962
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,423
He's hardly home. I mean,

963
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:35,131
we know each other. I'm just...

964
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:38,047
I'm sure I'm just being paranoid.

965
00:49:38,072 --> 00:49:40,386
No, I... I think you should be.

966
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:45,880
Yeah.

967
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:56,272
That's your brother?

968
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,142
He's handsome.

969
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,496
He was everything you'd
want from a big brother.

970
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,580
And I'm sure he would be very
proud of you if he was here.

971
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,182
Tara's an amazing little girl.

972
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:09,473
And that's because of you.

973
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:12,095
Mano, what happens if I get deported?

974
00:50:13,665 --> 00:50:14,916
You're not getting deported.

975
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:15,611
Yeah, but what if I do?

976
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,288
What if I have to go back to England?

977
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:19,309
Then I'll come with you.

978
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,885
Come here.

979
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:25,717
Now come on. Up you get.

980
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:28,032
And take these pictures with you. Come on.

981
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,554
Come on, come on, come on.

982
00:50:35,484 --> 00:50:38,037
I want you to put some pictures up.

983
00:50:39,094 --> 00:50:40,451
Isn't that a big deal?

984
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:41,666
I can take it.

985
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:44,857
Okay.

986
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,210
I even got you these.

987
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,812
You are too funny.

988
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,581
No, wait. Just...

989
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:57,208
Let me just...

990
00:50:57,871 --> 00:51:00,336
one last look before you...

991
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:02,588
Okay.

992
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,190
Do it.

993
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:11,369
- Okay, you can look.

994
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,429
Beautiful.

995
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,656
Okay. My turn.

996
00:51:33,243 --> 00:51:35,189
Okay, more.

997
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,484
Okay.

998
00:52:16,024 --> 00:52:18,821
Hello? Hi!

999
00:52:18,994 --> 00:52:20,189
I'm good.

1000
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,729
Yes, he's treating me well.

1001
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,774
Stop it!

1002
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,553
I can't wait to meet you, too.

1003
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,006
Your mother...

1004
00:52:30,056 --> 00:52:32,581
mum says she can't wait for us to go visit.

1005
00:52:35,925 --> 00:52:38,665
Yeah, I can't leave the country
until I get my green card.

1006
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:41,706
I know it sucks.

1007
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,389
You can't come here?

1008
00:52:46,085 --> 00:52:47,674
I'm sorry to hear that.

1009
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:52,385
Uh... uh, one second. One second.

1010
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:09,009
- Oh, my God.
- It's your dad.

1011
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,855
She said he's not feeling very well.

1012
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:13,376
There's always something
wrong with my dad anyway.

1013
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:16,441
Stop it!

1014
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:17,660
It's Mya.

1015
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,195
Stop it! Stop it.

1016
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,734
Hello?

1017
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:23,324
Yeah.

1018
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:26,252
Of course. Of course.

1019
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:28,893
Okay. Okay, bye.

1020
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:30,570
Everything okay?

1021
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:31,909
Want to come to a slumber party?

1022
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,373
A slumber party?

1023
00:53:33,404 --> 00:53:35,082
Yeah! Yeah, let's go!

1024
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,979
Stop!

1025
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:08,444
It has an unbreakable probe
that uses disposable combs.

1026
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,883
Are you Mrs. Edwards?

1027
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:32,835
Uh, yeah.

1028
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:34,637
We're from immigration
and customs enforcement.

1029
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:36,564
We need to come in and
ask you a few questions.

1030
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,756
- Okay.
- Is Mr. Edwards here?

1031
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:41,569
Uh... no, he's not.

1032
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:43,352
W... what are you doing?

1033
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:44,660
Don't you need a search warrant for this?

1034
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:47,383
We're immigration, Mrs.
Edwards, not the police.

1035
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,985
When will your husband be back home?

1036
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:51,949
Uh... I don't know.

1037
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:53,807
Well you may want to call him.

1038
00:54:56,654 --> 00:54:59,149
Jack, the I.N.S. are here.

1039
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,051
I don't know.

1040
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,192
They want to see you... us.

1041
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:07,207
I don't care who looks after Tara.

1042
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,646
You have to come here now.

1043
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,440
Please repeat after me,

1044
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,318
I declare under penalty of perjury...

1045
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:25,420
I declare under penalty of perjury...

1046
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:27,173
That the following is true and correct.

1047
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,624
That the following is true and correct.

1048
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:30,489
Your husband's visa was denied.

1049
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,227
Yes.

1050
00:55:31,252 --> 00:55:34,099
Were you engaged to be married
before the visa was denied?

1051
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:34,876
No.

1052
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,066
What's your maiden name,
address, and date of birth?

1053
00:55:37,186 --> 00:55:38,786
Alison Federman,

1054
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:42,520
- 300 west 12th street.
- Apartment J4, New York, New York,

1055
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,229
- 10012.
- Your wife's date of birth?

1056
00:55:45,248 --> 00:55:47,706
Uh, April 9, 1981.

1057
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,078
April 9, 1981.

1058
00:55:49,198 --> 00:55:51,429
What was the last meal
you had with each other?

1059
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:52,548
Uh, Italian.

1060
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,682
Takeout.

1061
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,883
Yeah, more specifically.

1062
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:55,984
Chinese.

1063
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,078
Where'd you meet your wife?

1064
00:55:57,142 --> 00:55:58,649
N.Y.U... through friends.

1065
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,351
N.Y.U... the darkroom.

1066
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:01,796
Who sleeps on which side of the bed?

1067
00:56:01,815 --> 00:56:03,407
I sleep on the right.

1068
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,442
I sleep on the left.

1069
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:06,463
I sleep on the left. N... n... n...
no, sorry. I sleep on the right.

1070
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:08,472
I always get that confused.

1071
00:56:08,592 --> 00:56:10,261
What's your husband's favorite food?

1072
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:13,602
Spanish. He likes Spanish food.

1073
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:14,870
Spanish.

1074
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,392
Are you circumcised?

1075
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,674
Is your husband circumcised?

1076
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:25,190
He's English.

1077
00:56:26,835 --> 00:56:28,061
I'm English.

1078
00:56:32,077 --> 00:56:34,079
You're free to go.

1079
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:36,056
- What?
- Yeah, you can go.

1080
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:38,064
You'll have another
meeting in about six months.

1081
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,931
- Ali!
- Don't, Jack! Don't!

1082
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,915
Do you have any idea
what that was like for me?

1083
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:52,691
I'm sorry.

1084
00:56:52,697 --> 00:56:54,124
I didn't know they were
gonna come to the house.

1085
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:55,782
Do you even care about this marriage?

1086
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:57,866
- Of course I do.
- That's the wrong question.

1087
00:56:57,897 --> 00:56:59,574
Do you even care about me?

1088
00:57:00,036 --> 00:57:02,833
'cause I think that all you care
about is what you can get from me

1089
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:03,734
and this marriage.

1090
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:04,804
That's not true!

1091
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,123
Of course I care about you.

1092
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:06,843
Mya needed me.

1093
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,526
You are never here anymore, Jack.

1094
00:57:08,646 --> 00:57:11,323
The second Mano came into this
picture, you just disappeared.

1095
00:57:11,373 --> 00:57:13,450
- I'm sorry.
- I trusted you.

1096
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:15,590
I trusted you with my life.

1097
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,073
I can go to jail because of this.

1098
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:18,750
- Ali!
- Don't touch me!

1099
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,051
He's gone all the time, and
it's really freaking me out.

1100
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:27,658
I mean, I know he has a life, but...

1101
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:28,955
thanks.

1102
00:57:33,072 --> 00:57:35,437
He's basically moved in with him already.

1103
00:57:36,644 --> 00:57:38,487
I'm afraid the I.N.S.
could come back at any time.

1104
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:39,936
I just don't know what to do.

1105
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:42,001
Al, it's not the 1950s.

1106
00:57:42,032 --> 00:57:44,334
If you're not happy, you can get a divorce.

1107
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:46,261
What?

1108
00:57:46,905 --> 00:57:48,857
What about Tara and Mya and...

1109
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:49,777
Ali,

1110
00:57:49,897 --> 00:57:51,510
think about this logically.

1111
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,318
You can go to federal prison

1112
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:55,407
if they find out this
is a fraudulent marriage.

1113
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:57,485
I know he's your best friend,

1114
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,794
but you have to think
about what's right for you,

1115
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:00,819
okay?

1116
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,526
He can find somebody else.

1117
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,712
Hey.

1118
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:07,939
Is he really worth the risk?

1119
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,699
She won't even talk to me.

1120
00:58:17,756 --> 00:58:20,177
Give her some time. She'll come around.

1121
00:58:23,737 --> 00:58:26,490
Mano! What if somebody sees?

1122
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,889
We'll tell them we're European.

1123
00:59:01,796 --> 00:59:02,822
Hi.

1124
00:59:08,603 --> 00:59:09,854
You okay?

1125
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:12,895
I want a divorce. I can't do this.

1126
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,916
I thought I could, but I just, uh...

1127
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:16,900
I'm sorry.

1128
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,893
I spoke with a lawyer. You'll have until
the next meeting before they find out.

1129
00:59:26,315 --> 00:59:27,792
I'm sorry.

1130
00:59:28,405 --> 00:59:29,831
I'm so sorry.

1131
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,216
What happened?

1132
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,936
What happened? 

1133
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,658
Come on.

1134
00:59:55,988 --> 00:59:58,172
This is pretty standard stuff, guys.

1135
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:00,211
And this is a good friend of yours?

1136
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:01,569
Is there nothing we can do?

1137
01:00:01,607 --> 01:00:02,664
You can fight it.

1138
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,754
- It wouldn't be easy.
- How much are we talking?

1139
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:06,506
$10,000, $15,000.

1140
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,808
And there's absolutely no guarantee

1141
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:09,965
they'd approve him anyway.

1142
01:00:10,003 --> 01:00:10,939
I don't want to fight it.

1143
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:11,956
You don't have a choice.

1144
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:13,231
If you leave the country now,

1145
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:14,707
they'll never let you back in.

1146
01:00:14,764 --> 01:00:17,060
- If you were to marry someone else...
- Someone else?

1147
01:00:17,066 --> 01:00:19,118
I know. I know it's risky, but

1148
01:00:19,238 --> 01:00:20,422
it would keep you here.

1149
01:00:20,426 --> 01:00:21,946
So I wouldn't have to go back at all?

1150
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:23,692
- No.
- What about me?

1151
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:26,382
I'm an American citizen.
I could marry Jack.

1152
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,528
Y... you can.

1153
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:33,008
Are you kidding me?

1154
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:34,341
Jack Edwards...

1155
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,512
no, not like this. Why not?

1156
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:37,938
I told you yesterday

1157
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:39,822
that if you were to get deported,

1158
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:42,062
I would go back to England with you.

1159
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:42,987
But this is like...

1160
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:44,996
- For real.
- You don't understand.

1161
01:00:46,028 --> 01:00:47,812
This is exactly what I want.

1162
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,091
Still here, guys.

1163
01:00:52,435 --> 01:00:54,012
You can marry Jack,

1164
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:55,832
but it won't do a damn thing

1165
01:00:55,857 --> 01:00:57,403
to keep him in this country.

1166
01:00:57,721 --> 01:00:59,474
I don't understand.

1167
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,107
It's legal in New York.

1168
01:01:01,132 --> 01:01:04,398
Immigration is a
federal-level right, Mano.

1169
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:08,346
As the law stands, with gay marriage
only being on the state level,

1170
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:09,585
your marriage would mean nothing.

1171
01:01:09,635 --> 01:01:11,399
So our relationship means nothing?

1172
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,545
Your relationship is not the problem here.

1173
01:01:13,558 --> 01:01:16,955
The problem is, you don't have the
same rights as a straight couple.

1174
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:19,902
Your marriage may look and
feel the same, but it's not.

1175
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,343
I'm sorry, guys.

1176
01:01:21,463 --> 01:01:23,631
There's simply nothing we can do.

1177
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,015
Look, my son is gay.

1178
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:29,557
He's been with his partner 10 years now.

1179
01:01:29,677 --> 01:01:31,540
I know what you guys are up against.

1180
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,022
You're gonna have to either

1181
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:34,467
fight this divorce

1182
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:35,912
or find another woman

1183
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:38,177
that would be willing to
go the whole way with you.

1184
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:47,818
Thanks.

1185
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,957
Hey.

1186
01:01:57,377 --> 01:01:58,685
It's gonna be okay.

1187
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:00,656
I promise.

1188
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:18,874
What did you do, Jack?

1189
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:19,982
You must have done something.

1190
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,009
Other than not being there when
the fucking I.N.S. turned up

1191
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,060
Jesus, Jack.

1192
01:02:23,123 --> 01:02:24,725
Well, I was babysitting for you, Mya.

1193
01:02:24,756 --> 01:02:26,388
What, so this is all my fault now?

1194
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:28,321
Well, if you hadn't been called into
work and I wasn't babysitting for you,

1195
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,347
then I would have been there!

1196
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:31,318
Yeah, well, if you hadn't lost your wallet,

1197
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:33,158
none of us would be
here in the first place.

1198
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:36,673
W... what's that supposed to mean?

1199
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:38,557
Nothing. Just forget I ever said it.

1200
01:02:39,682 --> 01:02:41,265
- You think that I...
- No!

1201
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:44,218
What I think is, sometimes
things happen in life, okay?

1202
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:45,933
I think sometimes things happen,

1203
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:47,409
and you just have to grow the fuck up

1204
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:48,429
and move on.

1205
01:02:48,457 --> 01:02:50,365
You think that I killed Peter.

1206
01:02:50,397 --> 01:02:51,792
I didn't say that.

1207
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,468
No, you think that I killed my own brother!

1208
01:02:53,475 --> 01:02:54,495
I didn't say that.

1209
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,937
So what did you say?!

1210
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,936
I didn't say anything.

1211
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,401
I didn't think anything.

1212
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:01,615
Just drop it, okay?

1213
01:03:01,922 --> 01:03:03,160
Go on. Say it.

1214
01:03:04,975 --> 01:03:06,664
Say it, Mya.

1215
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:09,585
Say what you've been wanting to say

1216
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:11,950
- for seven fucking years!
- All right, fine!

1217
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,146
Okay?

1218
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:16,399
I wish it was you.

1219
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:18,983
I wish to God it was you
that was killed that night.

1220
01:03:19,014 --> 01:03:20,647
I wish it was you

1221
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,668
that was standing outside in the rain

1222
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:25,934
by that cab while my husband kept me warm

1223
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:30,145
when I had just found out I
was pregnant with his child!

1224
01:03:34,537 --> 01:03:36,201
You don't think that I wish that?

1225
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,666
Every day?

1226
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,682
Mya, I know who I am.

1227
01:03:43,376 --> 01:03:44,968
I'm not her father.

1228
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,586
I'm just the gay uncle.

1229
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:52,166
- I'm sorry.
- I got to go.

1230
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:53,561
I'm sorry.

1231
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,596
Hey, guys. Here they are.

1232
01:04:33,627 --> 01:04:35,091
Hey. Sorry we're late.

1233
01:04:35,211 --> 01:04:36,436
So, this is April.

1234
01:04:36,474 --> 01:04:38,044
- Hi.
- Hi.

1235
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:40,115
Wow.

1236
01:04:40,402 --> 01:04:43,118
You two guys certainly
make a handsome couple.

1237
01:04:43,455 --> 01:04:47,178
Yes, one that doesn't have too
many rights, or so it seems.

1238
01:04:47,197 --> 01:04:49,184
Well, that's why we're here, gentlemen.

1239
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,678
It's my mother.

1240
01:04:54,467 --> 01:04:56,424
I have to take this call.

1241
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,240
- What time is it there?
- Early.

1242
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,090
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

1243
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,025
Well, I think we have a solution.

1244
01:05:03,251 --> 01:05:04,784
Right. Um...

1245
01:05:04,796 --> 01:05:07,824
the reason I wanted to
meet you, Jack, is, uh,

1246
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:10,608
Sam told me you're looking for a wife.

1247
01:05:10,646 --> 01:05:11,753
Yeah, for my green card.

1248
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:12,810
Right.

1249
01:05:13,361 --> 01:05:14,894
Because it's funny...

1250
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:17,747
I was just telling Sam
how I was having such

1251
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:21,075
a difficult time meeting any decent guys.

1252
01:05:21,094 --> 01:05:22,257
I mean, they're all such...

1253
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:23,409
douchebags.

1254
01:05:23,459 --> 01:05:25,092
Sorry. You have to take them, too.

1255
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:27,883
Anyway, I'm not getting any younger,

1256
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:30,079
and I'd really like to have a baby.

1257
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:31,605
So what we were thinking is,

1258
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,676
if you would donate some sperm

1259
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:35,303
so April can have a baby...

1260
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:37,624
I would marry you for your green card.

1261
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,945
Donate sperm?

1262
01:05:39,995 --> 01:05:43,442
If we time it right, I could be
pregnant for the I.N.S. meeting.

1263
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,520
and then no one could question
why you're getting married.

1264
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:48,973
It's perfect.

1265
01:05:49,016 --> 01:05:51,132
Plus, you'd both have a vested interest,

1266
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:52,339
so no one could back out.

1267
01:05:52,352 --> 01:05:54,028
Well, I certainly couldn't back out.

1268
01:05:54,047 --> 01:05:55,511
I'd be pregnant.

1269
01:05:55,574 --> 01:05:57,745
- It'd be very obvious.
- I guess.

1270
01:05:57,865 --> 01:06:00,141
I... I don't know what to say. Um...

1271
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,387
can you excuse me for just one second?

1272
01:06:02,419 --> 01:06:03,476
Jack?

1273
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:12,178
It's my father.

1274
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,056
He had a stroke.

1275
01:06:39,864 --> 01:06:42,373
There's been extensive brain damage.

1276
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:47,815
They said it's gonna be a
very long rehabilitation.

1277
01:06:48,397 --> 01:06:49,717
Jesus, Mano.

1278
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:51,088
I have to go back.

1279
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:53,156
Of course. You must.

1280
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,746
I was hoping you would come with me.

1281
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,643
You know I can't do that.

1282
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,019
I wouldn't get back in the country.

1283
01:07:04,051 --> 01:07:06,084
I wasn't thinking we would be coming back.

1284
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:12,134
I already turned in my resignation.

1285
01:07:13,485 --> 01:07:14,731
You're moving back?

1286
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,512
My mother can't do this by herself.

1287
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:20,568
Isn't there another family
member that can help?

1288
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,254
This is my father, Jack.

1289
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:23,862
The man almost beat you half to death

1290
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,240
when you told him you were gay.

1291
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:27,178
He's my flesh and blood.

1292
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:28,899
He needs me.

1293
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:31,889
You think this is what I want to do?

1294
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,348
You think this is...

1295
01:07:34,585 --> 01:07:35,793
Easy? This is...

1296
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,963
I don't know what to do, Jack.

1297
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,022
Well, you have to go back.

1298
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:41,792
Then come with me.

1299
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:53,586
Maybe we can do a long-distance thing.

1300
01:07:53,706 --> 01:07:57,140
I could throw rope across the
ocean and pull Europe closer.

1301
01:07:59,098 --> 01:08:01,376
You could come here every couple of months.

1302
01:08:06,363 --> 01:08:09,166
I guess I misunderstood
what was going on here.

1303
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,908
We can have a marriage in Spain...

1304
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:26,036
a real marriage.

1305
01:08:26,073 --> 01:08:27,869
I can't leave, Mano.

1306
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:36,791
Whose life are you living, anyway?

1307
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:46,625
- I fell in love with you.
- Yeah.

1308
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:48,846
And I fell in love with you.

1309
01:09:11,695 --> 01:09:13,381
You got me a ticket?

1310
01:09:22,475 --> 01:09:24,595
In case you change your mind.

1311
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:35,632
I should go.

1312
01:10:10,526 --> 01:10:12,359
You babysit her, huh?

1313
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,592
Hey, nice to meet you. Kathy.

1314
01:10:16,143 --> 01:10:17,545
Hi.

1315
01:10:55,873 --> 01:10:59,052
I'm sorry. I... I called. I just...

1316
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:25,060
- Where's Mano?
- He moved back to Spain.

1317
01:11:29,177 --> 01:11:30,716
Thank you.

1318
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:41,334
I should... okay.

1319
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,044
Good luck, Jack.

1320
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,470
Hey. Yeah.

1321
01:12:16,352 --> 01:12:18,417
Um, do you want to meet for a drink?

1322
01:12:19,781 --> 01:12:22,171
Hey.

1323
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:23,541
Hey, handsome.

1324
01:12:23,597 --> 01:12:24,805
I didn't think you were gonna show.

1325
01:12:24,811 --> 01:12:25,812
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

1326
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:26,869
No worries. You're here now.

1327
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,096
Two shots.

1328
01:12:28,152 --> 01:12:29,766
- We're celebrating?
- Sure.

1329
01:12:29,886 --> 01:12:31,937
So, I haven't heard from you in a while.

1330
01:12:31,956 --> 01:12:32,870
You still all loved up?

1331
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:34,171
No.

1332
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:36,023
Sorry to hear that.

1333
01:12:36,705 --> 01:12:38,776
Actually, I'm just having a
really hard time right now,

1334
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:40,078
and I could really use a friend.

1335
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:47,548
You coming in?

1336
01:12:48,161 --> 01:12:49,456
I can't, Jack.

1337
01:12:49,944 --> 01:12:51,245
Not even for a bit?

1338
01:12:51,295 --> 01:12:53,510
I thought maybe you could stay the night.

1339
01:12:54,573 --> 01:12:57,107
Look, you're a great guy,

1340
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,936
and God knows I love hooking up with you,

1341
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:01,944
but this isn't what I signed up for.

1342
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:04,435
It's not what either of
us signed up for, right?

1343
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:08,276
I got to go.

1344
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,497
Okay.

1345
01:14:33,231 --> 01:14:35,089
Hobnobs?

1346
01:14:35,634 --> 01:14:37,235
I'm glad you called, son.

1347
01:14:41,696 --> 01:14:43,404
I really fucked up, didn't I?

1348
01:14:45,018 --> 01:14:46,451
Hey, hang on.

1349
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:52,519
Here... I want you to have this, Jack.

1350
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:53,870
Sam.

1351
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,235
It's seen too much just
to be sitting on a shelf

1352
01:14:56,273 --> 01:14:57,781
somewhere, gathering dust.

1353
01:14:58,638 --> 01:14:59,708
I can't.

1354
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:02,235
You can. And you will.

1355
01:15:05,489 --> 01:15:07,391
Take beautiful pictures, Jack.

1356
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:11,539
Thank you.

1357
01:15:24,259 --> 01:15:26,374
Okay. Okay.

1358
01:15:32,643 --> 01:15:34,131
Uncle Jack?

1359
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:39,574
Are you going to live with Uncle Mano?

1360
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:41,933
You know I can't do that.

1361
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,511
But you love him, don't you?

1362
01:15:44,631 --> 01:15:46,557
I promised I'd never leave you.

1363
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:50,016
Promises are for kids so they
don't feel scared about things.

1364
01:15:50,523 --> 01:15:52,125
Where'd you get all this?

1365
01:15:52,245 --> 01:15:53,257
I don't know.

1366
01:15:53,269 --> 01:15:55,603
But you guys should
just get married already.

1367
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,530
And leave you here?

1368
01:15:57,824 --> 01:15:59,332
To be honest,

1369
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:02,472
you've been pretty useless
since Uncle Mano left.

1370
01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:04,908
You want me to check for
monsters under the bed?

1371
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:06,489
Don't be silly.

1372
01:16:06,545 --> 01:16:09,023
There are no monsters under the bed.

1373
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,000
Of course there's not.

1374
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:13,672
Night-night.

1375
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,805
Good night, Uncle Jack.

1376
01:16:22,555 --> 01:16:25,396
- Hi.
- Hi.

1377
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:26,631
How's it going?

1378
01:16:26,635 --> 01:16:28,806
Well, right now I'm trying to remember how

1379
01:16:28,824 --> 01:16:32,835
prokaryotic cells transfer genetic
information to other prokaryotic cells.

1380
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:33,988
This test is tomorrow.

1381
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:36,701
I haven't even gone through
half of these things.

1382
01:16:37,127 --> 01:16:39,560
- Want some help?
- I would love some.

1383
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,295
Okay.

1384
01:16:41,415 --> 01:16:44,378
Lysosomes are not found
in prokaryotic cells...

1385
01:16:44,397 --> 01:16:45,660
true or false?

1386
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,896
Lysosomes are only found
in eukaryotic cells.

1387
01:16:48,921 --> 01:16:51,992
The difference between prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells is that

1388
01:16:52,005 --> 01:16:54,545
prokaryotic cells have no true nucleus

1389
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,767
or membrane bound organelles
but eukaryotic cells do.

1390
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,996
- Is that true or false?
- False.

1391
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:00,997
Correct.

1392
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,153
Okay. One down.

1393
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:04,592
200 to go.

1394
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:07,559
Hey, I'm really sorry about
what I said the other day.

1395
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,531
You've been more of a father to Tara
than I could ever have hoped for.

1396
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,748
I really couldn't have
done this without you.

1397
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:17,025
- Yeah, you could.
- No. I couldn't.

1398
01:17:18,996 --> 01:17:21,135
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

1399
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:24,170
No.  I don't want to talk about it.

1400
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,210
Uh, sporulation is initiated

1401
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:29,356
by the lack of nutrients in the media...

1402
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:30,645
- true or false.
- True.

1403
01:17:30,683 --> 01:17:32,197
Are you gonna move to Spain?

1404
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,906
The cell compound labeled
7 in this diagram...

1405
01:17:34,937 --> 01:17:36,895
hey, I'm serious.

1406
01:17:37,015 --> 01:17:39,529
Tara's almost 8. I'm
almost done with school.

1407
01:17:39,961 --> 01:17:41,800
- Spain?
- Yeah. So what?

1408
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,014
We'll come visit you.

1409
01:17:43,057 --> 01:17:46,861
You know your brother wanted her to
spend as much time in Europe as possible.

1410
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:49,230
I can't just up and leave you guys.

1411
01:17:49,276 --> 01:17:50,559
You can.

1412
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:53,250
You've been living our life
for the last eight years.

1413
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:54,951
- It's what I wanted.
- I know.

1414
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,184
I love Tara.

1415
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:57,241
Of course you do.

1416
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:00,083
But this is your life, Jack.

1417
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:02,677
Right.

1418
01:18:05,135 --> 01:18:08,789
Prokaryotic cells transfer genetic
information by the use of...

1419
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:13,124
"a," pili, "b," mitochondria,
or "c," flag-ela.

1420
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,671
"A," pili.

1421
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:15,658
Correct!

1422
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:17,830
- Okay.
- Next.

1423
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:18,868
I don't like this.

1424
01:18:18,988 --> 01:18:21,083
What do you mean you don't like this?

1425
01:19:38,938 --> 01:19:40,541
See?

1426
01:19:40,571 --> 01:19:41,757
I told you.

1427
01:19:41,763 --> 01:19:43,177
Well, they're not perfect.

1428
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:44,411
Yeah, right.

1429
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,836
They're great.

1430
01:19:45,849 --> 01:19:48,185
Sam, I could find a cup,
and you'd think it was great.

1431
01:19:50,594 --> 01:19:51,418
Here, look.

1432
01:19:51,695 --> 01:19:53,090
This is totally blown out.

1433
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:54,822
Yeah, and you can fix that later.

1434
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:56,094
Well, I know, but

1435
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:58,383
if I'd got it right the first
time, I wouldn't have to.

1436
01:19:58,434 --> 01:19:59,197
It's beautiful.

1437
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:00,974
Hm. I don't know.

1438
01:20:01,012 --> 01:20:03,226
You have too great an eye to...

1439
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:08,301
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh,

1440
01:20:08,421 --> 01:20:11,723
- Mya, maybe we should...
- No. No, no. Please... stay.

1441
01:20:12,462 --> 01:20:14,013
I won't be long.

1442
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:17,441
I never sent them in.

1443
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:25,731
We're still married?

1444
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,470
- Okay, Sam, maybe we should...
- Yeah, let's...

1445
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:31,800
Take a closer look at these.

1446
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:37,951
Look, I never meant to
hurt you. I just got scared.

1447
01:20:38,164 --> 01:20:39,628
We're still married?

1448
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:43,069
I tried to mail them, but
I couldn't, for some reason.

1449
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:45,947
- You had this the whole time?
- Yeah.

1450
01:20:46,785 --> 01:20:48,873
You can still get your green card.

1451
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,579
I thought you'd be more happy.

1452
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,231
Are you fucking kidding me?

1453
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,825
I think you should leave.

1454
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:09,589
Ali! Ali! Wait, wait.

1455
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:12,873
Thank you.

1456
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,919
- Are you joking?
- No.

1457
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:15,982
No.

1458
01:21:16,245 --> 01:21:18,154
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

1459
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:21,300
What you did for us, for me...

1460
01:21:21,888 --> 01:21:23,815
Jack, I know I put you through a lot.

1461
01:21:23,865 --> 01:21:25,654
No. I was selfish and single-minded,

1462
01:21:25,686 --> 01:21:27,512
and you put your whole life at risk.

1463
01:21:28,026 --> 01:21:29,539
Well, that's a little dramatic.

1464
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,257
Do you forgive me?

1465
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:36,323
I do.

1466
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:37,847
Do you forgive me?

1467
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:39,117
I do.

1468
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,159
What are you gonna do?

1469
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:14,060
Anyone want a piece of me?

1470
01:22:14,467 --> 01:22:16,607
- No, thank you, dear.

1471
01:22:19,691 --> 01:22:21,756
Okay.

1472
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:24,377
This is it.

1473
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:27,105
I'll see you real soon, okay?

1474
01:22:27,305 --> 01:22:29,695
- You promise?
- I promise.

1475
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:35,614
Happy graduation.

1476
01:22:35,627 --> 01:22:38,042
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1477
01:22:42,898 --> 01:22:45,419
- You take a lot of pictures, now.
- Yes.

1478
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,322
Okay.

1479
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,180
Come here, you.

1480
01:22:50,774 --> 01:22:53,346
I'll miss you.

1481
01:22:55,873 --> 01:22:57,793
I can't believe we're gay divorces.

1482
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:04,193
I love you.

1483
01:23:05,782 --> 01:23:07,716
Jack, wait.

1484
01:23:07,897 --> 01:23:09,680
What's this?

1485
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,639
Don't open it yet.

1486
01:23:12,283 --> 01:23:13,334
Okay.

1487
01:23:14,898 --> 01:23:16,800
All right.

1488
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:18,778
I'm leaving.

1489
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,633
I believe in family.

1490
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:18,485
I believe in fate.

1491
01:25:19,142 --> 01:25:22,120
I believe you can turn for
one second and miss a lifetime,

1492
01:25:22,327 --> 01:25:25,092
but your past does not dictate your future.

1493
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:28,476
I believe the people that
you love are your life,

1494
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:31,035
that there are things worth fighting for.

1495
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,257
I believe we should all
have the freedom to love,

1496
01:25:34,308 --> 01:25:35,903
to create family,

1497
01:25:36,134 --> 01:25:38,243
and not be afraid of who we are.

1498
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:40,114
I believe in love.

1499
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,010
I do.
