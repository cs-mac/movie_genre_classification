1
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,993
It's a red light!

2
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,200
Hang on to your seat!

3
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:09,548
Charlie! I can't believe
you did that.

4
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,777
You scared me half to death!

5
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:17,022
I can't open my door.
How am I supposed to get out?

6
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,524
You said you wanted
to go to this dance.

7
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:23,757
I do want to go to the dance.
I just didn't think...

8
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,924
Hi, Charlie. Nice parking job.

9
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,712
This is gonna cost me $2.00.

10
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,292
Hi. Hello.

11
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:20,549
You're looking pretty. Thank you.
You look nice yourself.

12
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,855
Look who's here!

13
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:36,233
Your favorite from the Rainbow
Road, Miss Patsy Cline.

14
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:40,637
Howdy. You all havin'
a good time? Yeah!

15
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:45,804
This is a Bob Wills' tune
that I picked special
just to sing to you.

16
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:55,753
Deep within my
heart lies a melody

17
00:02:55,822 --> 00:03:00,259
A song of old San Antone

18
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:05,856
Where in dreams I
live with a memory

19
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:10,266
Beneath the stars all alone

20
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:13,397
Well, it was there I found

21
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,998
Beside the Alamo

22
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:20,740
Enchantment strange
as the blue up above

23
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:25,945
On that moonlit pass
that only he would know

24
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,115
Still hears my
broken song of love

25
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,351
That's Cline?

26
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:35,292
Patsy Cline. Right.

27
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,694
Why don't I know her?
Damned if I know.

28
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,857
She sings at the Rainbow Road?

29
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,764
On weekends, yeah.

30
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:45,737
Lips so sweet and tender
like petals fallin' apart

31
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:48,740
Thanks for bringing me,
Charlie. Speak once again

32
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,470
Of my love, my own

33
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:55,709
Broken song Empty words I know

34
00:03:55,782 --> 00:04:00,446
Shall live in my heart all alone

35
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,886
For that moonlit pass

36
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:05,823
She went to school
with my brother.

37
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:09,157
They used to say,
" Don't dare Patsy if
you don't want it done."

38
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:14,456
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

39
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:18,095
She's got real nice tits.

40
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,969
And she's married,
Bozo. You lose.

41
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:26,778
Thank you.

42
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,089
Stop it! You're such a geek!

43
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,031
Hi. Hi.

44
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,836
I want you to get your coat.

45
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,604
I wanna drive you someplace
for a drink. I want us to
dance a while.

46
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:01,044
Then I want us to get to know
each other a lot better.

47
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:04,311
You want a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I do, baby.

48
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:10,515
Well, people in hell want
ice water. That don't
mean they get it.

49
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,668
Patsy, you never did.

50
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:26,103
I did so. I looked him right
in the eye and said...

51
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:29,437
"People in hell want ice water.
That don't mean they get it."

52
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,569
Who was he? Some clown
with hot britches.

53
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:38,243
Lord, I do get tired of men
sometimes, always pawin'
and snortin' around.

54
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,747
They after you all the
time when you were my age?

55
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,254
I don't know.

56
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,314
Were they, Mama?
Tell me. Stop it.

57
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,825
Quit, Patsy.

58
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:52,390
Back when I was in high school
and had a better shape...

59
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:55,593
there was this boy
named Teddy Welloff.

60
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,070
Had gray eyes with
coal black eyelashes.

61
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,733
This is way before
I met your daddy.

62
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:05,266
May he rot in hell. Don't speak
like that about Daddy.

63
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:09,076
Anyway, at lunch we'd all
go in the cloakroom to
get our dinner buckets.

64
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:13,381
Every day this Teddy
Welloff used to brush his
front up against me...

65
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,648
when I was bent over.

66
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:18,714
That's the truth.
Wait, there's more.

67
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,856
One day, I took my
ink pen with me.

68
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,957
That thing had a real
sharp point on it.

69
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,931
I never looked at him
the rest of the day...

70
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:39,377
but there was egg salad sandwich
all over that cloakroom.

71
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:42,711
That boy walked funny for a week.

72
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,984
I'm gonna pee my pants.

73
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,951
You gonna come in for a while?

74
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:55,392
Is Gerald still up?

75
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:57,225
It looks like it.

76
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:00,664
No, honey, I better go
on home. You chicken!

77
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,668
I'll be over for Sunday dinner.

78
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,499
Bye.

79
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,004
Nightynight.

80
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,006
Good night, baby.

81
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:13,745
I'm home.

82
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:16,341
How'd it go?

83
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,580
Well, I only made $25.

84
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,417
I did real good I
think. That's nice.

85
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,618
I sang "San Antonio Rose."

86
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,666
I've been gone all evening.
Don't you want to talk to me?

87
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,502
Say "Kiss my ass" or something?

88
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:42,632
Sorry, honey.
How'd it go tonight?

89
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,974
You already asked me that.

90
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:48,707
Ask me something else?

91
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:51,683
Come on, let's have
a conversation.

92
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,514
Notice anything different?

93
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,020
I finished the riggin'.

94
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:06,031
Patsy, why are you always
pushing at me so hard?

95
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,532
I don't know.

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,661
Just hoping for a fight,
or a laugh or something.

97
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:15,265
I don't want to fight
with you. I'm not mad.

98
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:24,647
I can't stand it. Makes me want
to scream and claw my face.

99
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,150
What should I do?

100
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,414
You didn't ask me how to
get into this marriage.

101
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:31,548
I don't think you ought to
ask me how to get out of it.

102
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,489
Is he mean to you? No.

103
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,461
Does he drink? Gamble?

104
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,463
Does he chase the women?

105
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,964
Then what?

106
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,835
Come on, girl. Speak the
truth and shame the devil.

107
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,895
God as my witness, I don't know!

108
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:51,967
I laid in bed and thought,
" Shit! What if I was blind
or didn't have my legs?"

109
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,979
You watch that mouth.

110
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,147
Mom, I'm home.

111
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:57,649
I'm starvin'.

112
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,316
There's lunch made,
but don't spoil your dinner.

113
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:05,221
Say hello to your sister before
you worry about your belly.

114
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,988
I don't know, Mama.
My life ain't so bad.

115
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,553
I got a decent house,
a man who loves me.

116
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:14,600
I've even sung on
television four times.

117
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:19,229
Tell me. Why do I have to
force myself to get out
of bed every mornin'?

118
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:22,968
You always was hard to
keep satisfied, even when
you was little.

119
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:26,034
I'm not talking about
when I was three.

120
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,239
I'm asking you what
I should do now.

121
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:33,317
Maybe you should scream and claw
your face. See if that'll help.

122
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,895
I said blue moon of
Kentucky keep on ashinin'

123
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,410
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

124
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,780
Blue moon of Kentucky
keep on ashinin'

125
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:11,816
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

126
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:15,827
It was on one moonlit night

127
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:19,092
Stars shining bright

128
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,157
Whispered on high

129
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,135
Love said goodbye

130
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:29,334
I said blue moon of
Kentucky keep on ashinin'

131
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:35,576
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

132
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,676
Thank you. Goddamn
woman, you're good!

133
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,687
That bitch can sing!

134
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,985
I don't know if you
remember me. Take a walk.

135
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:54,515
I really like the way you sing.
What were you doing while I sang?

136
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,528
You think that's funny?
I was listening.

137
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,963
I don't like the way you
listen. Take a walk.

138
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,751
Hi.

139
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:24,548
Oh, merciful God.
I want to explain.

140
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,649
It's the creature
that wouldn't die.

141
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,752
I came over here to
explain. He won't go away.

142
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,925
To apologize for messin' you up.
I was just enjoying your singin'.

143
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:39,237
Now that I get a good
look at Patsy Cline,
she don't look so hot.

144
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:43,271
I don't care if you have
sung on some halfassed
television program.

145
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:45,936
You don't sing that good.

146
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:48,810
You ever listen to a Kitty
Wells record real close?

147
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,008
You'd go home and slit
your goddamn throat.

148
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,622
I've grown so used
to that man somehow

149
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,690
And I'm nobody's sugar baby now

150
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:11,498
'Cause I'm lonesome

151
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:16,508
I got the lovesick blues

152
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:25,479
We're gonna take a
break. Thank you.

153
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,661
Seven and seven.

154
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,361
Last week at the high
school you said you
wanted to buy me a drink.

155
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,596
I want a seven and seven.

156
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,002
A seventyseven.

157
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:51,604
Well, you've got the
advantage on me.

158
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:54,976
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

159
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,480
Charlie.

160
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,509
Charlie Dick.

161
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,018
Dick?

162
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,721
Charlie Dick?

163
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,326
That's right.

164
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,756
What do you want
out of me, Charlie?

165
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,964
You didn't follow me out
to Rainbow Road because
you're a fool for music.

166
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:21,598
Hell no. I want to get
to know you better.

167
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,336
Okay. What does that mean?

168
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,605
It means I want to get
to know you better.

169
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,073
I figure when you say you want
to get to know me better...

170
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:36,451
what you mean is you want
a tenminute screw in the
backseat of your car.

171
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,490
Son of a bitch.

172
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,592
You must think that thing
you got between your legs
is lined with gold.

173
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,255
I can get tail anytime.

174
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:49,267
I don't have to crawl
after a mean woman who's
got a cob crossways.

175
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,903
If I just want to bump uglies
with somebody, I got plenty
of places to go.

176
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,237
"Bump uglies"? That's right.

177
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,904
My Lord, what a charming
expression.

178
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:49,391
I just grew up.

179
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:56,058
My daddy dumped us
when I was about 16.

180
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,069
I haven't seen him since.

181
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:01,265
But Mom and I did okay.

182
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,276
She couldn't work too much,
so I've worked pretty
steady since I was 15.

183
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,835
You made a livin' for
the whole family?

184
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,904
No. Mama sewed for people.

185
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,478
But basically I did.

186
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,812
I want to ask you something.

187
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,413
What?

188
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:21,255
You know all those things
you said you want?

189
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:22,954
Yeah.

190
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,054
Answer me quick.
Which you want most?

191
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,567
All of it. I want it all.

192
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,932
And I want to make it right.

193
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,436
I do.

194
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:37,204
Since I've been 11 or 12 years
old, I've had my life mapped out.

195
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:42,077
I haven't pushed hard these
last years, but I'm gonna
start next year.

196
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:46,209
I'm starting next year,
too, by God. That's the
time to start for me.

197
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,913
I'm serious. I'm gonna
be a singer.

198
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,889
I'm gonna make some
money, have some kids...

199
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,949
and then I'm gonna stop singing
and raise those kids right.

200
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,360
Have a big house with
yellow roses all around it.

201
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,534
You think that's silly? No.

202
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:08,733
I figure somebody
ought to be happy.

203
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:12,209
Hell. It might as
well be me. Right?

204
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,711
Right.

205
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,947
I've never met a woman like you.

206
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,143
I can talk to you.

207
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:24,986
You know what that
means to a man?

208
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:29,794
Do you?

209
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:32,997
I don't know.

210
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,208
Let's go dancin'.

211
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,810
Where? Right out here. Come on.

212
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,720
In the parking lot? Yep.

213
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,925
Are you kiddin'?

214
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,288
I don't do this. You don't?

215
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,388
No. But I'm doin' it.

216
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,914
No, Charlie, don't leave me.

217
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,862
I was starving,
and I didn't even know.

218
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:27,805
Hey, Mama!

219
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,933
Mama, come here.

220
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,944
What are you doing here
on Sunday morning?

221
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:35,207
Mama, I feel so good!

222
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:39,176
Don't give me that dark
look. I feel so damn good!

223
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,414
What's them suitcases?
I left him.

224
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,620
I don't care!

225
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,252
There's a man. No,
I'm doing this for me.

226
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:52,263
There's a man. Mama! Honey baby!

227
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,764
Come on, honey.

228
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,968
Be happy for me.
Does Gerald know?

229
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:01,529
I stopped by on my way
over here and told him.

230
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,802
You know what he said? What?

231
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:07,744
"Patsy, if your considered
opinion is that you really
want a divorce...

232
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:10,179
I'll not stand in your way."

233
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,176
There's a man. You're too happy.

234
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:15,914
Yes, there is.

235
00:21:15,988 --> 00:21:18,149
I don't know. There might be.

236
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:22,216
I don't know, but oh,
sweet Jesus, I just feel so good.

237
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:28,198
Oh, my darling, you're crying

238
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,235
Boohoohoohoo

239
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:35,400
There's no use in denying

240
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:38,841
I've cried for you

241
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:42,938
It was your favorite pastime

242
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:44,949
Making me blue

243
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,617
Last week was the last time

244
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:53,055
I cried for you

245
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,657
Seven hankies blue

246
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,723
I filled with my tears

247
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,860
Seven letters too

248
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:08,998
I filled with my fears

249
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,134
Guess it never pays

250
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:16,011
To make your lover blue

251
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:19,107
Seven lonely days

252
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:22,051
I cried and I cried for you

253
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:25,648
Oh, my darling, you're crying

254
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:28,522
Boohoohoohoo

255
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,845
Your cheating heart

256
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:54,614
Will make you weep

257
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:59,855
You'll cry and cry

258
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,726
And try to sleep

259
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:12,294
But sleep won't come

260
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:16,740
The whole night through

261
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:22,544
Your cheating heart

262
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:28,685
Will tell on you

263
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:35,457
When tears come down

264
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:40,464
Like falling rain

265
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:45,068
You'll toss around

266
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:46,798
Nice day.

267
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,567
Great day.

268
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,371
Do you want to top me
all the time? Just say,
"Yes, it's a nice day."

269
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:55,038
Yes, it's a nice day.

270
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,580
This water is cold.

271
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,586
We used to come swimmin'
here up till November.

272
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:05,680
I'm telling you, this water's
got ice cubes in it.

273
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:09,956
A guy in my class says he saw an
8foot water moccasin in here...

274
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:12,724
with his mouth open,
showing white.

275
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,732
I ain't afraid of snakes.

276
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,564
Take a swim, big talk. Go ahead.

277
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:20,628
I'll pay you. How much will
it take for you to jump in?

278
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:23,470
What? I'm serious. How much?

279
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,476
Three hundred.
You'd really do it?

280
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:27,842
You got the cash? I love it!

281
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:30,108
Man, I wish I had $300.

282
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:33,481
You don't have it?
I ain't jumping in for nothin'.

283
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,486
I'll save you.

284
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,663
You want to have other
nice days like today?

285
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:47,198
Sure.

286
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,633
I mean lots of them. Sure.

287
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:52,670
No, I mean lots of them.

288
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,901
Good times all the
time, Sunday to Sunday.

289
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,477
What?

290
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,339
Charlie?

291
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:05,383
Wanna get married?

292
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,318
I dare you!

293
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:11,822
Yes!

294
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,992
You telling me yes? Yes!

295
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,437
Beautiful. Doesn't
she look beautiful?

296
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,437
Are you ready?

297
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:37,948
We're ready.

298
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,754
Byebye.

299
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,862
If you find yourself
wondering what to do in
the dark, give me a call.

300
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,523
I think I can manage.
I'll see you at work.

301
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,032
On Monday morning.

302
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,567
Byebye, Mama.

303
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:59,263
I love you, sugar.
You take care of yourself.

304
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:03,365
You look so pretty today. Bye.

305
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:18,814
What the hell you been
doing in there? Come here.

306
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:34,337
It's kind of scary,
isn't it? What do you mean?

307
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,864
You go out and buy a new dress...

308
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,605
stand in front of a
preacher, say a few words...

309
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,273
suddenly everything's changed.

310
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:49,812
I just want it to work out,
Charlie. I want everything
to be right.

311
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:53,156
Well, come here.

312
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,154
Wait.

313
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:01,222
This is my wedding night.

314
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,461
I want the words.

315
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:06,593
Say the words.

316
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:11,442
I love you.

317
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:15,104
Say it again.
I love you, goddamn it!

318
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,239
That's so nice.

319
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,784
I want this to work out, too.

320
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:22,251
I'm sure as hell gonna try.

321
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:24,551
Yeah? Yeah.

322
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,446
Here. You look like you
need this more than me.

323
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,422
God bless you, mister.

324
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,721
Big night, huh?

325
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,226
Real big.

326
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:09,198
Tell me. How was the
honeymoon? Nice?

327
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:11,792
Hell, yeah. It was wonderful.

328
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,000
Two days at a cutrate
motel. It was great.

329
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:19,737
Real uptown stuff.
Pasty didn't like it?

330
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:23,008
Patsy didn't say a word.
She wouldn't. I didn't like it.

331
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:26,448
I didn't like it. Jesus,
you're in a mood.

332
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:28,918
I've got $12 to my name.

333
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:32,320
Twelve dollars until payday.
The money ain't so bad here.

334
00:28:32,391 --> 00:28:33,983
Or so good.

335
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:35,788
What do you want?

336
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:39,422
Want to be like that old
fart, Lawrence?
Wear a suit, run the place?

337
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:42,399
Hell, no.

338
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:47,097
I'd just like somethin'
different maybe. Do something
a little better.

339
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,936
I'd like to get my
own place maybe.

340
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,533
I don't care,
I ain't gonna do it.

341
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:56,809
The idea of you asking me to
go on television and lie.

342
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,442
I am not asking you to lie.

343
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:03,386
All you've got to do is say,
"Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley.

344
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:06,481
I brought my friend Patsy
Cline. I'm her talent scout."

345
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:08,526
That's not a lie.
You are my friend.

346
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:12,154
I ain't gonna do it,
so stop flapping your jaws at me.

347
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,291
That man from the show told
you that talent scouts
can't be a relative.

348
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:21,971
Is that why you give me
that housecoat of yours
with the puff sleeves?

349
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,941
I give you that housecoat
'cause you said you liked it.

350
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,604
Well, I won't lie on television.

351
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,409
Goddamn it! I'm not
asking you to lie.

352
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:32,882
Just don't spill your
guts is all I'm askin'.

353
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,385
Stop that dirty talk now.

354
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:41,358
Mama, think of what it could mean
to sing on national television.

355
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,626
All you gotta do is just say...

356
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,426
"Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley.

357
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,627
I've brought my friend Patsy
Cline. I'm her talent scout."

358
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:54,172
Come on, Mama.

359
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:57,208
Do I have to get on my
knees and beg you? I will.

360
00:29:57,275 --> 00:30:02,110
Please! Help me to be a
singer, have my house with
the yellow roses. Please!

361
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,116
That house with the yellow roses!
I'm sick of hearing about it.

362
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:08,152
What does Charlie
say about all this?

363
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,916
He thinks it's a terrific idea.

364
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,082
Well, I ain't gonna do it.

365
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,924
The idea of me on television.

366
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:30,941
Thirty seconds.

367
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,412
They're from
Winchester, Virginia.

368
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,380
Patsy, I can't do it.

369
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,974
You can, too. Don't be
an old chicken.

370
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:42,747
You look beautiful.
A little color in your cheeks.

371
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,382
Mrs. Hensley? You're on.
Follow me. Just say what
we practiced.

372
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,892
Say what we practiced and
smile. You look real pretty.

373
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,930
You're better looking
than her, Woodhouse.

374
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:56,195
Get her off of there.
Let's see Patsy.

375
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:00,068
Marla Kleinman. Remember, folks.

376
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:03,107
Your applause is on
the applause meter.

377
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,206
Get lost! Stop it.

378
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:11,078
Hello and welcome.

379
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:13,276
There's your mama!

380
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:17,253
That is a pretty dress.
What color is that exactly?

381
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:20,155
Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley.

382
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:23,126
And I brought my
friend Patsy Cline.

383
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,561
And I'm her talent scout. Good.

384
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,121
Miss Cline, let's go.
Hurry please, around the back.

385
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,430
Where are you from?
Winchester, Virginia.

386
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:35,132
That's lovely country. So,
what's Patsy's talent?

387
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:36,640
She sings.

388
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,676
Does she sing better than I do?

389
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:41,177
Oh. Well, she's...

390
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,578
She's wonderful.
She made a record.

391
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:46,674
Why don't we bring her out?
Ladies and gentlemen...

392
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:49,345
let's welcome Patsy Cline.

393
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:54,284
Come on, Patsy! Come on, baby!

394
00:31:55,694 --> 00:32:00,154
I go out walkin' after midnight

395
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:04,931
Out in the moonlight
just like we used to do

396
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:08,905
I'm always walkin' after midnight

397
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:11,772
Searchin' for you

398
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,175
She looks great, don't she?

399
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:18,580
I walk for miles
along the highway

400
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,314
Well, that's just my way
of sayin' I love you

401
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:27,415
I'm always walkin' after midnight

402
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,859
Searchin' for you
That's beautiful.

403
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:37,767
I stopped to see a weepin'
willow cryin' on his pillow

404
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:41,738
Maybe he's cryin' for me

405
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:44,297
You lucky boy.
She could make it big.

406
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:47,072
Night winds whisper to me

407
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:51,343
I'm lonesome as I can be

408
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,648
She's singing good.
I go out walkin' after midnight

409
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,680
Out in the moonlight
just hopin' you may be

410
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:04,855
Somewhere out walkin'
after midnight

411
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:09,923
Searchin' for me

412
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:14,100
Patsy Cline!

413
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,905
This Virginia gal can sing.

414
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,774
Let us hear from you
through the applause meter.

415
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:23,939
Watch the meter. Come on,
people, clap louder.

416
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,346
Go, go!

417
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:29,743
Patsy Cline is the winner!

418
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,520
She won!

419
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,209
Bull's eye!

420
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:06,280
A little draggy to me that
time. Patsy, that's all right.

421
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:09,794
This is gonna make us all a
whole lot of money, little girl.

422
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:14,855
Listen, boys, you don't
mind if we try it one...
Come on. One more time.

423
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,026
Thanks a lot, boys.

424
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,581
I'm home, baby.

425
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:06,947
Where've you been?
I stopped and had a drink.

426
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:09,316
Yeah. Five or seven.

427
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:12,618
I worked my hump off
making you baked chicken,
you come home this late.

428
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,920
I'll eat it.

429
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:20,829
You got a finger? Then put it
in a telephone and dial when
you'll be late.

430
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:22,833
I said I'd eat the thing.

431
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:27,431
Lady, I've got a message
for you. Screw your baked
chicken and screw you.

432
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:30,941
Yeah? That's the last time I'm
gonna make you something nice.

433
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,943
Oh, poor Patsy.

434
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:35,536
You dumb son of a bitch!

435
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,377
You want your dinner?
Why don't you eat it now?

436
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,509
Gonna throw a plate?

437
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,320
You wanna start on
the living room?

438
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:52,659
Charlie, look what you've done!

439
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,721
Goddamn it!

440
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,342
Sip it slow and the
world stays sweet.

441
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,941
My daddy used to say
that same thing.

442
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,154
Do my back, baby,
would you please?

443
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,154
He was something, my old man.

444
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:27,289
He used to eat cold navy
bean sandwiches for
breakfast every morning.

445
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,859
I hope he rots in hell.

446
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,927
What do you mean?

447
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,438
He's crazy.

448
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:38,874
He tried some stuff with me once.

449
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,434
You telling me he tried
to mess with you?

450
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,081
I don't want to talk about
that now. How come you
never told me about that?

451
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,710
How come you never say
anything about your family?

452
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,879
Not when I'm in such a good mood.

453
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,889
Hello? Patsy Cline?

454
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,949
That's me. What? Who is it?

455
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,461
Is it Woodhouse? Hush up.

456
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,693
I'm sorry. I didn't hear
you. Tell him he made me
late for dinner.

457
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:04,860
For the love of God,
put a lid on it. Yes, ma'am.

458
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:07,564
I'm sorry, my husband's
a little nuts.

459
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,267
This is Decca Records. What?

460
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:18,805
That's Decca Records.
" Walkin' after Midnight"
jumped to number 16!

461
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,852
I am on the son of
a bitchin' charts!

462
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:25,188
Goddamn it, baby!

463
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:27,315
Let's go spend some money.

464
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:39,402
I got a letter from Washington.

465
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:45,135
Probably from Eisenhower,
wanting to know why I
didn't vote for him.

466
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,279
Shit! I've been drafted.

467
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,545
What? They want me to
show up next week.

468
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,917
I can't be drafted.
I'm in the National Guard.

469
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:01,616
You said they never miss
you at those meetings.

470
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:05,129
Well, I ain't goin',
I'll tell you that much.

471
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:07,687
I'll shoot my toe off.

472
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:11,428
I'll tell 'em I'm a
homo. I ain't goin'!

473
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,271
I love you. Take care
of yourself.

474
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:17,774
Bye, baby.

475
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:24,908
Well, now, it ain't
the end of the world.

476
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:30,114
Fort Bragg's not exactly
a million miles away.

477
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,122
You've got that tour coming up.

478
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:37,093
Shit! Why don't you tell me every
cloud's got a silver linin'?

479
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:40,255
Why don't you move
in with me, honey?

480
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,095
No sense in paying
rent on your place.

481
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:54,406
Well, good mornin'.

482
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:56,379
Says who?

483
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:59,974
For heaven's sake.
Sit up and take some nourishment.

484
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:02,576
Charlie'll have his first
leave in three weeks...

485
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:06,488
and you walk around with your
lower lip draggin' the floor.

486
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:10,550
Big bawlin' baby.
I oughta fix you a sugar tit.

487
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:15,830
You're still not too big
for me to smack your jaws
for you. You know that?

488
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,267
You make that sign again,
I'll leave the print of
my hand across your face.

489
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,567
I'll make your teeth rattle.

490
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:28,003
For those of you who've
got to get to work,
it's 8:30 in the morning.

491
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,515
Let's continue listening
to everybody's favorites.

492
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:35,510
I got a check today.

493
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:45,890
Why don't you go out and
spend some money?
It'll make you feel better.

494
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,863
Says who?

495
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:51,459
You're just too mean
to live lately.

496
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,981
Well, what do you think?

497
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,490
I think it's beautiful.

498
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,618
I think I hate it.

499
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:19,561
You sour, mean thing.

500
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,155
But I know how to
get sweet again.

501
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,969
I'm lookin' for Charlie
Dick of the 20th Battalion.

502
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,372
Go down here and turn left.

503
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:09,603
Can you tell me where
"C" Company is?

504
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,308
Right over there. There?

505
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,317
Thank you. You're welcome.

506
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:19,547
Charlie!

507
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,320
Hey, baby. How are ya?

508
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:31,000
What'd they do to your
hair? They cut it.

509
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,002
Eat your hearts out!

510
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,311
Come on, honey. Hurry up,
get the key in there.

511
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:00,321
I was waitin' to see you.

512
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,363
Wait, Charlie.
I gotta close the window.

513
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,873
Hurry up.

514
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,141
You know something, Charlie?

515
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:29,189
You can't go to your grave
saying you weren't ever loved.

516
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:34,795
'Cause no matter what happens to
you for the rest of your life...

517
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:42,570
right now, by God,
somebody loves you.

518
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:45,975
Totally.

519
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:10,259
Come on home and
fool around with me

520
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:16,337
So, honey, fool around You'll
know right where I'm at

521
00:43:17,508 --> 00:43:21,968
And don't worry if I'm lonesome
'cause I'm used to that

522
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,310
And when you're tired of foolin'
'round with two or three

523
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:32,689
Then come on home and
fool around with me

524
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:45,363
Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey Won't you come home

525
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:49,736
I'm home the whole day long

526
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:54,039
I'll do the cookin',
honey I'll pay the rent

527
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:57,410
I know I've done you wrong

528
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:01,850
Remember that rainy
evenin' I drove you out

529
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,650
With nothin' but a fine tooth
comb Take it home.

530
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:10,160
I know that I'm to blame
And ain't that a shame

531
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:14,288
Bill Bailey, won't you please
come home Come home, Bill Bailey

532
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:19,393
Bill Bailey, won't you
please come home

533
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:25,542
Lord, I'm give out.

534
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:31,479
I'm so tired, my ass is draggin'
the floor behind me.

535
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,744
I'm so tired,
I wished I was dead.

536
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,149
I'm so tired, I wished
I'd never been born.

537
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:43,785
I'm so tired, I wished my
daddy'd had his thing cut
off so he never...

538
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:47,353
God Almighty! Will you
boys let it be?

539
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:52,130
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

540
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:58,769
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

541
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:01,277
Gonna lay around this shack

542
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:04,439
Till the milk train comes back

543
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:09,676
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

544
00:45:10,554 --> 00:45:15,719
I ain't gonna work
on the railroad

545
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:19,923
I ain't gonna work on the farm

546
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:25,401
Gonna lay around this shack
till the milk train comes back

547
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:29,565
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

548
00:45:57,835 --> 00:45:59,097
Patsy?

549
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:01,270
Are you okay?

550
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:08,241
Darling, tell those boys
they'll have to wait.

551
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:10,246
I can't get up.

552
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:21,954
How about it? You gonna live?

553
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:24,324
Oh, Lord, I've been better.

554
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:29,123
Let me have a sip of this.

555
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:40,669
You have to do that in
the mornin'? It puts hair
on your head.

556
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:47,142
Oh, my God in heaven!
I bet I'm pregnant.

557
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,916
Lord, I can't be pregnant.

558
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:56,016
I just had a hit record.
My husband's in the army.

559
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:58,721
I mean, oh, Lord.

560
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:01,629
How the hell am I gonna
tour if I'm pregnant?

561
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:05,627
Oh, God. You talk
about your bad timin'.

562
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:13,173
Please, Fred, don't eat that.

563
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:36,231
Hi, honey.

564
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,500
Charlie.

565
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,704
Look at me, honey.

566
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:45,508
You think I look just awful?

567
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:48,010
Hell, no. You look great, baby.

568
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:51,974
You always do.

569
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,783
Thanks.

570
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:15,096
I'm crazy 'bout you, baby.
I love you all the time.

571
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:19,803
Come here.

572
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,970
You sure you want to?

573
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:27,446
Look out. I'm comin' to get you.

574
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:38,327
Ah, baby.

575
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:44,799
You still like me, Charlie?

576
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:47,268
Yeah. You do?

577
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:13,586
Lord, bitch. You don't
sing. You whine. Whine.

578
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:17,299
Hi, darlin'.

579
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:21,694
What are you doin'?

580
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:24,297
Havin' a glass of champagne
with Kirk Douglas.

581
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,434
What's it look like I'm doin'?

582
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,876
You don't have to iron
me a shirt every day.

583
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:31,676
I thought you told me Sergeant
Wilson wanted you lookin' sharp.

584
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:33,683
I'll tell you a secret.

585
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:36,117
I don't give a goddamn
what Sergeant Wilson says.

586
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:39,952
That tight assed bastard's been on
my back ever since I got here.

587
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:45,486
God, I hate this army.

588
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:48,725
I hate this state.
I hate this miserable
little apartment.

589
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,235
I've been places I
like better, too.

590
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:54,635
I could still be making
records if I'd stayed home.

591
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:57,105
Nobody asked you to come here.

592
00:49:57,174 --> 00:50:00,974
The hell you didn't.
You begged me. I didn't mean it.

593
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:04,537
Come on, Charlie. Don't fuss now.

594
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,742
I'm makin' chili for
dinner. You like that.

595
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:10,150
Let's just be nice. Oh, my.

596
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,848
"I'm makin' chili,
and I try to be nice...

597
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:15,391
but my husband's just
so rude and nasty."

598
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,859
Shut up. Poor Patsy!

599
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:20,761
Why don't you just shut
your mouth? Why don't
you try and make me?

600
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:23,925
Don't push me,
Charlie. I dare you.

601
00:50:31,175 --> 00:50:33,109
Patsy. Patsy!

602
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,407
Leave me alone!

603
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:39,915
You know the part I remember?

604
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,247
I remember the part when you
told me over and over...

605
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,378
how you're gonna protect me.

606
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:47,515
Keep anybody from hurtin' me.

607
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,786
You remember all those
times you told me that?

608
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,851
Patsy, wait!

609
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:53,863
Patsy, I'm sorry.

610
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:56,791
Open the door up.

611
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,798
I'll bring the rest.

612
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:08,836
Will you get the
baby things, John?

613
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:25,191
I'm gonna start singin' again
right after the baby's born.

614
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:28,322
I was hopin' you'd
stay home for a while.

615
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:31,562
I'm gonna start singin' the
same week the baby's born.

616
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:35,096
I can make it, Mama.
Damn it, I know I can.

617
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:39,609
All I need is one good song
to put me over the top.

618
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:43,476
Then when I've made enough,
I can retire, raise the baby.

619
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,907
I just wanna make it right.

620
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,818
You forgot the part
about the yellow roses.

621
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:47,441
What the livin' hell?
They told me...
It's a false alarm.

622
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:53,178
Why don't you put a star
in your crown, and get old
Charlie a beer?

623
00:53:00,924 --> 00:53:02,949
Can I have a kiss?

624
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:09,855
Can I have a decent kiss?

625
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,133
Miss me?

626
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:20,642
Nope.

627
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:29,384
I didn't know it till I
saw you, but, yes, I did.

628
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:33,423
Look at you.

629
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:37,816
I got ten days' leave.

630
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:42,127
I got two good lookin' women,
and a baby on the way!

631
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:46,101
Hog heaven!

632
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:57,640
Mama, look at these sweet little
things Betty just gave me.

633
00:53:57,714 --> 00:54:01,206
Aren't they darlin'? Look
at that one. It's got a
little bit of embroidery.

634
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:08,357
Damn it! Get your feet
off the baby's clothes.

635
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,585
Charlie, for the love of God!

636
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:14,754
Why don't you get out
from under our feet?

637
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:17,561
Go buy yourself a beer
or something. Lord.

638
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:21,561
All right, if that's what
you think I should do.

639
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,740
Dinner's at 6:00. All right.

640
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:28,437
Charlie here says he loves
the army. Hell, yes.

641
00:54:28,512 --> 00:54:31,538
Says he's gonna reenlist
when his time's up.

642
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:35,483
You know, Woodhouse,
I never saw so many
teeth in a horse's ass.

643
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:39,281
I gotta go.
You butthole. Come on.

644
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:41,290
I didn't know they made
apron strings this long.

645
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:43,485
I gotta get home.
Let's stop and have one.

646
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,494
It's on the way.
Just a quick one.

647
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:51,763
Hey, bartender, let us have
a shot for everybody.

648
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:53,598
No, not for me.

649
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,231
Nothing but the best for
Charlie. Yes, one more.

650
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,400
One more. Just one before you go.

651
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:02,240
No, I gotta get goin'.
Y'all have a good night.

652
00:55:02,312 --> 00:55:04,837
It's been real nice.
I'll see you before I go.

653
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:07,042
Hey, Charlie. What?

654
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:09,551
Nothin'. What?

655
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,554
Well, your hair is all.

656
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:14,853
You look so different
with short hair. So?

657
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:17,826
So, I think it's kind of cute.

658
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:20,055
I like it.

659
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,097
Remember?

660
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,329
All those good times we had.

661
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:31,005
Yeah, I remember.

662
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:32,541
Of course I remember.

663
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:36,739
Well, why do you have to
go home so early then?

664
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:41,141
Talk to me, Charlie.

665
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:48,789
You know I've always liked you.

666
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:54,689
We're goin' to Carol's
house. Come on, Charlie.

667
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:00,436
Let's get outta here.

668
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:06,670
Is the father around so I
can get the rest of this
information from him?

669
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:08,802
Well, what's his name?

670
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:10,710
Charles Dick.

671
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:12,305
Son of a bitch!

672
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:16,443
Stop that dirty talk
now. He'll be here soon.

673
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,488
The son of a bitch!

674
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:23,154
Oh, Mama.

675
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:40,976
Somebody answer the phone.

676
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:47,473
Hello. Charlie?

677
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:48,984
Where are you?

678
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:52,385
Charlie, we're at the
hospital. She's had her baby.

679
00:56:52,456 --> 00:56:54,686
I'll be right down. No,
you won't be right down.

680
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:59,627
You keep your miserable
self away. She had a hard
time. She's finally asleep.

681
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:03,928
She asked for you 14 times
tonight, and you weren't there.

682
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,629
Damn your soul, Charlie
Dick. Where were you?

683
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:40,202
There's your dad.

684
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,332
Hi, honey.

685
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:51,477
She's beautiful.

686
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:58,281
You want to hold her? Yeah.

687
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,415
Come here, you little thing.

688
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:06,423
I got her.

689
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:07,929
I got ya.

690
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:17,639
She's so pretty.

691
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,639
Look at her hair. I know.
It's curlin' already.

692
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:29,579
You still think Julie's
a good name for her?

693
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,888
I wish to God I'd been with you.

694
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:42,557
Yeah. Where were you?

695
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:45,294
I'd tell you a hundred
lies, but I ain't goin' to.

696
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:47,669
Got drunk.

697
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:56,345
That's whiskey under the bridge.

698
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:40,648
Fifty cents, please. Yes, ma'am.

699
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:47,229
Hello? Hi, baby, it's me.

700
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:49,595
Hi, Charlie. Guess what?

701
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,430
I found us a new apartment.
It's got room for the baby...

702
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:56,199
and it's still cheaper than that
other one we had down here.

703
00:59:56,273 --> 00:59:58,207
Got a big kitchen, too.

704
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:01,672
So, what do you say?
Why don't you come on down?

705
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:03,474
No, Charlie, I can't.

706
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:07,346
I want to start singin' again,
and Mama helps me with Julie.

707
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:11,478
Come on, baby. I really miss
ya. I wanna see my kid.

708
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:14,955
Don't you get another leave
in a couple of months?
You can see her then.

709
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:17,926
Goddamn. Why are you
so polite anymore?

710
01:00:17,994 --> 01:00:21,657
Can't you just talk normal?
I feel like I'm talkin' to
Eleanor Roosevelt.

711
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:24,393
I gotta go, Charlie.
The baby's cryin'.

712
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:27,664
I'll talk to you, okay? Yeah,
okay, if Julie's cryin'.

713
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:38,640
Patsy.

714
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:41,410
You awake?

715
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:44,038
Wake up, baby.

716
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,742
Shh. Put something on.
I want to take you someplace.

717
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:48,750
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

718
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:52,652
It's important. You crazy?
It's the middle of night!

719
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:55,589
I can't leave the baby.
We'll put her with Hilda.

720
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:13,133
Why won't you tell me
what this is about?

721
01:02:14,077 --> 01:02:16,045
Just wait.

722
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,610
At least tell me
where we're going.

723
01:02:58,955 --> 01:03:01,219
I need something from you.

724
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:04,720
I need you to look me
in the face and say...

725
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:09,959
"You screw up a lot,
but I still love you,
Charlie. I always will."

726
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:14,629
I told you before you left,
I'm not holding any grudges.

727
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:17,400
I need something from you.

728
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:20,034
I need you to look me
in the face and say...

729
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:24,843
"You screw up a lot,
but I still love you,
Charlie. I always will."

730
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:39,628
You screw up a lot,
Charlie, but I still love
you and I always will.

731
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:42,062
Say it again.

732
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:47,126
You screw up a lot,
but I still love you,
Charlie. I always will.

733
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:11,283
I'll have a blue Christmas

734
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:14,387
Without you

735
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:17,900
I'll be so blue

736
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:22,563
Thinking about you

737
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:28,043
Decorations of red

738
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:31,547
On a green Christmas tree

739
01:04:31,614 --> 01:04:33,081
Start the movie!

740
01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:37,552
Won't mean a thing, dear, if...

741
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:43,189
What are they doin'?
What the hell's goin' on?

742
01:04:56,739 --> 01:04:59,731
I cannot believe this!

743
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:08,549
Honey, your mama's life is not
workin' out. Trust me. It's not.

744
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:14,923
I'm goin' to Nashville tomorrow.
See if I can do something.

745
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,017
Aren't you Patsy Cline?

746
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:43,313
Yeah.

747
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:44,819
I'm Randy Hughes.

748
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:48,050
I was just coming to
see you. Is that right?

749
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:50,456
You wrote me a letter
about a year ago.

750
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:53,791
But I had a baby and haven't
been doin' much singing.

751
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:56,161
You don't have to sell me.

752
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:59,690
I think you're maybe the best
country singer in the world.

753
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,296
Come in here.
Let's you and I talk.

754
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:07,935
I always did like a man who knew
how to start a conversation good.

755
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:11,708
I swear, I can make us
both a lot of money.

756
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:15,148
You won't be sorry.
You know why not? Why?

757
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:18,381
Because when the song is
right and I feel it...

758
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:23,187
I can tell from looking
at people's faces that
I've reached inside them.

759
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:25,489
You got any idea what
that feels like?

760
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:27,461
You want to be Kitty Wells?

761
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:30,328
Hell no! I want to
be Hank Williams.

762
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,359
All right. Sit down,
listen to me.

763
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:38,298
I got a story to tell you.

764
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:43,008
I heard you sing one night
in a dump in Virginia.

765
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,912
Twelve tables,
watereddown drinks...

766
01:06:45,982 --> 01:06:48,314
dance floor the size
of that coffee table.

767
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:50,648
You were good.

768
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,054
The crowd liked ya.
Ate up that yodelin'
and growlin' stuff.

769
01:06:55,124 --> 01:07:00,528
Then you let go on "Walkin'
the Floor Over You."

770
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:04,430
But you did it slow
like a ballad.

771
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:10,596
I'm tellin' you, the hair on
the back of my neck stood up.

772
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,634
There I was in this
dive in Virginia...

773
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:18,272
and I was listening to
something real special.

774
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:19,781
Yeah.

775
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:24,013
You get my drift?
I'll make it simple.

776
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:30,549
You got a voice that was
made to sing love songs.

777
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:36,293
If I work with you,
we take advantage of that fact.

778
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:42,702
I don't wanna talk about
it anymore. I got starving
kids waiting in the car.

779
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:44,763
It's too late. It's all set up.

780
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:49,471
I don't give a damn!
I don't want four big male
singers drowning me out.

781
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:52,036
They're booked and
will be there at 2:00.

782
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,481
If they're there,
I'm not showing up.

783
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:58,145
Musicians are booked.
Owen Bradley's gonna be
there. I'm gonna be there.

784
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:00,917
You can show up or not.
Just suit your damn self.

785
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,423
I will.

786
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:04,119
2:00.

787
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,753
Grab hold of Randy, Madrine.

788
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:11,461
They got four singers backing
me up today. Big ones.

789
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:15,163
They're just gonna drown
me out. Hell's bells!

790
01:08:15,238 --> 01:08:18,002
Let's have the next bit.

791
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,008
One, two.

792
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:31,180
Hello. Did you tell
'em what I said?

793
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:34,052
Mr. Bradley's the
producer, darling.

794
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:37,456
Hello, Patsy. Hi, Mr. Bradley.

795
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,961
What's the frown for?
You've been worryin' again.

796
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:42,497
Don't frown. You'll make
yourself old before your time.

797
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:45,796
I wanted to talk to
you... Listen to me.
Everything's all right.

798
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:48,234
The song's a good one.
The arrangement's a good one.

799
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:51,034
The backup singers are
good. Even the glazed
doughnuts are good.

800
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:55,043
Everything's good today,
so relax and be happy and sing!

801
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:58,971
Just make sure they hear me.

802
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:01,209
Sing!

803
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:03,548
Take seven coming up.

804
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:21,629
I can see you all recognize
that song. That's great.

805
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:27,074
We happen to have the little girl
backstage that made that famous.

806
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:32,581
We're proud of her at the Grand
Old Opry. Miss Patsy Cline!

807
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:43,353
I fall

808
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:46,554
To pieces

809
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:53,730
Each time I see you again

810
01:09:56,572 --> 01:10:00,702
I fall

811
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:03,108
To pieces

812
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:11,510
How can I be just your friend

813
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:16,914
You want me to act

814
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:21,259
Like we've never kissed

815
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:25,562
You want me to forget

816
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:29,628
Pretend we've never met

817
01:10:29,705 --> 01:10:32,139
And I've tried

818
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,904
And I've tried

819
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:38,572
But I haven't yet

820
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:40,616
You walk by

821
01:10:40,683 --> 01:10:45,677
And I fall to pieces

822
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,010
I like everything you
sing. You just open your
mouth and I fall down.

823
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,707
But when you sing
those slow ones...

824
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:15,546
I just love it.

825
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:19,054
Randy told me it's number
nine on the pop charts.

826
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:22,056
I'm a crossover.
Money, money, money!

827
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:27,124
I wanna buy Mama a
pure silk dress.

828
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:30,324
Give Sylvia that graduation
party she never had.

829
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,728
I want to spend
some of that money.

830
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:37,330
I'll tell you what.
I'll help you do it.

831
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:43,706
I'm home. Had to crawl
part way, but I made it.

832
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,848
That's pretty.

833
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:49,350
Bake that all by your Ionesome?

834
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:50,851
I sure did.

835
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:56,351
How come you didn't bake
me a cake for my birthday?

836
01:11:57,426 --> 01:11:59,917
Goddamn it! That's not funny.

837
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:02,328
Been working on that all day.

838
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:07,200
Didn't this pie turn out nice?

839
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:10,830
Did it with tapioca
just like Mama does.

840
01:12:10,906 --> 01:12:14,239
I can't wait to see her and
John and Sylvie tomorrow.

841
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:23,676
Why don't you go easy on that
drinkin' tomorrow at the party?

842
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:27,018
Why don't you kiss my furry butt?

843
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:30,024
You think I wouldn't?

844
01:12:35,631 --> 01:12:39,590
Come on, Charlie.
I'm cooking chicken.

845
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,867
Stop it. Everything's gonna burn.

846
01:12:43,939 --> 01:12:47,204
Where are the kids
at? They're upstairs
in their bedroom.

847
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:50,404
Come on. Oh, Lord!

848
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:52,743
On the linoleum floor...

849
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:55,181
with my dress up around my ears?

850
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:56,684
Charlie!

851
01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:01,148
Red hots. Get your red hots here.

852
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:07,528
Here's a taker for you.
Come on now. Like New York City.

853
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:16,337
Come on!

854
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:19,306
Hey, everybody. Listen a minute.

855
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:23,436
We have a high school
graduate in our family
for the very first time.

856
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:26,003
Charlie and I finally
got enough money...

857
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:28,107
Finally!

858
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:30,118
To give her a party
and buy her a present.

859
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:33,553
Here it is. Happy graduation.
It's a new toothbrush.

860
01:13:39,328 --> 01:13:42,263
Don't Sylvia looks sweet today?

861
01:13:42,331 --> 01:13:44,458
I love her new hairdo.

862
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:46,865
I'm gonna put him
down. He's so crabby.

863
01:13:46,936 --> 01:13:49,928
Good night, honey.
Give Grandma a kiss.

864
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:54,208
Here, sweetheart. Put him down.

865
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:56,301
Give Mama a kiss.

866
01:13:57,847 --> 01:14:02,580
Oh. It just kills me
I don't see him more.

867
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,881
I know it. I wrote that book.

868
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:08,681
How's things with
you and Charlie?

869
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:12,786
Up and down?

870
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:15,330
There's lots of up and down.

871
01:14:15,397 --> 01:14:16,830
Oh, Patsy!

872
01:14:20,536 --> 01:14:21,969
Geez, Mama.

873
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:28,670
You know Charlie. He drinks a
little, but I knew that when
I married him.

874
01:14:28,744 --> 01:14:31,679
Other than that,
things are silky smooth.

875
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:34,873
When he drinks,
he's got a temper.

876
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:37,248
Does he hit you?

877
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:40,846
Just that one time.

878
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:46,293
They say if a man hits you once,
there's always another time.

879
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:50,230
Sis, you have some money?
We want some more beer.

880
01:14:50,299 --> 01:14:52,995
I wanna go with you.

881
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:55,628
See you in a minute.

882
01:15:01,477 --> 01:15:04,674
You don't remember
Barbara Simmons?

883
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:07,341
You had crush on her all
through the fifth grade.

884
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,646
You're a damn liar.

885
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:12,551
I don't know why, though,
with that frizzy brown hair.

886
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:15,385
What about you and
old Homer Atkinson?

887
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:18,187
I never liked Homer Atkinson!

888
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,854
You loved Homer
Atkinson. I did not!

889
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,728
You called him every
night and hang up...

890
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:25,824
when he answered.

891
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:28,062
Look out!

892
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:40,077
Somebody help me!

893
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:29,793
The babies.

894
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:31,799
Where are the babies?

895
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:35,564
Patsy, they're fine.

896
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:38,967
John's all right, too.

897
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:42,806
You had us scared a little bit.

898
01:16:47,216 --> 01:16:50,811
Tell me. Are the babies alive?

899
01:16:50,886 --> 01:16:55,585
Honey, little Randy and
Julie weren't with you.

900
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:59,355
John was with you, and he's okay.

901
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,843
The kids are sleeping.

902
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:36,063
Good night.

903
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:58,219
Relax. Just a moment.

904
01:18:00,622 --> 01:18:02,055
Forceps, please.

905
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:10,998
Very good.

906
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:13,698
That's fine.

907
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:15,964
That's very good. Fine, fine.

908
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:18,233
Just as we expected.
It's healing nicely.

909
01:18:21,443 --> 01:18:23,741
Is it that bad?
It's not that bad...

910
01:18:23,812 --> 01:18:25,746
I wanna look.

911
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:31,309
When the stitches come out,
the scars will heal very quickly.

912
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:38,216
This is what I got to deal with?

913
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:45,328
You cut your suit
to fit your cloth.

914
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:47,926
Later you can have plastic
surgery if you want.

915
01:18:50,506 --> 01:18:54,909
Hell yes, I want plastic
surgery. I want all I can get.

916
01:18:54,977 --> 01:18:58,071
Maybe you can make me
look like Grace Kelly.

917
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:13,952
Cut it. Cut it, please.

918
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:15,826
Mr. Bradley...

919
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:19,891
I don't care how many times
you play that, I can't sing
this man's songs.

920
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:21,936
I don't know how
to sing like that.

921
01:19:22,004 --> 01:19:25,405
Nobody wants you to.
You can take it away from him.

922
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:29,604
Yeah. The hell with the demo.
Steal the son of a bitch.

923
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:35,510
I don't understand why
everything has to be so
hard. How am I to do this?

924
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:38,815
Just like you always
do. Your way.

925
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,855
Let the song tell the story.

926
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:57,438
Crazy

927
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:01,499
I'm crazy for feelin'

928
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:05,673
So lonely

929
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:09,674
I'm crazy

930
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:14,350
I think that's a good tempo.
Let's try it that way.

931
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:16,391
Somebody bring me a beer.

932
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:20,224
Will somebody bring the lady a
beer? Then we'll go for a take.

933
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:26,263
Wonderin'

934
01:20:27,836 --> 01:20:33,706
What in the world did I do

935
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:40,044
Oh, crazy

936
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:45,209
For thinkin' that my love

937
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:49,656
Could hold you

938
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,062
I'm crazy for tryin'

939
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:58,531
And crazy for cryin'

940
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:04,061
And I'm crazy for lovin' you

941
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:51,345
Oh, God, honey,
I hope you like it!

942
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,581
It's so pretty.

943
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:57,056
There. There it is.
See that white one
with the columns?

944
01:22:01,163 --> 01:22:03,324
Ain't it the truth?

945
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:07,635
I fell in love with it
the minute I saw it.

946
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:13,836
I'd like a pale,
pale blue carpet.

947
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:18,539
Maybe a couple divans,
make a conversation area.

948
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:21,777
Honey?

949
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,751
Look at this.
We got a dishwasher.

950
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:29,219
And an oven built
right into the wall.

951
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:33,819
I want to check a roast,
all I have to do is open
the door like this.

952
01:22:33,895 --> 01:22:37,262
No more bending over.
The Queen of Sheba.

953
01:22:39,534 --> 01:22:43,368
Say you already bought
it? I paid down on it.

954
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:45,872
Why didn't you tell me?

955
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:48,273
I wanted to surprise you.

956
01:22:49,778 --> 01:22:51,370
You surprised me.

957
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:56,008
The best thing we can do
with our money is put it
in bricks and mortar.

958
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:07,226
That show went on
forever last night...

959
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:10,788
and every minute of it
shows in my face today.

960
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:18,067
I'm glad we saved "Crazy"
till the end. I think it
made a great encore.

961
01:23:19,775 --> 01:23:22,471
You love Charlie?

962
01:23:22,544 --> 01:23:23,841
What?

963
01:23:23,912 --> 01:23:25,504
You love him?

964
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:30,040
Oh, come on. I couldn't
get along without Charlie.

965
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:33,918
How's that song go?
" He may have been a headache,
but he never was a bore."

966
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:36,514
That's Charlie.
Is that an answer?

967
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:41,658
I think Charlie and I
deserve each other.

968
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,963
Looks like Charlie might be
throwing you a little party.

969
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:53,007
Sure does. Take care.

970
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:56,067
I'll see you at the
session. All right.

971
01:23:56,144 --> 01:23:59,079
Try and get a little sleep
between now and Friday.

972
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:01,411
Nightynight. Good night.

973
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:18,425
Miss Patsy Cline! In person!

974
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:22,766
My baby's home!
We're having a party.

975
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,135
I see.

976
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:29,906
Did you see my new car?
I bought an old clunker to
drive in the demo derby.

977
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:32,705
How are you?

978
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:37,480
You know most everybody.
This is Cindy.
John and Sarah from work.

979
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:43,484
That there's...
I don't know who that is.

980
01:24:43,558 --> 01:24:47,961
This is Skip. He sold me that
car. I'm glad to meet you.

981
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,925
Nice to meet you. Think I'll
get myself a beer.

982
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,332
How'd it go tonight? All right.

983
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:58,203
This your date, Otis?
Lucky man. Yeah, goddamn it.

984
01:24:58,273 --> 01:25:00,833
Help yourself to food in there.
Bought a bunch of Chinese.

985
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:03,673
Let's us dance one.

986
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:06,839
Come on. Don't be such
an old wet blanket.

987
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:14,488
Oh! No fair. We gotta
wait for the next one.

988
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:17,548
I'm going to bed. I'm so tired.

989
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:20,618
That girl I was dancing with goes
with that guy from the derby.

990
01:25:22,063 --> 01:25:26,090
Obviously you got me mixed up
with someone who gives a shit.

991
01:25:29,337 --> 01:25:31,464
Come on. There you go.

992
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,408
That's Goldilocks and the
Three Bears. Take your book.

993
01:25:35,477 --> 01:25:39,436
Oh, how's my big boy?
You are the most
beautiful little boy.

994
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:41,709
Here we go.

995
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:46,687
Fell right on your
butt. Take your bottle.

996
01:25:47,322 --> 01:25:49,017
Hey, kiddo.

997
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:52,651
Hope you're rested.
Otis wants us to go out after
the demo derby tonight.

998
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:57,323
Darling, I'm so tired,
I feel like I'm
walking on stumps.

999
01:25:57,399 --> 01:25:59,333
I gotta sing there tonight.

1000
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:02,700
I don't feel like walking
off the stage and taking
a busman's holiday.

1001
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:05,137
What's a busman's holiday?

1002
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:10,372
A guy drives a bus,
he doesn't want to take a
bus ride for his vacation.

1003
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:14,447
Hell. It's too hard to explain.

1004
01:26:14,516 --> 01:26:17,679
I understood it.
You getting awful goddamn
fancy all of a sudden.

1005
01:26:17,752 --> 01:26:19,185
Yeah?

1006
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:33,327
Here comes another
paycheck for Charlie.

1007
01:26:36,304 --> 01:26:39,535
Crazy

1008
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:42,975
Crazy for feelin'

1009
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:45,808
So lonely

1010
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:51,513
I'm crazy

1011
01:26:52,654 --> 01:26:57,887
Crazy for feelin' so blue

1012
01:27:01,429 --> 01:27:05,388
You didn't finish that.
"And the cow jumped...

1013
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:07,332
Over the moon.

1014
01:27:07,402 --> 01:27:11,361
Three little bears
sittin' in their chairs."

1015
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,407
Better start gettin' ready.

1016
01:27:13,475 --> 01:27:15,943
We got time. Not that much.

1017
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:19,037
"And a pair of mittens."
You're not dressed yet.

1018
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:21,344
I get dressed faster than you.

1019
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,384
No, you don't. White?

1020
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,113
What? White.

1021
01:27:26,187 --> 01:27:30,021
What are you talking about?
Want to see if you say "black."

1022
01:27:31,192 --> 01:27:34,719
"A quiet old lady who
was whispering 'Hush."'

1023
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:39,165
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on ashinin'

1024
01:27:40,735 --> 01:27:46,071
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

1025
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:59,016
Love said goodbye I said

1026
01:27:59,087 --> 01:28:03,888
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on ashinin'

1027
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:18,137
Shinin' bright

1028
01:28:18,206 --> 01:28:22,472
Whisperin' on high till
lovers said goodbye

1029
01:28:22,544 --> 01:28:24,512
I said blue moon

1030
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,945
Come on, baby, treat me right.

1031
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:40,183
I'm gonna get you!

1032
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:42,195
Baby, baby. Be good to me.

1033
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:47,233
What happened? That's not
supposed to happen.

1034
01:29:11,593 --> 01:29:15,290
I was lookin' for you.
I ain't been hidin' nowhere.

1035
01:29:16,297 --> 01:29:18,424
Wanna dance? Yeah, later.

1036
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,266
You should've seen Charlie.
His clunker is still burnin'.

1037
01:29:22,337 --> 01:29:26,501
Why don't you take a busman's
holiday? Go sing another song.

1038
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:47,927
Sit down.

1039
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:05,304
Baby, let's dance.

1040
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:22,321
I'm gettin' thirsty.
I don't know about you, Otis.

1041
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:46,545
I'll be right back.

1042
01:30:48,123 --> 01:30:50,318
You want to leave?

1043
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:52,256
Hey, you.

1044
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:53,988
Bitch!

1045
01:30:54,062 --> 01:30:56,826
What the hell you think you're
doing? Same question back to you.

1046
01:30:56,898 --> 01:31:00,425
I was just talkin' to her. Me,
too. I'm just talkin' to them.

1047
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:05,435
How old is she anyhow?
She said she's 24.

1048
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:09,341
Ask her how old she is
counting the years she
went barefoot on the farm.

1049
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:13,403
You got a mean mouth.
I'd like to pull your tongue
with a pair of pliers.

1050
01:31:13,481 --> 01:31:15,540
I'm takin' a pee.

1051
01:31:15,617 --> 01:31:19,348
I'm warnin' you. You set your
ass down at my table. You hear?

1052
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:22,052
Don't you warn me!

1053
01:31:22,123 --> 01:31:27,925
You spend the evening rubbing
up against some tramp,
I'll do whatever I please.

1054
01:31:27,996 --> 01:31:32,456
You will, will you? I'll walk out
with the first guy.

1055
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:35,867
I'd like to see you
try. You just watch me.

1056
01:31:54,022 --> 01:31:56,183
This is it right over here.

1057
01:31:56,257 --> 01:32:00,660
I get Patsy Cline on my
cycle, all she wants is
coffee and a ride home.

1058
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:03,629
You're a real gent. Just my luck.

1059
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:06,258
Thanks a lot. No problem.

1060
01:32:24,352 --> 01:32:26,286
Well, the slut's home.

1061
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:28,322
Came home to see the pig.

1062
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:30,914
Where's that guy?

1063
01:32:30,992 --> 01:32:34,052
Had him let me off
about a block away.

1064
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:36,858
We just talked. You're a whore.

1065
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:42,260
Let's not call each other
names. It don't do no good.

1066
01:32:42,337 --> 01:32:45,135
We still gotta wake up tomorrow,
and look each other in the face.

1067
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:49,006
I ain't having no more
nights when my wife goes
off with another man.

1068
01:32:49,077 --> 01:32:52,240
Don't tell me what you
will or will not have.

1069
01:32:52,313 --> 01:32:55,805
I looked at you tonight and
thought, "God help you, Patsy.

1070
01:32:55,884 --> 01:32:58,580
No matter how hard you try
to make things right...

1071
01:32:58,653 --> 01:33:01,451
goodtime Charlie keeps
dragging you back down!"

1072
01:33:01,522 --> 01:33:05,515
Don't whine about me!
Where are you when the kids
want oatmeal in the morning?

1073
01:33:05,593 --> 01:33:08,585
Where are you when Julie pukes
in bed? You sure ain't here!

1074
01:33:08,663 --> 01:33:10,062
You lie!

1075
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:12,895
You never changed a shitty
diaper in your life...

1076
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:15,800
between Mama, Madrine and me!

1077
01:33:17,038 --> 01:33:19,029
That's right, I'm not here!

1078
01:33:19,107 --> 01:33:22,076
I'm singing in every shit house
between here and Kansas City...

1079
01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:24,941
so you can wear $30 silk shirts!

1080
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:27,948
Yeah? Take the goddamn thing!

1081
01:33:28,016 --> 01:33:29,449
Take it!

1082
01:33:32,387 --> 01:33:34,617
You lay down for that
guy tonight? Don't ask.

1083
01:33:34,689 --> 01:33:37,658
I'm askin', slut.
Yes, I did! I did!

1084
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:42,856
It was great. It was wonderful.
It was better than it's been
with you.

1085
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:46,025
We're gonna get married,
Mr. Motorcycle man and me.

1086
01:33:49,203 --> 01:33:51,728
Come here. Stand up!

1087
01:33:52,874 --> 01:33:55,069
Stop it! Stop!

1088
01:33:57,178 --> 01:33:59,476
Goddamn it!

1089
01:33:59,547 --> 01:34:00,878
Shut up!

1090
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:03,416
Mama?

1091
01:34:05,453 --> 01:34:08,911
Oh, God, baby, go back to bed.

1092
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:25,868
Regarding that family
disturbance, unit 17 has
that in hand.

1093
01:34:38,019 --> 01:34:40,487
Trade me an eye for one
of them cigarettes?

1094
01:34:43,191 --> 01:34:45,250
What are you in here for?

1095
01:34:45,326 --> 01:34:47,521
Had an argument with my wife.

1096
01:34:49,497 --> 01:34:52,489
I fell asleep in a doorway.

1097
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:55,365
Put them there. You can have
one whenever you want it.

1098
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:57,461
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1099
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:02,068
You look like you got the
whole world on your shoulders.

1100
01:35:02,143 --> 01:35:06,603
You give me a cigarette,
these questions go with
it, you can have it back.

1101
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:08,911
I just thought we'd
pass the time.

1102
01:35:28,836 --> 01:35:31,498
Go ahead and take it.

1103
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,708
You only got one.

1104
01:35:34,776 --> 01:35:37,074
It's all right.
I smoke too much anyway.

1105
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:39,912
Thank you.

1106
01:35:42,483 --> 01:35:44,417
Sleep light, don't you?

1107
01:35:45,787 --> 01:35:48,085
Just like my old man.

1108
01:35:50,425 --> 01:35:52,620
He smoked Camels, too.

1109
01:35:55,496 --> 01:35:57,862
He started when he
was nine years old.

1110
01:35:58,933 --> 01:36:02,369
There he was, nine years
old, in the fourth grade...

1111
01:36:02,437 --> 01:36:04,371
still wearing knickers.

1112
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:07,033
Get up in the morning,
he'd have a cup of coffee
and a cigarette...

1113
01:36:07,108 --> 01:36:10,737
right at the breakfast
table, big as you please.

1114
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:13,280
He was a pisscutter,
my old man was.

1115
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:17,051
He always could make me laugh.

1116
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:23,317
I never knew who my daddy was.
I don't think Mama did either.

1117
01:36:24,225 --> 01:36:26,659
My daddy's six feet tall...

1118
01:36:26,727 --> 01:36:29,753
when six feet tall was big.

1119
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:32,095
Had this real high voice.

1120
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:34,999
Could walk halfway around
the block on his hands.

1121
01:36:37,738 --> 01:36:42,072
One morning I was getting
ready for school.

1122
01:36:42,143 --> 01:36:46,273
My daddy stayed home from
work, he was at the kitchen
table smoking Camels...

1123
01:36:46,347 --> 01:36:49,783
one right after the other,
he was eatin' them.

1124
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:55,789
I went to get corn flakes
out of the cupboard...

1125
01:36:57,391 --> 01:36:59,689
and heard this noise.

1126
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,252
I thought the whole
house was falling down.

1127
01:37:05,299 --> 01:37:08,166
I turned around, he'd shot
hisself in the head.

1128
01:37:11,472 --> 01:37:13,337
Sweet Jesus!

1129
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:19,107
I sat on my bed for five days.

1130
01:37:20,414 --> 01:37:22,882
Wouldn't talk to nobody.

1131
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:25,077
Wouldn't go to his funeral.

1132
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:30,186
On the fifth day, I got up,
went out the door.

1133
01:37:30,258 --> 01:37:32,852
And I never looked back.

1134
01:37:35,429 --> 01:37:37,624
Just keep on movin'.

1135
01:37:37,698 --> 01:37:40,895
Know what I mean?
Just keep on movin'.

1136
01:37:46,307 --> 01:37:50,903
I can't seem to find anything in
my life to hold on to anymore.

1137
01:37:51,979 --> 01:37:54,971
It's like everything is
falling down around me.

1138
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:05,015
I say to myself, " I don't have
to lead that trashy dog's life...

1139
01:38:05,092 --> 01:38:07,788
that my daddy led my mama.

1140
01:38:07,862 --> 01:38:09,955
I can make things different.

1141
01:38:10,031 --> 01:38:13,023
I can make it right."

1142
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:17,002
And look at me. Here I am,
my face busted up.

1143
01:38:18,172 --> 01:38:21,539
Calling the cops in the
middle of the night.

1144
01:38:21,609 --> 01:38:24,373
And my kid saw it all!

1145
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:28,277
Mama, I don't know
what to do anymore.

1146
01:38:28,349 --> 01:38:31,113
I don't know whether
to divorce him or not.

1147
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:34,848
All I know is I can't
keep him outta the house
like this forever.

1148
01:38:34,922 --> 01:38:37,584
This is your baby.
You have to rock it.

1149
01:38:37,658 --> 01:38:42,391
Hell! I'm not asking for your
goddamn eyeteeth! I was asking
for your opinion.

1150
01:38:42,463 --> 01:38:46,058
You're talking to your
mama. You keep a civil
tongue in your head.

1151
01:38:51,272 --> 01:38:52,705
Yeah?

1152
01:38:54,675 --> 01:38:58,008
Oh, no, Randy, not a big show!

1153
01:39:01,349 --> 01:39:03,442
All right.

1154
01:39:03,517 --> 01:39:06,611
Christ on the cross!
I don't believe it.

1155
01:39:06,687 --> 01:39:08,917
I got recording sessions Friday.

1156
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:12,983
Now I gotta do a benefit for that
disc jockey that died last month.

1157
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:15,494
Tell him you're wore out.

1158
01:39:19,033 --> 01:39:21,968
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

1159
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:26,166
If that's the worst thing
that ever happens to me.

1160
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:29,309
You still like me?

1161
01:39:29,377 --> 01:39:30,776
Now and then.

1162
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:32,437
You love me?

1163
01:39:32,513 --> 01:39:33,946
Sometimes.

1164
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:39,146
Tell me what to do with my life.

1165
01:39:44,058 --> 01:39:48,961
I've got your picture

1166
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:52,158
That you gave to me

1167
01:39:52,233 --> 01:39:55,293
And it's signed "With love"

1168
01:39:55,369 --> 01:39:58,463
Just like it used to be

1169
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,541
Hey! Whoa! Charlie.
Where are you goin'?

1170
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:06,068
I'm gonna talk to my
wife. Hold on a second.

1171
01:40:06,147 --> 01:40:09,207
What do you want, Charlie?
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:40:10,284 --> 01:40:11,979
It's all right.

1173
01:40:12,053 --> 01:40:14,283
Everybody, take five.

1174
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:16,482
Kill Patsy's mike.

1175
01:40:23,331 --> 01:40:25,663
God, Charlie, don't.

1176
01:40:30,137 --> 01:40:31,399
I'm sorry.

1177
01:40:33,007 --> 01:40:34,599
I did wrong.

1178
01:40:36,777 --> 01:40:40,042
I will never raise a hand
to you again. I swear it.

1179
01:40:42,616 --> 01:40:44,709
I know you're thinkin'
of leavin' me.

1180
01:40:44,785 --> 01:40:47,686
I swear to God, I don't think
I could take it.

1181
01:40:50,024 --> 01:40:51,787
I don't know.

1182
01:40:54,195 --> 01:40:56,686
Can't we try and
make it right again?

1183
01:41:00,868 --> 01:41:05,134
If you want a definite
answer right this minute,
the answer is no.

1184
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,375
I don't know if I can
live with you anymore.

1185
01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:36,829
Sweet dreams

1186
01:41:36,904 --> 01:41:39,532
Of you

1187
01:41:41,909 --> 01:41:47,438
Every night

1188
01:41:47,515 --> 01:41:52,179
I go through

1189
01:41:54,422 --> 01:42:00,122
Why can't I forget you

1190
01:42:00,194 --> 01:42:05,791
And start my life anew

1191
01:42:05,866 --> 01:42:11,532
Instead of having sweet dreams

1192
01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:14,768
About you

1193
01:42:17,211 --> 01:42:23,081
You don't love me

1194
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:25,983
It's plain

1195
01:42:27,655 --> 01:42:32,115
I should know

1196
01:42:32,193 --> 01:42:36,289
I'll never wear your ring

1197
01:42:40,634 --> 01:42:46,266
I should hate you

1198
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:50,936
The whole night through

1199
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:57,780
Instead of having sweet dreams

1200
01:42:57,852 --> 01:43:00,912
About you

1201
01:43:03,757 --> 01:43:09,662
Sweet dreams

1202
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:11,857
Of you

1203
01:43:13,868 --> 01:43:18,737
Things I know

1204
01:43:20,074 --> 01:43:23,601
Can't come true

1205
01:43:26,614 --> 01:43:32,382
Why can't I forget the past

1206
01:43:32,453 --> 01:43:37,948
Start loving someone new

1207
01:43:38,025 --> 01:43:41,358
Instead of having

1208
01:43:41,428 --> 01:43:44,124
Sweet dreams

1209
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:49,534
About you

1210
01:43:58,178 --> 01:43:59,702
Thank you.

1211
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:16,195
Tony, I gotta take a pee!

1212
01:44:16,263 --> 01:44:18,390
Pretty Boy Floyd!

1213
01:44:24,338 --> 01:44:27,466
Get this boy one.
He's been on bread and water.

1214
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:31,807
Give me a drink.
I've been in the jail.

1215
01:44:31,879 --> 01:44:35,007
You drink any more, you'll wish
you was dead when you wake up.

1216
01:44:35,082 --> 01:44:38,210
Where was it you left
your ball and chain?

1217
01:44:38,285 --> 01:44:42,619
In my private room in
prison. Take a walk.

1218
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:47,787
Charlie, finish this and
let's get outta here,
find us a couple of girlies.

1219
01:44:47,861 --> 01:44:51,319
That's one thing I do not
need. I got that already.

1220
01:44:51,398 --> 01:44:54,595
Can everybody hear me?

1221
01:44:54,668 --> 01:44:56,659
I got me a wife.

1222
01:44:56,737 --> 01:45:02,141
She is hard to handle and as
contrary as a hog on ice.

1223
01:45:02,209 --> 01:45:05,645
That ain't half of it.

1224
01:45:05,713 --> 01:45:08,375
You guys ain't got no
idea what it's like...

1225
01:45:08,449 --> 01:45:11,748
to be rubbing up against
something that dangerous.

1226
01:45:14,922 --> 01:45:18,653
That's what I like
about the South

1227
01:45:24,098 --> 01:45:26,760
Mama, hi!

1228
01:45:26,834 --> 01:45:29,701
We're still at the
airport. The weather bad?

1229
01:45:29,770 --> 01:45:32,534
Yeah. We've spent the
whole damn night here...

1230
01:45:32,606 --> 01:45:36,098
but the first spot of good
weather we'll take off.

1231
01:45:36,176 --> 01:45:38,110
How are my babies?

1232
01:45:38,178 --> 01:45:41,841
Just fine. Charlie came
by the house with two
quarts of ice cream.

1233
01:45:41,915 --> 01:45:44,281
He did? He said he
missed seeing them.

1234
01:45:44,351 --> 01:45:46,410
I knew he couldn't stay away.

1235
01:45:46,487 --> 01:45:50,947
He hadn't had a thing
to drink. Good as gold.

1236
01:45:51,025 --> 01:45:55,052
Hell, Charlie's always
good. Except when he isn't.

1237
01:45:55,129 --> 01:45:57,256
You just hurry home.

1238
01:45:57,331 --> 01:46:00,391
Give those babies sugar
for me. Of course.

1239
01:46:03,737 --> 01:46:08,071
Let's go! Hot dog! This beats
the hell out of drivin'!

1240
01:46:08,142 --> 01:46:10,576
Let's get this show on the road.

1241
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,274
Looks like we might be
in for a little fun.

1242
01:46:42,342 --> 01:46:43,775
A little turbulence.

1243
01:46:52,986 --> 01:46:56,319
Right tank's empty.
Switching over.

1244
01:47:03,797 --> 01:47:06,994
Oh, boy! What the
hell's goin' on?

1245
01:47:07,067 --> 01:47:11,333
What's the matter with this?
Gotta drop the nose. Hold on.

1246
01:47:15,976 --> 01:47:18,638
Kick it over.

1247
01:47:18,712 --> 01:47:22,478
Come on, baby. Come on!

1248
01:47:22,549 --> 01:47:24,744
Catch on!

1249
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:29,916
Come on, baby.

1250
01:47:41,435 --> 01:47:46,304
It started. Oh, Lord, thank you!

1251
01:47:46,373 --> 01:47:48,102
Attaboy, Randy.

1252
01:47:49,676 --> 01:47:52,440
I almost peed my pants.

1253
01:47:52,513 --> 01:47:54,947
I did pee in mine.

1254
01:47:57,217 --> 01:47:58,946
My God!

1255
01:49:03,784 --> 01:49:08,278
You can't work and take
care of two babies.

1256
01:49:13,493 --> 01:49:15,222
Look at me.

1257
01:49:15,295 --> 01:49:18,560
I'll take the kids
with me for a while.

1258
01:49:20,267 --> 01:49:22,565
I'll be good to them.

1259
01:49:22,636 --> 01:49:24,661
I know it.

1260
01:49:31,311 --> 01:49:33,245
I know it.

1261
01:54:51,698 --> 01:54:55,634
