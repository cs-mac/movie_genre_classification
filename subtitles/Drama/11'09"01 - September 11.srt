***

2
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,437
David!

3
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,636
David!

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,800
David!

5
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,996
<i> I love you, Joseph. </ i></i>

6
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,393
Hey, I can wait out here all day.

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,472
Jesus.

8
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,594
Your last book sold 5 million copies.
Surely you could've done better than this.

9
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,669
Glad to see that you're writing again.

10
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,076
Yeah, well there have never been a problem
with that, I write every day.

11
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,589
- So, what is the problem?
- I'm done.

12
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,600
This doesn't look like you're done.
This looks like a bestseller.

13
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,325
That's not even a book. It's personal.

14
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,200
All your writing is personal.
That's why it sells.

15
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,357
I write dime store thrillers,
so spare me the pretense.

16
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,840
You have a legion of followers that would disagree with you.

17
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
What's this?

18
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,640
That's none of your concern.

19
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,194
- It's just a diary.
- An autobiography?

20
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,195
It's a diary!

21
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,999
I'm part of this support group,
and now we write about our pain.

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,669
You know, your writing is a lot more
important than you may think.

23
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,314
I can't begin to fathom what you must be going through.

24
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm fine.

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,073
Stop punishing yourself Joe.

26
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,953
You've got to get out of this room.

27
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,518
I miss you.

28
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,560
<i>The day that Sarah and David died,</ i></i>

29
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,680
<i>So did my faith in that there was
some sort of higher power.</ i></i>

30
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
<i>There's no divine beings and a master architect.</ i></i>

31
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,160
<i>Surely no deity could be responsible for so much pain, </ i></i>

32
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,680
<i>so much fucking misery.</ i></i>

33
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,080
<i> God is dead.
Or maybe he was never alive.</ I></i>

34
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,800
All my friends had these, careers,
and I just had a job.

35
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,600
It didn't matter. When I met Henry,
everything changed.

36
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,480
I quit my job ... and I was a wife.

37
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
Full time.

38
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,040
I was the most important thing in his life.

39
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,276
He needed me and he was the only family I ever had.

40
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,473
And I was good.

41
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,600
No, I was great.

42
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,760
When he died,

43
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,200
I died too.

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,800
I never realized the importance of family,

45
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,000
until the one I had was taken away.

46
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,840
But now, I wake up every morning ...

47
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,200
I write my journal ...
and I know that tomorrow is a new day.

48
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Don't loose those.
High street value and all that.

49
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,119
Yeah.

50
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,669
- You know you're up?
- I don't think that's gonna happen.

51
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,588
- Why not?
- I just don't have very much to say.

52
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,110
You've been coming here for months
and you've not said a thing.

53
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,198
I'm pretty sure you have an encyclopedia
of things to say.

54
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,348
- At least I see you're following the steps.
- Oh yeah.

55
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,276
No it's just ... I don't wanna go in there
and just bore everybody.

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,118
My story ends the same as everybody else's,
in Tragedy.

57
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,272
You know for someone so good with words ...

58
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,480
I find it hard to believe you can't find the
right ones to share.

59
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,360
You shouldn't look so surprised.
I read quite a lot you know.

60
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,040
Yeah, sorry.

61
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,320
Hey, um ... seems a bit stupid now, but I read
somewhere that you don't like using computers.

62
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,671
And I saw your tattered notebooks in group, so ...

63
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,715
- I know it's lame.
- Wow, thanks! It's not lame, it's great.

64
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,880
Okay, bye!

65
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,520
Call 911!

66
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,156
<i>Joseph.</i>

67
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,469
Mr. Crone?
Mr. Crone, can you hear me?

68
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,280
- You're one very lucky man.
- Am I?

69
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,200
Yes you are. You are in St. Luke's hospital now.

70
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Mr. Crone, do you remember what happened?

71
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah.

72
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,079
I do not know who your guardian angel is,

73
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,360
but you might consider giving him a raise.

74
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,400
- The other driver?
- He didn't have your luck.

75
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,040
Can I come in?

76
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,237
Sorry, I can leave.
I just didn't know who to call or ....

77
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,909
- There's no one to call.
- Looks like you're gonna need a new watch.

78
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,550
I get to bed every night praying I won't
wake up in the morning.

79
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,236
I pray I walk out of the house and get
struck by lightning.

80
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,591
I pray to a God I know doesn't exist to run me down by car,

81
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,359
and the day it finally happens I walk away
without a scratch.

82
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,392
- It wasn't your time.
- No it is my time, I have no purpose.

83
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,514
You're a famous author, with legions of fans.
Your books inspire millions of people.

84
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,916
- But you have no purpose?
- This is not group therapy. Okay?

85
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,031
Look. I know what it's like to feel sorry for
yourself, and it's dangerous.

86
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,199
I used to be alone and have no reason to ...
- Yeah, I know, you found God.

87
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,791
No. I met someone who showed me something
that changed my outlook on the world.

88
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
We all have our purpose.

89
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,800
Just because you feel alone,
it doesn't mean you've lost yours.

90
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,911
- How you're getting home?
- Taking a cab.

91
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
No you're not.

92
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,920
I'll get the car and meet you outside.

93
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,440
Do not answer the call, Joseph.

94
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,640
They are watching you.

95
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
But do not answer their call.

96
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,840
Will I see you at group tomorrow?
I can give you a lift if you like.

97
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,600
That's probably a good idea considering
my driving skills

98
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
See you.

99
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,840
Joseph.

100
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,960
Don't forget this.

101
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,261
Hey ...

102
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,035
I just wanted to say thank you for being there for me.

103
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
And thanks for this!

104
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Bye!

105
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,600
Shit.
Hello?

106
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,401
Hello?

107
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,800
<i>Joseph?</ i></i>

108
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,720
How'd you get this number?

109
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
<i>Dad's dying.</ i></i>

110
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,520
<i>The hospital released him to spend his
last days at home.</ i></i>

111
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,400
<i>I don't expect you to come,
I just thought you should know.</ i></i>

112
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,600
<i>Barcelona, Spain</ i></i>

113
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,280
That address is 45 minutes from Barcelona.

114
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,556
It's a very expensive trip.

115
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,593
- I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish.
- No, no. English.

116
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,160
<i>Returning to Spain brings back so many memories.</ i></i>

117
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,760
<i>Things I never wanted to revisit</ i></i>

118
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,160
<i>My old man ... his faith.
A God that abandoned me.</ I></i>

119
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,680
<i>My brother, who ...
although we have the same blood,</ i></i>

120
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,320
<i>remains a stranger to me.</ i></i>

121
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,000
Hello?

122
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,360
Hello?

123
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,400
You must be Joseph.

124
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
- And you are?
- My name is Anna.

125
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,200
So, you are a famous writer?

126
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,834
I don't like your books.
I only believe in one book.

127
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
Well, I'm taking care of your father until he passes.

128
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I will give you some time to be with him.

129
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,920
They're watching, Joseph.

130
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,720
They're coming for him.

131
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,120
You must save him.

132
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,800
Are you ready to save him, boy?

133
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
- I understand what you're talking about.
- He needs your help.

134
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,720
Dad, I don't know what you're trying to tell me.

135
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,960
He cannot do this by himself.

136
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm gonna get Anna, for you.

137
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,560
It's good to see you son.

138
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,600
Joseph?

139
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I can't believe it.
You made it.

140
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,520
- I'm not staying, I can't be here.
- What? Where are you going?

141
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,600
- Hotel.
- A hotel?

142
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,319
Joe, I read online you were in a car accident.
You didn't even call us.

143
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,670
- What could you have done?
- Been there for you.

144
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,500
We've never been there for each other.

145
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,079
Not when we were kids, and you're not
gonna be there for me now.

146
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,993
That could change. We've changed.
The lord has a plan for you brother.

147
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,680
The lords plan hasn't quite worked out for me has it?

148
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,320
Do you resent us that much?

149
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't resent you Samuel.
I resent what you represent.

150
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,749
What he represents,
what this whole place represents.

151
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,315
They do not think he'll make it past the week.
I do not think he'll make it past the night.

152
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,956
So whatever hatred you have for the church,
don't take it out on us.

153
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,358
Please.
Stay the night.

154
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,989
- So what happened to your church?
- Congregation dwindled.

155
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,475
More and more lost their faith.

156
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,593
We hope to find a new place as soon as the
messages from our sermon spread.

157
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
Perhaps you can lend us some of your loyal readers to the cause.

158
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,520
Yeah ... What cause is that?

159
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,720
Transcending the world's perception of religion.

160
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,440
Yeah, I don't know if my readers would be
buying what you're selling.

161
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,120
You'd be surprised what your fans would believe in.

162
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,637
You know why mom bought this thing
when we moved to Spain?

163
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,389
To remind us that angels are all around us.

164
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,752
Ever since Sarah and David died,
this statue's been in my nightmares.

165
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,240
It won't bite you.

166
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,440
It just reminds me of things I'd like to forget.

167
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,880
I have something for you.

168
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,836
I wish I could say I've read them all.
Seems as soon as I'm reading one, two more come out.

169
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,077
Do you really have as little faith as the
characters in your books?

170
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,716
Maybe less.

171
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:18,817
An atheist and a pastor.
We're quite the pair aren't we?

172
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,431
- Do you still write every day?
- Yeah, it's actually the only thing I inherited from him.

173
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,840
Me too.

174
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,560
For the past few Christmases and birthdays we've missed.

175
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,433
Please, I want you to have this.

176
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,470
- For continued success with the writing.
- You didn't have to do this.

177
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,195
It's been too long, brother.
It's good to see you.

178
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,955
Last few months we've had ongoing issues with vandals.

179
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,551
We installed those around the compound,
more than anything just to act as a deterrent.

180
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,991
<i>- Catch any bad guys?
- We caught something.</i>

181
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,151
- Anna has a very vivid imagination.
- Come, Joseph, come.

182
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,949
- What is this?
- Each camera takes one picture per minute,

183
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,311
unless the motion sensor is triggered and it rolls video.

184
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,350
This is from last week.

185
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,239
There.

186
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,079
Look!

187
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,920
What?

188
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,160
A demon.

189
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,230
- That's fog.
- My brother he ... he lacks faith.

190
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,200
I don't lack faith. I have faith.

191
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I have faith in what makes rational sense.
God, and demons, and the devil don't.

192
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,720
I am going to pray for you.

193
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
- George Washington.
- What about him?

194
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:27,640
Have you ever met him?
Have you ever met anyone who's ever met him?

195
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,120
No. No pictures, nothing. Only text.
Yet you still believe in George Washington.

196
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,040
God is a myth, Samuel. Neither you nor
Washington is gonna convince me otherwise.

197
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,958
David died at 11:11.
The time on his death certificate.

198
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,070
Not a number you easily forget.
I've been seeing that number a lot lately.

199
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Hello?

200
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
I got your number from the hospital,
I hope that's okay.

201
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,080
The hospital gave you my number?

202
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,240
<i>Well, I didn't say they gave me the number.
I said that I got from the hospital.</i>

203
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,120
<i>You know, I waited outside your hotel
for 30 minutes.</ i></i>

204
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I ... I forgot.

205
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,877
- I had a little bit of an emergency.
- An emergency, on top of the accident?

206
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,879
- You're having quite the week.
- I'm having quite a year.

207
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
- I'm in Spain.
- What?

208
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
<i> Yeah, I'm in Barcelona.</ i></i>

209
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,040
<i>- You're serious?
- Yes, my brother and my father live here.</i>

210
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,068
- My father moved here when I was a little kid.
- I'm so happy you're with your family, Joseph.

211
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,350
I wanna ask you a question.

212
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,392
You ever see a number reappearing in your life
over and over again?

213
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,718
- Such as?
- 11:11.

214
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,951
- Well. Did you make a wish?
- A wish?

215
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,194
Yeah. You know, when you look up and see
a clock that says 11:11 and you make a wish.

216
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,069
- No, why?
- An old wives tale, it's lucky I think.

217
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,872
Why are you asking me this?

218
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,439
<i>Why am I back here? Why am I staying when
everything in my being is telling me to run?</ i></i>

219
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,235
<i>I remember the day we moved into this house
and how much I hated it.</ i></i>

220
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,672
<i>How much I hated my father for moving us here.</ i></i>

221
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:44,873
<i>How I resented him.</i>

222
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,188
<i>Not much has changed.
I still feel like an outsider.</i>

223
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,675
<i>Even amongst my own family.</ i></i>

224
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Anna?

225
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:35,677
Anna?

226
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,389
<i> Diary of Anne. </ i></i>

227
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,640
I'm afraid I am not at good at writing as you.

228
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,800
- I am very sorry. I was just curious.
- It's okay.

229
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,240
- So you're a writer.
- It's a gospel, according to me.

230
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,436
I don't read Spanish, but it looks like a diary.

231
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,796
A record of my faith.

232
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,834
You know, if I kept a record of my faith,
it would be a book with no pages.

233
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,111
I keep a diary.

234
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,831
I know. But this is mine.

235
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,195
Something your father encouraged of his congregation.

236
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,711
Sounds like my father.
Well, I'm sorry again.

237
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,150
I will leave you to your comfort.

238
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,557
<i>The Spirit Guardians</ i></i>

239
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,518
<i>the messengers</ i></i>

240
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,879
<i>The next door</ i></i>

241
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,915
The 11:11 activation is to open the doorway of the 11:11.

242
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,517
This doorway is a transition zone between
two very different spirals of evolution.

243
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,855
Those who have been activated by messengers can view
both worlds, sometimes seeing ... the "Midwayers".

244
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Other times they manifest by hallucinations,
trying to deliver a message.

245
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,900
<i>Joseph</i>

246
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
Samuel?

247
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,680
Samuel?

248
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,280
Samuel!?

249
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,600
David?

250
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,880
Anna!

251
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,400
They are here.

252
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,000
Hello?

253
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,000
Hello!?

254
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:15,701
Hello?

255
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,000
Samuel?

256
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,901
Samuel!

257
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,520
Breathe. Breathe.

258
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Anna!

259
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,080
Come on. Let's get you up.
Come on.

260
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,399
What happened?

261
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,559
I don't know.

262
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,530
I was just ...

263
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,331
I was just praying.

264
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,750
Has this ever happened to you before?

265
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
No.

266
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,200
I'm hallucinating, I don't know what's wrong
with me, but I'm seeing things.

267
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,640
You drink?

268
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,512
Jesus drink.

269
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,600
- What is this place?
- This is our chapel.

270
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,040
This isn't a chapel.

271
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,072
You don't need a cathedral to worship the lord.

272
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,876
The dedication of my flock is not measured
by the size of our church.

273
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,551
When our congregation grows, it will be
because of the message.

274
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,600
- Not the comfort of the pews.
- Let's get you back into the chair.

275
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,600
Come on. Give me your arms.
Here we go!

276
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,309
I'm gonna go try and get some rest.

277
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,235
Do you still blame me?

278
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,159
What happened to mom was not your fault.

279
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,000
Joseph, come to my service tomorrow.

280
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,400
You know, I really don't do cathedrals.

281
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,600
- Or basement chapels.
- Religion is flawed, I'll give you that.

282
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,880
But I'm doing my part, to bring
it back to the true message.

283
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,640
So was it worth it?

284
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,400
You know, following dad's footsteps,
devoting your life to a myth?

285
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,399
Just because you've lost your faith,
does not mean I've lost mine.

286
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,471
I'll see you in the morning.

287
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,600
<i>You have one unheard message.
Message left at 11:11 p.m.</i>

288
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,271
<i>I think it's 11:11 where you are,
didn't wanna say anyting, just ...</ i></i>

289
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,715
Is this your new book?

290
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,070
I am not Kathy Bates ...

291
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,113
but I will go misery on you if you
are not up in two seconds.

292
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,949
- What are you doing in my room, Anna?
- I am your date to the service.

293
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,200
To church service?

294
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,040
I don't do church.

295
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,760
Your brother say you say that.
That's why I'm here, to restore your faith.

296
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,351
Yes. Well you can restore my faith on Sunday.
Today is Thursday.

297
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,316
Get dressed!

298
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,280
Sacrifice.

299
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,960
Something the bible talks a lot about.
Genesis 22.

300
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,760
God tells Abraham to sacrifice his only son, Isaac,

301
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,400
as a testament to his faith.

302
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,160
Abraham loved God so much

303
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,240
he took his child to a mountain with the intent to slay him.

304
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,960
For three days he journeyed to Moriah,
knowing that when he arrived

305
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,720
he would have to kill his own flesh and blood.

306
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,000
God too, made the ultimate sacrifice.

307
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,077
He gave his only begotten son,
Jesus Christ, to die for our sins.

308
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,431
In life, we all must make sacrifices.

309
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,519
Not as extreme as Jesus or Abraham,
but still important.

310
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,200
Imagine if Christ had not died on the cross.

311
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,560
Then our sins would not be absolved.

312
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,000
We make sacrifices every day, right?

313
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,874
Today, the sacrifice is the warmth
and comfort of our chapel.

314
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,437
I am a sinner.
I wish I could say I were divine,

315
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,996
but the truth is, my life is riddled with shortcomings.

316
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,920
Today in religion, we spend so much time asking for
forgiveness, so much time obsessing on our faults,

317
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,040
that we forget to live.

318
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,639
We worshippers look down on sinners.

319
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,838
All the while, pushing newcomers away from the church,
not bringing them closer together.

320
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,111
Damning mistakes we ourselves make.

321
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,360
To sin is human. Jesus Christ sacrificed his
own life so that we may sin.

322
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,355
It was his final gift to man.

323
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,632
What will your sacrifice to God be?

324
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,396
Javier, what is it?

325
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,708
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

326
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,109
Javier, you don't look well.

327
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,040
Jose!

328
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,280
Joseph!

329
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,949
They are coming for you, brother.
The doorway's opening.

330
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,150
You will see.

331
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,600
- How do I dial 911.
- No, please don't do that.

332
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,680
Why?

333
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,600
Because we know him.
We've been trying to help him for some time.

334
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,152
Joseph, in  the last year we've lost the church,
people have lost their faith ...

335
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,953
- We can't afford this type of attention.
- Who is he?

336
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,992
His name is Javier Cabello,
he's a member of the congregation.

337
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,193
- Why is a member of the congregation trying to kill you?
- He's trying to scare me.

338
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,757
- He's doing a good job. Why?
- He never liked what I had to say.

339
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,920
Tough crows.
What did you have to say?

340
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,360
My sermons, the messages of the church.

341
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,360
Javier had some radical beliefs,
he was into some ... dark things.

342
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,074
- Was he a satanist?
- No, he was just misguided.

343
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,397
He stuck a gun in your face,
he pointed the gun at me!

344
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,160
Joseph, I implore you not to worry.
Please.

345
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,040
Let's not destroy his life or this church any more.

346
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,160
- He was probably drunk. I'll call his wife.
- You do what you've gotta do.

347
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,640
All the forgiveness, it doesn't always work that way.
You be careful.

348
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,280
I wanna get out of here.
Let's go someplace for a bit

349
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,550
Good idea.
Come on.

350
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,836
That was an interesting sermon.
You endorse sin.

351
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,410
I mean, doesn't that go against everything the Bible teaches?

352
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:39,411
People are gonna do what they want,
regardless if you enable them or damn them.

353
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:41,412
Fear is no way to live your life.

354
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,111
That is the essence of what religion is, isn't it? Fear.
- Okay, so by that rationale ...

355
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,789
Why have faith in religion at all?
Why believe in God?

356
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,151
- Have you ever read the Bible, Joseph?
- You're gonna drop the Bible on me now.

357
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,880
I asked if you ever read the Bible,
not if you believe in it.

358
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,960
I haven't read the Bible since I was a young kid.

359
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,720
You of all people should know the importance
of power of a book.

360
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,240
The right words at the right time can change a life.

361
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,000
Give it purpose.

362
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,080
Restore faith.

363
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,560
I know the power a book.
I live with that power every day.

364
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,200
It doesn't always restore faith,
it destroys it.

365
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,200
A fanatic read my books,

366
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,800
set fire to my apartment,
and killed my wife and my son.

367
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,520
All because of words I wrote in a book.

368
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,000
- I'm glad you came back home.
- This was never my home.

369
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,600
- You never gave it a change.
- You were born here,

370
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,358
you never knew anything else.

371
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,829
You know, there isn't a day going by
I'm not reminded of what I took from her.

372
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,636
From you, from dad.

373
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,829
I promised myself I would make my life will important.

374
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,200
My work and the message I preach.
I will give her death meaning.

375
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,360
- It's your birthday tomorrow.
- I'm not big on birthdays.

376
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,590
Take a look at this.
Look at the time.

377
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,474
- 11:10?
- It's 11:11.

378
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,100
I was wearing that when I was in my car accident.

379
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:30,401
It's also the time your fog rolled in.

380
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,960
It's the time of death on David's death certificate.

381
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,157
Your attack happened at 11:11.

382
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,155
Mom ... November 11th.

383
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,669
- You're searching for parallels?
- And finding them.

384
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,320
Brother, be careful looking for meaning
when there is none.

385
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,440
No, there's something to this.

386
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,960
Or maybe you're just cognisant of the
number now, and looking for it.

387
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,200
No, no. It's too frequent to be random.

388
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,520
These people online call themselves "Eleveners."

389
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,040
They believe that there's celestial beings that
exist between our world and someplace else.

390
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,313
They believe they try to use the number
to contact us, to get our attention.

391
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,240
You think, because you're seeing some
number over and over again,

392
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,520
that someone, or something, is trying to contact you?

393
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,320
Brother, be careful looking for meaning
when there is none.

394
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,440
No, there's something to this.

395
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,960
Or maybe you're just cognisant of the
number now, and looking for it.

396
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,200
No, no. It's too frequent to be random.

397
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,520
These people online call themselves "Eleveners."

398
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,040
They believe that there's celestial beings that
exist between our world and someplace else.

399
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,313
They believe they try to use the number
to contact us, to get our attention.

400
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,240
You think, because you're seeing some
number over and over again,

401
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,520
that someone, or something, is trying to contact you?

402
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,229
You believe in praying to an old man
who lives in the clouds?

403
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,719
Those cameras in your church;
how long do you save that footage?

404
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,077
- Here's November 4th, that's as far back as we go.
- That was six nights ago.

405
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,634
Fast forward to 11 PM.

406
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,753
Keep going. Good, stop.

407
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,599
- What are we looking for?
- 11:11.

408
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,396
Last night, after your attack,
I came here and looked at this footage.

409
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,833
Javier said there were others, and well,
there were a bunch of people standing in your yard.

410
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,152
You still think that's random?
Something's trying to get our attention.

411
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,470
That was the fourth, right? Hold on one second,
I gotta take this. Pull up the fifth.

412
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,753
Excuse me.
What the hell happened to you?

413
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,112
<i>- Are you okay?
- I'm great, Grant. I'm doing backflips right now.</i>

414
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,919
I read that you were in a wreck, you get admitted
to a hospital, and you don't as much as call me?

415
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,876
<i>- I'm fine.
- You bet you're fine.</i>

416
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,357
You are about to find out just what a great agent I am.
I hope that you're still writing.

417
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,472
Because I have just come out of a meeting
with Ransom Publishing.

418
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,276
They are offering you a high seven figure,
blind deal, on your next book.

419
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,631
<i>Now, Joe, don't you get mad at me,
but I pitched them your diary.</i>

420
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,200
<i> ... When ... Joseph ...</ i></i>

421
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,360
Hello?

422
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,600
Hello?

423
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,199
Are you scared yet, son?

424
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,870
Pardon me ma'am. English ... English?

425
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,639
Sir, excuse me, do you know where ...

426
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,550
Thank you.

427
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Here?

428
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,440
I have this camera.

429
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,200
I need to get the film developed in
this camera, do you do that?

430
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,440
I need to see ... to see,
the film in this camera.

431
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,790
I don't know if you have an express service,
or something, but ...

432
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,992
- Name, please.
- Joseph Crone.

433
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,960
Can I get the pictures in an hour or something?

434
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,540
- Tomorrow.
- No, no. Today.

435
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,471
Okay, I know, "Magnani."
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

436
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,077
Javier is a good husband and a good man.

437
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,800
Yeah I'm sure. When he's not brandishing a gun,
he's probably great to be around.

438
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,240
Mrs. Cabelo, he came to my brother's service
and he shoved a gun in my face.

439
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,636
So anything you can tell me would be really helpful.

440
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,440
He has been ... in a very bad place.
Confused.

441
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,280
- Confused how?
- He thinks he was chosen.

442
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,509
- Says he has to end the church.
- My brother's church?

443
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,916
Javier has always been a religious man, but ...

444
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,596
Things became cloudy.
He became obsessed.

445
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,874
He spent all of his time at the library of
the occult, reading dark things.

446
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,799
He lost his grip on reality.

447
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,710
- How is your brother?
- My brother is fine.

448
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,600
He has the best sermons.
They make sense.

449
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,520
Some will make me feel comfortable.
I've been to the other churches,  but ...

450
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,428
I always left feeling guilty, dirty.

451
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,916
But not there.
Not with him.

452
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:22,917
<i>-- Spanish --</i>

453
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,760
To sin is normal, that's what Samuel would say.

454
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,160
Let me bring you the address to the store.

455
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:05,511
Hello?

456
00:50:13,861 --> 00:50:15,211
Hello?

457
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,832
Anybody home?

458
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,480
Jesus.

459
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,280
- You scare people in english too?
- Yes, sir.

460
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,879
Javier Cabello.

461
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,599
- Does the name ring a bell? Do you know him?
- I have many customers.

462
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,037
I didn't say he was a customer.

463
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,516
I'm not interested in many,
I'm interested in this one.

464
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,237
- We heard you were in town.
- Im sorry?

465
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,156
Your work precedes you.

466
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,160
What does an atheist want with the occult?
Research for a new book?

467
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,080
Yeah, I'm researching Javier Cabello.

468
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,989
Please.
His wife says he comes in here.

469
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,479
- All this, huh?
- Yes. Javier spends a lot of time here.

470
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,070
- Guess so.
- Books of rituals.

471
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,190
Sacrifice. Satanism.

472
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,792
And this one?
Tell me something about this number, 11:11.

473
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,390
- What does it mean?
- Something is trying to wake you up.

474
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,512
- Wake me up from what?
- That which you aren't seeing.

475
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,480
Why this number? Why 11:11?

476
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,400
Why not ... I don't know, 19 or 67, 45?

477
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,755
Why numbers at all? Why not just ... you've
got something to say, just come out and say it.

478
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,680
There are rules.
Even for mystical and fantastical.

479
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,400
It is how faith works.

480
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,760
- Okay. 161, "Midwayer". What are they?
- Exactly what it sounds like.

481
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,429
- Beings that exist midway.
- Great, but midway to what?

482
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,558
- Our world and theirs.
- Are they dangerous?

483
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,309
They have limited power in our world.
They are not truly a part of it.

484
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,274
According to this, they are here on missions.

485
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,110
If you have been activated,
they want you to play some part in it.

486
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,400
If you've seen the number, or them,

487
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,440
there is a reason for that.

488
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,720
Javier was seeing this number?

489
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,793
Come on. Tell me.
This is your knowledge, tell me.

490
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,835
And part your wisdom on me, because I don't know.
I've seen these things.

491
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,918
For the last two nights.

492
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,999
- Why?
- The closer we get to the 11:11,

493
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,795
the more power they have in our world.

494
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,913
It's insane. It's just ... It sounds insane.

495
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,674
Come on, follow me.

496
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,314
The Sumerians believed that 11-11
was an important date.

497
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,638
- Why?
- On the eleventh day of the eleventh moment

498
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,957
of the eleventh year,
a gateway will open

499
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,709
from it comes beings unlike mortal eyes have seen.

500
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,196
And on this day, innocent blood will spill.

501
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,395
And from this sacrifice, the serpent will rise.

502
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,196
Destroying faith and bringing with it, rapture.

503
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,200
A sacrifice for raising,
a sacrifice to bring, the end.

504
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,200
Javier said that 11:11 is a doorway.
What does that mean?

505
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,676
- That he is delusional.
- Let's say he's not delusional.

506
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,678
What if 11:11 actually means something?

507
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,475
This is a prank. There's gotta be a
logical explanation for this.

508
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,240
Here you go again, you believe in a man who walked
on water, you believe in a talking snake,

509
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,520
and you can't believe in this?

510
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,240
Just follow me for a minute.
What if 11:11 is the doorway.

511
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,514
What if 11:11 as in the time, is the
doorway that's letting these things in.

512
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,394
Joseph, do you hear youself?
You sound like one of your books.

513
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,917
I told you, don't look for meaning where there is none.

514
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,471
It's just a number.

515
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,470
Glad to see that you are still writing.

516
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,435
There are things I should have told you.

517
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,916
Your brother is special.
You must protect him.

518
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,439
Protect him?

519
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,320
I haven't seen him ... I haven't seen you, in years.

520
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,600
And now I have to protect him?

521
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,000
- Protect him from what?
- The God ... God brings into this world,

522
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,430
Satan tries to avert it.

523
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,828
I have never told Samuel what
I'm about to tell you now.

524
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:34,200
After you were born, there were complications.

525
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,000
The doctors told us that your mother
could no longer conceive.

526
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,437
That she could no longer give birth.

527
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,319
The birth of your brother was a miracle.

528
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,991
Immaculate conception?
That's insane even for you.

529
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,112
- Once you went away ...
- No, no, I was sent away.

530
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,200
I did what was best for you.
I do not regret my decision.

531
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,640
What was best for me?
You did what was easiest for you.

532
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,228
You have such a rage inside of you.

533
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,480
Rage against me. Rage against him.

534
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,240
I didn't know how to comfort you.

535
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,280
You're a goddamn priest.
Isn't comforting people what you do?

536
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,672
Look at me.

537
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,152
You did this.
You sent me away.

538
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,799
And you tore this family apart.

539
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,880
Your brother must survive.

540
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,800
His message must survive.

541
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,400
- You must have faith.
- I have faith.

542
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,991
I have faith and fully believe that you are insane.

543
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,150
You are more important than you think.

544
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,468
<i>I'm seeing things. Am I crazy?</i>

545
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,277
<i>I'm loosing my mind.</i>

546
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,680
<i>Or are they visions?</i>

547
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,480
<i>Warning? Prophecies?</i>

548
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,520
<i>I've seen 11:11 again.</i>

549
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,159
<i>As crazy as this sounds, it's followed me to Spain.</i>

550
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,800
Hello?

551
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,438
You suddenly piqued my interest in 11:11.
I started reading about it and now I just can't stop.

552
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,200
- I'm a little bit obsessed.
- I'm a little bit more than obsessed.

553
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,920
- I keep seeing the number everywhere.
- So you've been activated.

554
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,874
<i> - I've been something ... I don't know.
- Are you okay? </ I></i>

555
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,875
Uh ... no.

556
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,077
Actually I'm not okay.
I'm not okay at all.

557
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,320
Someone's trying to kill my brother.

558
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,605
What?

559
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,400
<i>And my father's dying.</i>

560
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,600
And I keep seeing the number ... I'm seeing it ...
I just see it everywhere.

561
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,600
I don't know if I'm willing it or if it's real.

562
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,078
You know, Barcelona is only 6 hours away,
if you need someone.

563
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,638
You know I never believed in God,
or fate, or purpose, but ...

564
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,800
this is different.

565
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:13,920
- I never should have come back.
- Sounds like maybe your family needs you.

566
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,480
<i>Maybe you need them too.</i>

567
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,920
Yeah, you don't know my family.
Look, I'm gonna call you back, okay?

568
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,680
<i>Okay.</i>

569
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:28,000
<i>-- Spanish --</i>

570
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,753
What is all this?

571
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,273
<i>Protect him.</i>

572
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,920
Last night, when I found you on the floor,

573
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,880
I saw this, standing in the room with us.

574
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:57,281
I printed this up.

575
00:59:57,282 --> 01:00:00,320
I don't know what's going on but I take
comfort in the fact that if I'm going crazy,

576
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,840
I'm not doing it alone.

577
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,880
On the web, it talks about 11:11 being a doorway,
same thing Javier told us.

578
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,240
- A doorway to what?
- Us.

579
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,069
A doorway to communicate with us.
They say they're angels.

580
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,120
- Whatever they are, they want my attention.
- Angels?

581
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,880
These things are not angels, Joseph.

582
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,040
- 11:11 is just ...
- A number?

583
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,072
If you say just a number, and I swear
to your Christ, I'll loose it.

584
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,990
For a man who's based his entire existence around some
unseen force, cosmically guiding humanity.

585
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,759
- And you can't believe this?
- Joseph, what do you want me to say?

586
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,517
For the last week at least, these things have been showing
up in and around this house, at the exact same time.

587
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,599
David's death, mom's death,
my car accident, your attack last night.

588
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,960
I keep telling you this.
Tomorrow is 11/11/11.

589
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,720
And I'm terrified, that something horrible's gonna happen.

590
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,840
- Pack your things, we're leaving here tonight.
- Joseph, I'm not leaving this house, or dad.

591
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,790
Dad told me that I had to protect you, that you were
some kind of savior. What was he talking about?

592
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:04,520
- Answer me. What was he talking about?
- Dad sometimes had radical beliefs.

593
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,800
He said you were gonna be the one to
save me, save this church

594
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,469
He thought I was important to religion, to man's faith.

595
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,717
- Important how?
- That my outlook needed to be heard.

596
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,476
That the church, maybe even religion itself,
was headed for destruction.

597
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,152
- And you have the answers?
- No. He had delusions of grandeur.

598
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah, I thought he sounds like a prophet.

599
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:40,960
<i>At first I thought I was loosing my mind,
I kept seeing things, things I can't explain.</i>

600
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:46,552
<i>It kept happening at the same time, at 11:11.
And now the day's getting closer.</i>

601
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,196
<i>These vision are getting clearer and I'm seeing them longer.</i>

602
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,471
<i>Something's trying to warn me.</i>

603
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,388
<i>Something major will transpire on 11/11/11.</i>

604
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,518
<i>"One thousand one hundred eleven loyal midwayers
are engaged in important missions on earth."</i>

605
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,996
<i>"These midwayers have definite power over time and space."</i>

606
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,591
<i>This is from the Urantia book.
I recommend all "Eleveners", read this!</i>

607
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,480
<i>I have a bad feeling something is about to happen.</i>

608
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,181
<i>I've been seeing the 11:11 too frequently.</i>

609
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,476
<i>Something terrible is coming.</i>

610
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,119
I've asked Anna to pack your things.
We're leaving this house.

611
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,312
- What are you talking about?
- You're not safe here.

612
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,955
What do you know the Urantia book?

613
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,913
- How did you hear about that?
- Online.

614
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,430
It's a book radicals believe was
written by celestial beings.

615
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,155
- Angels.
- It's hogwash. Blasphemous.

616
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,037
Does your sudden interest in the subject
have to do with 11:11?

617
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,551
I myself had been become curious about your
repeated sightnings of the number.

618
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,355
- I thought you said you weren't a believer.
- Not believing and not understanding

619
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,758
are two different things.
The Bible warns about divination.

620
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,118
Leveticus 19, verses 18-20.
Looking for answers through numbers.

621
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,357
Interpreting random acts as messages from God.

622
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,508
Whatever is coming through that doorway is not good,
regardless of what these papers say.

623
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,717
- Be careful of wolves in sheep's clothing.
- Meaning?

624
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,400
A man of sin will come at the power of Satan.

625
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,520
He will use all kinds of power, including
miraculous and wonderful signs.

626
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,800
But they will be lies and trickery.
Thessalonians 2:9.

627
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,480
If something is trying to get your attention.

628
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,280
It's not holy or angelic.

629
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,600
These "Midwayers" as the papers call them,

630
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,312
they're demonic.

631
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,876
- So you do believe in demons.
- I believe in God.

632
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,553
And with that comes believing in the devil.

633
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,154
I'm loosing my mind.

634
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,353
- Move!
- Joseph!

635
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,596
The lord has sent you here to protect me, Joseph.

636
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,198
What is it?

637
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,593
<i>I feel like I've been wrong my entire life.
What if God is real?</i>

638
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,756
<i>And my brother, a prophet? </i>

639
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:19,833
<i> 11:11 is my activation to save the prophet,
his message, this church.</ i></i>

640
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,638
- There he is.
- Sadie.

641
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,450
Hey.

642
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,599
- I promise you, I'm not not crazy.
- I wish you would've told me we were having company.

643
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,717
- Yeah. No, I ... I didn't know.
- I was worried about you.

644
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,276
My mom's a flight attendant, so I get free standby.

645
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,790
Okay, maybe I'm a little bit crazy, but just the good kind!

646
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,516
I was just telling Sadie about the falling chandelier
last night, and about our wayward childhood.

647
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,515
- I can't believe you're here. You're crazy.
- I prefer "spontaneous".

648
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,430
- You flew to Spain.
- You think a number's coming to get you.

649
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,951
Don't take this the wrong way but ...
You look terrible.

650
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,800
That's 'cus I haven't slept.

651
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,840
Seriously, I haven't slept.
For three days.

652
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,480
So you know what today is then?

653
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,400
Yes, I know. 11/11/11.

654
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,200
They were talking about it on the radio.

655
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,800
I don't know what you're going through,
but I know how important family is.

656
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,560
No matter how screwed up they are.

657
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,915
You being here, it's important.

658
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,076
I've never been to Barcelona.
Let's go explore.

659
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,800
You know what I did last night?

660
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,520
I stood in my little brother's front yard,

661
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,560
waiting for 11:11, to see if the demons
came out of the ground.

662
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,760
My brother may or may not be the savior of humanity.
Some sort of prophet.

663
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,395
And I may or may not be the one chosen to save him.

664
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,430
I can't believe the words that are coming out of
my mouth. I hear myself, I know I sound crazy.

665
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,960
Every time I research for a book, I find the answers.

666
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
The deeper I look into 11:11,

667
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
the more questions I have.

668
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,880
I'm seeing these things, I know they're not there.

669
01:08:51,881 --> 01:08:54,919
11:11, it's a sign, right?
It's an activation.

670
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,960
But from whom?

671
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
What does it say about me that I find it much
easier to believe in the devil than I do in God?

672
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,160
Before my husband died he became
increasingly more religious.

673
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,432
He spent every waking hour online, trying
to find something that would comfort him.

674
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,869
I basically watched him descend into madness.

675
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,629
He became addicted to trying to find
some answers, some kind of belief

676
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,160
that would make his departure easier to understand.

677
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,880
Instead, it just tore him apart.

678
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,640
And it made the end even more terrifying.

679
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,600
No, I don't think that you're crazy, but ...

680
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,599
I also don't think that obsessing about this
and researching is gonna help you either.

681
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,116
I truly believe there are some things we're
never supposed to understand.

682
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,318
What if being here is my purpose?
Protecting my brother is my purpose.

683
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:42,116
What if everything, this car accident ...
I walk away from this car accident, it defies logic.

684
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,320
I should have been sent to the morgue, not home.

685
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,880
What if every event in my life is tied together?

686
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,997
The fire, my mother's death, my car accident.

687
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:54,511
You said that we need to find synchronicity in
our lifes, you told me to seek a purpose.

688
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,920
What if being here is my purpose?
Protecting my brother is my purpose.

689
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,360
Maybe I'm just crazy.

I'm so sorry, Joseph.
You guys need some time.

- Mrs. Cabello, I need to see Javier, right now.

01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:16,468
- Sacrifice him at 11:11.
- Wait. Joseph, stop. Where are you?

714
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,354
There's a camera shop.
Camera shop in Barcelona.

715
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,712
It's in the Gothic Quarter. I need you to
go there and pick up a roll of film.

716
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,138
I don't understand.

717
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:29,359
Just pull out a pen and a piece of paper
and write this down.

718
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,316
- Okay.
- It's "The Anamorfosis".

It's under my name.

720
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,440
- I need to see what's on those pictures.
- Okay, yeah-yeah-yeah, I'll get it.

He just came at me, I don't know what happened ...
He came at me, it was ...

725
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,460
Give me the gun.

726
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,315
I'm gonna take care of you,
I'll get you out of this house, right now.

727
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,766
- Wait, father's room.
- What?

728
01:16:29,765 --> 01:16:31,821
- There are some notebooks.
- What are they?

729
01:16:31,822 --> 01:16:34,439
- Important!
- I don't care, we're leaving this house.

730
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:38,120
That's my life's work, the entire church's work.
Javier came to stop me and take them.

731
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,719
I fear that there will be more after.

732

What are you talking about?

733
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,120
If they want to end me, all they have to
do is destroy our history.

734
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,920
- Those notebooks, we have to protect them.
- No, I need to protect you!

735
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,400
They're a part of me,
and I'm not leaving without them!

736

Wait, stop! All right, I'll get your books.

01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:49,651
Samuel!

757
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,652
Help! Joseph!

758
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,900
Samuel!

759
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,400
Samuel!

760
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,401
Samuel...

761
01:21:17,402 --> 01:21:18,462
<i>Joseph!</i>

762
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,050
Samuel!

763
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,550
Samuel?

764
01:21:33,251 --> 01:21:34,251
Samuel!?

765
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,400
Samuel!

766
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,680
Samuel!

767
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,360
Sir, please wake up!

768
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,920
Come on. Please hurry!

769
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,520
Help me!

770
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,520
Samuel!

771
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:20,521
Samuel!

772
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,200
Joseph!

773
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,800
Joseph!

774
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,040
Thank you.

775
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,840
<i>No signal</i>

776
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,118
I'm dying.

777
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,153
No, this was preordained long before
either of us were beforn.

778
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,678
It wasn't a doorway that opened, it
was a window that was closing.

779
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,673
11:11 was the time it could be stopped.

780
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,120
- Stop what?
- The end. Rapture.

781
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,760
Me.

782
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:42,191
Be careful of a wolf in sheep's clothing.
A man of sin will come at the power of Satan.

783
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,760
He will use all kinds of power, including
miraculous and wonderful signs.

784
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,160
But they will be lies and trickery.

785
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,640
- But we stopped it, I saved you.
- You found your purpose, brother.

786
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,830
<i>- I have no purpose.
- Your purpose?</i>

787
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,000
<i>You're the one who said to
find Synchronicity in your life.</i>

788
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:00,120
<i>Maybe being here in Spain is my purpose.
Protecting my brother, maybe that's my purpose.</i>

789
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:05,280
They have many different names, some call them
Midwayers, messengers, angels.

790
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:10,110
God brings into this world,
Satan tries to pervert it.

791
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,834
- What if they're angels?
- I told you, don't look for meaning where there is none.

792
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,670
If something is trying to get your attention, it's not holy.
These "Midwayers", they're demonic.

793
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,997
They were never warning us, Joseph.
They were warning you.

794
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,232
My brother, Joseph, sacrificed his life for mine.

795
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,720
He stood in the way of Javier's blade,

796
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,640
risking all he'd worked for, all he had built.
For me.

797
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,040
- What is this? This isn't a Bible.
- It soon will be.

798
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:39,995
Something you are very much a part of, brother.
A new Bible, a new religion.

799
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,476
You are the Apostle.
I'm just a carpenter.

800
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,405
No ... No!

801
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,280
- I see you can walk.
- Let's call it a miracle.

802
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,159
It's not real.

803
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:02,070
Neither was the talking snake, or the man
who parted water ... not anymore.

804
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,200
Your legend will live on to the end of time.

805
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,880
Thanks for this.

806
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,160
This will be the first scripture.
The genesis to the end.

807
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,680
Your death will give me the spotlight.

808
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,600
This book, will give me your legion of followers.

809
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:24,400
And these ... gospels ...
will make them believers.

810
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,400
<i>The Book of Sadie</i>

811
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,720
No!

812
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,240
- Looks like a diary.
- It's a gospel, according to me.

813
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,392
You of all people should know the
importance of power of a book.

814
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,000
<i>God is dead, or maybe he was never alive.</i>

815
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,600
Your writing's a lot more important
than you may think.

816
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:45,600
- I read somewhere that you don't like using computers.
- For success with the writing.

817
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,837
I hope you're still writing I've just come out
of a meeting. I pitched them your diary.

818
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,793
- Is this your new book?
- This looks to me like a bestseller.

819
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,200
I write dime store thrillers.

820
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,280
You have a legion of followers that would disagree with you.

821
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,999
You're a famous author with legions of fans.

822
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,999
Perhaps you can lend us some of you loyal readers to the cause.

823
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,673
What if God is real,
and my brother a ... prophet.

824
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,840
We all must make sacrifices.

825
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,400
What will your sacrifice to God be?

826
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,400
Who are you?
What are you?

827
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,520
I am the end.

828
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,477
<i>To those of you who don't know me, I'm Joseph Crone.</i>

829
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,276
<i>And to those of you who do, my loyal readers
around the world, millions of you,</i>

830
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,480
<i>made my books bestsellers.</i>

831
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,760
<i>I have something very important
to tell you all.</i>

832
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,200
<i>For years I criticized religion.</i>

833
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,912
<i>I rejected the existence of God.
But I was wrong.</i>

834
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,598
<i>I've been awakened</i>

835
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,679
<i>And I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that not only does God exists,</i>

836
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,351
<i>but my brother, Samuel, is one of his chosen ones.</i>

837
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,519
<i>He's a savior, he's a saint, a messenger.</i>

838
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,349
<i>I wanted to post this video
because tomorrow is 11/11/11,</i>

839
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,632
<i>and something remarkable is going to happen.
I don't know what it is.</i>

840
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,600
<i>But if something were to happen to my brother or to me,</i>

841
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,800
<i>I wanted to make sure you knew the truth.</i>

842
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,200
<i>- We're not alone
- Welcome!</i>

843
