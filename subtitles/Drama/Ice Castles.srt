0
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,636
- Hey, Dad. I'm back.
- Hey.

1
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,032
- I'm starving. What you doing?
- Next year's planting.

2
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,515
I'm trying to figure out
whaùs the best cash crop. Trying to.

3
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,797
Every year it gets harder
to outsmart the market.

4
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,232
- So, how was the pond?
- It was good.

5
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,633
Listen, I've been thinking about graduation.

6
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,154
- Yeah. I haven't.
- Yeah, well, I know that.

7
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,275
We gotta start thinking
about what colleges...

8
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,349
Nick is coming home.

9
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,432
Okay. And what does that have to do
with college?

10
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,354
Nick goes to college and he's home
for a pick-up game tonight at the rink.

11
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,477
When you go to college, you're supposed
to stay there until you darn well graduate.

12
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,711
Do you wanna come? I think I'm gonna try
to get a little practise in beforehand.

13
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,358
Well, that I wouldn't miss for the world.

14
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,834
You got to pull in tighter
if you're gonna turn that into a triple.

15
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,239
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,315
There he is. Nick Peterson,
last year's Eastern MVP.

17
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,111
- Too bad nobody saw it.
- You saw it.

18
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,315
Who cares?

19
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,836
Back from Michigan State
for a potential career-ending injury

20
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,992
in a few pick-up games with his boyfriends.

21
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,670
Do you still skate like a girl or what?

22
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,315
Yeah. And you know, now we actually wear
dresses at Michigan State.

23
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,037
Thaùs my boy, I think. You want a coffee?

24
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,109
- Sure.
- You actually came.

25
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,270
Yeah. I gotta show these boys
a thing or two.

26
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,396
- You bring your homework?
- With you here, are you kidding me?

27
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,268
- Are you learning anything besides hockey?
- No, 'cause I'm going pro.

28
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,670
Hey, so was that a double or triple
you just did?

29
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,239
- Triple.
- What?

30
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,276
- All right, everybody, clear the ice.
- All right.

31
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,433
Everybody off the ice. Thank you.
But you're all welcome to stick around

32
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,308
for the Ashton's pick-up game,
but we need everybody off the ice right now.

33
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,435
Thank you.

34
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,270
The lowa Invitational Junior Championships
are in Cedar Rapids this weekend.

35
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,716
Yeah. I saw the posters for it.
You want to go?

36
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,792
- I want you to sign up.
- Yeah, right.

37
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,952
You've been skating since you can walk.
You're darn good.

38
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,031
Maybe iùs time you showed someone.

39
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,315
- Whaùs the point?
- The point is I know my sister.

40
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,598
She always thought you could do more
than skate around that darn pond. Compete.

41
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,474
I just do it for fun now.

42
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,949
We can use the programme
we used for Christmas,

43
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,110
the one your mother played.

44
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,118
But I don't wanna do it.

45
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,719
Come on! Lùll give me a chance
to cheer you on for a change.

46
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,434
Hey.

47
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,751
- Hey.
- Come on.

48
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,594
- Hey, leùs play. Come on.
- All right, leùs go. Marco!

49
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,629
- Polo.
- Marco.

50
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,758
- Marco.
- Polo.

51
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,876
Come on. You'll have fun if you go.

52
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,388
- You're gonna be at school, though.
- I know.

53
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,232
But I'll come back.

54
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,268
- Marco!
- Polo. You took it off.

55
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,072
- Hey, you're going.
- No.

56
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,149
- Yes, you are.
- Hey.

57
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,596
- Yes, you are.
- Give it back.

58
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,758
You're gonna regret it if you don't go.

59
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,829
- All right.
- Yeah?

60
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,351
- I haven't been to Cedar Rapids in a while.
- Thaùs my girl.

61
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is someone very special here today.

62
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,954
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is someone very special here today.

63
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,318
Leùs give a big Cedar Rapids welcome
to Olympic silver medallist Aiden Reynolds!

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,515
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm all right.

65
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,114
- Are you having fun yet?
- I'm nervous.

66
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,192
- Keep breathing.
- She's really good.

67
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,710
Scores for Carol Sanders. Technical, 39.92.

68
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,916
Components, 38.88.
For a composite score of 78.80.

69
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,752
Our next competitor, representing
Ice Castle Skating Club in Windsor, Iowa,

70
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,638
is Lexi Winston!

71
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,631
That explains her outfit.

72
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,232
Have fun, okay?

73
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,235
- Hey. I love you.
- I love you, too.

74
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,118
I didn't know
she was gonna skate to this piece.

75
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,233
Your mom would have been so proud,
so proud.

76
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,118
- Scores for Miss Winston. Technical...
- You did great.

77
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,872
...30.25.
- You did it.

78
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,517
Components, 41. 76.

79
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,792
- Oh, come on. Thaùs horrible.
- For a combined total of 72.01.

80
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,675
A wonderful effort nonetheless.

81
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,117
You coached that new girl, right?
Carrie something?

82
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,439
We're no longer working together.

83
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,073
- I take it you haven't competed much.
- She was great.

84
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,470
I didn't say she wasn't,
but everything she was doing was level one.

85
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,195
With the right training, hard work,
and a higher profile,

86
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,840
I think you could be a serious competitor.

87
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,195
- I just skate for fun.
- It showed.

88
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,556
- Think how much fun you'd have if you won.
- She did just fine.

89
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,436
She could do better. You owe it to yourself.

90
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,516
There's a whole world out there.

91
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,670
Wouldn't it be nice to see
how far you can go?

92
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,990
Mr Winston, your daughter is
a natural on the ice.

93
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,911
I'm guessing she's a bit late in the game,

94
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,958
but she's also got the strength and poise
the younger girls don't have.

95
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,713
- She can land a triple.
- Thaùs good.

96
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,791
But skating today is a total package,

97
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,919
athleticism, emotion, and glamour.
Lexi's got two out of three.

98
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,759
It may sound cynical,
but thaùs just the way it is.

99
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,593
- You really want to coach me?
- Regionals are coming up.

100
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,990
There's barely enough time to train,
but I'm willing to give it a shot.

101
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,957
Are you? Iùs your life.

102
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,312
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

103
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,279
- You train at Boston Memorial Rink, right?
- I do.

104
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
If I don't hear from you by tomorrow,
I'll move on.

105
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,109
- My dad will be all by himself.
- Your daÔs a sharp guy, I think he'll survive.

106
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,552
- Look, I gotta get going.
- He hasn't been alone since my mom died.

107
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,076
You planning on living with your dad
for the rest of your life?

108
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,878
What about us?

109
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,916
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm not moving in with him.

110
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,878
- I'm serious.
- You and me, we're like a rock.

111
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,593
And plus I'm gonna be at school
most of the time.

112
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,231
Which reminds me, if I don't get going
right now, I'm gonna drive off the road.

113
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,758
- But you'll miss me too much.
- Well, maybe.

114
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,398
You know I always miss you
when you're out of sight.

115
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,393
And we'll see each other in a few weeks
when you come down for our first game.

116
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,950
You know, iùs kind of exciting, you and me,

117
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,114
famous Red Wings star and world...
Hey, Olympic champion figure skater.

118
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,991
- Think fast.
- Nick. Stop!

119
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,356
Oh, my God, you are dead. You are dead.

120
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,833
You must be Lexi.

121
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,309
You're gonna have to work on closing
your mouth when entering the hotel.

122
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,439
- Sorry. Iùs just that...
- I know. Iùs just all too much.

123
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,312
Just wait.

124
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,590
We are part of the hotel,
but we're just kind of off by ourselves.

125
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,236
- Everybody's really nice.
- Hi.

126
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,029
- But you're the new girl, so...
- Oh, iùs her.

127
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,997
- Hey.
- Oh, please.

128
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,274
Everybody has their own room.

129
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,158
We eat in the slum section
of one of the hotel coffee shops.

130
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,629
And don't even think about escaping
into town for a good dinner

131
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,233
because you're gonna be working
all the time.

132
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,596
We have the workout room,
aerobics, strength, stretch.

133
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,831
- Big deal for Mr Reynolds.
- Does everyone here train with him?

134
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,593
No, there are several coaches
that use Boston Club as a base.

135
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,955
So whaùs the big deal about Carrie Turner?

136
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,917
You don't get a lot of news in Idaho, huh?

137
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,797
- Iowa.
- Same difference.

138
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,553
Carrie jumped ship last week
to train with Frank Carroll,

139
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,438
right after she took first
in the Colorado Invitational.

140
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,318
Coach is pretty bent up about it,
so I'm not sure I'd bring it up.

141
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,277
We have two full-time physical trainers.

142
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,069
They also do massage,
so if you pull something, it gets fixed fast.

143
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,798
Not a lot of wasted time.

144
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,029
And some ballet.

145
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,558
One and two and three and four and five
and six and seven and eight...

146
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,519
Hey, look, I know you're from Ohio
or somewhere, but this is real life, okay?

147
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,431
You want to do something,
you want to get somewhere?

148
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,795
This is your chance. Don't blow it.

149
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,791
...Seven. Eight. Heads up. One.

150
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,639
Come on, Bret!

151
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,789
Hit it.

152
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,594
Go, Peterson!

153
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,913
Look, if you want this thing,

154
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,279
you gotta get there!

155
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,077
Get your man. Get your man.
Peterson, you got him.

156
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,754
Nice. Nice.

157
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,993
Turn it back up. Turn it back up.

158
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,793
- Nice hustle.
- There you go.

159
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,394
- Hey! Yeah!
- Come on, Peterson. High five!

160
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,714
The coach is only as good
as his best skater.

161
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,109
He needs a new star and he's hoping
somebody he's working with here

162
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,918
- is gonna emerge.
- Emerge?

163
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,719
Yeah. A star to show she can take them
all the way.

164
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,995
- All the way where?
- Nationals. Worlds.

165
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,149
Seriously?

166
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,277
Good morning, ladies. Welcome to Boston.
Leùs get to it.

167
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,315
- And, Lexi...
- You have to step up!

168
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,034
...you see those girls out there?
Those coaches?

169
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,238
How you take the ice right now,
the first time,

170
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,958
is gonna go a long way in determining

171
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,316
whether iùs you or them
skating here after regionals.

172
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,798
Did you see that?

173
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,475
- She's replacing Carrie?
- She is.

174
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,871
And we're off.

175
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,795
Thaùs cute.

176
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,912
Hey, you. So I scored two goals today.

177
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,035
- Really?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,109
Thaùs awesome.

179
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,111
- How's it going out there?
- Good.

180
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,716
Iùs kind of strange, but iùs great.

181
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,757
It just takes a little getting used to,
you know.

182
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,550
Mr Reynolds is a really great coach, though.
I had no idea I could skate like this.

183
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,712
We're both on the way up.

184
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,239
So I'm really looking forward
to my first game so I can finally see you.

185
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,316
To tell you the truth,
I actually might not stay at school too long.

186
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,119
If everything goes the way it looks,
I might get drafted early.

187
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,349
Thaùs great.

188
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,638
Nick Peterson!

189
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,034
Well, I miss you.

190
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,636
Three and four and five and...

191
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,352
Okay, those turns need to be clean. Deeper.

192
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,119
More upper body. Come on, more drama.

193
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,993
You need to be at least level three
if you wanna be competitive.

194
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,116
You've got regionals
in less than three weeks.

195
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,192
I want you going over these sequences
every waking moment.

196
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,919
Four, five, six...

197
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
More drama! Thaùs it! Thaùs level three!

198
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,749
You gotta get there to be in the top four,
otherwise you don't move on.

199
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,474
Good. No, iùs looking better.

200
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,199
All right. Okay. Give us...
Just go over it one more time.

201
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,913
Hey, iùs Lexi. I'm probably skating, but
if you leave me a message, I'll call you back.

202
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,875
- Hey, guys. Come here. Iùs Carrie.
- Oh, my God.

203
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,439
Carrie is back.

204
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,952
Carrie!

205
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,759
- Maybe she came back to say goodbye.
- I doubt it. Just wait here.

206
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,471
Call a break? You should be practising.
Go. Practise. Go. Go. Go.

207
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,000
- What are you doing here?
- Thaùs the new girl?

208
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,399
Yeah, Lexi Winston.

209
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,994
- I hear she's competing week after next.
- Yeah, she is.

210
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,828
Now watch your location.

211
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,434
Talent pool is a little slim these days, huh?

212
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,749
- Careful. Iùs slippery out there.
- Make that turn. Just get up. Come on.

213
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,355
Good luck.

214
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,957
Don't worry about it, Lex.

215
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,553
Thaùs good work for today. She's all yours.

216
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,314
- Excuse me?
- We've got to create a buzz.

217
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,039
I want the whole skating world to know
you're a force to be reckoned with.

218
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,669
- Hey, you.
- Hey. What time is it?

219
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,754
I don't know.

220
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm having a serious affair
with your voicemail these days.

221
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,117
I know. I'm sorry. I had a lot of practise
and then Coach sent me shopping.

222
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,035
Shopping? I guess I could see how you
can't find time to answer my messages, huh?

223
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,193
Well, I'm sorry. I just haven't had time.

224
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,679
What the heck's that noise?

225
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,637
I'm getting my hair done.

226
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,312
I thought you're there to skate, Lex.

227
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,356
- But, Nick...
- You know...

228
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,634
I don't know, this sounds like bull to me.

229
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,358
You know, I gotta practise
in a couple of hours, Lex.

230
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,714
I can barely hear you.

231
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,789
What?

232
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,872
- Yeah, exactly. I gotta run.
- Wait, Nick...

233
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,429
Wonderful. I love you. You're beautiful.
You're great.

234
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,876
Oh, good. There you go.
Just one more smile for me. Thank you.

235
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,431
Perfect. Good. Now, spin, turn. Pose, smile.

236
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,919
Oh, get that out of your face. Okay. Good.
Teeth. Very nice.

237
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,792
I think we have it.

238
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,239
- Danny.
- Yes, sir?

239
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,989
Do me a favour, love...

240
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,514
- Do you want me to keep them all apart?
- Yes.

241
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,833
Is it awful?

242
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,876
Awful? No. Iùs not awful.

243
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,919
Believe me, it is a far cry

244
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,595
from anything but beautiful.

245
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,796
- This is Lexi Winston, my newest skater.
- Miss Lexi! Miss Lexi.

246
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,029
- Lexi.
- Do you think she'll make it to sectionals?

247
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,429
- Isn't Carrie Turner favoured?
- I wish her only the best,

248
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080
but I'm very excited about
Miss Winston's regional debut.

249
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,678
Dad. Aunt Jane.

250
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,834
- You guys made it.
- You couldn't have kept us away.

251
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,717
- Hi, Mr Winston. How are you doing?
- Good. Thank you.

252
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,916
Jane.

253
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,115
Bad or good?

254
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,112
Who is this incredibly
beautiful young woman here?

255
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,789
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

256
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,396
- Lexi, hurry. We're up next.
- Lexi, leùs go.

257
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,993
- Okay.
- Come on.

258
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,752
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

259
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,189
- She's all grown up.
- Performance makeup.

260
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,349
Come on.

261
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,310
- Yes! Yes!
- Scores for Ms Turner.

262
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,598
Technical, 63.8. Components, 64.6.

263
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,831
For a combined first place total of 128.4.

264
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,274
Be careful. Iùs slippery out there.

265
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,235
- She's trying to rattle you.
- Yeah, well, I'm rattled enough as it is.

266
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,914
Well, shut it out. You can do this.

267
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,911
Hey, Lexi, skate the programme
and you'll be fine.

268
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,754
You're better than she is. Okay?

269
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,949
Our next skater this evening,
representing the Boston Skating Club,

270
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,679
Boston, Massachusetts, Lexi Winston.

271
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,829
Yes!

272
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,159
You see?

273
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,838
- Wow!
- Sweetie, you were fantastic.

274
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,797
That was so... So good.

275
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,591
The scores for Ms Winston.
Technical, 49. 15.

276
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,391
Components, 71. 18.
For a combined total of 120.33,

277
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,393
putting her solidly in second place
and on her way to sectionals.

278
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,518
You did it. You did it.

279
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,477
- Is this really your first competition?
- Are you guys together?

280
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,391
How long have you been training
with Aiden Reynolds?

281
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,392
- Where'd you find this gem, Aiden?
- On a pond in lowa.

282
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,515
- Is she your new Carrie Turner?
- Do you think she has what it takes?

283
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,589
What do you think?

284
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,671
I think I'd like to do a story on her
in Skating magazine.

285
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,036
- All right. Absolutely.
- That was a great run, Lexi.

286
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,357
You ever pull a stunt like that again
and you're out.

287
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,516
- What?
- You don't add,

288
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,160
change or place a jump unless I tell you to.

289
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,755
I tell you to do a triple, you do a triple.
I don't, you don't.

290
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,389
- I knew I could do it and I did it.
- It was sloppy.

291
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,712
- I placed second.
- Well, you think you know something

292
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,189
because you've been doing this
a little while?

293
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,035
You don't.
You need to always skate the programme.

294
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,917
I have calculated every point,

295
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,878
and competition is not the time
to throw in something untrained.

296
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,839
- I'm sorry.
- This is your job and mine,

297
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,798
and if you don't want to do it,
go home with your dad right now.

298
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,431
Please just let me stay.

299
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,395
Go. Go say goodbye to your family.

300
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,796
Hey, Nick. Iùs me.

301
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,108
We seem to keep missing each other.

302
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,315
Busy schedules.
But we knew that would happen.

303
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,954
I miss you.

304
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,148
After regionals, it seems more than usual.

305
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,950
I can't wait to come to your game.

306
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,990
I miss you. I already said that.

307
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,520
Call me back. Bye.

308
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,034
Lover boy?

309
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,430
He scored a goal at practise.

310
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,550
You better not let coach catch you
talking on the phone.

311
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,437
He wants you here 150%.

312
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,753
- I barely talk to him.
- Yeah, well, barely is better than never,

313
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,229
which is how it usually ends up.

314
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,479
We haven't seen each other in so long.

315
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,028
With all thaùs happened,
do you really miss him that much?

316
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,511
What are you talking about?
I never thought I'd make it to sectionals.

317
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,035
Maybe I could change my flight,
then I'd only miss a few practises.

318
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,348
Good luck.

319
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,596
Hey, iùs Lexi. I'm probably skating, but if
you leave me a message, I'll call you back.

320
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,753
Hey, I got you a really good seat
right by the tunnel,

321
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,869
so I'll give you a wave when I come out.

322
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,112
And I look forward to seeing you
tomorrow night.

323
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,960
- Whaùs the matter?
- Nothing.

324
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,269
What?

325
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,957
- How do you know?
- Please.

326
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,878
I'm supposed to go to Michigan
for Nick's first game.

327
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,837
You've got sectionals coming up.

328
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,708
- I'd only miss two days of practise.
- I thought we had this conversation.

329
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,112
Truman, Eliot, you're up. Change!

330
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,229
Push! Push!

331
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,875
Peterson, get in there.

332
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,795
Well, thaùs it, folks.

333
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,031
A warm round of applause
for another Michigan State victory.

334
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,037
Congratulations, team.

335
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,149
Hey.

336
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,075
Iùs me. I'm so sorry.

337
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,632
I really wanted to be there.
I did everything I could.

338
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,108
I'm sure you did great. You always do.

339
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,792
So, Ms Winston, do you have a boyfriend?

340
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,952
- I do. He's a hockey player at Michigan State.
- Excuse me.

341
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,317
- Sure you want that on record?
- Why not?

342
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,753
I don't know.
Something happens between you two...

343
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,353
- We're fine.
- I'm sure you are,

344
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,795
but a little mystery never hurt either.

345
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,435
So have you got your story straight?

346
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,396
I'm with Lexi Winston
who can barely contain her excitement.

347
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,152
First major competition...

348
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,395
So doing this well, do you have goals now?
Have your goals changed?

349
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,077
No one even knew your story. You came in.
You had grown up in lowa,

350
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,709
skating on ponds, as you say.
Did you dream about a day like this?

351
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,916
Iùs fun to be recognised.

352
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,834
Media darling Lexi Winston is taking
the ice skating world by storm.

353
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,797
- Very nice to meet you.
- You know, you always dream about it,

354
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,474
but you never really think
that iùs gonna happen.

355
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,516
How do you handle that pressure?

356
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,550
I don't think of it as pressure.
I think of it as excitement.

357
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,873
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

358
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,390
- This is so awesome.
- Turn to page 25.

359
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,392
Oh, my God.

360
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,517
- I told you iùd be worth it.
- This is amazing.

361
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,910
This is so cool! This is awesome!

362
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,434
- Read the cover.
- Oh, God.

363
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,593
- "Lexi Winston, from lowa to l-oh-wow."
- "To l-oh-wow."

364
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,196
Did you get the magazine?

365
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,789
Yup.

366
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,392
You're like a celebrity now.

367
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,110
I kind of am. Iùs crazy.

368
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,633
What happened to you?

369
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,152
Nothing. I'm just sore.

370
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,557
I have sectionals next weekend.

371
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,238
What about Thanksgiving?

372
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,717
Well, I was hoping maybe
you could come here to Boston.

373
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,355
I thought you were coming here to Michigan.

374
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,079
- I can't, I have practise.
- Yes. So do I.

375
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,158
Well, I want to see you.

376
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,795
- Why does it say you're single?
- What?

377
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,636
The magazine says you're single.

378
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,076
That wasn't me. That was Aiden.

379
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,516
He said that I should probably
just try to keep us quiet.

380
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,715
You kidding me, Lex?

381
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,513
Nick, you know what?
We knew this was gonna be hard and it is.

382
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,479
It stinks, but we said we would make it work.
We said we would make it happen.

383
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,120
Yeah, well, look, iùs not working.

384
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,959
You know we haven't seen each other
in a really long time

385
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,393
and we haven't talked at all,

386
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,948
and every time I do talk to you,
you're not even there.

387
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,508
I can't help it. I'm doing the best I can.

388
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,875
You can't help being a different person?

389
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,754
- I'm trying.
- Maybe we should just take a break.

390
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,832
This isn't working.

391
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,798
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

392
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,553
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I said I'm fine, okay?

393
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,349
So thaùs it?

394
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,835
I didn't get recruited to get my butt kicked
for nothing. I'm good enough to play.

395
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,990
Sorry you see it that way.

396
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,072
Don't think I'm gonna beg you
to stick around.

397
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,711
I've got a winning team here.

398
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,394
So as far as I can see,
you're doing me a favour.

399
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,916
- Sit.
- Are you kidding me?

400
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,237
The only way I'm getting on this
is if I'm driving.

401
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
- You know how?
- I'm from lowa.

402
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,715
Hold on.

403
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,040
Boy, you're full of surprises.

404
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,917
You don't know the half of it.

405
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,230
Are you concerned about her, though,
as you get ready for sectionals?

406
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,956
I don't think so. I'm just... I can take it
in stride, and I'm working really hard

407
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,429
and I have full confidence
going into sectionals. So...

408
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,670
So you don't feel like you have to look
over your shoulder at her?

409
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,716
- No, definitely not.
- Okay, good luck.

410
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,835
Thank you very much.

411
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,235
- Lexi!
- Hi, Lexi!

412
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,675
Aiden, do you think
Ms Winston has a shot at nationals?

413
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,875
We wouldn't be here if I didn't.

414
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,952
But do you think she's skating
well enough to beat Carrie Turner?

415
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,996
I think Ms Winston can beat
anyone competing today.

416
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,992
What about regionals,
a little bit of beginner's luck there maybe?

417
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,036
No. Pure talent and hard work.

418
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,669
Hey, Lexi, are the rumours true?
Is there a romance brewing?

419
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,113
I don't comment on my personal life,
but thank you.

420
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,837
Facing one of the more interesting
challenges in her career,

421
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,151
Carrie Turner is delivering
the best performance we've seen.

422
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,879
I have to agree.
Now, the unknown element this evening

423
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,669
is Lexi Winston, who came in a close second
in the regionals,

424
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,228
who can possibly top
her second place finish here.

425
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,791
Let me tell you something, she is
skating absolutely flawlessly this evening.

426
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,836
Our next competitor, representing Boston
Skating Club in Boston, Massachusetts,

427
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,797
is Lexi Winston.

428
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,998
Lexi! Lex!

429
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,914
Amazing.

430
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,835
The scores for Miss Winston.

431
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,150
- Nick? Nick, wait.
- Technical, 70. 1.

432
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:58,959
Components, 81.3.
For a combined total of 151.4.

433
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,832
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a new sectionals champion, Lexi Winston.

434
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,472
Lexi! Lexi, right here, please.

435
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,959
Aiden! Aiden!

436
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,112
Turn around, just...

437
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,957
Lexi, you look amazing.

438
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,513
You okay?

439
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,591
Aiden, I'm nervous.

440
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,117
But thaùs just so great. Iùs all new, exciting.

441
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,433
Leùs get to work.

442
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,351
- Aiden, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

443
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,919
- Please, introduce us.
- How are you?

444
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,911
- Of course, Diane, this is Lexi Winston.
- Hi.

445
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,630
You are just fantastic.
Aiden's lucky to have found you.

446
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,756
- Lexi, you are adorable...
- So where?

447
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,398
Your future is limitless, my dear.

448
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,710
- Monday morning, your office, 8:00 a. M?
- Absolutely.

449
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,995
Thaùs just an astounding performance.

450
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,150
The sky's the limit for you, dear.

451
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,798
- You all right?
- Yeah.

452
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,114
Aiden, I want first dibs
for our New Year's show for next year.

453
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,189
You promised me.

454
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,556
You know how we feel about your show,
Eddie, but Ice Capades is very interesting.

455
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,596
You are just darling.

456
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,910
Excuse me one second.

457
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,950
- What was that?
- Can we just go?

458
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,435
Honey, do you have any idea
who these people are?

459
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,318
What they could do for you?

460
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,515
I know, but...

461
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,431
He is a big time ice show producer.

462
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,354
If he likes you, you'll work year-round
as long as you can skate. Trust me.

463
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,477
Show that smile of yours,
he's gonna love you.

464
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,472
Look, you've got maybe
a couple good years in this business.

465
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,998
Right now, you're an entertainer. We all are.
Think I like this?

466
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,959
Can we just go somewhere? Just us.

467
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,077
Yeah, okay, we will. We will.
Just give me one minute, okay,

468
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,392
just talk to this producer, then we'll go,
okay? Be right back.

469
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,831
- Hello.
- Hey, Daddy.

470
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,391
Well, hello, sweetheart. How are you doing?

471
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,074
Good. No, everything's fine.

472
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,949
Well, sounds like that means
we won't be seeing you.

473
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,388
Well, we still have a lot to do

474
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,597
and Aiden says
we have to get ready for nationals.

475
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,475
- Daddy.
- What is it, sweetheart?

476
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,671
This might be a funny question,
but do you think I'm all right?

477
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,716
Well, no, I think you're the most
wonderful person in the world,

478
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,268
but I'm not sure that I follow you.

479
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,879
Me, neither.

480
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,672
Say, maybe what you need to do is come
home, you know, for a little bit and just...

481
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,875
If only. I'm sorry I'm not there, Daddy.

482
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,033
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

483
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,875
Hey, listen, whatever you, you know, need to
do or want to do, I'm there for you, okay?

484
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,069
Thanks.

485
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,239
I'm your dad.

486
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,519
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, honey.

487
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,037
I'll talk to you soon.

488
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,319
Who is that?

489
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,315
Aiden.

490
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,434
Can you say "desperate for attention?"

491
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,033
- Lexi!
- Lexi!

492
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,270
Lexi! Baby, don't move.

493
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,432
Call an ambulance!
Somebody call an ambulance!

494
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,077
Why can't I see?

495
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,588
No, I don't... I don't remember.

496
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,319
Lexi, you bumped your head, and they think

497
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,709
you've got, they think
you've got a concussion.

498
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,791
You had an accident.
You took a fall at the lake.

499
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,075
Everything's gonna be all right.

500
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,472
Go back three slices.
Well, her tests are consistent.

501
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,629
And thaùs a good thing?

502
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,190
Once these things plateau,
iùs rare to see improvement,

503
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,271
but this light perception she has will remain.

504
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,555
So you're saying this is it?

505
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,395
There are always miracles, new discoveries.
The brain is complex and unpredictable.

506
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,153
The fact that she can see some light
will certainly help her.

507
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,468
What next?

508
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,638
Go home.

509
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,193
Help her adjust to being blind,
get back to some sense of normalcy.

510
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,635
- This is gonna be a big adjustment for her.
- Yeah.

511
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,153
And for you.

512
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,193
I spoke to the press.

513
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,589
I still don't understand
why iùs any of their business.

514
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,272
I told them she broke her arm.

515
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,954
The doctors are keeping quiet.
That should buy us some time,

516
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,715
at least until nationals, and by then
they'll be on to other stories, so...

517
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,640
In the meantime, you can relax and lay low
back in lowa, and we'll see what happens.

518
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,673
I can't see.

519
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,516
- Iùs over.
- No, no.

520
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,877
- The doctor said there's a chance.
- A chance?

521
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,480
Are you saying that for me or for you?

522
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,919
I don't even know why you're here any more.

523
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,310
- Hey.
- Just leave me alone. Iùs over.

524
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,473
No. No. No, Lexi. Iùs not over.

525
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,996
You love skating and winning.

526
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:25,558
Nationals are coming, and then the season
is gonna be over and iùll start up again.

527
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,876
You'll find yourself a new skater
and she'll win gold for you.

528
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,396
Thaùs all you ever wanted.

529
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,270
Please just go.

530
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,039
Aiden, just go.

531
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,639
Well, the big question in
the figure skating world right now,

532
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,676
what happened to Lexi Winston?

533
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,550
What we hear is that Lexi broke her arm
at a non-competition event,

534
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,677
but there seems to be more to it
since it can't be confirmed.

535
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,196
There has been no press conference,
no calls answered.

536
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,434
In fact, Lexi has virtually disappeared
from the scene. Mysterious, to say the least.

537
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,951
They said it wasn't gonna snow,
but it sure doesn't feel that way.

538
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,553
I wouldn't know.

539
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,239
Whaùs that?

540
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,757
I said I wouldn't know.

541
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,750
Come on. You can smell it in the air.
I know you can.

542
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,469
I should have never gone to Boston.

543
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:52,760
Lexi. Stop listening to your mind
telling you what you don't have

544
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,637
and what you should have done.

545
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,951
Leùs just focus on whaùs here
and right now.

546
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,395
Just try and feel the ground.

547
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,471
I couldn't be more proud of you.
You know that, don't you?

548
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,634
All I know is that I'm stuck here in
the middle of nowhere, in the dark.

549
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,280
- Thaùs very helpful.
- Iùs true.

550
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,871
Probably be stuck here forever.

551
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,110
Listen, before you left here
a few months ago, this wasn't nowhere.

552
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,512
In fact, it was a place that you had
a hard time leaving. Remember that?

553
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,919
- There, there.
- Remember that?

554
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,877
Welcome home, cutie.

555
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,078
Hey. How was your sleep?

556
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,108
Okay.

557
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,954
Good. So I'm going out in a bit,

558
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,555
and I could use the company.

559
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,915
No, thanks.

560
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,117
Come on, Lex.
Why don't you come out for a bit?

561
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,438
Ask Aunt Jane to go.

562
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,555
Okay.

563
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,117
Hot chocolate? With whipped cream.

564
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,394
I'm fine.

565
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,395
Iùs beautiful out there today.

566
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,517
Colder than cold, but at least iùs not windy.

567
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,434
We could go for a walk later.
You could use the exercise.

568
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,794
No, thanks.

569
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,118
Iùs been weeks, honey.
The girls have been asking about you.

570
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,033
What did you tell them?

571
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,360
Nothing. But everyone's gonna find out
sooner or later.

572
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,234
- So where is she?
- In her room.

573
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,155
You're down here watching television,
she's upstairs in her room doing what?

574
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,993
I don't know.
I've read to her, I've talked to her.

575
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,438
You know, what is the point
of you coming over here

576
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,795
if she's gonna be sitting upstairs by herself?

577
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,838
- I can't make her do anything.
- She's dying up there.

578
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,911
Then you do something!

579
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,672
I thought I was.

580
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,428
You know, why don't you come over? Okay.

581
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,638
All right. I've had enough of this.
Come on, leùs go.

582
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,914
- Dad.
- Come on, leùs go.

583
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,150
- Dad.
- Your mother would be ashamed of us.

584
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,071
You sitting around here
feeling sorry for yourself for so long,

585
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,798
and the fact that I actually helped you.
Come on, leùs go.

586
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,869
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.

587
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,951
Iùs lonelier in this house now
than when you were in Boston.

588
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,268
- Dad! Dad!
- Come on, leùs go!

589
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,715
- Where? Where are we going? Dad.
- Anywhere but here!

590
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,950
We are not gonna sit and rot in this house!
Come on!

591
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,558
- Here.
- Dad.

592
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,916
- Dad, I'm not ready for this.
- Sure you are. Sure you are.

593
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,192
- Iùs slippery.
- Thaùs why you're wearing skates.

594
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,636
Is the ice thick enough?

595
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,595
- We're gonna find out soon enough, I think.
- Dad.

596
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,468
I just remember when your mom and I
used to bring you out here.

597
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,390
Yeah, you weren't too interested in walking,
but you loved the feel of the ice.

598
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,119
You loved it.

599
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,149
My legs are tired.

600
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,279
Yeah. Well, come on.
Iùs just another minute. Thaùs it.

601
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,193
One foot in front of the other.
You can remember.

602
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,276
Dad. Dad, I'm just not ready.

603
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,270
When did you become such a wuss?

604
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,513
Nick? What are you doing here?

605
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:26,118
You know, I'm getting kind of tired,
and my legs are kind of beaten.

606
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,838
Iùs cold.
Why don't you... Can you help me out here?

607
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,433
No, Dad. Dad, I'll come with you.

608
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,556
What? You're gonna leave me
out here by myself, huh?

609
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,235
I said... Dad, just let me...

610
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,788
- Hey, I got you.
- I'm fine.

611
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,029
I said I'm fine.

612
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,192
Iùs my skates. Iùs my skates. I just...

613
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,316
Yeah, iùs gotta be your skates.

614
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,516
Can you help me get them off?

615
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,634
- No, get up. Get up. Get up.
- Stop it.

616
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,036
All this time, Lex,
I kept thinking to myself, "She's home.

617
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,311
"And she gets cabin fever,

618
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,638
"I guess she really doesn't want to see me."

619
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:20,034
Maybe she figured you wouldn't want
to see her after what happened.

620
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:31,156
Maybe he thought that he caused it,
and he couldn't admit it to himself.

621
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,795
Nick.

622
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,919
I'm right here.

623
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,829
Help me.

624
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,399
I'm right here.

625
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,952
- Don't let me go.
- I'm right here.

626
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,995
See? Look, look!
You can stand on your own...

627
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,550
You okay? You used to fall all the time.

628
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,555
Nick, I can't see anything.

629
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,834
Come on.

630
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,996
Just follow my voice, okay?

631
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,391
Do you think that maybe we could try
this again?

632
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,956
Skating. Skating, I mean.

633
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,871
Are you sure that no one's gonna be here?

634
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,520
Jane said the girls will be coming in
at 10:00 and we'll be out before then.

635
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,511
You can still tie up your skates.

636
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,956
Now all I have to do is skate.

637
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,913
You feel good?

638
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,556
If you're gonna skate, we gotta figure out
a way for you to see the walls.

639
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,552
Thaùs a good idea, except I'm blind.

640
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,990
I know. What I mean is,
is you're able to see light and shadow,

641
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,959
so maybe you can use that
to get a feel for the rink.

642
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,675
See, there you go. Thaùs good.

643
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,391
You're starting to get
a sense of where the wall is now?

644
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,914
- Sort of.
- All right, good.

645
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,509
- Nick? Nick?
- You're fine.

646
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,710
- Lex, turn, turn... You okay?
- Yeah.

647
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,270
Now I know why you guys wear
so much padding.

648
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,831
Skate toward me and count out loud.

649
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,879
One one thousand, two one thousand,
three one thousand, four one thousand...

650
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,313
You're halfway.

651
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,279
...five one thousand, six one thousand...
- Twenty feet, ten, five, stop. Good.

652
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,636
- No, this is too fast.
- You get 10 feet, there you go, yeah.

653
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,759
You just turned on your own! Good!
Come here. Come toward centre ice.

654
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,309
Hey, if you can balance in spread eagle,
you should be able to try a sit spin.

655
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,473
- You're crossing the blue line now.
- Don't tell me.

656
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,075
Look at that. Here, skate toward me.

657
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,758
- What was that, another blind joke?
- Hey, try a jump!

658
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,229
No.

659
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,838
Just get some air.
Whaùs the worst that could happen?

660
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,276
Well, I could fall on my butt,
hit my head and go deaf.

661
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,351
- How's that?
- Well, hand me a stick and a puck, too.

662
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,635
- Lf you can hand them over here.
- Yeah.

663
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,156
- Here you go.
- Okay.

664
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,549
And let me know when I'm at the centre
of this blue line, okay?

665
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,675
Okay.

666
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,999
Blue line!

667
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,513
I knew it.

668
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,389
I knew where it was.

669
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,391
Come with me. I want to try something.

670
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,392
- What are we doing?
- You will see. Follow me.

671
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,510
- I'm better off in the rink.
- No, no, give it a shot.

672
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,797
- I don't even know where the edges are.
- Sure you do.

673
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,036
- Come on. I'll start you.
- Keep talking.

674
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,789
Hey, don't try to see.

675
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,116
I mean, if you can't see,
maybe making the effort to do that

676
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,351
is just getting in the way
of using something else.

677
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,072
Like what?

678
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,116
The sound when I slam into the boards?

679
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,316
No. Like your memory.

680
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,351
Just close your eyes.
Just picture it in your head.

681
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,272
Lex, we've been skating on this pond
our whole lives. Nothing's changed.

682
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,318
Iùs the same shape, the same dimensions.

683
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,949
Come on. You've done this
blindfolded before. Whaùs the difference?

684
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,998
I could cheat before.

685
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,635
Iùs like lacing up your skates.

686
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,439
You know, if you think about it too much,
then you get all tangled up.

687
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,751
If you just do it, then iùs second nature.

688
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,193
There you go.

689
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,439
You're approaching the middle. You're
about a third of the way to the end, Lex.

690
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,192
- Don't tell me.
- Okay.

691
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,270
Okay. Where am I now?

692
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,389
You just told me not to tell you.

693
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,550
I know where you are. Come on.
Where do you think you are?

694
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,191
- By the stream outlet.
- Yes.

695
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,950
Look who's showing off, huh?
Watch the edge, 10 feet. Good.

696
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,716
Come on, come towards me.

697
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,833
Lex, you landed it! You okay?

698
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,478
Yeah. Yeah.

699
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,198
Thaùs incredible!

700
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,434
I felt like that even when I could see.

701
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,191
- You felt it?
- Yeah.

702
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,636
It just kind of happened. How'd it look?

703
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,953
Incredible.

704
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,708
Iùs good to see you smile, Lex.

705
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,157
- Is she ready yet?
- You should have some coffee.

706
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,516
- No, thanks. We gotta get going.
- Come on. Iùs not gonna kill you.

707
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,034
Hey, I gotta tell you, she is, you know.

708
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,509
I mean, I think
you've pulled her out of her funk.

709
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,160
And that jump, you know, that she tried.

710
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,711
I mean, if you give her another couple of
weeks and... That was a heck of a thing.

711
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,231
Well, if she could do it once,
she could do it again.

712
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,389
Well, I guess that means
you're not planning on

713
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,595
going any easier on her.

714
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,318
Oh, she's tough. She can handle it.

715
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,630
If you can just believe that
you're on the pond, you can do it.

716
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,109
I'm not promising anything.

717
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,115
Just pretend that the streamlet
is to your left and go for it.

718
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,431
Yes! You did it!

719
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,633
- Oh, rats!
- Okay, okay. Okay.

720
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,749
Lex, you're skating beautifully.

721
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,833
Nick?

722
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,114
Nick?

723
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,229
Yeah?

724
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,438
I'm so proud of you.

725
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,994
Hey, Coach. Just hoping you might have
a minute. Made a mistake.

726
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,468
I wish you could see the sunset, Lex.

727
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,988
I'd rather see your face.

728
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,112
I miss you, Nick.

729
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,475
I know you're right here, but I still miss you.

730
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,668
I'm glad you got to see me skate
at sectionals, I mean.

731
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,357
No... Don't...

732
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:06,076
Iùs too bad iùs all over, though.
The skating part, I mean. Not the other stuff.

733
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,638
- Maybe it doesn't have to be.
- Yeah, right.

734
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,754
Hey. You earned a spot at nationals.

735
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,275
- I checked. You're still registered.
- You checked?

736
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,632
I mean, yeah,
that guy called about your music.

737
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,833
You can do it.

738
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,989
Have you been thinking about this?

739
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,198
- It wouldn't work. I...
- Lex, I'm serious.

740
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,312
So am I. Iùs ridiculous.

741
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,036
Come on, iùs not that crazy.

742
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,036
You know, iùs a little bit crazy,
but why not?

743
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,475
Well, iùs one thing for her to skate
with you on the ice.

744
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,949
She's skating great on her own.

745
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,678
What difference does it make
where she skates?

746
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,954
Iùs a big difference.

747
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,873
Hey, she landed a triple.
She's skating as well as ever.

748
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,918
I don't have a programme
and I don't have a coach.

749
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,870
- But what about Jane?
- I could try, I suppose. I don't know.

750
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,839
- Do you trust me?
- Sure I do, but iùs ridiculous.

751
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,114
She can do it.

752
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,872
She skated well enough at sectionals to win.

753
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,076
She beat out everyone
in the middle of this country.

754
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,391
- She qualified for nationals.
- But they'll pity me.

755
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,353
- Yeah, they would if they knew.
- They will.

756
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,793
I don't know how they couldn't.

757
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,519
The girls in the rink have seen you skate,
they don't know.

758
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,160
- Give yourself a chance to prove...
- What?

759
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,071
...that it was all worth it.

760
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,074
Blind or not, if she could do this,
she could do anything.

761
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,108
This feels big.

762
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,558
Iùs just like ours.

763
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,756
Well, we've got as much time as we want

764
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,593
between 1:00 and 4:00 in the morning
for the next few days.

765
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,636
All right, just like home.

766
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,870
We'll count off the length
and width dimensions

767
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,349
and you enter from the centre end.

768
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,594
- So I just come straight out?
- Yeah.

769
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,510
If we start you off right, you'll be fine.
Iùll be the same count.

770
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,433
Iùs really just about balance and instinct.
Here you go, just come here,

771
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,399
come towards the centre.
Ten feet, five, you're here, good.

772
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,994
You'll start facing the entrance.

773
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,477
Here we go. And the judges will be
right over here to your left.

774
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,754
Twenty-five, ten, five.

775
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,999
- Yeah!
- Come on!

776
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,069
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah.

777
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,991
Hey. Attagirl.

778
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,353
Today's national championship
has attracted skating's royalty,

779
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,908
Michelle Kwan, five-time world champion

780
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,072
and nine-time US national champion
as well as...

781
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,317
Carrie Turner is skating beautifully
at this point in her career.

782
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,470
She's in great position
for the world championships

783
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,357
and making the Olympic team next year,

784
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,271
if she can avoid injury.

785
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,349
Lexi?

786
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,515
You look...

787
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,669
How are you?
I mean, does this mean you can...

788
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,749
No.

789
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,155
Wow, you can't tell, iùs amazing.

790
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,310
Aiden, this wasn't your fault.

791
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,151
You were my responsibility.

792
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,791
I was my responsibility.

793
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,669
But I want you to know
that I appreciate everything you did.

794
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,233
It was all worth it.

795
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,154
It was good seeing you, Lexi.

796
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,599
- No one knows.
- How would they?

797
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,589
She wants to keep it that way.

798
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,557
Kick butt out there.

799
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,833
Hey, beautiful. How you doing?

800
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,079
Just like practise, okay?

801
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,152
In this season,
she seems to have come from nowhere,

802
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,595
and then she disappeared
and now she's back.

803
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,150
Well, since sectionals,
everybody's been talking about Lexi.

804
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:47,870
The crowd adores her and there's
something real special about her skating.

805
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:53,193
There's a pureness, there's an honesty,
and she's able to emotionally connect

806
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,589
with every single person in the audience.

807
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,516
Our next competitor, representing
Ice Castle Skating Club in Windsor, Iowa,

808
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,431
is Lexi Winston.

809
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,316
She certainly skates with joy
and freedom and love,

810
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,551
and it seems to her it doesn't matter
about winning or losing,

811
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,596
but enjoying what she does.

812
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:19,719
But the question is, is she capable
of performing like that here now,

813
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,713
just coming fresh from an injury,
having absolutely no experience?

814
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,916
Can she do it now when it counts?

815
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,468
Well, I guess we'll soon find out.

816
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,549
Lexi!

817
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,075
Yeah!

818
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:28,234
Lexi! Lexi! Lexi! Lexi! Lexi!

819
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,273
Are you okay?

820
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,394
Lexi!

821
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,229
Hey, you.

822
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,718
I thought you'd never come.

823
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,756
We forgot about the bears.

824
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,073
Come on, Lex!

825
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,515
I think they know now. Come on.
