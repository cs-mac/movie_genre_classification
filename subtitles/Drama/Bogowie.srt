00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,870
<i>On January 4th 1969
Professor Jan Moll was the first</i>

2
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,790
<i>to attempt a heart transplant
in Poland</i>

3
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,870
<i>The patient died
on the operating table</i>

4
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,870
POLISH ATTEMPT HEART TRANSPLANT

5
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,870
Prof. Moll was not prepared.

6
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,590
He decided to operate without
the necessary knowledge

7
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,070
to have success.

MOLL KILLS PATIENT
ON THE OPERATING TABLE

10
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,480
Prof. Moll, did you realise

11
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,790
that a procedure
on, such a vital organ as, the heart

12
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,790
may alter the recipient's personality?

13
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,070
Maybe it was a risky choice,

14
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,230
but the only one which
gave the patient a chance to survive.

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,110
- but leaving no chance for the donor...
- He was pronounced brain dead!

16
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,910
The Poles are jealous even
of one others failures.

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,310
<i>Based on a true story</i>

18
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,310
<i>Warsaw, 1983</i>

19
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,510
35 minutes. Too long.

20
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,110
GODS
<i>- Religa.</i>

21
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,980
- What do we have?
- 42, chest pain,

22
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,230
cold extremities,
pulse 115, pressure...

23
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,470
- Let me osculate.
- Blood pressure 72/40,

24
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,270
ECG with infarction signs.

25
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,830
Acute systolic murmur.

26
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,300
We're operating! Prepare the OR,
and call the perfusionist.

27
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,790
Let's go.

28
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,310
- The old man will have your balls.
- Have you seen his coronarography?

29
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,630
- We have to open him up.
- maybe we should take him in for observation?

30
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,550
Pulse is accelerating,
the pressure's barely holding.

31
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,070
- Krysia, call the old man.

32
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Krysia, Krysia! Someone has to finish after me
in the pathology.

33
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,470
Zbyszek, What the fuck are we doing?
He doesn't stand a chance.

34
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,510
Turn that beeper up!

35
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,150
Using the pump?

36
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,630
- Where is the perfusionist?
- He's changing. - Time.

37
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,700
- Where've you been?
- In the middle of the night? At home!

38
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,230
- What's this?
- Acute mitral regurgitation.

39
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,630
- Probably.
- And the boss?

40
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,950
Krysia's trying to reach him.
We can either try to help

41
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,710
or wait till he dies.
I'll need a vein and a valve!

42
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,550
The valves are locked.

43
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,270
We can start the briefing.

44
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,910
Where is Dr. Religa?

45
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,550
The report from the night shift...

46
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,830
At 11.15 pm a patient brought in
with a myocardial infarction,

47
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,830
- a distinct murmur at the heart apex.
- A valve.

48
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,550
He didn't operate, did he?

49
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,870
The professor wants to see you.

50
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,150
So he sends coffee?

51
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,630
- Check his hourly diuresis.
- Why did you

52
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,030
decide to operate on your own?

53
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,630
I was on duty.

54
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,310
My dear colleague...

55
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,190
- In my clinic...
- He would have died.

56
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,950
- Don't interrupt!
- We couldn't reach you.

57
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,990
You've broken all the rules.
Without my consent, in ECC,

58
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,720
not to mention the break-in.

59
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,640
- I had to operate.
- Thank you.

60
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,390
So far, the patient is stable.

61
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,630
Go home and rest.

62
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,710
Someone will fill in for you.

63
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,870
What's up, Zbyszek? How was it?

64
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,070
- Ewa, what are you doing here?
- You lost your steloscope again.

65
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,630
It's called a stethoscope.
Tell me...

66
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,790
what would I do without you?

67
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't smoke, you'll lose stamina.

68
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,230
Doctor, don't make passes
at our patient.

69
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,710
- Go to sleep.
- Hang on there.

70
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,110
- Walking or riding?
- Riding.

71
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,150
Hold on.

72
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,790
I've never heard anyone in Poland
share their professional insights.

73
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,310
- Jan Moll.
- Zbigniew Religa.

74
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,550
Our guest here, assisted his brother
during the first heart transplant in the World.

75
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,750
A year later, I did it here.

76
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,230
They made history...

77
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,420
And you almost got crucified!

78
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,830
- Have you been in the U.S. for long?
- In total...

79
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,230
- two years.
- It may be more difficult for you here.

80
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,600
- Were you bored?
- Only at the end.

81
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,230
Remember how many times the DA

82
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,670
asked us to open skulls
in order to certify death,

83
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,390
and a few days later
the patient would go home?

84
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,430
- Were those miracles?
- Surgeons don't wait for miracles.

85
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,030
We have no right to experiments
which, if unsuccessful,

86
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,910
could take even a week of life away.

87
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,230
Could you cope with that?
Let's go get a drink.

88
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,990
No one else wants to go
to that shithole?

89
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,950
Will you get
your own clinic in Warsaw?

90
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,070
Staszek, I've got a family,
I won't take your clinic.

91
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,950
- You could do what you want.
- I do it anyway.

92
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,620
That's why I'm talking to you.

93
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,830
I need some fresh air.

94
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,240
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

95
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,710
Zbyszek! Zabrze is beautiful!

96
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,870
Hello.

97
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,960
Good evening.

98
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,510
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

99
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,630
- Marian Zembala, Andrzej Bochenek.
- Religa. Zbyszek.

100
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,750
Good evening.

101
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,990
- We've seen you talking to Moll, sir.
- We're on first name basis.

102
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,310
Did you talk to Moll
about transplants?

103
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,950
About rejection.

104
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,710
We've been analysing his operation.

105
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,550
- And you found it successful?
- We stopped at rejections.

106
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,550
But even that was too much.
They want to get rid of us so bad,

107
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,750
- they're sending us for internships.
- Where?

108
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,790
- England for me, Holland for him.
- Congratulations. I was in the US.

109
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,550
This is the way it is. The old are too scared,
and the young aren't allowed.

110
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,550
Just make sure you come back,
don't leave me alone with them.

111
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,230
How was the congress?

112
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,060
- We'll be done before your read it.
- Thank you, doctor.

113
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,790
- How are you Ewka?
- I'm good, Zbyszek. - Ewka!

114
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,150
- How are you feeling?
- Poorly.

115
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,750
- Where are you going?
- To get cut.

116
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,950
Do you remember, I told about those operations.
They're easy.

117
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,990
- It's something else I'm worried about.
- What is it?

118
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,350
That I'll be naked in there.

119
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,310
Don't worry, I'll close my eyes.

120
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,430
- Watch him for me.
- Watch Teddy, got it.

121
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,630
Ewa...

122
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,070
- On stage, but doesn't speak?
- A mime.

123
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,080
I thought it was a dog.
Saw.

124
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,790
What's with the silence?

125
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,190
- We're going into circulation.
- Cooling.

126
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,310
- Suction.
- Ready.

127
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,150
- Let's open the heart.

128
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,470
Hook.

129
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,110
- Oh, Ewa...
- What is it?

130
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,830
- What is it?
- Fuck!

131
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,070
Take a look.
It's not your typical TOF.

132
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,510
- The ventricle is enlarged.
- Acquired atresia.

133
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,710
- We can't do it all.
- You want to leave it?

134
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,310
- Her heart won't make it.
- We've got no choice.

135
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,150
First let's close
the ventricular defect.

136
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,390
Then widen the pulmonary valve.

137
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,790
It has to work!

138
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,070
Tweezers.

139
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,670
36 degrees. After reperfusion.

140
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,950
- The patient is warm.
- Prepare to go out of ECC.

141
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,110
- Reducing cardiac output.
- How much?

142
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,630
1.5... 1.5 litres.

143
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,270
Gently.

144
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,390
Breathing.

145
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,100
Stop circulation.

146
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,870
What's wrong? What is it?

147
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,990
Fuck... we've got hypoxia.

148
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,310
Keep working, girl. More oxygen.

149
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,190
Zbyszek... let's go back to ECC.

150
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,470
Asystole, again.
She has to manage on her own.

151
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,670
- More adrenaline!
- I can increase it, but it won't help.

152
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,110
- Do it!
- It won't help.

153
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,990
Work with me, girl!

154
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,640
Keep working!

155
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,510
Are you crazy? She could get infected,
put on new ones!

156
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,310
The missus?

157
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,030
- Excuse me?
- Did you mess up or your missus?

158
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,790
God.

159
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,390
Then let it go.

160
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,550
I can't.

161
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,310
You can't force anyone to stay.
The heart won't listen.

162
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,150
We'll see about that.

163
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,390
I didn't...

164
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,550
I didn't make any mistakes.

165
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,200
There was no other way to do it.

166
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,790
I had to try.

167
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,750
Having diagnosed pulmonary atresia,
Why didn't you stop the operation?

168
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,630
There was no other option.
What would you have done?

169
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,710
You had a variety
of options to choose from.

170
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,950
For example?

171
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,790
If you had stopped, would the patient
have survived?

172
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,030
No.

173
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,230
What was
the direct cause of death?

174
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,270
Electromechanical dissociation

175
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,950
caused by end-stage
heart damage in this disease.

176
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,230
We didn't overcome
the vascular resistance

177
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,440
due to the underdeveloped
pulmonary vessels.

178
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,750
The heart didn't start beating,
after the defects have been removed.

179
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,070
You've convinced me.

180
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,750
- But not me.
- Come on...

181
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,390
It was too late for the surgery...

182
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,550
Dr Religa didn't make any mistakes.
He had to try.

183
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,950
That girl's life
must have been unbearable.

184
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,310
The smallest effort
could have killed her.

185
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,470
Doctor, thank you for coming
to the Ethics Committee.

186
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,340
There was...

187
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,590
one solution
that could have saved her.

188
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,990
Care to enlighten us?

189
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,150
A heart transplant.

190
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,310
You must be joking.

191
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,470
You'd be willing
to experiment on a child?

192
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,070
I don't know why you,
cardiologists, think that you're gods.

193
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,230
Do you know any other way
we could've saved her?

194
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,310
I repeat:

195
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,390
we are investigating
a child's death.

196
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,550
That's right.
It was also my child... dear colleague.

197
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,510
Thank you.

198
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,630
Wait...just a second...

199
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,550
I have to go to Warsaw.
I won't be long.

200
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,750
If you go, I'll divorce you.

201
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,750
I have to.
I'll be back in the evening.

202
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,550
A very interesting case.
Let's go.

203
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,510
Professor!

204
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,390
- Good to see you're enjoying your holiday.
- I know.

205
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,150
We must launch
a heart transplant program.

206
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
Continue gentlemen, I'll catch up in a minute.

207
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,310
We've got the gear,
the people, the technology...

208
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,550
The British have positive results
with cyclosporine.

209
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,670
Let's do this!

210
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,390
- Cutting a beating heart out of...
- A body.

211
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,110
A human being.

212
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,310
It's ethically vague.

213
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,870
The world has no doubts.

214
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,470
I know that, in our country,
the heart is a relic.

215
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,310
But we both know it's a muscle.

216
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,830
Also,the cost of one transplant

217
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
equals the cost of three other
operations.

218
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,950
Three lives for one?
Can we afford it?

219
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,110
Let's save them all, Professor!

220
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,950
We don't have enough data.

221
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,910
- We could give life to many people.
- Or false hope.

222
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,800
So you rather wait for a miracle?

223
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,070
Zbyszek... in my clinic

224
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,710
there are only two ways
in which you'd perform a transplant:

225
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,230
Either after my retirement
Or after my death. Basically, the same thing.

226
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,110
Are the fish biting?

227
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,670
Yes, I'm waiting.

228
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,790
Staszek, straight to the point:
my favourite team is Gornik Zabrze...

229
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,870
I'll take that clinic.
- Excuse me ladies, this is a sudden emergency

230
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,390
I was offered my own clinic.

231
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,190
- By Sitkowski?
- No.

232
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,390
By Pasyk, in Zabrze.

233
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,790
You know what?

234
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,150
I don't like it here anymore.

235
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,390
I can't go with you.
We'll lose the apartment.

236
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,750
- I have to go.
- What about me?

237
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,670
My research, my students?
Doesn't that count?

238
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,830
You're saying I should say no?

239
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,070
- You could've asked, at least.
- I'm asking.

240
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,630
No, you're not.

241
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,550
It's one of the more disappointing
surprises in my career.

242
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,710
I don't know what I'd do
if I was offered a clinic.

243
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,760
Especially because I have one already.

244
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,230
- But I'm afraid your ambitions...
- The ambitions that you awoke

245
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,790
by sending me abroad.

246
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,790
I'm sick of answering questions whether we
operate people here or just dogs?

247
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,150
I've turned a blind eye
to many things...

248
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,790
But this is something
that might finish you off.

249
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,310
I'm officially inviting you to perform
the inaugural surgery

250
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,940
In my clinic, in Zabrze.

251
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,230
Hurry! Faster! Take him.
No pulse, we're losing him!

252
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,390
- What is it?
- A knife stab, the heart might be damaged.

253
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,670
Dark blood. Adrenaline, stat!

254
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,550
- Scalpel. - Here?
- Where else?

255
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,630
- To the OR. - Who are you?
- I was just passing by. Take my bag!

256
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,950
A stab wound.
I plugged it with my finger.

257
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,510
On the street?

258
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,470
- You're not going to leave me now are you?
- No, I'm not.

259
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,460
I'm not going with you.

260
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,430
I can't leave Krysia with the kids.

261
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,150
Romek...

262
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,630
I understand.

263
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,030
Dr Religa?

264
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,590
Yes. What's this about?

265
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,630
Are you the madman with the scalpel?

266
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,990
You can't do shit to me!
There was no other way!

267
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,640
I wanted to thank you.

268
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,070
You saved my son.

269
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,640
Thank you.

270
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,840
No problem.
Keep him away from knives.

271
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,790
- Good night.
- Good night.

272
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,430
- Are these the operating rooms?
- Will be. Work in progress.

273
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,590
Modern elevators...
it's all coming.

274
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,980
We're waiting.
There are some small delays.

275
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,670
We still have to wait.

276
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,430
And there, at the end,

277
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,710
there is...
there will be... your office.

278
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,310
- Equipment for the OR?
- What?

279
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,470
The equipment?

280
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,870
That's the biggest problem.
We'll discuss that later.

281
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,070
But everything else is here.

282
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,390
- Beds, closets.
- You mean we've only got beds?

283
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,990
Come on! We'll get it all somehow.

284
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,470
How much money have you got?

285
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,830
How much money have you got?

286
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,350
Nil.

287
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,790
They said no.

288
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,590
Fuck! With beds we can open
a bordello, not a cardiac surgery clinic!

289
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,910
Dr Bochenek!

290
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,950
Welcome.
Dr Pasyk.

291
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,640
- Andrzej Bochenek.
- Thank you,

292
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,510
we're waiting impatiently
for the supplies.

293
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,550
- Everything is going well.
- Goodbye.

294
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,270
Here we'll have the operating rooms.
Fast, modern lifts.

295
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,550
- And the equipment?
- On its way.

296
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,300
When will they finish this?

297
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,750
How was England?

298
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,190
- Have you named your deputy yet?
- No.

299
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,910
- Of course.
- Thank you.

300
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,960
Urology. Like me, before.

301
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,790
But you haven't operated a lot.

302
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,750
- It's no surprise. Who'd let you?
- I heard you would.

303
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,230
Doctor, the delegation.

304
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,710
- Fuck...
- Good morning.

305
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,230
We came to help.

306
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,950
From the Nowy Sacz Nursing School.
Good morning.

307
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,230
Welcome to the most modern
cardiac surgery clinic in this country.

308
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,550
- Morning.
- Hello.

309
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,310
Finally! Dr Zembala.

310
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,510
Hello.

311
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,270
- I'm at your disposal.
- Hi, Marian.

312
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,590
You took the shortcut, huh?

313
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,550
- This is the OR?
- That's right.

314
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,070
Great layout.
A perfect place for lifts.

315
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,110
- And who are they?
- Work force. To clear the rubble.

316
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,070
Our staff.

317
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,180
- Marian.
- Kalina. - Jolka.

318
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,110
Goska.

319
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,630
It takes 2 years to train
a cardiosurgical nurse.

320
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,990
So there's no time to waste.
Take care of the girls.

321
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,990
- Guess who's the deputy?
- Who?

322
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,310
- Doctor...
- Oh, I forgot. Welcome on board.

323
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,830
- Religa, we spoke on the phone.
- I remember...

324
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,310
Right, so... continue.

325
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,190
It's about the newest
cardiac surgery clinic.

326
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,110
Cardiac... right.

327
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,910
Heart diseases,
the most frequent cause of death.

328
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,030
All types of surgery. The first Polish

329
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,550
surgical heart attack
treatment program.

330
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,230
- The executive's disease.
- Yes, yes. I've heard.

331
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,860
So, how much do you need?

332
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,750
3 million.

333
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,550
Dollars.

334
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,950
Come on, doctor...

335
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,870
- What?
- Nothing.

336
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,950
Shallow breath. Obesity.

337
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,230
See you, sir.

338
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,030
Federation.

339
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,590
Unfortunately, the director can't help.
Try the unions.

340
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,830
Federation.

341
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,950
Yes, I told him.

342
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,870
You have to wait.
I don't know how long.

343
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,950
Call back,
or try the unions.

344
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,830
Fed... Oh, hi.

345
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,940
No,I'm not busy, I can talk.

346
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,940
I don't know who those guys were.

347
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,630
Connect me with the unions
And no more meetings for today.

348
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,550
- There's this doctor waiting.
- It won't take long.

349
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,270
Will you give me 3 mln USD
for a clinic in Zabrze?

350
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,910
No. But why?

351
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,230
Fuck!

352
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,040
You got me in some deep shit.

353
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,470
No, thanks.
I quit smoking.

354
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,680
We must go to the Regional
Party Committee. At least.

355
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,190
I won't go there.

356
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,670
- What are you afraid of?
- I'd rather die then go to the Party!

357
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,150
I'm glad you've turned to the Party.

358
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,990
- Jadwiga will help us.
- Jadwiga?

359
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,950
Jadwiga.

360
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,620
Comrade Jadwiga?

361
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,310
The "Jadwiga" cokery.

362
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,550
Located in the heart
of a beautiful city.

363
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,790
It is one the most polluting plants
in the region.

364
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,600
Officially we had it shut down.

365
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,390
But too many people
would lose their jobs.

366
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,990
Officially.

367
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,590
Unofficially, we'd lose
too many dollars.

368
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,790
Because all of our coke is exported.

369
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,350
So the cookery pays the fines
and keeps on poisoning us.

370
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,790
It pays in zlotys, to make dollars.

371
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,950
I'll give you those zlotys.

372
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,470
And you'll be curing us
from the harm Jadwiga is causing.

373
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,040
Officially?

374
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,870
By all means.

375
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,870
You just have to change
zlotys to hard currency.

376
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,630
- Officially?
- Would you prefer to deal on the street?

377
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,470
- If I had to.
- Oh, come on... Take a seat.

378
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,680
We live in a civilised country.

379
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,270
It has to go through
the Ministry of Health.

380
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,790
I'll deposit it as a subsidy
grant-in-aid to the clinic in Zabrze.

381
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,630
And you'll receive bucks.

382
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,310
In 15 days we'll perform
the first procedure.

383
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,950
- We're getting to work.
- Doctor, you're losing it.

384
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,990
Look around!
We won't start in a month.

385
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,550
- Pigs will fly before we finish in 15 days.
- Don't get on my nerves

386
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,950
We're getting down to work.
I'm serious

387
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,470
I'm off to change, move it!

388
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,150
- It's an ambitious plan.
- It's a plan?

389
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,390
Professor...

390
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,790
I came a little earlier.

391
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,430
Did you order them to sleep here?

392
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,790
They love me.

393
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,950
- Transplants, with those youngsters?
- What's there to be afraid of?

394
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,070
Don't rush Zbyszek.

395
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,950
Let me show you the OR.

396
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,950
This way

397
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,030
We'd like to welcome you
in the clinic in Zabrze.

398
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,870
We're happy that the man
who founded Polish cardiac surgery

399
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,350
will be the first to operate
in our clinic. In Dr Religa's clinic.

400
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,630
You're all crazy. Where's the OR?

401
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,680
The inaugural surgery,
Zabrze, August 1985

402
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,720
If you ever open another clinic

403
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,590
and invite me
for inaugural surgery,

404
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,910
make sure it's a little more challenging.

405
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,470
This patient could operate himself.

406
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,910
- Suction.
- Suction.

407
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,510
It's not sucking.

408
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,390
- I hope you don't mind.
- I was in the Uprising.

409
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,990
You won't surprise me.

410
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,630
What' s going on?

411
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,790
There we go...

412
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,790
The contractions are proper.
And at your end?

413
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,990
It's a success.

414
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,590
You can close up.

415
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,070
Thank you, congratulations.
Especially, to the patient, for surviving it.

416
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,510
- Quiet! You'll wake the patient!
- Tweezers.

417
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,870
You seem to be
the only sane person around.

418
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,870
Far from it.

419
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,790
Didn't you know
this was supposed to be an asylum,

420
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,150
before Pasyk and Religa
began this?

421
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,360
Maybe you'd come to Warsaw,
to have a look around?

422
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,070
Thank you, but...
Dr Religa needs me here.

423
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,870
I teach him to speak Silesian.

424
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,510
I can't help feeling that the patients
are the healthiest ones here.

425
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,030
Jolka, what are you doing?

426
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,710
Attention...
Everybody

427
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,990
Blood!!!

428
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,910
No, no...

429
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,550
I'm a cardiologist,
not a cardiac surgeon.

430
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,790
I know.
You're the boss.

431
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,270
And I also know we are all here
working for you.

432
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,590
- I understood this an hour ago.
- That's why you won't drink with me?

433
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,750
- Where's prof. Sitkowski?
- On his way to Warsaw. Excuse me.

434
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,870
Krysia,What have you got here?

435
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,910
Doctor, I was reflecting on todays operation.

436
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,720
With the proper training, it is possible
to train a cardio surgeons nurse in 21 days.

437
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,310
Have you seen anyone make a snake
out of an aortic catheter?

438
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,310
Marian... pardon me,I mean Dr Zembala...

439
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,230
One can't even celebrate with you.
Go, dance!

440
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,350
Boss... a phone call.

441
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,750
The best clinic in the world.

442
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,320
Speaking. Go on.

443
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,070
What do you mean?

444
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,550
- What's this about?
- How should I know?

445
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,990
- We have to keep the pressure on them.
The money went to the Ministry...

446
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,110
- I know!
Do something!

447
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,670
- My staff won't wait...
- Don't worry, I know the director.

448
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,350
Thank you.

449
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,950
Good morning.

450
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,030
Good morning, gentlemen.

451
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,510
Good morning.

452
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,830
Please, take your seats.

453
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,510
I'm being told, you began operating.
Without waiting for the decision.

454
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,310
Right.

455
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,710
Obviously this is some sort of mistake.

456
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,990
We'll investigate it.

457
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,430
Your grant has been suspended.
It will be spent

458
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,630
on more important matters.

459
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,670
You have two weeks to clean up
after yourselves.

460
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,110
Two weeks should be enough.

461
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,990
Goodbye.

462
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,350
My arms are too short
to reach Warsaw.

463
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,990
Believe me.

464
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,310
Fuck.

465
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,150
Motherfucker.

466
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,470
Staszek, hi. I need a favour.

467
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,560
Don't tell anyone at the clinic
we didn't receive the money.

468
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,790
Tweezers.

469
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,510
- Fuck.
- Blackjack.

470
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,980
- What?
- 21 "fucks".

471
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,390
Fuck!

472
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,310
- Stitches.
- Those two are loose.

473
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,070
What did you say?
I must've heard wrong.

474
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,990
Kid...

475
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,830
you were right. Thanks.

476
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,510
- Go on.
- A male, 52...

477
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,870
I can tell he's a male!

478
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,110
With ischemic cardiomyopathy.
4 infarcts,

479
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,060
last one 3 months ago with
ventricular fibrillation and asystole.

480
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,150
He needed 5 shocks, 300 J each,
to regain normal rhythm.

481
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,270
The last attack caused permanent
damage to the left ventricle.

482
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,390
Shortness of breath,
lower limbs edema,

483
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,150
no other medical problems.
His domestic situation..

484
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,470
Excuse me.

485
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,190
- He's stable but we're helpless!
- Spare me his personal details!

486
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,990
We'll get emotional
if he survives the transplant.

487
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,070
- Transplant.
- That's right.

488
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,110
- The transplant.
- Right.

489
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,910
From the second one,
every two.

490
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,230
From the second one. Up,

491
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,000
and twirl. Pull up, and twirl.

492
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,870
- What are you doing?
- A bypass.

493
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,790
Up... twirl...

494
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,150
- and let go.
- He wants to perform a transplant
on the guy from last night.

495
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,670
- The sternum must fold well.
- We're not ready.

496
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,670
- Everyone is in training.
- Keep your tools in order.

497
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,550
We haven't got a donor.
We don't know if we'll find one.

498
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,590
- Or how far away. - Tighten.
- We don't have proper transportation.

499
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,070
Compatibility testing
is only done in Warsaw.

500
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,710
The Brits are still testing cyclosporine.
Shit, we might kill the guy!

501
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,670
- You want to stop him?
- Sure! - How?

502
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,750
- I'm the deputy.
- So, by power of authority?

503
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,150
Now cut it.
Scissors?

504
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,870
Scissors!

505
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,710
- For wire.
- It's too early.

506
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,830
Give them to him.

507
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,230
- Let's make sure we are well prepared!
- We don't have donors!

508
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,270
- How is he treating you?
- We're operating. I am.

509
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,870
- We're looking for a donor.
- A donor?

510
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,470
- Heart donor.
- That's not a typical request.

511
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,310
- We want to save a life.
- But a heart?

512
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,950
We're chasing the West.

513
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,990
What is your prognosis
for such patient?

514
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,230
We can prolong a man's life
by 10 years. Maybe 20.

515
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,870
Even if it was 2 months...

516
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,110
For a man who can die tomorrow,
or in the next couple of days,

517
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,630
a couple of months is eternity.

518
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,710
You know what...

519
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,990
I don't think so.

520
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,790
<i>Jan Nielubowicz.</i>

521
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,230
So you're doing it. I understand that
the decision has been made.

522
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,430
- We're ready.
<i>- I need a favour.</i>

523
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,550
We're preparing to do a liver transplant.

524
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,830
<i>We've been working on this
for years.</i>

525
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,830
If your heart transplantation
program fails,

526
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,560
we'll also get a red light.

527
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,070
<i>Please, don't do it. Not yet.</i>

528
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,470
A heart transplant is irreversible.

529
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,510
You can't put the old heart back in.

530
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,150
As opposed to other organs.

531
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,910
- How long have you been preparing your team?
- A long time.

532
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,470
<i>What can I do?
You have my blessing.</i>

533
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,550
- Thank you. We'll be careful.
<i>- Good luck.</i>

534
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,950
Maybe I'll cook you a decent meal?

535
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,510
Religa.

536
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,880
This better be important!

537
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,310
They've been calling for an hour.

538
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,390
Go.

539
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,550
- We've got a donor. Not far from here.
- Compliance?- Confirmed.

540
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,230
I'll go get the donor.
A committee

541
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,630
has to pronounce brain death.

542
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,750
Monitoring of the patient,
phone, blood.

543
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,600
- No one goes home tonight.
- Boss...

544
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,990
- My wife is in labour.
- And someone is dying there.

545
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,190
Prepare the patient.

546
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,190
What are you doing?
They are shutting us down!

547
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,710
- What's this?
- Mom, stop it.

548
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,390
I need your signature
to discharge the patient.

549
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,630
- The results?
- Perfect.

550
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,070
Thank you, doctor.
I don't know what to say.

551
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,790
I wouldn't know what to answer.
The nurse will walk you to the door.

552
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,670
- I don't like driving behind someone.
- So... how does it work?

553
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,750
We get there,
the committee certifies,

554
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,710
the DA allows an earlier autopsy.

555
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,550
- I meant the transplant.
- No idea.

556
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,310
Technically it seems easy,

557
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,830
but which moment,during the procedure
is the most difficult?

558
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,070
I don't know.

559
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,070
- But you've seen it in the US.
- Nope.

560
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,070
- In Detroit, Kantrowitz wasn't doing it anymore.
- You haven't seen it?

561
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,550
- No, but I've practised on dogs, cadavers.
- Oh. Good.

562
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,430
- Are you afraid?
- No.

563
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,470
Good morning.
Good morning, doctor.

564
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,990
- We came for the heart.
- For the donor.

565
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,990
- Where's the committee?
- They haven't arrived yet.

566
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,510
When will they arrive?

567
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,440
The district surgeon
is working on it.

568
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,110
- So they're on their way?
- Seating on the committee

569
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:59,600
- is voluntary, so...
- They'll make history! Is that hard to understand?

570
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,070
They're refusing to do it.

571
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,790
- What is it?
- He's fibrillating!

572
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,710
Give him adrenaline!
Defibrillation!

573
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,870
- Where is the phone?
- Over there.

574
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,950
The man's dead,
what do you need him for?

575
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,550
- Clear...
- 200.

576
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,230
Go!

577
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,110
I can see it's an fucking infarct!
I'm calling Religa.

578
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,940
Give me the district surgeon right now!

579
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,150
How could they refuse?
It's all by the book!

580
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,230
They are summoned
by the health department!

581
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,230
Harder!

582
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,720
It's busy.

583
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,390
Fucking long distance!

584
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,230
I have a dying man in my clinic.

585
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,070
Leave it.

586
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,190
Come in.
No one will see you here.

587
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,510
- Don't talk too long.
- Sure. Thank you.

588
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,790
Hello? Mom's asleep?

589
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,550
No, no...Let her sleep.

590
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,710
They're going to operate.

591
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,480
You're almost grown up.

592
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,910
I wanted to tell you
that I love you very much.

593
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,440
I know we haven't been
getting along, but now,

594
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,630
when I come back, that will change.
With Mom too.

595
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,470
Right. Sleep well.

596
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,950
Don't worry. Of course. Bye.

597
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,630
- Should I call the police?
- People will die because of you!

598
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,830
Let her go!

599
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,470
Put it down!

600
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,630
I have to take the gear to Warsaw.
Are you the boss here?

601
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,470
- Breathe.
- Defibrillator!

602
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,550
Get the anesthesiologist.

603
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,870
- How much?-300.
- Loading.

604
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,460
Get the fuck out of my clinic!

605
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,630
- Clear.
- Go!

606
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,430
- No reaction. -400.
- Loading.

607
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,670
A day later and it would've been too late.
One day.

608
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,150
The funds haven't been allocated yet.

609
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,990
You fought hard for that money.

610
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,990
Don't give me that look.

611
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,390
I had to check
what I was getting into.

612
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,150
Comrades from Zabrze were...

613
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,990
euphoric that you want
to make their town famous.

614
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,470
I want to cure people.

615
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,670
Sure. I know that.

616
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:29,430
But not everyone is happy
to see a new cardiac clinic.

617
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,350
I'll talk to the right people today.

618
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,390
Is it possible to get a decision
by the end of the day?

619
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,550
If I didn't know your line of work,

620
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,910
I'd think you're crazy.

621
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,750
However, If anyone is to treat us,
it should be you.

622
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,590
Good bye.

623
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,990
Religa, Zabrze clinic.

624
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,550
Right.

625
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,120
Right.

626
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,510
Thank you.

627
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,430
The Ministry.

628
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,310
We got the money.

629
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,600
- Boss...
- Thank everyone for yesterday,

630
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:44,720
but now we need new plans.

631
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,390
Two patients need a transplant,
and we are prepared.

632
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,270
We need a transplantation
program. Any ideas?

633
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,070
The committees are crucial.
We should make lists for all regions.

634
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,990
We need to work
on district surgeons.

635
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,630
- We have only 3 friendly centers.
- A week ago we had none.

636
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,120
True.

637
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,590
Compatibility.

638
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,510
- Good morning. May I?
- May you what?

639
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,710
My doctorate.

640
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,790
I'm Romuald Cichon,
this is my doctorate.

641
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,470
- They didn't want to let me in.
- Because of your clothes. Hi Romek.

642
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,350
- Take a look.
- I'd like to work with you Doctor.

643
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,390
But you know, it's tough here.

644
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,070
Sure it is.

645
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,990
- Two days ago I had a case...
- Hold on.

646
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,390
Welcome aboard.
Get yourself some scrubs.

647
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,070
- Marian.
- Romuald.

648
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,070
Congratulations.

649
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,630
- Marian, your bypass disappeared.
- What?

650
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,870
It got absorbed through the ventricle.
Kid, is that possible?

651
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,950
I don't think it is.

652
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:05,190
But seriously,
your patient disappeared.

653
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,310
- From the IC unit?
- Yes.

654
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,230
I knew it.

655
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,790
- Should we follow him?
- Great idea! Come on.

656
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,830
- Where's the patient?!
- He went for a beer.

657
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,390
For a... Then you ought to...
Call the police.

658
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,950
Call the police immediately!

659
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,350
I performed a bypass,
so that he could go for a beer?

660
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,750
My work is going to waste!
I'm going to kill him!

661
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,120
- You had your chance.
- Calm down. It's your great success.

662
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,270
Allow me to differ. I don't agree!

663
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,790
What do you think, kid?

664
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,990
- 2 days after the surgery? Impressive.
- We've got a new donor.

665
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,670
- Where?-In Warsaw.
- What else?

666
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,860
- A biker, instant brain death.
- We know what to do.

667
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,510
Get an anesthesiologist.
Kid, you're coming with me.

668
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,350
Move it!

669
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,710
- Come here.
- But doctor...

670
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,710
Not now!

671
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:24,000
Last night you let a patient
in my office for a phone call.

672
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,230
- Yes, because...
- And I heard it all.

673
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,750
Do you realise what you did to me?
You're fired.

674
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,070
I need to tell you something.

675
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,870
- Doctor...
- Where's the anesthesiologist?

676
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,070
- There's this thing...
- What?

677
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,110
That? They're bugging us because
we're actually doing something.

678
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,070
No... it's...

679
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,550
They're following me.

680
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,630
I was detained during martial law.

681
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,870
They ruined my father,
and me...no one would give me a job.

682
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,150
You're the first one.

683
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,790
Wait here.

684
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,310
My name's Religa,
you probably know that already.

685
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,630
I'm the boss of this clinic.
Tell your superiors

686
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,760
that I do the politics here,
and my doctors treat people.

687
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,550
I'm off to save a dying man,
and you get the fuck out.

688
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,150
- Listen...
- Someone has to treat you people!

689
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,150
Get in.

690
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,390
Motherfucker!

691
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,990
Drive my car.

692
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,870
Way to go, doctor.

693
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,870
- Pupillary reflex negative.
- I concur.

694
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,710
Corneal reflex, negative.

695
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,990
Lack of reaction to pain stimuli
in the cranial nerve area.

696
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,830
- So... that's it.

697
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,630
We can certify brain death.

698
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,710
- Are you taking the kidneys?
- The heart.

699
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,190
I'll have to check again.

700
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,070
From the top.

701
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,550
- Should I talk to the family?
- No.

702
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,510
- I have to.
- Then, you have to do it now.

703
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,270
Hello. Zbigniew Religa.

704
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,910
Are you familiar
with transplantation medicine?

705
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,590
Kidney transplants?

706
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,790
My son doesn't need no kidneys.

707
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,800
But I need your son's heart.

708
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,470
I do not give my consent.

709
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,070
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

710
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,070
Besides...
it's not my decision to make.

711
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,030
Please, sit down.

712
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,030
You'll save him, right?

713
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:15,630
Unfortunately,
we have diagnosed brain death.

714
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,910
But he still has a chance?

715
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,390
I'm afraid not.
The human dies with the brain.

716
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:30,230
- Your son is dead.
- But I saw him breathing.

717
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:37,030
The ventilator machine breathes
to keep his heart beating.

718
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,070
So he's alive?

719
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,590
Your son is dead.

720
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,030
I know you are in pain...

721
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,790
I am really sorry,
but I need to ask you...

722
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,710
Do we have your consent
to collect your son's heart?

723
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,390
I need it to save another man.

724
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,750
You're the first mother in Poland
who has been asked this question.

725
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,670
His heart can live in someone else?

726
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,510
Yes.

727
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,790
Who is that man?

728
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,990
I wouldn't know.

729
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,590
And what can you do?

730
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,120
I can save that man's life
thanks to your son's heart.

731
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,630
You have my consent.

732
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,230
Well?

733
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,390
He won't sell without talons.

734
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,870
- Don't you have them?
- Do you? - I don't.

735
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,470
Neither do I.

736
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,430
Start her up!

737
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,310
- Go!

738
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,110
We have the parent's, the committee's,
and the DA's consent.

739
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,470
- Tests?
- Compatibility OK,

740
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,390
- Kidneys are functioning.
- Doctor...

741
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,710
The recipient's wife
Is waiting in your office.

742
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,360
I know her, I'll talk to her.

743
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:43,550
And with this new heart
will he be different?

744
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,710
- He'll be better.
- So he'll change?

745
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,710
I mean he'll be healthier.

746
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,990
He'll be fit.
He'll be able to walk, to work.

747
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,230
I'm afraid he might become...
weird...

748
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,910
That he won't recognise me, or...

749
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,630
he won't love me anymore.

750
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,520
I know it might sound strange,

751
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,630
but in our times
a transplant is a routine operation.

752
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,400
But the heart holds feelings.

753
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,870
- I think they're in the head.
- What about love?

754
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,750
- You're religious, right?
- Of course.

755
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,630
We just fix bodies here.
You're talking about the soul.

756
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,190
We won't change your husband.
He'll be healthier.

757
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,710
So nothing from this heart
will pass onto him?

758
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,830
The heart is a pump.
A wonderful one, but just a pump.

759
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,870
- Where are you going?
- What? You fired me.

760
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,120
Don't be stupid,
Go back to the OR.

761
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,710
And these people
want nothing in return?

762
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,070
- They want...
- How much?

763
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,510
They want their son
to save someone's life.

764
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,830
Andrzej... we've got a donor.

765
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,830
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

766
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,870
Young?

767
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,630
- You realise it's a risky operation.
- It's always risky.

768
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,310
But it's no faggot or a Jew?
Or, even worse, a woman?

769
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,030
It's a man.

770
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,630
Gornik needs me on the bleachers.

771
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,390
Then there's the wife
and kids.

772
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,710
And if it won't work with me,
will you keep on trying?

773
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:18,950
<i>The first transplant,
Zabrze, October 1985</i>

774
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,990
Are we ready?

775
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,910
Godspeed.

776
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,590
- Andrzej, how are you feeling?
- All right.

777
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,510
- A little nervous?
- Wouldn't you be?

778
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,310
- Did you have breakfast?
- No.

779
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,390
A shot of cognac?

780
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,790
We'll give you a shot,
it won't hurt.

781
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,310
Was it you who stole the cabbage?

782
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,110
We're ready.

783
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,720
The patient is stable.
We can begin collecting.

784
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,830
Aortic clamps.

785
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,470
Suction.

786
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,540
The guy is heartless.

787
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,310
Last stitches.

788
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,520
- The heart is in.
- 52 minutes.

789
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,790
Stable.
Moment of truth.

790
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,990
Fibrillating.
Defibrillator, 20.

791
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,070
20.

792
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,030
Clear...

793
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,470
Go!

794
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,630
- Once again, 20.
- Set.

795
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,790
You got it? Clear...

796
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,590
Going out of the ECC.

797
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,750
ECC stopped.

798
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,270
OK. Let's close.

799
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,790
Take the swab out.

800
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:26,110
- We need to call the media.
- Why?

801
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,230
What does a hen do
when it lays an egg?

802
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,830
- It clucks?
- Exactly. Call them.

803
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,640
- Reports, boss.
- It's the middle of the night.

804
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,590
In our world, the night is a day at work.

805
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,990
Adrenaline!

806
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,150
Defibrillation!

807
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,670
Charge.

808
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,230
Clear!

809
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,870
Epinephrine, again.

810
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,430
Clear!

811
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,230
Go!

812
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:24,870
Time of death: 7:02 pm,
6th day after the transplant.

813
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,870
Find a new donor.

814
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:54,150
He risked the life of both patients,

815
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,950
for fame.

816
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:07,310
He went outside the box...
so off with his head?

817
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:15,510
Without the courage to go forward
you'll never get anywhere.

818
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:21,710
<i>The second transplant,
Zabrze, November 1985</i>

819
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,070
<i>Yesterday, in Dr Religa's clinic
in Zabrze,</i>

820
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,390
<i>30 days after the surgery,
the second heart recipient died.</i>

821
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,150
<i>Will Dr Religa solve the problem?</i>

822
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,030
<i>And, more importantly, should he try again?</i>

823
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,830
How should I know?

824
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,560
- Don't shout.
- The patient is ready.

825
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,270
- Where is Romek?-Absent.
- Marian?- Operating.

826
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,590
We need a decision
about the patient in 3.

827
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,840
- Is he stable?- He was earlier.
- Dr Religa has arrived.

828
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,710
- Thank God.
- I don't know...

829
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,070
- What's going on?
- Take care of him, I'll operate.

830
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,070
- You?
- Will you?

831
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,870
Don't I have a right?

832
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,230
Can't I have lunch?
Give me the keys!

833
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,750
Sorry, boss, but no way.

834
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,310
Then pack your stuff,
I don't want to see you here.

835
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,390
Understand? You're fired!

836
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,550
Get out.

837
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,550
Please, don't let him drive.

838
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,270
Oh, my sweet honey...

839
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,350
You, come with me.
Give me the keys.

840
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,750
I want to go my home,
to Warsaw. for lunch.

841
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,350
No way, boss.

842
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,950
Come here.
It's an opportunity of a lifetime.

843
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:15,630
In honour of your merits,
I give you all my surgeries.

844
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,630
- Sure, boss.
- Get to work.

845
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,430
- Give me the keys!
- Boss...

846
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:29,150
Do you really think
I won't start my car without the keys?

847
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:34,710
- Maybe I should drive you.
- You're a lousy driver!

848
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,910
- Wanna bet?
- That you can't drive?

849
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,630
Or that I'll fire you?

850
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,680
That no car will overtake me.

851
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,800
I guess I'll take the train back.

852
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,950
Romek...

853
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,630
what was the bet about?

854
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,950
If I win,
I'll perform my first surgery.

855
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,790
Right.

856
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,200
When you get back,
hire Krysia again.

857
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,910
Everyone wrote this patient off,
so I thought we could try.

858
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,470
I was clear: we're taking a break
from transplants.

859
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:00,630
There's so much to be done
in cardiac surgery,

860
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,520
that you're just being
a pain in the ass!

861
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,470
No one else will take him.

862
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,990
He knows where he came.

863
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,470
What are his chances?
10 percent? 15?

864
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,110
Less.

865
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,910
Let me see.

866
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,510
Motherfucker.

867
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:42,440
- Are we closing? The heart is weak.
<i>The 3rd transplant, April 1986.</i>

868
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,950
- The left ventricle is distending.
- The venous pressure is too high.

869
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:53,150
- Something is wrong.
- We shouldn't have taken him.

870
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,390
Are you saying
we shouldn't save his life?

871
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,070
I'm saying that some cases
are hopeless!

872
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,350
Doctor, leave the OR, please.
You are fired.

873
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,950
Now.

874
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,990
Good luck, Marian.

875
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,550
Marian, you're my deputy now.
Kid, scrub up!

876
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:26,990
Does anyone else question
the point of this clinic?

877
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,990
There's no point
in going back to the pump.

878
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:37,510
It would be best to support
this heart with another heart.

879
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,590
We'd need a new donor,
but... I don't know...

880
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,710
Maybe a xenogenic transplant?

881
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,630
- What would be the best?
- A monkey.

882
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,230
Not many of them around, but...

883
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,950
Go, hire Dr Bochenek back,
and send him for a pig.

884
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,550
You go with him. Kicka
will take over. Are you up to it?

885
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,790
I am.

886
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,710
You'll call the Wroclaw zoo
and ask them for a baboon.

887
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,470
Tell them a man's life's at stake.

888
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:13,150
We'll hook him up
to a pig's or monkey's heart,

889
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,550
and try to find a new donor.
Let's do it!

890
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,420
It stinks like a human inside.

891
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,270
18. That's it.

892
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,640
A fine specimen.

893
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,840
Now you have to put it to sleep.

894
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,310
- How much does it weigh?
- How should I know? You're the anesthesiologist.

895
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,750
I need to know its weight.
For the dosage.

896
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,550
- Then fucking ask her!
- I wouldn't know how to intubate it:

897
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:47,590
orally, or just cut it's throat.

898
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,710
Cut it's throat?

899
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,870
Through the snout.

900
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,080
Run! We have a patient on the table.

901
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,110
Sorry, boss. It died in transport.

902
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,670
Who? The pig!

903
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,310
I don't know!
What do you want me to do? An autopsy?

904
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,230
We gave it valium,
and it got a heart attack.

905
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,710
Pigs are sensitive.

906
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,430
What?

907
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,590
Another one?

908
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,390
Yes, of course.

909
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,750
Take it out. We're closing.

910
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,830
I found a donor.

911
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,750
Just don't tell Religa.

912
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,630
Why?

913
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,630
The guy died 2 hours ago.

914
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,630
Not a word to the DA
about this circus.

915
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,150
Good morning.

916
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,630
Time of death: 5.50 pm.

917
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,220
Direct cause: asystole

918
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,390
due to right ventricular failure.

919
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,630
CPR was performed
for about an hour.

920
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,550
Any more questions, sir?

921
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,520
Do you have the autopsy results?

922
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,950
During the autopsy
no signs of rejection were found.

923
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:05,180
The transplanted heart infarcted,
probably right before the transplant.

924
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,070
You transplanted a heart
with an infarction?

925
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,150
The collected organism not tested like it
Would be on a healthy individual. It's impossible.

926
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,830
We couldn't have known
about the infarction.

927
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,470
We won't trouble you anymore.
I'm shutting down

928
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,150
- the transplantation program.
- Hold on, doctor.

929
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,510
I'm not done yet!

930
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,550
Who is Dr Religa's deputy?

931
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,390
It's 3 am!

932
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,390
- Where is my home?
- Boss...

933
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,070
Where is my home?

934
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,350
The Doctor couldn't make it,
he sent me instead.

935
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,950
We have tons of work,
a lot of surgeries...

936
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:38,670
and he... it's amazing
that you have such a husband.

937
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,300
- You think?
- Yes. He...

938
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,560
The Doctor is completely
devoted to his work.

939
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,430
I can tell.

940
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:01,230
- You're a saint.
- I'm pissed, not a saint, professor.

941
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,190
- Doctor.
- Give this to me.

942
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,390
"Religa, you're not God."

943
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,320
"Quit killing people,
ambition has eaten your conscience."

944
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,350
Poznan Health Dept.

945
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,720
We have to go back to the clinic.

946
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,150
I guess I'm going to quit.

947
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,910
Don't you see he won't let go?
Don't you all see it?

948
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,230
Feeling happy is a game changer.

949
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:24,630
I was happy when we persuaded
the Dutch to treat our kids.

950
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:29,630
- You told me.
- Yes, but then I thought:

951
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:34,150
why take our kids there
if it's easier...

952
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:39,950
if it's easier for me
to come back here.

953
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,790
True.

954
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,990
- Here?
- Yes.

955
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,230
Go, I can handle from here

956
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,080
- What time is it?
- Quarter to.

957
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:06,870
I told you not to call me
when I'm on holiday!

958
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,790
Excuse me? In what condition?

959
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,150
OK, I'm on my way.

960
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,550
I've got a show to play!

961
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:43,310
<i>That's right. I'm off.</i>

962
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,950
You deserted your team.
They are lost without you.

963
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,070
What are you doing?

964
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,230
what's the biggest problem?

965
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,510
- Qualifying patients for surgery?
- No.

966
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:07,070
- Cyclosporine dosage?
- No.

967
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:13,470
- The time span?
- Those are not real problems.

968
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,950
The mother's eyes after
a failed attempt to save her child?

969
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,390
It's about humility.

970
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:28,950
Failure and success
can be equally hard for a doctor.

971
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,950
One needs a large dose of humility.

972
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,310
Morning.

973
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,550
- You came for the apples?
- That's right.

974
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,350
I've sold them all.

975
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,630
There's nothing left?

976
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,910
Too bad.

977
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,830
Maybe the neighbours have some?

978
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,950
You'd have to ask around.

979
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,630
What kind?

980
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,950
Kosztela.

981
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,480
I want to apologise.

982
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,710
It was Gods plan.

983
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,870
- Full mouth sanitation.
- Throat swab?

984
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:32,790
- Isn't that obvious?
- Good morning. Follow me.

985
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,270
Thank you.

986
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,150
There.

987
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,750
Fuck! Sorry.

988
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,630
"Fuck" it is.

989
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,480
Our cyclosporine dosage was too high

990
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,510
The Brits and Germans
have been making the same mistake

991
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,990
Daddy's back.

<i>The fourth transplant,
Zabrze, May 1986</i>

993
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,390
How are you feeling, director?

994
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,470
- I'm worried about one thing.
- What is it?

995
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,870
- That I'll be heartless again.
- Just for 15 minutes.

996
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,190
I hope nothing stupid
comes to my mind at that time.

997
