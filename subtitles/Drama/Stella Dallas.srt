1
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,444
- Hi, Stell.
- Hello.

2
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,711
- Hello, Stella.
- Hello.

3
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,707
Stella's got a fella!
Only he don't know it.

4
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,441
- Who?
- You, that's who.

5
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:15,382
My own sister, standing out here
every night making a sap of herself...

6
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,318
- over a guy who don't know she's here.
- You mind your own business.

7
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,322
Anyways, you don't know
what you're talking about.

8
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,224
I don't? You doll up every night
and wait to welcome me home?

9
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:28,060
- Why, of course.
- Ah, gee, thanks.

10
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,898
- I must give you a kiss for that.
- Stop! Take your dirty hands off me.

11
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,906
You're like all the rest. Fingers are
chopped at the mill when he walks by.

12
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:42,240
- But he don't look at none of them.
- Why should he? Mill hands.

13
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:45,679
Hey, wait a minute.

14
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,308
There's some nice girls
that are mill hands.

15
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:50,682
Where do you get off?
What's the matter with a mill hand?

16
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,687
I'm a mill hand.
Your father's a mill hand.

17
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,246
- Don't yell. The neighbors know it.
- Well, maybe he don't.

18
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,259
- So I'll tell him.
- Stop that!

19
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,022
Stop this!

20
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,996
What's the matter with you two?
You used to get along.

21
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,966
Yeah, but that was before she
started taking a business course...

22
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,059
to improve herself.

23
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,434
It's done her a lot of good,
all right.

24
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:12,338
- She ain't satisfied with none of us.
- Supper.

25
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:14,899
- What'd you say, Mom?
- Supper's ready.

26
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:17,037
So am I. Come on, Pop.

27
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,284
- Come on, Stell.
- I'll be in in a minute.

28
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,469
"The childhood sweetheart
of young Stephen Dallas.

29
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:50,603
A sweetheart until that tragic hour
when his millionaire father...

30
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,547
bankrupt and ill,
committed suicide.

31
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,607
Two days later,
Stephen Dallas disappeared...

32
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:59,553
leaving behind him a note saying
he was trying to make a life...

33
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,556
somewhere else.

34
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:09,195
Harvard graduate and crew man
disappeared after his father's death.

35
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:12,166
Millionaire playboy
left without a penny."

36
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,045
Don't be late, Charlie.

37
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,858
- What is it?
- Your lunch.

38
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:39,087
That's right. Get funny.
What's in it?

39
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:42,461
Just a little turkey and dressing.
That's all I had today.

40
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,864
Wait a minute.

41
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:48,267
Baloney again,
and apple butter.

42
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:51,136
Baloney and apple butter.
Apple butter and baloney.

43
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,971
That's all I get.
I ain't gonna take it no more.

44
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,409
- You can do without it.
- I can, huh?

45
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,243
- Charlie, I'll fix you something.
- Don't baby him, Mom.

46
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,715
Baby me? I'm old enough
to earn money, ain't I?

47
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,309
A man can have a home of his own
on what I'm makin'.

48
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,947
Charlie, wait a minute.

49
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:11,084
Oh, what do you want to
egg him on for, Stella?

50
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,390
That Jenkins girl's
just dyin' to get him.

51
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:17,627
Let her. If that's all the ambition
he's got, there's nothing you can do.

52
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,134
I don't know what
we'd do without him.

53
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,763
I'm gonna fix up somethin'
for him to eat.

54
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,569
You can leave it for him
on your way down.

55
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,575
He'll starve first.

56
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,652
Maybe you're right, Mom.

57
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,520
I'll take it down to him.

58
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,187
I'll run over to the delicatessen
and get him something nice.

59
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,196
Will ya?

60
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,533
Yeah.

61
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:31,029
Hey, the boss just phoned.
He's at Millhampton Junction.

62
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:35,066
He said to tell you the Parker contract
is right in his vest pocket.

63
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,941
He was chirping like a bird.

64
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:40,949
Said he'll be here in a few minutes,
but just wanted to tell you.

65
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,082
Hey, ain't you interested?

66
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,883
Yes, I'm glad Mr. Beamer
got the contract.

67
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,857
You oughta be.
He was chirping like a bird.

68
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:54,295
You know how he does on the telephone.
He said to put you down for a raise.

69
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,729
You can have that vacation now.

70
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,733
How's that?

71
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:03,635
I don't need a vacation now.
I have no place to go.

72
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,264
Huh?

73
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,275
Oh, nothing.

74
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:04,364
I beg your pardon.

75
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,628
Could you tell me where I
could find Charlie Martin?

76
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,904
He works on the carting machine.

77
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:12,964
Oh, yes.
The carting machines.

78
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:16,375
Why, they're closed down just now.
He'd be out in the yard, most likely.

79
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:20,347
I tell you what you do-- Go back through
the corridor the way you came in.

80
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,283
Instead of coming up those stairs...

81
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,843
there's a big gate down there.

82
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,856
If you go through that gate...

83
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,758
the path leads right down
past that first big building.

84
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:35,160
Just as you turn round the corner,
the men usually have their--

85
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,264
Yes?

86
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:42,202
Well, it's sort of dirty down there.
Maybe I'd better send for him.

87
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,369
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

88
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,746
- McCarthy!
- Yes, sir.

89
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:55,215
- Find Charlie Martin, send him in.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

90
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,557
- He'll be right in.
- Thank you.

91
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:08,124
- Good morning, Dallas.
- Congratulations on that contract.

92
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,461
- How do you do, Mr. Beamer?
- How do you do?

93
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,601
- Stella Martin.
- Martin's girl?

94
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:15,936
You're all grown up.

95
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:18,974
And so pretty.
Isn't she, Dallas?

96
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,668
Yes.

97
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:23,371
Say, how long have you two
known each other?

98
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:27,644
- Well, we haven't really met.
- Oh, excuse me.

99
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,550
Mr. Dallas, this is Miss Martin.
Miss Martin, Mr. Dallas.

100
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,679
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

101
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,019
My brother forgot his lunch,
and I didn't want him to go without.

102
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,753
- So I brought it to him.
- That's a nice girl.

103
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,159
Good to your brother.
Good to your father, too, I'll bet.

104
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,527
I wish I had somebody
thinking so much of me.

105
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,657
Eh, Dallas?

106
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,431
They said he went out to eat.

107
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,494
- Thank you.
- That's too bad.

108
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:52,598
- After all your trouble.
- I suppose it was all my fault.

109
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,441
- I was late.
- It wouldn't do him harm to wait.

110
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:00,243
I'll bet sometimes he's late.
Never mind. Don't you worry.

111
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:04,116
Let's see what you got. We can
make believe you brought it to us.

112
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,178
- Eh, Dallas?
- It isn't anything much.

113
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:09,990
Oh!

114
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:17,159
Make this yourself?
Dallas?

115
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,666
- Thank you.
- You too.

116
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:22,795
I hope they're not too dry.
I forgot to bring anything to drink.

117
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,033
- I have some milk here.
- Oh, fine.

118
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,802
- I'll get some glasses.
- Can I help you?

119
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,575
- Thank you.
- Hey, you're some cook, aren't you?

120
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,581
Oh, wait, please.

121
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:40,320
I hate glasses
that don't shine.

122
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,391
Don't you?

123
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,804
Shall we go?

124
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,376
You ready?

125
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,043
- Hello, Stella.
- Hello.

126
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,846
- Hello, Steve.
- How are you, Ned?

127
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,787
Don't forget, the missus will be
expecting you over for that good meal.

128
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:51,588
- You bet. Very soon.
- You go over there for dinner?

129
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,687
Gee, you who could be
at the River Club.

130
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,962
- Look.
- That's the second time this week.

131
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,093
I saw them in the drug store
together the other night.

132
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,968
You mind your own business.

133
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,976
- You mind our being talked about?
- Mind? I mind?

134
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:16,575
Oh, no. It's just that I can't
believe you like seeing me...

135
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,586
when you could be out
with all the swells.

136
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,589
I want to be with you.
I like being with you.

137
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,929
Could I take your arm?

138
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,864
I mean, is that all right?
Is that considered--

139
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,596
I wanna be like all the people
you've been around.

140
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,869
Educated, you know,
and speaking nice.

141
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:44,003
Don't be like anyone else.
I like you the way you are.

142
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,674
No, I don't want to be like me,
not like the people in this place...

143
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,945
but like the people
in the movie.

144
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,647
You know, doing everything
well-bred and refined.

145
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:56,452
And dull. Stay as you are.
Don't pretend.

146
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:01,087
Anyway, it isn't really well-bred
to act the way you aren't.

147
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,030
But I wanted to be different
ever since I met you.

148
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,533
If I was around you long enough,
I could be.

149
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:09,867
I could learn to talk like you
and act like you.

150
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,873
Pretty soon, l--

151
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:17,140
Well, you've done a lot for me
even in these couple of weeks.

152
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,309
You've done a lot for me too.
I was very lonely the day you walked in.

153
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,112
Oh, no, I don't smoke
and I don't drink either.

154
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:30,953
I was lonely and unhappy,
and then you--

155
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,459
Yes?

156
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,469
Oh, I shouldn't have.

157
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,470
You won't have
any respect for me.

158
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:51,240
Not for girls who let men kiss them
whenever they want.

159
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:55,477
I mean, I don't let--
I mean--

160
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,816
Well, a girl shouldn't
unless they--

161
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,321
Well...

162
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:04,353
unless they know a man is serious.

163
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,366
Ain't she got home yet?

164
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,937
Does the old man--

165
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,573
- Hello, Pop.
- What time did Stella get home?

166
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,550
Huh? Oh, that was about--
That was around--

167
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,813
Oh, I don't know,
but she woke me up.

168
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,321
Hey, Mom, how about the coffee?
And Pop's too.

169
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,517
Tell Stella I want to see her.

170
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,561
Gee, it was kind of late.
Let her sleep.

171
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,259
Tell Stella I want to see her.

172
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:46,767
Yes.

173
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,403
Why, she ain't here.

174
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,242
I wonder where she
could've gone so early?

175
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,583
She ain't slept there.

176
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,744
She spent the night with Carrie Jenkins.
It was raining hard.

177
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,347
She didn't go out with Carrie.
Why should she stay the night with her?

178
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:12,918
When she gets home, tell her to take
her things and be out before I get back.

179
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,327
Listen, you can't.
Give her a chance to explain.

180
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:17,729
You shut up!
Tell her what I said.

181
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,166
All right, then I guess
that goes for me too.

182
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,760
Finish your coffee.
I'll talk to your pa.

183
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,272
I don't want coffee or any part
of this dump from now on.

184
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,172
I'm through!

185
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:34,249
- I'll tell you later.
- Gee, where have you been?

186
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,841
- The old man's--
- Look, Charlie.

187
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,446
Married? Oh, Stell!

188
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,150
Gee, Mr. Dallas, that's swell.

189
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,456
Hey, Ma, she's here.
She's married.

190
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,292
Hey, Pop, it's okay now.
She's here.

191
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,144
We're here, Agnes.

192
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,242
My, oh, my, you sure is.

193
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,379
And there it is.
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:16,185
Who do it look like?

195
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,455
Let me see who you look like,
your pappy or your mammy.

196
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,793
Go ahead and open the door.
You'll have time for that later on.

197
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:25,390
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am.

198
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,994
I know who's gonna be boss
around here from now on.

199
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:40,343
Oh, gosh.
Home never looked so good to me.

200
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,508
Poor Stella.

201
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,246
I didn't mind it.
The hospital got on my nerves.

202
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,811
That darned doctor trying
to make me stay another week.

203
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,154
- He thought it would be better--
- Better for who?

204
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:54,525
It was just to get your money.
I felt as good the next day as ever.

205
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,588
Maybe better than I had
for a while.

206
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,930
Oh, Stephen,
why didn't you bring them to me?

207
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,698
The days wouldn't have seemed
half so long.

208
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:07,538
- I thought everybody'd forgotten me.
- I think we'll get you to bed.

209
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,975
Bed? I just got up.

210
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,105
Haven't you seen enough of me
in bed for the past three weeks?

211
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,116
Seems like three years to me.

212
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:18,051
You'll soon find you're not
as strong as you think you are.

213
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,487
You must remember I've had a great deal
of experience in these maternity cases.

214
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,957
Experience?
What do you think I had?

215
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,392
Tell me why doctors, nurses
and husbands...

216
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,454
always think they know more
about this maternity business.

217
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,557
Don't you think a mother learns anything
in that room they wheel her into?

218
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,398
Or is that just
a kindergarten class?

219
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,907
Let me tell you. I picked up
quite an experience in that room.

220
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,408
That wasn't out of books either.

221
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,910
Experience.

222
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,912
- Stephen.
- Yes, dear?

223
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,509
A dance at the River Club
tomorrow night.

224
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,782
I think I can wear
my blue dress.

225
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:58,316
- I'll let it out a little at the top.
- You don't want to go dancing already.

226
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,060
Before I went to the hospital,
I was stuck in this house...

227
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,622
for four solid months
without going anywheres.

228
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,759
We just got in to the River Club.

229
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,566
All my life I've died to go to the real
places and get in with the right crowd.

230
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:13,267
Just when I got a chance to get started,
I have to give it all up.

231
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,775
We'll go next time.

232
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,641
I don't want to go next time.
I want to go this time.

233
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,546
Stephen, I won't dance much.
I promise.

234
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,709
I just want to get a wave
and a manicure...

235
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,049
and get all dressed up again
and go hear some music...

236
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,920
and forget all about doctors
and hospitals and nurses.

237
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,925
And babies?

238
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,460
Ah, but Stephen, please.

239
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,202
Why, you're a wonderful dancer,
Mr. Munn.

240
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,273
If I'm any judge of horse flesh,
you don't shake a mean leg yourself.

241
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:03,384
Who's that she's dancing with?
He's pretty good too.

242
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,655
- I really don't know.
- His name is Munn.

243
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,026
He has something to do
with horse races.

244
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,498
The girls invite him over for golf,
and he gives them tips.

245
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,130
How'd you come to get hooked up
to a table like that?

246
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,298
They're some business friends
of my husband's.

247
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:21,399
Business friends?
What is he, an undertaker?

248
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:29,247
Get him to ditch that bunch of moss bags
and come over and join us.

249
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:32,719
Spencer Chandler's table?
We don't even know him.

250
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,154
Well, that won't take long.

251
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,920
- You know what he said after our dance?
- No. What?

252
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,984
He said, "Ed--"
He always calls me Ed.

253
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,156
"You can pick winners on a dance floor
better than you can on a racetrack."

254
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,531
Yeah? Ah, go on.
Don't red apple me.

255
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,127
No, on the level.
I'll prove it to you.

256
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:52,605
I'd have to ask Stephen first.

257
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,110
- Yes?
- Come here.

258
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:59,409
Excuse me. Yes?

259
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,711
- This is Mr. Munn.
- How are you?

260
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:06,117
Mr. Spencer Chandler wants us
to come over to his table.

261
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,656
- I'm sorry. We're just leaving.
- Leaving?

262
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:11,090
- It's only quarter after.
- I know, but that's late for us.

263
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,889
- Come just for a nightcap.
- Yes, Stephen, please.

264
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,056
I'm afraid we can't.
Thank you. Good night.

265
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,201
Good night.

266
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:24,739
I'll get the things.

267
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,138
He dug it out of his pocket.

268
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:33,978
The horse came in and paid 20 to 1.
What do you think of that?

269
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,411
- Oh, dear.
- Did you lose something?

270
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,423
- What was it?
- May I help you?

271
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,153
I remember.
I gave it to Mr.--

272
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:47,161
Pardon me.

273
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,460
- What do you think of that?
- What a story.

274
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:55,503
Say, Ed, did you give me back
my handkerchief?

275
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,471
- You never gave it to me.
- I must have lost it.

276
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,008
- Take mine.
- No, I didn't mean--

277
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:04,978
Wait a minute. I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

278
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,681
- Mr. Chandler, this is Mrs. Dallas.
- How do you do?

279
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,878
Spencer, I want you to prove
something to her for me.

280
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:15,014
Didn't you say I could pick 'em on
the dance floor as good as on the track?

281
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,890
I wouldn't feel too flattered. Munn
hasn't given me a winner in a month.

282
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,293
- Will you sit down?
- Thank you.

283
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,059
Miss Dallas, I'd like you
to meet Miss Terry.

284
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:27,033
I believe your wife lost something,
and she thought maybe Mr.--

285
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:30,162
- Mr. Munn might know.
- Thank you.

286
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,471
Stephen, this is Mr. Chandler.
Mr. Chandler, my husband.

287
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,740
Mr. Chandler asked me to dance.
You don't mind?

288
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:41,282
Sorry, my wife's just out of
the hospital and should be in bed.

289
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,285
We'll hurry then.
Come on.

290
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,626
You wouldn't like to sit down
and have a little snifter?

291
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:54,821
No, thank you very much.

292
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,181
Thank you.

293
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:33,029
What have I done this time?
I'll take my usual lecture. Begin.

294
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,797
Stella, I asked you not
to wear those earrings...

295
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:38,203
that cheap imitation necklace.

296
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,140
You took them off.
You agreed.

297
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,178
Then after we got there,
you came out of the dressing room--

298
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:47,841
I'm perfectly willing to let you
tell me how to talk and act.

299
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,044
But please don't give me pointers
on how to dress.

300
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,646
Allow me at least to know more
about one thing than you do.

301
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:59,217
After all, I've always been known
to have stacks of style.

302
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,457
You should have heard Ed Munn,
and he's been around a bit too.

303
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:05,056
He's traveled further,
and he--

304
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,494
All right, then, farther.
Whichever it is, I don't care.

305
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:12,904
Gosh, I have to think twice
every time I open my mouth.

306
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,705
Spencer Chandler didn't seem to
have to turn the other way either.

307
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,246
He only happens to be
one of the Chandlers.

308
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:23,148
Please don't say things
like that.

309
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:26,654
- Remember you're my wife now.
- And can't look at another man.

310
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:29,519
- That isn't the point at all.
- That's a laugh.

311
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:32,219
An affair between
Spencer Chandler and I.

312
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:35,092
Well, I am coming up
in the world.

313
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,898
Stella, can't you--
Won't you try to understand?

314
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,943
Please listen to me this time.
Please.

315
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,571
The fake jewelry is not important.
Chandler's not important.

316
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,275
None of these things matter
in themselves.

317
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,285
But what's to become of us?
That is important.

318
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,157
Stella,
why did you marry me?

319
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,454
Because I was crazy about you, silly,
and I still am, only--

320
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,432
- Only you just don't seem to ever--
- Once, a long time ago...

321
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,130
you said you were crazy
to learn everything, become someone.

322
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,138
Didn't you?

323
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,674
- Yes, Stephen.
- Please listen to me.

324
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:23,677
I'm only telling you this
because I love you.

325
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:29,345
Beamer wants to send me to New York
to handle the sales department there.

326
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,408
I want to go.

327
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:35,513
I want to take you with me,
but I want you to make an effort.

328
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,151
I want you to try to be...

329
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,627
what you wanted to be.

330
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:45,530
Give up a few things for me
and try to adapt yourself--

331
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,468
Adapt myself?
Give up a few things?

332
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:52,974
Well, what have I been doing
ever since I met you?

333
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,407
I'm getting
a little sick of it too.

334
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,412
How would it be for you to do
a little adapting for a change?

335
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,278
I don't see you
giving up anything.

336
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,284
I'll tell you one more thing.
I'm not going to New York.

337
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:08,550
I'm not gonna leave here just when I'm
beginning to get with the right people.

338
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:13,484
You go on and go to New York.
I'm gonna stay here.

339
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,522
Can you beat that?

340
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,694
Laying awake waiting for her dinner,
and not a squawk out of her.

341
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,908
Gosh, Carrie...

342
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,413
I used to think girls
at the mill were crazy...

343
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:36,245
when they got married and right
off the bat started having kids.

344
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:38,912
But honest, Stella,
would you want any more?

345
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,148
Sure, if I could have
another one like her.

346
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,157
She's been a regular pal to me.

347
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:46,717
Since Stephen's been away in New York,
I hardly know I have a husband.

348
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,958
He's only been here three times
this summer, and only on account of her.

349
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,293
He's crazy about her.

350
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,734
Who wouldn't be?

351
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,794
Oh, look at her.

352
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:59,669
Wiping it up at her age.
Can you beat that?

353
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,733
She's the spit of her old man.

354
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,571
Now, who's that? Edna?

355
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,350
Is this all the welcome I get?

356
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,887
Of all people!

357
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:17,516
- Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
- And I you.

358
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:21,756
- I haven't seen you for ages.
- Get a load of that kid.

359
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,764
Has she grown,
or am I crazy?

360
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,322
Come on.

361
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,770
Gee, Stell, she looks more
like you every time.

362
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,767
You remember Uncle Ed,
don't you, darling?

363
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,174
I remember you.

364
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,940
- Oh, let me see.
- How's that?

365
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,984
Oh, Ed, you shouldn't
have done this.

366
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,246
Don't she look like a little queen?

367
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,720
It's gold and turquoise.

368
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:50,417
Edna!
You want a drink, don't you?

369
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,824
Sure, and if you don't mind,
I'll peel this coat.

370
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:55,761
Sure, go ahead.
What'll it be?

371
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,459
You know me. I ain't particular,
so long as it don't jump up and bite me.

372
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,435
- But I've been drinking bourbon.
- What have you been drinkin'?

373
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,267
Nothing, but I'll take bourbon.

374
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:09,642
You oughta have been along. Maybe
you've been having too much fun here.

375
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,805
- I haven't been out for two months.
- Been sick?

376
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,874
I don't seem to get any fun
out of a good time anymore.

377
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,647
All the time I'm out, I'm thinkin'
of her and what she's doing...

378
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,780
and how soon I can get back to her.

379
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:27,489
Well, here's hoping I'll always
be around at the right time.

380
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,926
- What are you drinking?
- Sarsaparilla.

381
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,163
Stealin' the kid's drinks, huh?

382
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,296
Did you ever catch her
sneaking your oatmeal?

383
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,671
- Say, can I pick her up?
- Sure, go ahead.

384
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:47,345
Come to your Uncle Ed.
Got ya, girl.

385
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,816
Come on. Ain't you got a big smile
for your Uncle Ed?

386
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:55,117
Of course she has.
Come on. Smile for Uncle Ed.

387
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,093
- Edna!
- I'll get it.

388
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:03,289
If I could only see her
open that door just once.

389
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:05,595
- Come on.
- Come on, darlin'.

390
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,536
Smile for Uncle Ed.

391
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:32,284
- Oh, you remember Mr. Munn.
- How do you do?

392
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,521
- And Carrie Jenkins.
- Yes, how do you do?

393
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,266
I'll be getting along.

394
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:46,835
- Yes, darling.
- That's a fine baby you got there.

395
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:49,638
- Thank you. I think so.
- I gotta be going too, Ed.

396
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,144
Me too.

397
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,543
Just a minute.
I'll see you to the door.

398
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:00,220
Thanks for the good time.

399
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,381
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

400
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,096
Stella, I can't have our child
living this way.

401
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,861
- What's wrong this time?
- It's not just this time.

402
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:16,893
Because there was a couple of drinks?
What's wrong with that?

403
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:19,565
Coming in here with that
icebergy way of yours.

404
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,836
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

405
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,606
But she's my child, too,
and I won't have this.

406
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,274
I hadn't wanted to take Laurel
away from you, but if you--

407
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:33,011
Take her away from me?

408
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,578
What are you talking about?

409
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:38,888
How dare you say such a thing?
Give her to me.

410
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,054
- Give her to me, I say!
- You mustn't do this.

411
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,428
Watch out!
You're hurting her!

412
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,433
Get out.

413
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,901
Did he frighten
Mommy's little girl?

414
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:52,906
Don't you cry.

415
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:56,637
Mommy's right here.
Mommy won't let anybody hurt you.

416
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,385
There, there.

417
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:11,653
You're here with Mommy, and nobody
in the world will ever take you away.

418
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,327
Nobody.

419
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,619
Thank you.

420
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:42,155
- Boy.
- That's cute.

421
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,194
Would you like to include
one of those too?

422
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,856
She's a little too grown up now,
I'm afraid. That's all.

423
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,024
Come on, fellas.
Mother's ready.

424
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,433
- Come on, boys.
- Mother, he rows it himself.

425
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:59,098
Can't we wait until he winds it again?
I want you to see how it goes.

426
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:02,700
- Thank you, Mr. Dallas.
- You'll send those right away?

427
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:07,872
- Helen.
- Oh, Stephen.

428
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,543
- I'm so glad to see you.
- And you.

429
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,712
Boys, come here, please.

430
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,915
- Stephen, these are my sons.
- How do you do, young gentlemen?

431
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,924
How do you do?

432
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:21,325
This is Mr. Dallas, whom your mother
has known for such a long time.

433
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:22,556
John.

434
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,723
- How do you do?
- Lee.

435
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,892
- And Cornelius.
- Con.

436
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,232
He doesn't like
to be called Cornelius.

437
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,068
I do too.
It was my father's name.

438
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:35,835
- Was?
- Con's the man of the family now.

439
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,539
He looks after us all so beautifully.
His father would be very proud.

440
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:42,913
Splendid. Nothing but the finest care
would be good enough for your mother.

441
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,111
But, Stephen,
tell us about you.

442
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:48,986
I gave up all thought of ever
seeing you again such a long time ago.

443
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:51,423
- What are you doing here?
- New York? I'm in business here.

444
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,960
If you mean this store, I'm buying
birthday presents for my daughter.

445
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:56,258
Your daughter? Oh, Stephen.

446
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,996
- Here she is.
- Oh, she's pretty.

447
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:04,334
- When may we meet her and her mother?
- They're not here.

448
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:07,863
Laurel goes to school near Boston,
and her mother spends her time with her.

449
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:10,638
I have so many things to hear
and to tell.

450
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:14,648
- Can you lunch with us?
- I should be back at the office now.

451
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:18,447
We'd be glad to have you, if you
don't mind carrying your own tray.

452
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,250
John's been saving up for a whole month
to take us to lunch. It's his treat.

453
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:26,521
That's all right. I got enough for
one more, if you don't eat too much.

454
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:28,960
How 'bout it, Mr. Dallas?

455
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,796
- I can't refuse an offer like that.
- Oh, good. Come along.

456
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,960
If you run short,
I'll lend you a couple of dollars.

457
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,469
Gee, thanks.

458
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,139
Oh, books again.

459
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,176
I've got a good mind to tell him
she can get books from the library.

460
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:48,841
But there's no place where you
can get a fur coat for nothing.

461
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:53,410
Boy, what I wouldn't give
to see her in one.

462
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,517
Oh, well. Here.

463
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:59,151
Hide them with the rest
and let me get on with this...

464
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,162
or it won't be ready for Christmas,
let alone her birthday.

465
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,096
- Gladys, where's Mother?
- Now, let me see.

466
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,330
She's--

467
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,169
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

468
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,266
Miss Phillibrown, my teacher,
came home with me.

469
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:18,676
- She wants to see you.
- If I'd known, I could have fixed up.

470
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,579
Look at me. I'm a sight.
Look at the things all--

471
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,082
Oh, dear.

472
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,085
Mother, this is Miss Phillibrown.

473
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:30,590
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet ya.

474
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:34,424
- Won't you sit down?
- I haven't a minute, but--

475
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:38,522
Thank you. My dear, I wonder
if I might have a glass of water.

476
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,226
- Of course. You too?
- No.

477
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:42,599
Maybe she'd rather have sarsaparilla.
I have some on ice.

478
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,331
- No, thank you.
- All right.

479
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:45,997
She's such a darling.

480
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:49,305
I didn't want to talk in front of her
in case she might be disappointed.

481
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:53,939
I spend the weekends in Boston.
May I borrow Laurel for this one?

482
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:58,577
I couldn't get her ready this time,
but if you'd ask her again--

483
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:01,121
Lollie thinks the world of you.

484
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:05,091
I know she'd have a wonderful time,
seeing some decent shows...

485
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,093
not just movies.

486
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:10,221
I had in mind
the galleries and museums.

487
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,028
- She seems so interested.
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:16,002
She's crazy about that stuff.
She gets it from her father.

489
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,004
Her father?

490
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,233
You see,
I've only heard about you.

491
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,039
Oh. 'Course, she don't see
as much of her father.

492
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:26,205
Mr. Dallas' business
keeps him in New York.

493
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,807
- Really?
- But I always spend vacation with him.

494
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:32,648
Up in Maine, in the woods.
Have you ever been there?

495
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,847
Oh, it's beautiful.

496
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:38,449
Your mother's given her permission
for you to spend a weekend in Boston.

497
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:41,427
- When?
- Very soon.

498
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,330
Oh, thank you, Miss Phillibrown.

499
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,095
- I really must go.
- Oh, must ya?

500
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,067
- Good-bye, Mrs. Dallas.
- Good-bye. Come again.

501
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,132
Thank you.

502
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,939
- Good-bye, Laurel, dear.
- Good-bye, Miss Phillibrown.

503
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:01,776
- Mother, isn't she the nicest?
- Yes, darling.

504
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,716
- Did you ask her to the party?
- No. You think she'd come?

505
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,947
Of course. Why not?

506
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,290
Mother! For the party?

507
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,653
What did you do that for?
You're always sticking your--

508
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:18,665
Mother, I'm sorry.

509
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,297
Come here.
I didn't mean to--

510
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:27,565
You know how I always fly off,
and l--

511
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:30,133
Well, I wanted it
to be a surprise--

512
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:38,876
Well, now that you've seen it,
you may as well slip it on...

513
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:42,821
and let me fit you
instead of this thing.

514
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,222
- Dummy.
- Oh, it's blue.

515
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:58,537
There.

516
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,744
- It's beautiful!
- Careful. Don't mash the ruffles.

517
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:10,443
Now. Oh, yeah, I forgot.
This goes here.

518
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:13,180
- Oh, no.
- Yes, it gives it a little snap.

519
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,849
You're just like your father. You want
everything plain as an old shoe.

520
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,256
Plain? With all these
beautiful, handmade ruffles.

521
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,955
Now, turn around.
Yes, the length's all right.

522
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:27,092
It's just the sleeves.
Take it off, let me get on with it.

523
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:29,932
- Yoo-hoo! What's going on in there?
- Come on in, Ed.

524
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:32,768
Wait till I get out.

525
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,774
What is this?
A Follies dressing room?

526
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,208
What's the matter?

527
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,542
He shouldn't see me like this.

528
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,050
Ed's known you since you were knee-high
and seen you with hardly anything on.

529
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,052
Even less than that. What have you
got to hide from your uncle?

530
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,520
- Let me see.
- Mother, make him stop.

531
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,057
Stop!
Lollie, don't be a little fool.

532
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,389
I wish you wouldn't tease her.
You know she don't like it.

533
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,662
I know, but I get a kick from
a young one being so finicky.

534
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,168
Well.

535
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:06,129
- Your car downstairs?
- No.

536
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,198
It's in the shop. Why?

537
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:12,007
I wanted to go to town and get
the decorations for the party.

538
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,742
Why not go in on the train?
Take the kid, see a show, have dinner.

539
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,512
No, I don't want her
to know what I'm getting.

540
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:20,520
Oh, I see.

541
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:25,083
I guess I could show you
a better time without her.

542
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,092
- How long will you be?
- I won't be long.

543
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,569
- Unless you got a drink here--
- I got sarsaparilla.

544
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,936
I'll meet you at the corner.

545
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,412
Sarsaparilla.

546
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,006
Honest, some of the things
I do for you.

547
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:53,520
You'll like it when you get used to it,
and it's good for you too.

548
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:01,056
- What's that?
- You can read, can't you?

549
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:03,062
Itch powder?

550
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,097
Things are just a little
too quiet around here.

551
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,465
Hey, can I see that?
What's the name of that horse?

552
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,033
- What's the matter?
- I got a ticket on it.

553
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,809
- Kokomo wins. I'm rich!
- Let me shake your hand.

554
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,042
Thank you.

555
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,483
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

556
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,953
- I'm awfully glad.
- I stand to win $30,000.

557
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:30,991
- Good.
- Have a cigar.

558
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,320
- What happened?
- Have a cigar.

559
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,762
- Sir!
- You want gum. We go to all parts here.

560
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,062
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

561
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,500
- Say, that was great luck.
- Did you see what happened?

562
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,538
He won $30,000 on a horse race.

563
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:48,564
- You're kidding.
- Kidding?

564
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,576
Watch 'em commence.

565
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,320
I can't stand it.

566
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:08,192
Another one just bit the dust.

567
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:10,728
You're killing me.

568
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,797
Get the old girls.

569
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:23,833
They're doing a sister act.
They must have rehearsed.

570
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,549
What's so funny?

571
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,529
Now what'd you do?

572
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,270
Come on, look.
They're two down there.

573
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:55,633
Gee, Ed, I don't see how you
can keep such a straight face.

574
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,576
What's a little kidding
among friends?

575
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,080
- Is that the father?
- No, it can't be.

576
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,548
She particularly said
her husband was in New York.

577
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,212
Such women don't deserve
to have children.

578
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,353
The one way to drink sarsaparilla
is so it don't taste like sarsaparilla.

579
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:17,397
Do you mind?
You want some?

580
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:20,923
Laurel's such a lovely child.
I don't know what to think.

581
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,299
Mary Anne's been asked
to her party.

582
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,903
Scratch that first entry of yours
and give somebody else a chance.

583
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:34,573
- Honest, I'd do anything--
- Please don't, Ed.

584
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:39,210
It's like I told you.
It's not personal.

585
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:43,484
I don't think there's a man living
that could get me goin' anymore.

586
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:48,654
I don't know. I guess Lollie just
uses up all the feelings I've got.

587
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:50,993
I don't seem to have any left
for anybody else.

588
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,125
You got plenty for me.

589
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,295
Why can't we go on as we are?

590
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,238
I don't know what
I would have done without you...

591
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:02,241
when Loli was with Stephen.

592
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:05,938
You're such a good sport
and such a lot of fun.

593
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,881
I guess you know
what you're doing.

594
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,582
- What's the matter?
- I got some of that stuff on me.

595
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:17,715
Wouldn't that be a hit?
I have.

596
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,656
It's all over here.

597
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,102
Gladys, are you nearly ready?
I have to let her in.

598
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:34,073
I'm ready. Miss Dallas!

599
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:36,507
Do I look all right?
None of them have ever seen me.

600
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,511
She's always telling them
how beautiful I am.

601
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,513
Honey, you sure
can live up to it.

602
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,516
But if I live through this day,
I'm gonna get me another corset.

603
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,017
Coming, dear.

604
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:59,030
How ever did you do it?

605
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,360
Oh, and you, Mother.

606
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,701
You look beautiful.

607
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:08,774
Do I?

608
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:14,839
Some favors!

609
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:17,782
Don't pull 'em. They pop
and have little hats inside.

610
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:21,150
- And little baskets.
- I put candies in with the nuts.

611
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:24,851
The place cards! They're beautiful.
Where did you get them?

612
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,655
I sit there,
and you sit here.

613
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:30,561
And Miss Phillibrown next to me,
and Flo Bell.

614
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,565
And Alice May.

615
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:38,068
Mother,
could I see the cake?

616
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:40,865
Go ahead.

617
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,134
Oh, look!

618
00:42:45,212 --> 00:42:49,205
- One, two, three, four, five, six--
- You like it?

619
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,217
Here somebody is!

620
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:55,681
- Let Gladys go.
- All right.

621
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:58,247
Remember what I told you.
Yeah.

622
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:04,588
- Is this the Dallas residence?
- Yes.

623
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,895
Sign here, please.

624
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,901
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

625
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,097
It's for you, Lollie.

626
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,437
Don't forget to say Laurel
in front of other people.

627
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,909
- Yes, ma'am.
- What is it?

628
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:20,606
It's from Miss Phillibrown.
She can't come.

629
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,342
What did she say?

630
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:25,442
"Dear, I'm sorry it's impossible
for me to come to your party...

631
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,714
but I'm thinking of you
this afternoon...

632
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,154
and I hope you will not
be disappointed.

633
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:32,715
Sincerely, your friend
Margaret Phillibrown."

634
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:34,727
That's too bad.

635
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:39,459
I do wish she could've come
just to see everything. And you.

636
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,196
Well, I'll fix up again
for her sometime.

637
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,364
Most likely the girls will have
a better time without her.

638
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,568
They see enough of her in school.
I know I did my teachers.

639
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:52,077
Everyone loves Miss Phillibrown.

640
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:54,080
Take these, please.

641
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,981
Well, anyway,
it'll make an even number.

642
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:00,245
Sure.

643
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,687
Come on. We'll wait
in the other room.

644
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,690
You sit over there.

645
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:18,400
Let Gladys go.
Remember what I told you.

646
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:21,100
- Miss Dallas' residence.
- That's right.

647
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,844
Miss Dallas' residence.

648
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,347
Okay. I'll tell her.

649
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,349
- Who was it?
- Miss Cheeny.

650
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,351
She says Alice May can't come.

651
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,852
Who?

652
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:39,023
Alice May Cheeny.
She sits next to me in school.

653
00:44:47,835 --> 00:44:50,235
It'll make the table look better.

654
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:52,534
It won't be so crowded.

655
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:56,609
I'll fix it.

656
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:38,742
I better make some more biscuits.
The others is all dried up.

657
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,585
Yeah. Let's do that.
That's a very good idea.

658
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,757
You know, Mother.
They're not coming, or they'd be here.

659
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,094
Oh, Lollie, you don't think that--

660
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,267
We'll go in together.

661
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:43,807
I never know what to look for.
You change so much each time.

662
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,251
- Do I look older?
- Older? You're a young lady.

663
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:51,121
- Your wardrobe's growing up too.
- I have a costume for everything.

664
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:53,421
Fine, because we have
a wonderful invitation...

665
00:46:53,494 --> 00:46:56,657
to spend our whole time together in
the most beautiful place in the world.

666
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,255
Better than Maine?
Where?

667
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,267
You'll see.

668
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,401
- How are you?
- Martha, this is my daughter, Laurel.

669
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:08,032
How do you do?

670
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:10,872
Oh, Daddy, how beautiful.

671
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,472
- This is Mrs. Morrison.
- How do you do?

672
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,849
- So glad to see you.
- I'm so glad to see you too.

673
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,856
Michael, this is Laurel
we've been waiting to meet.

674
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,951
Now, don't overdo it.

675
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:30,121
He's such a nice dog.

676
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:33,030
- Where are the boys?
- Still down at the stables.

677
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,661
Tell them their surprise is here.
You don't mind being a surprise?

678
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:39,365
Come on, Mike,
we'll go fetch 'em.

679
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,532
I'll show Laurel her room.

680
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:50,783
It's lovely.

681
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:01,327
How sweet.

682
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,724
If you let me have your keys,
I'll have Martha unpack you.

683
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,734
Oh, I can do it.

684
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,575
I'll take your coat.

685
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,577
Yes, thank you.

686
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:22,848
And your hat.

687
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:31,918
Oh, everything.

688
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,552
I like nice closets too.

689
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,562
We'll hang this here.

690
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:51,141
I'm so glad you brought
your riding clothes.

691
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:54,146
It was one of the things on my list,
to ride in Central Park.

692
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:56,614
We'll be using them here too.

693
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:00,785
And so many pretty dresses.

694
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,288
The fun your mother must have
choosing them for you.

695
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,291
She makes them all.

696
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,293
She does?

697
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,454
Oh, how clever.

698
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:13,056
What a lucky girl you are.
How lucky she is too.

699
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:15,795
All boys want to wear
are overalls.

700
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:20,368
I suppose you want to freshen up.
But don't change.

701
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:26,007
I'll see that your father has his tea.
He has to get right back to town.

702
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:29,848
Come down when you're ready.
Don't keep the boys waiting too long.

703
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,850
Thank you.

704
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:58,408
They won't acknowledge they like her.
They haven't got as far as that.

705
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:02,346
But have you noticed the hair brushing
and collar wearing going on?

706
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,475
I have.

707
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:06,519
Mother...

708
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,884
am I too little
to dance with Laurel?

709
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:12,015
- Did she say so?
- No, but Con did.

710
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:16,995
If I wanted to dance with Laurel,
I'd ask her, not Con.

711
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:18,998
I will.

712
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,034
Big intrigue.

713
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,438
Let me have it.
You'll drop it.

714
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,474
I will not.

715
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:32,205
- Why don't you let Con carry it?
- I wanna carry it.

716
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,509
- Good-bye. It's been fun.
- Oh, yes.

717
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:36,549
We'll look forward so
to next time.

718
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,052
I've had such a lovely time,
I don't know how to thank you.

719
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:46,385
Good-bye, Laurel.
I brought your suitcase.

720
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,154
- Here's a present for you.
- Thank you so much.

721
00:50:57,604 --> 00:50:59,731
Good-bye!

722
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:04,001
Oh, aren't they the nicest boys?

723
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:07,069
I think so.
How did you like Mrs. Morrison?

724
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,843
I think she's
the loveliest lady I ever knew.

725
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,907
Do you really, Laurel?

726
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,977
Oh, I mean-- I mean--

727
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,523
Of course, I mean,
except my mother.

728
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:22,995
Mother, how nice!

729
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:26,922
It's a little stuffy.
I'm gonna open a window.

730
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,934
All right.

731
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:33,997
You happy?

732
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:36,565
I guess I'll shove off.
You two got lots to talk about.

733
00:51:36,643 --> 00:51:38,702
So, what are you
gonna eat, Ed?

734
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:40,770
Me? I don't know.
I ain't very hungry.

735
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,111
I thought maybe
I'd stop in at--

736
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,117
Come back
and have dinner with us.

737
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,622
- You only bought two chops.
- One for you, one for Lollie.

738
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,681
I'm so happy,
I couldn't even look at a meal.

739
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:54,954
- What time?
- An hour.

740
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,589
So long, lollipops. I'll come back
and tie on the nose bag with ya.

741
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:02,967
- Want me to bring anything?
- No, thanks.

742
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,201
Why did you? I thought we were
gonna have a nice, quiet time alone.

743
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:13,041
So did I, Lollie, darling.

744
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:16,048
Things haven't been going
so good for poor Ed lately.

745
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:19,051
You'd never know it
to hear him talk.

746
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,054
You remember that big watch
and chain he used to wear?

747
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:25,148
Well, they're just
not there anymore.

748
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,159
I'm sorry.

749
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,998
She's not here anymore.
I let her go.

750
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,759
What did I need
with anybody around?

751
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:38,828
Oh, Mother, you shouldn't have.

752
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:43,342
Besides, I was glad to have something
to do to help pass the time away.

753
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,002
You know what I did?

754
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:49,674
I saved enough money out of her wages
for a deposit on a fur coat for you.

755
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:53,149
Mother, you didn't.

756
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,381
You're just going to
get it right back.

757
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:57,480
I don't want a fur coat now.

758
00:52:57,557 --> 00:53:00,685
None of the girls at Mrs. Morrison's
are allowed to have them yet.

759
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,193
Oh, no?

760
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:07,098
Here.

761
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,769
You know what I've been thinking?

762
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,501
Would it cost too awfully much
for us to have a house...

763
00:53:15,575 --> 00:53:18,169
with our own front door
and a little garden and flowers...

764
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:20,440
and a room for each of us?

765
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:24,040
Just in case sometimes we wanted
somebody to stay all night.

766
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:28,213
Mother, not a great big
expensive house like Mrs. Morrison's...

767
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:31,052
but just a little tiny place.

768
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,116
Say, tell me
about this Mrs. Morrison.

769
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:37,163
- What's she like?
- Mother, she's lovely.

770
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,164
She's sort of--

771
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,660
Well, she reminds me
of a flower...

772
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:45,796
that grows up in Maine.

773
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:49,433
All pale and delicate,
but strong too.

774
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:51,670
I don't know what you call it.

775
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:54,737
I don't care what kind
of a flower she looks like.

776
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,250
Is she tall or short,
dark or light, fat or thin?

777
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,550
- How old is she?
- She's not any special age.

778
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:07,025
She's like one of those goddesses
in my mythology book that way.

779
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:12,163
Come now. You can tell
whether she's 20 or 40.

780
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:15,030
Oh, she's not 40, no.

781
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:18,161
I guess maybe she's about 25.

782
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:22,265
And how did your father
happen to meet this goddess?

783
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,106
It's like a story.
Con told me all about it.

784
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,237
Con. Is that her husband?

785
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:29,839
Oh, no, he's dead.
Didn't I write you?

786
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:33,545
Dead, is he?
Well, that's convenient.

787
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,111
No, it isn't a bit convenient.

788
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,283
When Mr. Morrison died,
he left a whole lot of houses...

789
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,293
and horses and money.

790
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,728
Mrs. Morrison has to look out
for them all by herself.

791
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,289
She said she wouldn't know
what to do...

792
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,801
without Father to help her
and advise her.

793
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,804
Yeah. I can just imagine.

794
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,374
I just remembered.
I've got some snapshots of her.

795
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,142
- I just want to look at you.
- I want you to see her.

796
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,479
She's beautiful.
You'll be crazy about her!

797
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,525
The funny thing about her is that
she's not only beautiful all dressed...

798
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:14,890
but even when she wakes up
in the morning.

799
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:16,986
She spends hardly any time
on her face.

800
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,759
Once I saw her put soap and water
right on it.

801
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:22,631
All I can say is there are
different kinds of skin.

802
00:55:22,702 --> 00:55:27,002
Besides, with her money,
she don't have to worry about her looks.

803
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:31,100
Say, are those real pearls
she's got slung around her neck?

804
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:33,111
- Look what you're doing!
- What?

805
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:35,170
You're getting cold cream
all over her picture.

806
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,910
- I didn't mean it.
- Give it to me.

807
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,370
I'll do it.

808
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,025
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

809
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:26,463
Jingle all the--

810
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,967
Hi, lollipops.

811
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:38,067
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

812
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:45,249
Here is the mistletoe.
Now, where's the kiss?

813
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:52,748
Run along. Go inside.

814
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,920
What do you mean by showing up
here in this condition? Get out.

815
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,259
I've got something for you.

816
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,997
I've been robbed.

817
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,771
Why, if I thought
that anybody would take--

818
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,483
Here you are, my dear.

819
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,643
A very Merry Christmas.

820
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:23,018
No, thanks. I can't take it.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

821
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:25,023
Oh. What to do with it.

822
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:27,718
Cook it.

823
00:57:27,794 --> 00:57:29,728
Run along,
give it to somebody else.

824
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:32,731
Me give my chicken to somebody else?
You think I'm gonna do that?

825
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,523
You come out of there.

826
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,477
Ed, what are you trying to do,
set the place on fire?

827
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,316
Cookin' a turkey.

828
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:57,783
Get that thing out of here.

829
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:02,225
- I say yes.
- Don't tell me how to cook a turkey.

830
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:04,593
I know how to cook a turkey.

831
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:07,497
- Now, come on.
- Now, listen.

832
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,401
I know how to cook it,
and so there.

833
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:15,168
The feet won't be very well done,
but I don't care for feet anyway.

834
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,709
Ed, be reasonable.

835
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:24,673
- Merry Christmas.
- Father!

836
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,742
I'm so glad to see you.

837
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:29,049
And am I glad to see you.

838
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,017
What a nice surprise.

839
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,253
You should see the way
I've been running to the door.

840
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:39,321
I never dreamed of anything so wonderful
as your bringing them yourself.

841
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:43,267
Ooh, what a lovely tree.
Here you are.

842
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:46,396
Oh, thank you, Daddy.

843
00:58:46,472 --> 00:58:49,464
I'll put them right here
while I go call Mother.

844
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:52,033
I'll take your coat and hat.

845
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,508
This is a fine Christmas spirit.
You don't have anything in the house.

846
00:58:57,584 --> 00:59:00,553
Strawberry. There you are.
Strawberry.

847
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,554
And lemon.

848
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,055
Peach.

849
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,386
What is this?
This is more sarsaparilla.

850
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,431
Of all the places I ever saw,
a man can't have any--

851
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:16,434
Go inside and keep him company.
I'll get dressed as fast as I can.

852
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:20,734
What are you whispering?

853
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,970
- You've got to go. I've got company.
- Oh, company.

854
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,341
- Who's the company?
- Never you mind. Just go.

855
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:28,573
I'd like to see the guy.

856
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,417
I tell you, Stella, no, sir.

857
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:37,149
I'm gonna sit right here
until I find out who the company is.

858
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:39,987
No, you're not.
You're gonna go.

859
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:42,425
Pushin' and a-shovin'!

860
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,488
I think the company
would like the turkey too.

861
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:48,500
It was the biggest turkey
I could find.

862
00:59:48,568 --> 00:59:50,763
One of the finest turks
that the man had.

863
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,738
I never saw such a big turkey
in all of my life.

864
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:57,768
Daddy, a wristwatch.
How lovely.

865
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,607
- Do you like it, darling?
- Yes.

866
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,113
You're getting so grown up,
I don't know what to buy for you.

867
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,541
Mother copied it from one we saw
in the window of a shop in Boston.

868
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,554
- You can hardly tell the difference.
- It is pretty, isn't it?

869
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:21,615
- It was my best present till you came.
- Oh, you doll.

870
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:26,725
Well!

871
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,236
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

872
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:33,465
It's good to see you again.

873
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:35,507
- Well, it's good to see you.
- Sit down.

874
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:37,600
Thank you.

875
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:41,044
- The place looks awfully nice.
- You'll go to dinner with us?

876
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,948
Well, darling, l--
I came to ask your mother a favor.

877
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:51,121
I was wondering if you'd let me have
Laurel for the holidays this time.

878
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,750
I've never had a place
for her before.

879
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:57,318
This time we have an invitation
to spend it with the Morrisons.

880
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,900
Well.

881
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,961
- Would you like to go, Lollie?
- Yes.

882
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:09,804
- Oh, that is, if--
- Oh, I think it would be lovely.

883
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:16,880
- When would you want her?
- Well, my train leaves in an hour.

884
01:02:16,949 --> 01:02:19,816
I was hoping I could
take her back with me.

885
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:23,447
- Today?
- No, not today. I couldn't, Father.

886
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:26,253
Mother and I
had something all planned.

887
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,293
Well, yes, we did, but--

888
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,530
Well, we could do that anytime.

889
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:44,743
Come on.
We'll have to hurry.

890
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:48,540
You have your new coat,
and you'll want these things.

891
01:02:48,614 --> 01:02:51,447
I'll just get her started.
Excuse us. Hurry.

892
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:57,120
- There's your case there.
- Will this do for the train?

893
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,784
That's fine. Pack what you need now,
and I'll send your trunk on tonight.

894
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,121
All right.

895
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:04,594
She won't be very long.

896
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:07,155
This is for you, Stella.

897
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:09,167
Oh, thank you.

898
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,537
Stella, I'm awfully sorry...

899
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:17,667
when I see all you've done here,
and you did have plans.

900
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:20,541
- I didn't realize--
- Oh, it wasn't anything, really.

901
01:03:20,613 --> 01:03:24,105
We were just going to a show
and dinner at the Bontonne.

902
01:03:24,183 --> 01:03:26,117
This'll be
a real treat for her.

903
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:32,151
It's been so long
since I've seen you.

904
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,523
- How have you been?
- Well, thank you.

905
01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:37,290
- And you?
- Oh, fine.

906
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:39,388
That's good.

907
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:41,456
Too bad your train
leaves so early.

908
01:03:42,935 --> 01:03:46,462
Stella, l--
I've been thinking.

909
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:49,303
I don't know why it didn't
occur to me before...

910
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:53,004
but there's no earthly reason
why you should spend today all alone...

911
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,344
just because I've been
selfish and thoughtless.

912
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,349
There must be a later train.

913
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,818
Where's the telephone?
Shall we call and see?

914
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:05,221
Oh, yes, please!

915
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,225
Here.

916
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:18,500
Beacon Hill 3700, please.

917
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,034
Fooled you, didn't I?

918
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,601
You put me out the back door
and I went around again...

919
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:28,374
right in here.

920
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:32,008
Just where is all this company
that I'm being kicked out because of?

921
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:37,021
I'm gonna tell you this. You're not
gonna feed 'em my turkey. No, sir.

922
01:04:37,089 --> 01:04:38,681
Not--

923
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,822
I beg your pardon.
I guess l--

924
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:52,294
Oh, I'm sorry, Stella.
I didn't mean to--

925
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,943
I guess I'll go now.

926
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:01,513
Mr. Dallas.

927
01:05:09,722 --> 01:05:12,987
He's had a little too much
Christmas, I guess.

928
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:15,289
He was here a while ago
and brought a turkey.

929
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:17,420
I had a terrible time
getting rid of him.

930
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,365
- What did you find out about the train?
- I'm afraid it'll be too late.

931
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:25,165
I'm sorry.

932
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:31,142
I'm all ready.
Was I very long?

933
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,144
Not at all, darling.

934
01:05:34,814 --> 01:05:37,749
Good-bye, Stella.
I'll take good care of her.

935
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:39,751
Bye, Stephen.

936
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:41,753
Good-bye, Mother.

937
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:47,358
- Good-bye, Stella.
- Bye.

938
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:49,724
Thank you for letting me go.

939
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,847
- Mrs. Dallas, Mr. Morley.
- How do you do, Mrs. Dallas?

940
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:10,142
Won't you sit down, please?

941
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:18,652
I wrote you a letter,
and in it I stated--

942
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,124
Don't tell me what you stated.
Just tell me what you meant.

943
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:25,857
It's only natural to suppose that you
should wish to legalize your position--

944
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:28,661
Legalize my position?
I've got a marriage license.

945
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,259
What are you tryin' to give me?

946
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:34,500
Your freedom.
A divorce.

947
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:38,600
Mr. Dallas feels,
and I can readily understand why...

948
01:06:38,678 --> 01:06:41,545
that you might wish to remarry.

949
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:47,211
Let's get down to brass tacks. I haven't
the slightest idea of ever remarryin'.

950
01:06:47,286 --> 01:06:50,813
Now, it don't happen,
by any chance, to be...

951
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:53,688
Mr. Dallas who wishes
to remarry, does it?

952
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,092
Well, assuming for the moment
that it does...

953
01:06:57,163 --> 01:06:59,723
surely you could have
no objection.

954
01:06:59,799 --> 01:07:02,097
Your allowance would be the same.

955
01:07:02,168 --> 01:07:06,070
As a matter of fact, Mr. Dallas might
even be able to increase the amount--

956
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:09,107
I don't want any increases. Let him
keep it, and let me keep my daughter.

957
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:13,544
Mr. Dallas has no intention
of any change regarding your daughter.

958
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:18,447
Oh, he hasn't. Then what's he
been tryin' to win her away for?

959
01:07:18,517 --> 01:07:21,748
Takin' her to fine hotels,
country places, town houses.

960
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:24,756
Makin' her dissatisfied with
the kinds of things I been givin' her.

961
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:28,817
Does he think I don't see what he's
after? He'll never get away with it.

962
01:07:28,894 --> 01:07:32,591
I'm gonna give her the same things.
Everything her heart's been set on.

963
01:07:32,665 --> 01:07:37,602
Fine hotels, fancy friends. I'm gonna
give 'em to her, and he'll pay for 'em.

964
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,036
If he's got any increases,
he can hand 'em over.

965
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:42,040
If he don't,
maybe I'll get a lawyer...

966
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:44,099
and bring in the name
of that highfalutin widow!

967
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:48,374
I won't keep ya any longer, Mr. Morley.
Thank you very much.

968
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:52,383
Just see the check is mailed to the same
place. That's all the benefits I want.

969
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,224
This one'll do.
Look, put some more lace on it--

970
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:44,092
I'm sorry!

971
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:46,104
Nice one.

972
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:49,998
You're wonderful, Laurel.

973
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:52,202
Dick, you threw me
that last game.

974
01:08:52,278 --> 01:08:56,806
The last one came over like a bullet.
Is that any way to treat your teacher?

975
01:08:56,882 --> 01:09:01,615
- That's the way to take him over.
- What's the matter? Losing your edge?

976
01:09:01,687 --> 01:09:04,747
- Laurel, this is Mrs. Clews.
- I'm glad to know you.

977
01:09:04,824 --> 01:09:07,588
- You're improving rapidly.
- My teacher.

978
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,458
We're gonna have Dad's box for
the polo game. Won't you come with us?

979
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:12,690
Oh, I'd love to.

980
01:09:12,765 --> 01:09:15,029
But I should spend
the afternoon with my mother.

981
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,398
See ya at dinner then. Bye.

982
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:20,802
- How is your mother today?
- Oh, she's much better, thank you.

983
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:24,741
Couldn't Mrs. Clews and I visit her
this afternoon while you go to the polo?

984
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:26,744
- Oh, yes.
- That's an idea, Mother.

985
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:28,939
I've been looking forward
to meeting her.

986
01:09:29,014 --> 01:09:31,380
It's unfortunate
she's been ill all the time.

987
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,384
- What do you say?
- I'll have to ask Mother.

988
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:35,647
- Come on.
- All right!

989
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:37,916
- I'll call you.
- All right.

990
01:09:45,965 --> 01:09:47,330
Hello, darling.

991
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:51,629
- Did you have a good time?
- Oh, heavenly.

992
01:09:51,704 --> 01:09:56,038
Richard's mother and a Mrs. Clews I
just met want me to go to the polo game.

993
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,407
And they want to spend
the afternoon with you.

994
01:09:59,478 --> 01:10:02,504
And see me for the first time
in my nightgown? Huh!

995
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:06,017
I should say not. And me
with a trunk full of new clothes...

996
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:09,077
my skin is just itchin'
to get next to.

997
01:10:09,154 --> 01:10:14,023
Goodness gracious. But you go along,
and say I was asleep.

998
01:10:14,093 --> 01:10:16,027
No, I won't leave you
alone again.

999
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:18,655
There's no sense in the two of us
being cooped up here.

1000
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:23,031
I'll be all right in a few days. I'll
get all fixed up and meet your friends.

1001
01:10:23,102 --> 01:10:26,037
You know what I was thinkin'?

1002
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:29,006
The first night I'm able
to go down in the dining room...

1003
01:10:29,074 --> 01:10:32,168
we'll have this Richard
and his mother to dinner with us.

1004
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:34,178
Would ya like that?

1005
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:41,045
I knew you would.

1006
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:47,984
Go on, now. Run along.
You mustn't keep him waiting.

1007
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,120
Wear your blue jacket.
I love ya in that.

1008
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,184
Boy. Oh, boy.

1009
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:31,548
Listen, will you tell me
which lady is Mrs. Richard Grosvenor?

1010
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:35,192
Mrs. Grosvenor's
not here, ma'am.

1011
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,525
Oh, then please direct me
to the tennis court. Maybe she's there.

1012
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:40,963
Just across the lawn
and down that path.

1013
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:43,661
You mean sort of over that way
and down there?

1014
01:13:43,735 --> 01:13:46,602
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh. Wait a minute.

1015
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:50,875
- Here you are, young fellow.
- Oh, that's all right.

1016
01:13:50,943 --> 01:13:53,741
- Don't be sill'.
- Thank you.

1017
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,630
Here goes a birdie.

1018
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,227
- Did I say birdie?
- Well, whoo!

1019
01:14:34,586 --> 01:14:37,646
- Tryin' to cover it up, huh?
- No, I'll wear it everywhere.

1020
01:14:40,926 --> 01:14:44,293
Did you see the makeup on her?
And those shoes!

1021
01:14:44,363 --> 01:14:46,456
Why, I thought
she was wearing stilts.

1022
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:48,466
- Hello.
- Hi, kids. How are you?

1023
01:14:48,534 --> 01:14:50,468
Come on.
Move down one seat.

1024
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:52,470
Whatever happened to you two?
We've been back hours.

1025
01:14:52,538 --> 01:14:54,472
We took a shortcut.

1026
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,304
- Say, Paul, you sure missed a show.
- What'll it be, Mr. Grosvenor?

1027
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,076
- What show?
- That woman on the tennis court.

1028
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:06,549
I'll have a chocolate ice cream soda
with chocolate ice cream...

1029
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:08,552
and whipped cream on top.

1030
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,554
- What about her?
- Make mine the same...

1031
01:15:10,622 --> 01:15:14,058
only with vanilla ice cream
and leave off the goo.

1032
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:16,526
I didn't know they let
that kind of woman loose anymore.

1033
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,563
- Happy?
- You should've seen the getup.

1034
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,190
- What a woman!
- Maybe Dick knows her.

1035
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,757
- Dick, she was looking for your mother.
- Yeah?

1036
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:28,704
Pete lobbed one over the fence
and she started chasing after it.

1037
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,334
I never saw her before.
Who is she?

1038
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:35,176
I don't know, but I'd sure like
to know where she got that paint job.

1039
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:49,325
- It's a Christmas tree, not a woman.
- And it walks.

1040
01:15:49,394 --> 01:15:52,420
- Does it talk?
- And how!

1041
01:15:52,497 --> 01:15:56,365
- Good?
- Delicious.

1042
01:15:56,435 --> 01:15:59,268
That's the one.
I heard her say to Jimmy...

1043
01:15:59,338 --> 01:16:01,397
"You oughta see
my little girl play tennis."

1044
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,407
She must have some little girl.

1045
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:06,273
- No, I don't like it.
- It is rather heavy.

1046
01:16:06,345 --> 01:16:09,041
- Let me see that one.
- This one?

1047
01:16:09,114 --> 01:16:11,674
- She's an ad.
- An ad for what?

1048
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,514
We'll see in a minute.
Wait'll her hat lights up.

1049
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:16,554
You're all wrong.
It's a trailer.

1050
01:16:16,622 --> 01:16:19,557
Do you think that one
really suits my personality?

1051
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,957
- Yes, ma'am. Decidedly.
- You do.

1052
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:25,724
I'll take that.
Send it up to Room 214.

1053
01:16:25,797 --> 01:16:28,197
Thank you.

1054
01:16:30,269 --> 01:16:32,203
"Personality."

1055
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:35,873
Amy, get her.

1056
01:16:39,778 --> 01:16:42,770
- What's the matter?
- I must've lost my watch.

1057
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,908
Wait a minute. You can't go
all the way back there now.

1058
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:49,420
- When did you see it last?
- I want to go. Please let me go.

1059
01:16:49,488 --> 01:16:53,481
Don't worry about it. Let's finish
our sodas first. We'll find it.

1060
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:07,764
There you are.
I've been lookin' all over for you--

1061
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:12,536
Well, Lollie, what on earth--

1062
01:17:13,578 --> 01:17:16,012
- Mother, we're going home.
- Home?

1063
01:17:16,081 --> 01:17:18,481
What are you talking--

1064
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,780
- What's the matter? What's happened?
- Nothing.

1065
01:17:20,852 --> 01:17:23,047
Oh, I know.

1066
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,214
My little Lollie's had
a quarrel with her young man.

1067
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,385
Mother, please!

1068
01:17:29,461 --> 01:17:32,396
Oh, don't be a little goose.
I'll tell you what you do.

1069
01:17:32,464 --> 01:17:35,592
I'll invite him for dinner, make
believe I don't know anything about it.

1070
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,602
I'll pretend you're not back yet.
What's their number?

1071
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:46,277
I wanna go home.

1072
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,114
You wanna go home?

1073
01:17:51,616 --> 01:17:56,178
Well-- Well, what about me?

1074
01:17:56,254 --> 01:18:00,156
Payin' for two rooms all this time
and usin' only a bed.

1075
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:04,889
Don't you think I'd like a little
of the fun you've been havin'?

1076
01:18:04,963 --> 01:18:08,990
I should think you'd think
of somebody else besides yourself.

1077
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:11,194
You know...

1078
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:14,602
I like nice people
and a little fun myself.

1079
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:16,607
I'm sorry.

1080
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:22,636
I don't see how your pride would let you
show him you cared that much.

1081
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:27,549
If it was me, I'd stay on just to show
him that there's other fish in the sea.

1082
01:18:32,157 --> 01:18:34,250
It's only for you.

1083
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,294
Well, you said yourself
this morning...

1084
01:18:37,362 --> 01:18:41,298
you'd never been
so happy in all your life.

1085
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:43,266
And so was I too.

1086
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,301
- Oh, dear.
- Here.

1087
01:19:10,796 --> 01:19:12,991
Here you are, miss.

1088
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:16,133
Thank you.

1089
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:18,902
Board!

1090
01:19:25,076 --> 01:19:29,172
- She missed it as sure as you live.
- Oh, there she is.

1091
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:32,645
Nan! Did you have a blowout?

1092
01:19:32,717 --> 01:19:36,813
No, but just as I was leaving,
I met Ethel. Oh, I can't get my breath.

1093
01:19:36,888 --> 01:19:39,186
Here, sit down.

1094
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:41,191
I want to tell you what Ethel told me.

1095
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:44,456
You remember that funny-looking woman
parading around this afternoon?

1096
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,690
- No, I didn't see her.
- You didn't see her?

1097
01:19:46,765 --> 01:19:49,359
She can't be described.
You wouldn't believe it.

1098
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:52,926
I'll tell you, she was quite a number.
Her dress was up to here.

1099
01:19:53,004 --> 01:19:56,462
And paint an inch thick.
And bells on her shoes that tinkled--

1100
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:59,806
- Oh, not bells!
- And bracelets up to here that clanked.

1101
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:03,541
You never saw such a sight.
Anyway, do you know who she was?

1102
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:06,448
- Who?
- Laurel Dallas's mother.

1103
01:20:06,518 --> 01:20:08,645
Laurel Dallas!
Oh, I can't believe it!

1104
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,654
You mean that pretty little girl
Dick Grosvenor's been rushing?

1105
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:12,656
Yes. Didn't you know her?

1106
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:16,023
But are you sure?
She seemed so lovely and sweet.

1107
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:20,190
Isn't it weird? To have such
a common-looking creature for a mother?

1108
01:20:20,265 --> 01:20:22,927
- Poor thing.
- Poor nothing.

1109
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:24,935
She's wearing
Dick Grosvenor's fraternity pin.

1110
01:20:25,003 --> 01:20:28,734
-She won't be wearing it long.
-Not when Mrs. Grosvenor hears about it.

1111
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:31,241
- Your berths are ready, ladies.
- Thank you.

1112
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:36,144
-I want to tell you about--
-Ethel made it so interesting and funny.

1113
01:21:17,322 --> 01:21:20,780
- Lollie.
- It's lonely up there, Mother.

1114
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:23,760
I want to come down here
and cuddle with you.

1115
01:21:50,755 --> 01:21:55,419
I'd-- I'd like
to see Mrs. Morrison.

1116
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:58,394
- Was it in reference to--
- I couldn't say. It's private.

1117
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:01,193
I'd have to see Mrs. Morrison.

1118
01:22:01,266 --> 01:22:04,997
- What was the name, please?
- Mrs. Dallas.

1119
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:07,004
Mrs. Stephen Dallas.

1120
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,107
Yes.

1121
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:19,381
I will see if Mrs. Morrison is at home.
Come with me, please.

1122
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,987
- Just wait in there, please.
- Yeah.

1123
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:22,139
- Are you Mrs. Morrison?
- Yes.

1124
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:30,612
I'm sorry to bother you
in your home, but l--

1125
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:34,022
- Won't you sit down?
- What I have to say won't take long.

1126
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,993
- It's just that--
- Oh, we may as well be comfortable.

1127
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:38,996
It's so very warm.

1128
01:23:41,566 --> 01:23:43,659
Won't you take off your coat?

1129
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:47,796
I know you must think it's funny,
me comin' here like this.

1130
01:23:47,872 --> 01:23:51,774
I'm not gonna beat
around the bush, but...

1131
01:23:51,843 --> 01:23:56,075
what I wanna know is
if Stephen was free...

1132
01:23:56,147 --> 01:24:00,083
if I got a divorce
like his lawyer wanted, would--

1133
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:02,085
would you two get married?

1134
01:24:04,556 --> 01:24:06,922
Yes, we would.

1135
01:24:06,991 --> 01:24:09,687
I'm sorry if it's unpleasant, but--

1136
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:14,398
- I'd rather that you knew the truth.
- Yeah.

1137
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:17,993
Well, what I wanted to know is...

1138
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:21,368
if you and Stephen
did get married...

1139
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:24,237
well, what about Laurel?

1140
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:28,336
- Would ya take her too?
- Oh, no, Mrs. Dallas.

1141
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:31,942
I'm a mother.

1142
01:24:32,016 --> 01:24:35,417
Do you think I could ever deprive
another mother of her own little girl?

1143
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,580
Yeah, but if the mother
didn't want her--

1144
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,113
I mean, if she
couldn't very well have her.

1145
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:48,426
- If it was inconvenient.
- Inconvenient?

1146
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,060
Yeah. You see...

1147
01:24:51,136 --> 01:24:53,969
Lollie's growing up now,
and she--

1148
01:24:54,038 --> 01:24:56,370
well, she's quite
a responsibility.

1149
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:59,069
Oh, I don't understand.

1150
01:24:59,144 --> 01:25:01,374
Well, you see, it's this way.

1151
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:04,813
From now on, there's lots of things
Lollie ought to begin having.

1152
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:07,875
I don't mean money, but...

1153
01:25:07,952 --> 01:25:10,512
dances and parties, you know.

1154
01:25:10,588 --> 01:25:15,457
Good times, and really I've never been
much at that sort of thing.

1155
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:19,554
So I feel that I've done
about all I can for her.

1156
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:23,658
I thought that you being
so crazy about her father...

1157
01:25:23,735 --> 01:25:27,637
and she takin' after him so much
that...

1158
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:30,640
well, if you and Stephen
got married...

1159
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,643
why, Lollie could come
and live with you.

1160
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:38,415
And your name bein'
Mrs. Dallas, you see...

1161
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:42,249
everybody would naturally
think she was...

1162
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,118
your little girl.

1163
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:48,489
Then when ya went places,
you see...

1164
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,721
well--

1165
01:25:50,795 --> 01:25:54,492
You see, you're
the kind of a mother...

1166
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:58,229
that any girl would be proud of.

1167
01:26:01,306 --> 01:26:03,467
I didn't know anyone
could be so unselfish.

1168
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:07,477
And I'll say one thing. You'd never
be ashamed of Lollie either.

1169
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:11,606
Everybody's just crazy about her.
Oh, she makes a wonderful impression.

1170
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:15,210
She's so refined
and elegant in her ways, but--

1171
01:26:15,286 --> 01:26:17,481
Oh, you already know that.

1172
01:26:17,555 --> 01:26:20,023
Anyway, she'd--

1173
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:23,254
Well, anyway, she's--

1174
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:25,888
Well, she's crazy
about you already.

1175
01:26:25,964 --> 01:26:28,489
She don't talk as much
as she used to, but...

1176
01:26:28,566 --> 01:26:31,933
that's because she thinks
I'm jealous or something, and l--

1177
01:26:32,003 --> 01:26:36,133
Oh, I guess I was a little,
but I'm not anymore.

1178
01:26:36,207 --> 01:26:39,335
And you'll see.
In a little while, she'll--

1179
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:43,004
Well...

1180
01:26:43,081 --> 01:26:46,778
in a little while,
she'll forget all about me.

1181
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:51,379
And it won't be any time
before she'll--

1182
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:56,159
She'll love you just--

1183
01:26:56,227 --> 01:26:59,390
just like you were
her real mother.

1184
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,456
And Mrs. Morrison,
she's so wonderful. You don't know.

1185
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:04,865
I do know.

1186
01:27:04,936 --> 01:27:07,962
And I know it hasn't come
only from her father.

1187
01:27:15,613 --> 01:27:18,047
I have to go.

1188
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:21,142
Lollie doesn't know
I've come here, and l--

1189
01:27:21,219 --> 01:27:25,121
I don't want her to yet.
She's awful funny underneath.

1190
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:28,056
And I thought it all out.
It'll be better...

1191
01:27:28,126 --> 01:27:31,095
to just let her come
for the visit like always...

1192
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:33,892
and by that time,
it'll all be over.

1193
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:36,934
The divorce, I mean.

1194
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:39,128
And then--

1195
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:42,195
Then you can
break it to her.

1196
01:27:42,273 --> 01:27:44,707
It'll be easier that way.

1197
01:27:50,648 --> 01:27:52,582
- Board!
- Good-bye, darling.

1198
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:55,141
- Good-bye.
- Go on. Get inside.

1199
01:27:55,219 --> 01:27:58,086
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Good-bye, dear.

1200
01:28:01,993 --> 01:28:05,087
- You'll write to me, won't you?
- Oh, yes, I will.

1201
01:28:05,163 --> 01:28:07,688
Now have a nice time,
and don't think about me.

1202
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:11,633
Wear your new blue dress tonight.
I wanna see ya in my mind's eye.

1203
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,694
All right. Bye!

1204
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:15,363
I love you!
Good-bye!

1205
01:28:17,075 --> 01:28:18,770
Good-bye, Mother!

1206
01:28:40,865 --> 01:28:42,662
- It's a lot of fun, isn't it?
- Yes.

1207
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,202
- Haven't you ever played it before?
- No, I haven't.

1208
01:28:45,269 --> 01:28:47,703
John wouldn't go to bed
until I promised to bring these in...

1209
01:28:47,772 --> 01:28:50,741
so you'd still have some family
to keep you company tonight.

1210
01:28:50,808 --> 01:28:53,072
- How sweet.
- Oh, that John.

1211
01:28:53,144 --> 01:28:56,113
- And here's their breakfast.
- Gosh! You sure stand high with John.

1212
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:59,911
He won't let Lee and me
see 'em, let alone feed 'em.

1213
01:28:59,984 --> 01:29:04,011
I suppose it's time young men removed
themselves from ladies' boudoirs.

1214
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,455
- Okay, Dad.
- Good night, sweetheart.

1215
01:29:07,525 --> 01:29:10,187
- Good night, darling, and sleep well.
- I will, thank you.

1216
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:12,729
Good night, Laurel.
I'll see you in the morning.

1217
01:29:12,797 --> 01:29:15,061
- Good night, Mother.
- I'll put these in a safe place.

1218
01:29:16,834 --> 01:29:20,201
Oh, I never saw Father
so happy before.

1219
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,831
And you, dear,
are you happy?

1220
01:29:22,907 --> 01:29:25,569
So very, for you both.

1221
01:29:25,643 --> 01:29:27,668
But...

1222
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:30,737
I've been worrying
and worrying about something.

1223
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:33,147
Why, what could possibly
be worrying you?

1224
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:36,152
Well, I don't know
what to call you.

1225
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:38,450
Oh, if that's all.

1226
01:29:38,523 --> 01:29:41,856
I'm so glad, because I
have something to tell you...

1227
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:45,293
which I hope will make you
just as happy as it has me.

1228
01:29:45,363 --> 01:29:48,764
From now on, you're going
to be one of us really, dear.

1229
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:53,202
You're going to be a member of this
family like Con and Lee and John.

1230
01:29:53,271 --> 01:29:56,138
They're your brothers,
and this is going to be your home...

1231
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:58,300
as much as it is theirs.

1232
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:00,367
- This my home?
- Yes, dear.

1233
01:30:00,445 --> 01:30:03,243
You're going to live with us.

1234
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:06,647
- Live here?
- Here, the town house, wherever we are.

1235
01:30:08,586 --> 01:30:10,713
Does it make you happy, Laurel?

1236
01:30:10,788 --> 01:30:14,724
Oh, yes, it makes me very happy...

1237
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:19,729
to know that you want me,
and I do love you all so very much.

1238
01:30:19,797 --> 01:30:22,789
But I couldn't leave my mother.

1239
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:24,926
Oh, you won't be leaving her.

1240
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,937
Your mother will always
be your mother.

1241
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:32,442
I could never expect or even want
to take her place in your heart.

1242
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:37,174
- You'll visit her whenever you like.
- No, I couldn't.

1243
01:30:37,248 --> 01:30:40,911
Oh, thank you ever and ever
so much, Mrs.-- I mean--

1244
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:45,319
Laurel, your mother, your father,
all of us who love you...

1245
01:30:45,389 --> 01:30:47,323
feel that now that
you're getting older...

1246
01:30:47,391 --> 01:30:50,485
there are many advantages
that we can give you.

1247
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:52,495
I know.

1248
01:30:53,664 --> 01:30:55,598
And I do thank you.

1249
01:30:56,934 --> 01:30:58,925
But I'm sorry.

1250
01:30:59,003 --> 01:31:00,937
- Good night, Con.
- Good night, Dad.

1251
01:31:02,907 --> 01:31:04,465
Yes, dear?

1252
01:31:08,012 --> 01:31:10,412
What is it, dear?

1253
01:31:10,481 --> 01:31:13,314
You don't mean you thought
that I could live...

1254
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:15,318
anywhere ever without Mother.

1255
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:18,446
Well, you've lived without me.

1256
01:31:18,523 --> 01:31:22,050
Your mother and I are just
changing places for a while, that's all.

1257
01:31:22,126 --> 01:31:25,459
Isn't it fair for me to have a little
of what she's had all these years?

1258
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:28,431
But that's different, Father.
You know it is.

1259
01:31:28,499 --> 01:31:30,990
I've been with Mother all these years
because I needed her.

1260
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:33,832
Now she needs me,
and you need me less than ever.

1261
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,839
Oh, Laurel, don't say that.

1262
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,899
I'm sorry if you don't see that
what we've planned is for your good.

1263
01:31:38,976 --> 01:31:40,910
We thought it would make you happy.

1264
01:31:40,978 --> 01:31:43,242
Your mother and I have decided upon
what we think is best for you.

1265
01:31:43,314 --> 01:31:46,010
- My mother? Does she know?
- Certainly.

1266
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:48,881
We have your interests
equally at heart, haven't we?

1267
01:31:48,953 --> 01:31:52,480
We both feel that this should be
your home for at least a few years.

1268
01:31:52,557 --> 01:31:56,288
I'm sorry, Father,
but please understand.

1269
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,818
My home will be with my mother
as long as I live.

1270
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,401
Oh, Stephen.
Laurel, you don't understand, dear.

1271
01:32:04,468 --> 01:32:07,164
This was all your mother's idea.

1272
01:32:07,238 --> 01:32:09,832
Her wish for you.
She planned it all herself.

1273
01:32:09,907 --> 01:32:12,068
Your father had
nothing to do with it.

1274
01:32:12,143 --> 01:32:14,077
She came to see me,
and we talked it all over.

1275
01:32:14,145 --> 01:32:17,137
- She came to you? When?
- Yes, dear.

1276
01:32:17,215 --> 01:32:19,479
Was it just after we got back
from the Mirador?

1277
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:22,178
Why, I believe it was, but--

1278
01:32:22,253 --> 01:32:25,086
Oh, my poor mother.

1279
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:28,552
My wonderful mother.

1280
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:32,687
Oh, she wasn't asleep.
She heard what they said.

1281
01:32:33,931 --> 01:32:36,866
Oh, I must go to her.
I must go to her at once!

1282
01:32:36,934 --> 01:32:39,801
- Darling, tell us about it.
- Oh, please, Daddy.

1283
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:44,330
Help me. I can't make my visit here.
I must go to my mother!

1284
01:33:40,164 --> 01:33:44,294
Sure you can see him.
That ain't meanin' that he can see you.

1285
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:49,202
Hey, Munn.
Somebody to see ya.

1286
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:07,623
Ed.

1287
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:16,324
Ed, wake up.
It's Stella.

1288
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:21,200
Ed, it's me,
Stella Dallas.

1289
01:34:21,272 --> 01:34:23,206
Hello, Stell.

1290
01:34:23,274 --> 01:34:25,902
Look, I still live
in the same old flat.

1291
01:34:25,976 --> 01:34:30,276
I want you to take this, get a Turkish
bath and shave and come right over.

1292
01:34:30,348 --> 01:34:32,714
Ed, do ya understand?

1293
01:34:32,783 --> 01:34:35,217
Sure. I got it.

1294
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,048
Mommy!

1295
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:35,602
Lollie! When did you--

1296
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,204
Well, whatever brought you back?

1297
01:35:38,282 --> 01:35:40,580
Mother, how could you think--

1298
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:44,587
As if I could ever live
anywhere else but with you.

1299
01:35:44,655 --> 01:35:48,682
Well, I thought you'd like it
for a while. No, really, you--

1300
01:35:48,759 --> 01:35:52,024
You always seem to have
such a good time with your father.

1301
01:35:52,096 --> 01:35:54,860
Yes, but good times aren't--

1302
01:35:54,932 --> 01:35:58,493
Oh, they aren't
what make you belong.

1303
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:01,936
It's other kind of times.

1304
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,169
It's when you've
cried together...

1305
01:36:05,242 --> 01:36:07,608
and when you've been
through things together.

1306
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,946
That's when you seem
to love the most.

1307
01:36:14,385 --> 01:36:17,650
It's different when you--

1308
01:36:17,721 --> 01:36:20,519
Didn't they send a telegram?
They said they would.

1309
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:25,119
Most likely they tried to deliver it
and I was out. I've been on the go.

1310
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:28,359
- Put those in water for me, will ya?
- Oh, they're lovely.

1311
01:36:28,432 --> 01:36:31,458
From an old admirer.
Ed Munn blew into town.

1312
01:36:31,535 --> 01:36:34,527
- I've been steppin' out with him.
- Ed Munn?

1313
01:36:34,605 --> 01:36:35,765
Yeah. Now put 'em in water.

1314
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,367
I want 'em all fixed nice
when he gets here.

1315
01:36:47,585 --> 01:36:52,249
- Mother, you don't mean that you and--
- Haven't you fixed 'em yet?

1316
01:36:53,424 --> 01:36:55,358
Give 'em to me.

1317
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,095
Get some water.

1318
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:19,075
There.
That'll tickle him.

1319
01:37:27,825 --> 01:37:32,057
Don't you remember
a long time ago we said--

1320
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:37,628
- And you promised about him--
- I know what you're driving at.

1321
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:42,502
Now let me tell you something. I've
spent the best years of my life on you.

1322
01:37:42,573 --> 01:37:47,033
A woman wants to be something else
besides a mother, you know.

1323
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:49,045
Well, you will know
when you get grown up.

1324
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,843
You can't explain
everything to a child.

1325
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,850
Now, go on. Run along.

1326
01:39:04,722 --> 01:39:07,190
I've come back to stay,
if you still want me.

1327
01:39:07,257 --> 01:39:09,555
- Still want you?
- Laurel, my dear.

1328
01:39:19,169 --> 01:39:21,797
Tell me, dear.
What is it, angel? What is it?

1329
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:23,635
Oh, Daddy!

1330
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:26,976
What is it, sweetheart?

1331
01:39:33,183 --> 01:39:35,811
I thought it was for my sake...

1332
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:38,616
she wanted me to come
and live with you...

1333
01:39:38,689 --> 01:39:40,953
and I was so glad and so proud.

1334
01:39:41,025 --> 01:39:43,687
But it wasn't.

1335
01:39:43,761 --> 01:39:46,286
It was for him.

1336
01:39:46,363 --> 01:39:48,558
She wanted to marry him!

1337
01:39:52,302 --> 01:39:54,327
- Please don't cry.
- You knew him.

1338
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:57,897
- Yes, I know him.
- And she chose him!

1339
01:39:57,975 --> 01:40:01,467
Oh, Laurel,
come upstairs with me, dear.

1340
01:40:01,545 --> 01:40:03,570
All right.

1341
01:40:08,652 --> 01:40:10,779
So long.
Thanks a lot.

1342
01:40:10,854 --> 01:40:13,880
Well, hello!
You back? Gee, that's great.

1343
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,219
Who do you think brought me home?
Dick Grosvenor.

1344
01:40:18,295 --> 01:40:21,662
We were just talkin' about you. I'll
get him. He's still in the driveway.

1345
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:23,700
Oh, no, Con!

1346
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:27,498
- I don't want to see him, not now.
- Now, now.

1347
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:29,505
Oh, no--
No, not yet.

1348
01:40:29,573 --> 01:40:32,235
Go on upstairs, dear.
We'll take care of Dick.

1349
01:40:32,309 --> 01:40:34,243
Hey, Dick!

1350
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:36,541
Come on back!
Laurel's here.

1351
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:38,911
- When did she get back?
- She was here when I got here.

1352
01:40:38,982 --> 01:40:41,507
- How do you do, Mrs. Dallas?
- Hello, Dick.

1353
01:40:41,585 --> 01:40:44,019
- I'm glad to see you again.
- I'm glad to see you.

1354
01:40:44,088 --> 01:40:46,147
Con told me Laurel was here.

1355
01:40:46,223 --> 01:40:49,056
- All right, fella, that's one on me.
- No, she's here!

1356
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:52,789
- Hey, Laurel's here, isn't she?
- Yes. Won't you stay for dinner?

1357
01:40:52,863 --> 01:40:54,854
Why, if I'm all right as I am.

1358
01:40:54,932 --> 01:40:57,230
-Of course.
-lf you don't mind, I'd like to wash up.

1359
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,235
- Come on up to my room.
- Hurry up.

1360
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,794
Okay, Dad.

1361
01:41:01,872 --> 01:41:05,808
Stephen, Laurel is here.

1362
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:07,810
She's here to stay.

1363
01:41:09,613 --> 01:41:11,547
Who's accomplished it?

1364
01:41:13,117 --> 01:41:15,984
Couldn't you read between
those pitiful lines?

1365
01:41:28,065 --> 01:41:29,999
I told you those curtains
weren't to be drawn.

1366
01:41:30,067 --> 01:41:32,001
Open them, please.

1367
01:41:32,069 --> 01:41:34,003
Yes, madam.

1368
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:39,573
Yes.

1369
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,448
Now you must light the candles,
and we must hurry.

1370
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:47,541
Yes, madam.

1371
01:41:51,889 --> 01:41:53,823
Come, dear.
It's nearly time for our cue.

1372
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,858
What's this?

1373
01:41:57,928 --> 01:42:00,726
Oh, my darling.

1374
01:42:00,798 --> 01:42:02,732
I was just thinking.

1375
01:42:03,867 --> 01:42:06,165
I never really thought
that my mother--

1376
01:42:07,771 --> 01:42:11,229
I thought that she would
read about the wedding and...

1377
01:42:11,308 --> 01:42:15,142
even though she was too far away
to come, at least she would write to me.

1378
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,180
Oh, my dear.

1379
01:42:17,247 --> 01:42:19,181
Do you think if she knew...

1380
01:42:19,249 --> 01:42:22,650
any distance in the world
could keep her away?

1381
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,620
Then you think
she just doesn't know.

1382
01:42:41,872 --> 01:42:44,864
Sorry, but you can't stand here.
We have to keep this clear.

1383
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:42,899
Move along, please.
Break up the group here.

1384
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:52,203
- You too, lady.
- Please, let me see her face...

1385
01:43:52,276 --> 01:43:54,210
when he kisses her.

1386
01:44:26,643 --> 01:44:29,237
All right, folks.
You've seen enough. Come on.

1387
01:44:29,313 --> 01:44:32,248
Move along, please.
Come on. Clear the sidewalk.

1388
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:06,746
