1
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:31,630
Do you know
what he said to me last time?

2
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:34,500
I said to him,
"Are you the jolliest at home?"

3
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,721
And he said, "Yes, except for the doorknob
because that gives everyone a handshake."

4
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:39,839
Oh!

5
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,142
Oi!

6
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:03,588
Aye, aye, me damsel.

7
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,382
Welcome home, Mr Billy.

8
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,642
- We've been worried to death about you.
- For why?

9
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,352
On account of that explosion,

10
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,722
- What was that?
- At Ostend.

11
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:19,020
Oh, yes.
I heard tell of that at Antwerp.

12
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,393
Dreadful.

13
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:21,898
Dirty linen.

14
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,363
Mr William's been getting
in a stew about it.

15
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,654
- Is he out and about his business?
- That he is.

16
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,185
You faring well?

17
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,731
Thank you.

18
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,786
- How was your journey home?
- It was execrable.

19
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,154
Oh.

20
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:39,764
You in need of anything else?

21
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,105
Tea?

22
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:13,089
- Good morning, Signor Grande.
- Mr Turner! Buongiorno.

23
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:14,556
- Joshua.
- Morning, sir.

24
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:16,767
We have damn rats.

25
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,477
No shortage of them in this city.

26
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:22,098
Wretched things!
It's an epidemic.

27
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:24,896
- What can I do for you today?
- Well, let me see.

28
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,770
- He is back?
- We are expecting him any day now.

29
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,239
<i>Bravo!</i> The prodigal son.

30
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:33,529
- <i>Pronti.</i> What do we need?
- An ounce of chrome yellow.

31
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,744
- Chrome yellow, Joshua,
- Chrome yellow, sir.

32
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,455
- A large packet of ﬂake white.
- Flake white.

33
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,992
What is your price
for a bladder of ultramarine?

34
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:43,915
My price is the best price.

35
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,164
And what might that price be?

36
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:50,759
Blue ultramarine is coming
from far, far away: Afghanistan.

37
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:54,255
- What else do you need?
- Bottle of poppy oil, some Indian red.

38
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:56,723
- Poppy oil, Joshua.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,711
There's your prize porker.

40
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,758
Is he handsome?

41
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,302
He has a big smile on his face.

42
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,557
- You're making the sauce?
- It's all but done, save the brains.

43
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:45,682
Good.
Oh... dearie me!

44
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:49,856
- Will you take a dish of tea, Mr William?
- Oh, thank ye, Hannah.

45
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:52,901
Shall you be putting those chattels away?
I should.

46
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,694
- Best do it now.
- Yes.

47
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:57,819
Then I can rest me weary legs.

48
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:19,424
You're home, Billy boy!

49
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,887
Hey, Daddy!

50
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:28,223
I thought you was exploded.

51
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:31,067
I been down on my knees
and praying you was safe.

52
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:34,233
Well, you been chafing your old pedestals
for naught, Daddy.

53
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:35,651
I was a hundred miles distant.

54
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,695
- Oh, you heard tell of it, then?
- I did indeed.

55
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:41,241
Terrible, they pour souls as perished,
two score or more.

56
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:44,490
Took a few brave soldiers with it an' all.

57
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:48,164
I was vexed to learn
you been entertaining concerns, old Dadda.

58
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,253
'Twas only natural.

59
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,666
Oh, Daddy!

60
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,463
How was your crossing?

61
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,838
Set fair on departure,
lumpy in the middle.

62
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:01,886
- Did you sail from Rotterdam?
- No, Dieppe.

63
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:03,475
Oh.

64
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:06,471
Night coach from Brighton
proved to be an heinous travail.

65
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:07,517
How so?

66
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:10,356
It was stuffed full of yacking
and cackling females.

67
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:14,229
Pox-ridden harridan as broad in the beam
as the old Victory at Trafalgar.

68
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:19,029
- Were your travels productive?
- Exceeding refreshing, old Daddy.

69
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,571
Yeah, Amsterdam.

70
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:23,161
Had a gander at the Rembrandt.

71
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,827
Militia Company, Antwerp Cathedral.

72
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,745
Rubens, the triptych.

73
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:30,244
Flanders, still as ﬂat as a witch's tit.

74
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:33,748
Thank you, Hannah.
You sly girl.

75
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,585
Did you find tolerable diggings?

76
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,804
Stinking ﬂea pit at Dieppe,
then moved to the harbour.

77
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:43,515
Westerly aspect, fine sunset.

78
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:46,351
Oh, Daddy,
I'm in need of an eight-by-six.

79
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:51,315
I have a seven by five-and-a-half
ready sized and primed.

80
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:54,105
- That should suit,
- Right you be.

81
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:57,070
More's to the point,
how you been faring?

82
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:58,780
In good health, thank the Lord.

83
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:01,150
- Bronchioles still rattling?
- No.

84
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:03,572
- He was wheezing last week.
- Shh-sh-sh,

85
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:07,163
October ain't quite come
round the corner yet, has it?

86
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,032
I've been over to Grande's.

87
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,204
Oh.

88
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,578
Ultramarine's gone up
to a guinea a bladder.

89
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:13,999
Gawd's truth!

90
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,089
That brigand still robbing us, is he?

91
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:22,175
- You're in need of a shave.
- Yeah, well, be that as it may, Daddy.

92
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:26,391
Presently I'm gonna throw myself
into the arms of Morpheus.

93
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:10,726
No!

94
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,198
I took a trip down west, Exeter, last week.

95
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:25,943
Oh.

96
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,446
- How fares the old uncle?
- Bearing up, considering.

97
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:33,371
- Considering what?
- Well, his age, living alone.

98
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:34,539
Oh.

99
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,298
- Here's the thing.
- Hm?

100
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:43,168
He wants to arrange a family gathering.

101
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,814
Will you take some more cheek?

102
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,193
Yeah, cast us another morsel.

103
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:10,116
Missing your button, Mr Billy.

104
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:11,784
Oh.

105
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:29,339
Be so kind as to enter the vestibule.

106
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,184
The darkness is to a purpose.

107
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,861
I shall return by and by.

108
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,177
Madam.

109
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,514
Gentlemen.

110
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:22,726
Behold.

111
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,609
Three steps down.

112
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,588
Pray, view at your leisure.

113
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:19,605
- Good day to you, Hannah.
- Good day to you, Aunt Sarah.

114
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:22,127
- And how are you faring?
- Very well, thank you.

115
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:24,587
- Are you coming in?
- I most certainly am. Is he at home?

116
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:27,924
- He is. I'll tell him you're here.
- I can inform him myself, thank you kindly.

117
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:34,177
- Good day to you, sir.
- And a very good day to you, Mrs D.

118
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,516
And how do we find you
on this fair morning?

119
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,852
Exceedingly preoccupied, madam.

120
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,517
'Twas ever thus.
You've always been preoccupied.

121
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,686
You're too preoccupied
for your own good, sir.

122
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,650
Nothing comes from nothing, madam.

123
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:48,145
And we have had nothing from you, sir.

124
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,778
Evelina, Georgiana,
come and greet your father.

125
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,369
Good day, Father.
May I present my child to you?

126
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:58,659
- Your granddaughter'
- Rosalie Adelaide.

127
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,953
Your only surviving grandchild.

128
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:03,327
Georgiana, cease your dithering!

129
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,000
May I suggest, Mrs D,
with the utmost respect,

130
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:09,045
that you withdraw
to the drawing room?

131
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:12,135
Good day to you, Mrs Danby.
Would you care to step this way?

132
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,879
Good day to you, Mr Turner.

133
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:15,763
And will you be gracing us
with your presence

134
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,882
in the withdrawing room, sir?

135
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:21,011
I sincerely hope you will.
And, pray, do not keep us waiting.

136
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:23,935
We have our own lives to lead.
Come along, daughters.

137
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:27,355
The vapours in this room
are most noxious to a child's lungs.

138
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:41,156
Ladies, pray, sit yourselves.

139
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,582
Sarah, if you please.

140
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,749
I shall be seated, William,
when it suits me and not before.

141
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,292
So be it.

142
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,174
- She's a pretty little thing.
- Thank you, Grandfather.

143
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,636
- We are most proud of her.
- We are indeed.

144
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:57,176
- Have you been out strolling, Aunt Sarah?
- No, niece.

145
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:59,425
I've been to collect my pension
at Leicester Fields,

146
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,096
it being the first of the month.

147
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:05,142
Indeed.

148
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,231
- Your latest infant?
- To be sure, Father.

149
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,817
- Of robust constitution?
- She has an excellent character.

150
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:12,778
One must trust in providence.
Colour of eye?

151
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,864
- Blue, as yourself.
- Splendid.

152
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,699
Do not forget your other daughter, sir,

153
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,285
whom you have deigned to neglect
these past two years.

154
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,245
Sit down, Georgiana.

155
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,785
- She is learning French.
- And music.

156
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:25,705
She is having an education.

157
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:29,830
Reading, writing, arithmetic
and geography with the globe.

158
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:31,547
Sit up straight, Georgie!

159
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,211
Say something in French.

160
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,926
<i>- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, Papa.</i>

161
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,632
- Are you keeping well?
- I am.

162
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,631
I was not addressing you, sir.

163
00:18:39,756 --> 00:18:42,259
I enjoy good health, thank'ee.
And yourself?

164
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:45,478
We are surviving as best we can
under the circumstances.

165
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:49,645
- And what circumstances might they be?
- Straightened circumstances, sir.

166
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,643
But we manage
to keep body and soul together,

167
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,612
no thanks to your ungrateful son.

168
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:58,154
How dare you take your leave of me,
Billy Turner!

169
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:02,450
You insult me,
as you have always insulted me!

170
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,992
Billy!

171
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,533
Good evening, William.

172
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:47,498
Felicitations of the evening to you,
your Lordship.

173
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:50,536
You faring well?

174
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,255
Bit breathless.
Been up to the farm.

175
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,803
Watch the sunset,
say goodnight to the milkmaids.

176
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:05,262
Any further consideration
to mechanicalising the thresher?

177
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,895
You can't beat the old oxen.

178
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:13,358
- Is that so, your Lordship?
- Indeed.

179
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:16,648
We had a ploughing competition
last spring

180
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,568
between teams of horses
and teams of oxen.

181
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,691
- And the victor?
- The horses.

182
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:25,320
- Well, the ox is a sluggish beast
- Yes, but strong.

183
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,039
With the added benefit, when it comes
to the end of its working life,

184
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,999
it makes a very succulent dish.

185
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:33,249
Unlike the horse.

186
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,370
Good for glue.

187
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:36,998
Ahem... your Lordship!

188
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:42,804
- A very good evening to you, sir.
- Evening, Manners.

189
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:45,174
Mr Turner.

190
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:48,142
Are we not blessed by the heavens

191
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:54,437
to witness so glorious
a crepuscular time of day?

192
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,690
Imbecile.

193
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:07,363
Continuing satisfaction
as to the arrangement, your Lordship?

194
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:12,994
I think we have successfully achieved
the correct effect, William.

195
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:14,619
Thank you.

196
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:20,049
- Good evening, Nat.
- Oh, good evening, my Lord.

197
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:24,637
- Good evening, Miss Coggins.
- Your Lordship, Turner.

198
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:28,384
- How's your father faring, William?
- Oh, bearing up, your Lordship.

199
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:31,136
Very gracious of you to inquire.

200
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,185
We thought we'd lost him
this last winter, a very harsh one.

201
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:37,934
He came through.
He's a hardy old cove.

202
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,561
Excellent.

203
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,522
- See you at dinner.
- Indeed.

204
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:31,783
Exceedingly beautiful.

205
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:33,906
You are too kind.

206
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,619
I'm familiar with the melody, but...

207
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:39,792
- Herr Beethoven.
- Ah!

208
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:41,380
The "Pathétique".

209
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:53,218
I possess a rare fondness
for... Henry Purcell.

210
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,970
As do I.

211
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,688
Oh?

212
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:59,227
Um...

213
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,227
Yes.

214
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:11,615
“Dido-s Lament."

Indeed.

233
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,697
I thank you.

234
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:40,325
Thank you, Mr Turner.

235
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,082
Madam.

236
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,357
Shh-sh-sh!

237
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:24,585
- Mr Turner?
- Hm?

238
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:27,626
I have often pondered,
might there be a distinction

239
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:31,092
between the way you paint a sunrise
as opposed to a sunset?

240
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,179
- Oh, there is indeed, Lady Stuckley.
- Ah.

241
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:37,265
Yeah, cos one is going up
whilst the other...

242
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:39,634
- The other is going down!
- Oh, Eliza, do hush.

243
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,060
And might it also be determined
by the angle of the light?

244
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,899
Well, it's weather,

245
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,359
vapour,

246
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:49,602
wind.

247
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,855
Frangibility and such like.

248
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,356
- Eliza, look at his nails!
- Shh.

249
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:57,236
Whilst you goddesses are languishing
in the kingdom of Hypnos,

250
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,365
I am up before the lark to witness Helios
popping his head above the parapet,

251
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,335
with the only benefit
that the sunrise is not afﬂicted...

252
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,083
...with diminishing light.

253
00:26:16,712 --> 00:26:18,510
- Carew.
- Oh!

254
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:20,383
Turner!

255
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:23,853
I'm by way of observing
poor Saint Sebastian here.

256
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,393
The artist is not known to me.

257
00:26:26,514 --> 00:26:27,811
- Flemish.
- Oh.

258
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:30,902
Uncommonly capacious rump
on the cherub.

259
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:33,942
It might have gained in potency
with an increase of arrows.

260
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:36,441
Well, yon celestial fellow
is tugging them all out.

261
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,987
I can hardly bear to look upon it.

262
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:43,036
Ah, the pain on his face,
the mark of resignation in it.

263
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,283
'Tis a willing sacrifice, is it not?

264
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,877
'Twas not how the poor soul perished.

265
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:50,998
He was brought back to full health
by a good Samaritan.

266
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:54,797
Then the heathens cudgelled him to death
and deposited him in a sewer.

267
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,636
I would question
the veracity of that telling.

268
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:00,097
No good deed goes unpunished.

269
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,887
What a curious fate is mine.

270
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:12,436
Last month in the King's Bench Prison
in the company of debtors,

271
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,109
this month a guest
of quality, rank and fashion.

272
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:19,325
Rejoice, Haydon. You find yourself
in a veritable Bacchanalia.

273
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:22,662
His Lordship keeps
a very fine wine cellar.

274
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:24,951
Be sanguine, fill your boots.

275
00:27:25,072 --> 00:27:26,873
Might I ask you
to loan me some money, Turner?

276
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:28,124
I beg your pardon?

277
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:31,712
I am in dire and pressing need
of 100 pounds.

278
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:33,001
Out of the question.

279
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:35,716
My landlord,
he's a good man, a patient man,

280
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,676
but he will not wait forever.

281
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:40,592
I need to pay the wine merchant,
my colour man...

282
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:43,387
And your dear wife, Mrs Haydon,
is she faring well?

283
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:45,384
Mrs Haydon is presently with child.

284
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:47,853
Well, you have my hearty congratulations,
Haydon.

285
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,600
Congratulations are not in order.
I'm in torment.

286
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:55,354
I am not unsympathetic
to your impecunity, Haydon.

287
00:27:55,478 --> 00:27:58,277
Therefore I can advance you 50 pounds.

288
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:02,277
Turner, if 100 pounds will not spare me
from this predicament,

289
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,745
what in Jesu's name
can 50 pounds do?

290
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:07,581
Then you are refusing
to accept the 50 pounds?

291
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:10,918
- It is damned inadequate,
- I wish you good day, sir.

292
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:16,791
- Turner?
- Hey, hey!

293
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,169
My word is my bond.

294
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:22,763
I may not yet be an Academician
but I am a gentleman.

295
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,724
I have a painting
presently with the King at Windsor.

296
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:29,186
I am assured he will buy it from me
for 500 guineas or more.

297
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:31,852
Furthermore, I have another
fine painting in mind,

298
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,098
a companion piece,

299
00:28:33,224 --> 00:28:35,147
which he is most certain
to purchase in addition.

300
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:37,361
Who has made these assurances?

301
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,231
- The King's private secretary, Knighton.
- Oh.

302
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:45,487
Well, I can furnish you
with five pounds this morning.

303
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,863
Five pounds?

304
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:50,287
50 pounds is not sufficient.
Five pounds is tantamount to an insult.

305
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:53,537
Sir, I beseech you, brook your ire.

306
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:56,210
If you attend my residence at London,

307
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,583
I will loan you 50 pounds.

308
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,836
In addition to the five?

309
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:06,558
Mr Haydon, you are exceedingly tiresome.

310
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,138
I am gratified.

311
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:16,567
I humbly accept the 50 pounds.

312
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:21,444
Might I find you at the same address?

313
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,068
I may swim.

314
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:31,578
"And the spirit immediately
drove him out into the wilderness."

315
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:34,418
A tormented soul, for sure.

316
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:37,914
I sympathise,
but he attributes all of his failures

317
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:40,507
- to anything other than his own behaviour.
- Indeed.

318
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:45,551
His complaint with life is as absurd
as that of a spoke in a wheel,

319
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:49,221
railing against the motion
that it must of necessity partake.

320
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:53,221
I concur.
He suffers the fate of Tantalus.

321
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:56,315
He reaches for the fruit,
the branch moves.

322
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:59,026
When he stoops to drink
the water goes down.

323
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:01,896
If only he would consider
the wishes of his public

324
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:05,366
rather than pursuing
his own peculiar convictions,

325
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,609
it would be his salvation.

326
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:10,034
And yet, my dear Beechey,
as his personal troubles increase,

327
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:12,998
so the quality of his painting suffers.

328
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:16,619
- But still, the man can paint.
- For sure, he can paint a Haydon.

329
00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:20,123
The return of one prodigal
is worth more than gold.

330
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:24,548
An essential quality for a prodigal, sir,
is humility.

331
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:26,966
He is a cracked pot.

332
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,465
He's heading for a fall.

333
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,719
Gentlemen, are we as one?

334
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:36,939
Sadly... I cannot give him
my support.

335
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:40,268
He is not of our temper.

336
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:43,236
Alas, the Academy
does not have need of Haydon

337
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:46,608
so much as Haydon
has need of the Academy.

00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:30,079
You be a lodgings, then?

376
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,622
It be.

377
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:37,717
- This chamber, 'tis available?
- It is, aye.

378
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,506
May I peruse it?

379
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:50,220
Mrs Booth!

00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,733
There be a gentleman.

- Good day to you, madam.

382
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:05,910
- Are you seeking lodgings?
- Indeed I am.

383
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:07,325
Here, Mr Booth.

384
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:12,869
- Your top front, 'tis available?
- Maybe, sir, yes.

385
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:17,089
- May I peruse it?
- Indeed, sir, if you'd care to follow me.

386
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,047
- You just come off the boat?
- Indeed.

387
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:22,761
- The Maggie or the Billy?
- The Maggie.

388
00:37:22,878 --> 00:37:26,758
- Oh, 'twas early today!
- We'd the best of the tide.

389
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:30,598
There.

390
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,689
- This be my better most chamber,
- Exceeding homely.

391
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:35,273
Oh, I do thank you, sir.

392
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,394
You're looking
at the finest view in Margate.

393
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,981
They do say this town
be the first place in England

394
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:43,823
that the sun do reach of a morning.

395
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:47,821
Now, all my linen is freshly aired,
clean and sweet-smelling,

396
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:51,199
and I can lay a fire for you,
should you require.

397
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:54,163
Now, sir...

398
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:58,331
...my terms is one guinea for the week
with no meals

399
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:00,503
or full board for an extra 15 and sixpence.

400
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:04,629
And I'm afraid I do have to ask
for a small deposit and a reference.

401
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:11,093
- Five pound'
- 'Tis my reference and deposit.

402
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,604
Oh, I can't take this, sir.
It is far too much.

403
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:18,476
Refund of balance on departure'
That suit you, madam?

404
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:21,395
I do thank ye, sir.

405
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:25,316
Well, I should introduce myself.
My name is Mrs Booth.

406
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,239
- And you, sir?
- Beg your pardon?

407
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,613
- I was asking your name, sir.
- Mallard.

408
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:32,785
Oh... Mr Mallard.

409
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:36,035
Well, I do hope you'll be
most comfortable here, Mr Mallard.

410
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,253
Now, is there anything else
I can provide for you?

411
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,249
A small bowl of water, madam,
if you'd be so kind.

412
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:44,877
- Might that be a glass of water?
- No, a bowl.

413
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:49,264
Very well, sir.
I shall bring that up for you.

414
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:06,235
Yes?

415
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:11,787
I found you a small bowl, sir.
I hope this do suit your requirements.

416
00:39:11,903 --> 00:39:12,825
Indeed.

417
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:14,706
Where would you like
I should put it for you?

418
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:17,667
Upon the window sill,
if you'd be so kind.

419
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:22,957
Good. Oh, dear!
Do be coming along blowing now.

420
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:27,882
Well... I shall serve your supper downstairs
in the parlour at six of the clock.

421
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:29,923
And if you ever feel the need
of a bit of company

422
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,724
you'd be more than welcome
to join Mr Booth and I in our kitchen.

423
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:36,061
- I would not wish to impose, madam.
- Oh, not at all, Mr Mallard.

424
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:38,601
We should be glad of your company.

425
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:00,998
- I'll top up your ale, Mr Mallard,
- Thank you kindly, madam.

426
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,042
- I hope you're enjoying your supper.
- Mm.

427
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:04,710
Oh, good,

428
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:08,051
Some folk do find shackles
loo salty for their taste.

429
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:10,762
Can never be loo salty for me, madam.

430
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:13,010
Oh!

431
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,243
There, Mr Mallard.
This'll warm you up.

432
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,362
No, no, you sit yourself down.

433
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:38,787
I can squeeze around here
just about these days.

434
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:41,831
- So, you had a good walk, then?
- As far as Broadstairs and back.

435
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:45,673
Oh, dear! That is a long way.
You'll sleep well tonight.

436
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:47,291
Your very good health, madam, sir.

437
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:50,510
- Very good health to you too, sir.
- Will you not take a drink yourself?

438
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:53,176
I ain't touched a drop
this many a long year.

439
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:55,719
He did used to enjoy a tipple,
though that were long before I knew him.

440
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:58,515
- Man of the sea?
- He was, weren't he?

441
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:02,435
- Ship's carpenter.
- Carpenter? Noble craft.

442
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,229
What'd you ply?

443
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:06,351
Whalers? Spicers?

444
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,399
- Traders?
- Slavers.

445
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:12,400
- For my sins.
- He don't like to talk about it, though.

446
00:41:13,692 --> 00:41:17,572
Africa, Zanzibar, the Indies.

447
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,790
Such terrible sufferings I did see.

448
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,125
Treated like animals, they was.

449
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:24,165
Worse than.

450
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:26,129
The howling sound of sorrow.

451
00:41:26,246 --> 00:41:27,668
Yes.

452
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,257
- Changed my life, it did.
- Oh, it did there.

453
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:35,426
- Led me back to chapel.
- Mm... hm!

454
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:39,513
Humans.

455
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:42,680
Humans can be dreadful cruel.

456
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:47,647
I watch them boys down there in the sands
whipping them poor donkeys.

457
00:41:48,226 --> 00:41:50,320
Mind you, you're better off being a donkey

458
00:41:50,437 --> 00:41:53,281
than them wretched souls
on the slave ships.

459
00:41:57,777 --> 00:42:00,656
So, are you familiar with Margate,
Mr Mallard?

460
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,747
As a boy.

461
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:03,583
Oh, there.
You come here on your holidays, then?

462
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,668
Schooling, two years.

463
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:09,335
Oh, yes, Margate be famous for its schools.

464
00:42:09,456 --> 00:42:11,879
- Coleman's.
- Oh.

465
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,377
Mr Coleman?
I do remember he.

466
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:16,220
- Up there by the Dane.
- Back of the old town.

467
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:22,807
I lost two dear friends.

468
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:26,102
- I am sorry.
- Scrofula.

469
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:30,478
- Oh, yes. Terrible sickness.
- Aye.

470
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,400
Longtime ago.

471
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:57,296
- Oh! Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, madam.

472
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:01,216
- It is Mrs Somerville.
- Yes, you are expected.

473
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,343
Thank you most kindly.

474
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:06,687
Oh, what an elegant residence.

475
00:43:07,764 --> 00:43:09,983
Have you come far, Mrs Somerville?

476
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,695
Oh, yes, indeed.
All the way from Chelsea.

477
00:43:13,812 --> 00:43:16,156
I took the steamer to Westminster,
about an hour.

478
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:19,243
- Was the river busy?
- Extremely.

479
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,078
You can see the whole world
on the Thames.

480
00:43:22,195 --> 00:43:24,948
- Mrs Somerville.
- Oh, good afternoon, Mr Turner.

481
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:27,292
My apologies if I have forced you
to wait upon me.

482
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:32,131
Oh, not at all. I have enjoyed
a most pleasant interlude with your father.

483
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:35,171
- You find yourself well?
- Passing fair, thank you. And you?

484
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:37,590
Indeed. Dr Somerville likewise?

485
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:42,683
Oh, yes, he's much engaged
in administering to the poor veterans.

486
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,428
Well, now, it's a beautiful sunny day,

487
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:48,396
just perfect for our experiment.

488
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:50,607
I have everything I need
here in my wee bag,

489
00:43:50,724 --> 00:43:52,818
Are we going to witness an explosion?

490
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,732
Oh, goodness me!
No, I hope not.

491
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:56,730
I'm astounded
you have all your paraphernalia

492
00:43:56,855 --> 00:44:00,029
- contained in yon small pouch.
- Indeed it is, Mr Turner.

493
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,073
Everything except God's good sunlight.

494
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,823
Daddy, Mrs Somerville
is a natural philosopher.

495
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:09,997
- Is she, now?
- Mathematician, astronomer, geologist.

496
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:12,871
The universe is a wondrous thing,
is it not, Mr Turner?

497
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:14,623
It is, to be sure.

498
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:16,170
The planets and the stars,

499
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,339
the oceans and the tides,

500
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:20,879
the clouds and the air,

501
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:23,098
mountains, volcanoes...

502
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:25,888
The tides be subject
to the effect of the moon.

503
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:29,889
Quite so,
the mysterious force of gravity.

504
00:44:30,013 --> 00:44:31,981
It is my strong belief

505
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:35,481
that all things on this earth
are connected.

506
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:39,610
- Nothing exists in isolation.
- Indeed.

507
00:44:41,024 --> 00:44:44,494
The rain falls, the sun shines

508
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:46,534
and the onions grow.

509
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:47,701
Oh, yes,

510
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:50,245
Daddy likes to affect the pretence
of being a dunce.

511
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:51,887
He is in fact a man of high intellect.

512
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:54,670
- He taught me how to read and write.
- Is that so?

513
00:44:54,788 --> 00:44:59,385
- Education is an important thing.
- It is indeed, most important for everyone.

514
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:03,051
I myself am presently engaged
in the tutoring of my children.

515
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:04,718
That is indeed commendable.

516
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:07,092
It is a privilege
that was not afforded to me.

517
00:45:07,217 --> 00:45:10,266
I am an uneducated,
self-taught Scotch woman.

518
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:13,640
Mrs Somerville, you are what you are.

519
00:45:13,765 --> 00:45:15,642
- As are we, Daddy.
- True.

520
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:17,314
Thank you.

521
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:20,689
And what was your profession, Mr Turner?

522
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:23,067
Daddy was the finest barber
in Covent Garden.

523
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:25,410
I had some success in the business.

524
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:26,785
Wig maker.

525
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:29,497
He was a master
of the razor and the brush.

526
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:31,616
You're the master of the brush now,
Mr Turner.

527
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:32,833
Well...

528
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:35,420
My little lad could draw
afore he could read and write.

529
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,586
Sat in the corner of the shop,
scratching away with the chalk and charcoal.

530
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,800
I'd stick his pictures in the window.

531
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:42,169
And sell 'em, all of 'em.

532
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:44,546
For two or three shillings apiece
on occasion.

533
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:46,928
Do you have children yourself, Mr Turner?

534
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,301
I do not, Mrs Somerville.

535
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:55,898
Thank you, Mr Turner.

536
00:45:56,808 --> 00:45:59,106
- Have you ever seen a prism?
- I have not.

537
00:45:59,227 --> 00:46:00,649
Ooh!

538
00:46:01,855 --> 00:46:03,448
There it is.

539
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:07,736
That is a thing of beauty.

540
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:11,707
Shortly you shall witness
a rainbow passing through it.

541
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:14,872
- Sir Isaac Newton, Daddy.
- Ah!

542
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:18,873
Gentlemen, might I request
that you close the shutters, please?

543
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,840
- Daddy.
- Ah!

544
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,259
Tell us when to cease,
Mrs Somerville.

545
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:29,804
We need to create an aperture...

546
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,223
...to strengthen the colours.

547
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:37,558
- There.
- Daddy!

548
00:46:37,682 --> 00:46:40,936
- Aha!
- Let us put the paper in place.

549
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,690
- Daddy, some tacks for Mrs Somerville.
- No, no tacks, Mr Turner.

550
00:46:44,814 --> 00:46:47,442
The metal could contaminate the experiment.

551
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,454
A wee nub of wax.

552
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,664
Paper.

553
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:00,868
And what is the purpose
of the small piece of paper?

554
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:06,758
I shall cover the bottom half of the needle
so that it is not exposed.

555
00:47:06,878 --> 00:47:08,346
Ah.

556
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,934
And what is it you are about now,
Mrs Somerville?

557
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:15,804
You'll have to wait and see, won't you?

558
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:22,527
Daddy, I wager that is the first time

559
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:24,988
you've witnessed a hammer
being produced from a lady's reticule.

560
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:26,822
For certain 'tis!

561
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:37,204
You have the arm of a blacksmith,
Mrs Somerville.

562
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:42,709
There, now.

563
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:48,212
That has thrown
all those wee particles into chaos.

564
00:47:49,087 --> 00:47:51,181
Particles into chaos.

565
00:47:52,215 --> 00:47:55,685
What is the element contained
within the violet light

566
00:47:55,802 --> 00:47:57,475
such as magnetises the material?

567
00:47:57,554 --> 00:48:01,309
That is what, as yet, Mr Turner,
I do not know.

568
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:04,356
- Ah, the majesty of mystery.
- Indeed,

569
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:06,980
Now, let us allow nature
to take its course.

570
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:10,279
Although we will have to adjust
the position of the easel from time to time.

571
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,700
Indeed, as mighty Apollo moves
across his heavenly tract.

572
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,288
Yes!

573
00:48:15,405 --> 00:48:17,908
- Three steps down, Mrs Somerville.
- Take care.

574
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:20,876
Oh, my goodness me!

575
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:24,210
Oh, Mr Turner, I am quite overwhelmed.

576
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,424
Do as you wish, view as you wish.

577
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:30,171
Oh, my!
These are breathtaking, are they not?

578
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:33,219
My dear late father
would have much appreciated them.

579
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:36,843
- A naval man, I believe.
- Indeed, he was a vice admiral.

580
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:40,222
- We have the Battle of Trafalgar over here.
- Was he there, your father?

581
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:42,849
- Er, no, he was at Camperdown.
- Ah.

582
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:46,436
- Lord Nelson's ﬂagship, the Victory.
- Indeed.

583
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:49,360
- It's a sketch for the painting.
- Oh?

584
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,699
- Commissioned by the King.
- Is that so?

585
00:48:51,816 --> 00:48:53,818
Two years in the making,

586
00:48:53,943 --> 00:48:56,412
- He didn't like it.
- Did he not?

587
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:57,872
- No,
- Too good for him.

588
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:01,496
Two years!

589
00:49:01,618 --> 00:49:04,041
It takes me only half an hour
to paint a picture.

590
00:49:04,162 --> 00:49:05,880
So you are an artist, Mrs Somerville?

591
00:49:05,997 --> 00:49:09,968
Oh, I don't think we can quite use that term
in the presence of Mr Turner.

592
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:13,258
Nevertheless, Daddy,
Mrs Somerville is a fine watercolourist.

593
00:49:13,379 --> 00:49:16,098
Oh, you ﬂatter me.
Oh, what an epic storm scene!

594
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:18,764
Rock crushing a house in Switzerland.

595
00:49:19,594 --> 00:49:22,097
Calais sands,
women digging for bait.

596
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:24,895
I don't care for that much.

597
00:49:27,352 --> 00:49:28,774
Oh.

598
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:32,323
Oh, my! What have we here?

599
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,319
Oh, it's Hannibal crossing the Alps.

600
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:37,946
Do you see the elephant?

601
00:49:38,071 --> 00:49:41,496
- An elephant?
- He's in there somewhere.

602
00:49:42,408 --> 00:49:46,163
- Are you teasing me, Mr Turner?
- By no means, madam.

603
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,221
Can you find him?

604
00:50:03,346 --> 00:50:05,690
Well, no, I cannot.

605
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:07,851
There he is.

606
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:12,030
- Oh! Ha, ha!
- Daddy's little jest.

607
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:17,781
Oh, it is a terrifying scene!

608
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:20,371
The elements
dwarfing the elephants.

609
00:50:20,488 --> 00:50:21,990
Hubris.

610
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,792
There.

611
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:32,383
Shall I make it do a wee dance?

612
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:36,721
So, the end of the needle
that was exposed to the violet light

613
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,590
has produced a magnetic north pole.

614
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:41,093
- Like a compass?
- Exactly so.

615
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:44,061
Whereas, Mr Turner,
had I done the same experiment

616
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:45,851
using the red end of the spectrum,

617
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:48,316
this needle would not have been magnetised.

618
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:52,734
I have, from time to time, attempted it
with the green and the blue,

619
00:50:52,895 --> 00:50:55,944
and it has succeeded on occasion
but not consistently.

620
00:50:56,065 --> 00:50:58,284
Colour is contradictory.

621
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:02,284
Well, is it, Mr Turner?

622
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:03,824
Colour is absolute.

623
00:51:03,948 --> 00:51:07,373
Sublime but contradictory yet harmonious.

624
00:51:08,077 --> 00:51:10,500
You are a man of great vision, Mr Turner.

625
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:15,301
The universe is chaotic
and you make us see it.

626
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,262
In natural philosophy

627
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,758
nothing can ever be proved,
only disproved.

628
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:25,057
The purity of your prism,
the contamination of my palette.

629
00:51:25,178 --> 00:51:28,398
Natural light, blackness.

630
00:51:28,514 --> 00:51:31,518
White is the power of good,
black is the devil.

631
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:35,317
Hm.

632
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:46,367
Transparent bodies depend so much
upon what is opposed to them,

633
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:48,243
having no colour,

634
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:50,620
that they take every one offered.

635
00:51:52,663 --> 00:51:53,880
Um...

636
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:59,721
Water often possesses colour

637
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:02,925
but colour is not imparted
to its reﬂections...

638
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:07,137
...or refractions
like a coloured glass

639
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:13,230
when everything seen
is vitiated by that colour.

640
00:52:15,353 --> 00:52:19,153
Even the purest mirror
gives a tone to the sky

641
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:21,492
and as the colour is increased,

642
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:24,829
it destroys
all the colour of nature by its...

643
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:27,240
...by its own dullness,

644
00:52:27,365 --> 00:52:32,462
while water often seems
to challenge the sky for...

645
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:37,379
...brightness and...

646
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:41,054
...and when possessing colour, um...

647
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:45,346
...it's reﬂections of objects
appear more possible.

648
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:49,221
In short, their effects
are like their qualities.

649
00:52:50,304 --> 00:52:54,104
One repels the immediate ray.

650
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:56,068
The other absorbs it.

651
00:52:56,185 --> 00:53:00,031
The one transparent
while the mirror...

652
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:02,366
...is opa... is opaque.

653
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:11,625
How can they appear the same?

654
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:14,938
Daddy, cease your labour.
Go and sit in your chair.

655
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,312
I can't leave this.

656
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:20,562
It'll keep for the half-hour.
Go and peruse your newspaper.

657
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:29,203
Do not stoop.

658
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:35,414
Go and rest your bones.

659
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,218
- What's occurring?
- He's struggling.

660
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:28,675
Are you rattling?

661
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:30,548
Come on, bring it up.

662
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,649
- Shh-sh-sh.
- No, indeed not, sir.

663
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:53,580
I shall. I shall tell her.
I will tell her.

664
00:55:56,741 --> 00:55:59,540
I ought to have told her afore.

665
00:56:01,037 --> 00:56:04,166
- Years ago.
- Who do you speak of, Daddy?

666
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,213
Afore they took her away.

667
00:56:07,626 --> 00:56:11,597
Eastertide, the good Lord took her from us.

668
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,772
We did not do right by her, poor woman.

669
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:23,063
She was a lunatic.

670
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:27,063
We didn't have no choice, Daddy.

671
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:32,698
She made our life a living hell.

672
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:38,453
She was your mother.
Curse her!

673
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:44,456
Show her due respect, boy.

674
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:48,713
The bitch!

675
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,693
My little lad.

676
00:57:08,104 --> 00:57:09,777
Daddy.

677
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:26,891
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good day to you, madam.

678
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:29,860
- It's been a long while, ain't it?
- Mm-hm, yeah.

679
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:33,572
- May I offer you a refreshment?
- No, thank you kindly.

680
00:58:33,689 --> 00:58:36,192
- Champagne?
- No, no.

681
00:58:36,317 --> 00:58:38,194
No mind, sir,

682
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:42,540
I regret all my lovely girls are occupied
but we do have young Eliza here

683
00:58:42,656 --> 00:58:46,081
who I do not believe
you've had the pleasure of previous.

684
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:52,083
She has a pleasing countenance,
when she smiles.

685
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:55,052
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you, miss.

686
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:57,422
Show the gentleman
to your chamber, dear.

687
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:00,636
It's this way, sir.

688
00:59:22,488 --> 00:59:24,240
Very fine.

689
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:26,875
I do extras.

690
00:59:27,743 --> 00:59:29,541
No, no, no, no, no.

691
00:59:29,662 --> 00:59:31,414
Remove the bodice.

692
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:40,889
Expose your breasts.

693
00:59:42,174 --> 00:59:44,017
No, no... no.

694
00:59:44,134 --> 00:59:45,761
Lay upon the bed.

695
00:59:51,392 --> 00:59:53,565
Pan your legs.

696
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:54,983
Crook your knee.

697
00:59:55,104 --> 00:59:56,947
Right arm as thus.

698
00:59:58,148 --> 01:00:01,448
Hand upon the head.
No... as in despair.

699
01:00:39,773 --> 01:00:41,195
Yes.

700
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:59,757
Eliza... or Liza?

701
01:01:01,045 --> 01:01:02,547
Eliza.

702
01:01:04,006 --> 01:01:05,508
Or Liza.

703
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:09,979
- Your age?
- Twenty-two, sir.

704
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,561
Twenty-two?

705
01:02:12,574 --> 01:02:15,168
Would you like
something to drink, sir?

706
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,754
No... thank you, miss.

707
01:02:23,836 --> 01:02:25,383
Now...

708
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:28,341
expose your breasts,

709
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:10,296
- Good day, sir.
- Madam.

710
01:07:10,414 --> 01:07:12,291
- You be seeking lodgings?
- Indeed.

711
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,510
Oh... I do know'ee.

712
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:17,800
Er, Mr Duckworth.

713
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:21,175
- Mallard.
- Oh, Mr Mallard. Of course!

714
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:23,097
Well, you be lucky.
The room is free.

715
01:07:23,218 --> 01:07:25,220
- Splendid.
- Well, do come in.

716
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:28,895
There. Oh, it be most pleasant
to see you again.

717
01:07:37,941 --> 01:07:41,320
Oh, Mr Mallard.
Everything satisfactory in your chamber?

718
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:42,446
Most agreeable'

719
01:07:42,571 --> 01:07:45,324
Good. Well, you sit there
and make yourself comfy.

720
01:07:45,449 --> 01:07:48,498
I expect you'll be tired
after your journey.

721
01:07:48,618 --> 01:07:51,667
Now, I have not poured your tea
for it is fresh in the pot.

722
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,125
No matter.
Suits me, brewed and stewed.

723
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:55,751
Oh!

724
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:59,676
Now, that I do remember, Mr Mallard.
And will you take a biscuit?

725
01:07:59,755 --> 01:08:03,055
No, thank you, madam.
I purchased a potato on the boat.

726
01:08:03,175 --> 01:08:06,054
I should think that were all
you could manage on the steamer.

727
01:08:06,178 --> 01:08:08,101
It was somewhat turbulent.

728
01:08:08,221 --> 01:08:10,690
I shall leave you
to take your refreshment.

729
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:14,145
Madam, may I apprehend you
with my condolences?

730
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:16,275
Oh...

731
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:17,613
I do thank you, sir.

732
01:08:17,731 --> 01:08:21,611
My sympathies, commiserations,
for the loss of your dear departed man.

733
01:08:21,735 --> 01:08:24,079
Well, he were a dear man.

734
01:08:27,115 --> 01:08:31,871
'Tis twice in my life now
I have found myself a widow.

735
01:08:33,246 --> 01:08:36,876
My first husband were taken from me
when I was but a young woman.

736
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,547
How was he taken?

737
01:08:38,668 --> 01:08:41,421
He were foying over there
on Goodwin Sands.

738
01:08:41,546 --> 01:08:45,676
- A life-saver.
- Aye. He did save many a life.

739
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:50,306
But in the end...
he could not save his own.

740
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:53,274
We never did find him, poor soul.

741
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:59,027
My boy were eight year old
when he did lose his father.

742
01:08:59,147 --> 01:09:00,945
I was eight
when I lost my little sister.

743
01:09:01,066 --> 01:09:03,285
Oh? Oh, I am sorry.

744
01:09:07,823 --> 01:09:10,827
Well... 'tis the way of things.

745
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:17,958
Ooh...

746
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:21,428
You still making
your nice little pictures, Mr Mallard?

747
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:27,676
There.

748
01:09:48,572 --> 01:09:50,290
Mr Billy.

749
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,212
Welcome home.

750
01:09:57,747 --> 01:09:59,340
Dirty water.

751
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:11,303
Pleasant trip?

752
01:10:14,848 --> 01:10:16,350
Your order came.

753
01:10:16,474 --> 01:10:20,195
- Did he send the cobalt blue?
- I put it in a jar.

754
01:10:20,312 --> 01:10:23,236
Chrome yellow, scarlet lake, lead white.

755
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:26,360
- Canvases?
- He put 'em downstairs for me.

756
01:10:26,484 --> 01:10:29,328
Two six-by-fours,
three four-by-threes.

757
01:10:29,446 --> 01:10:32,120
- Megilp?
- Next week.

758
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:38,914
Was it a pleasant trip?

759
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:14,408
- Good morning, Mr Turner.
- Marlin, Sir Billy, Gussy.

760
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:16,785
- Good day to you, Billy.
- Delighted you could join us.

761
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,129
Damn fine spectacle this year, Billy.

762
01:11:19,245 --> 01:11:20,417
Aha!

763
01:11:21,957 --> 01:11:23,959
A very fine day to you, Mr Stothard!

764
01:11:24,084 --> 01:11:25,802
What? Oh!

765
01:11:25,919 --> 01:11:27,762
Mr Turner, sir!

766
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:36,855
- Constable.
- Turner.

767
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:45,321
- Jonesy, Carlo.
- William.

768
01:11:45,438 --> 01:11:46,781
The Hanging Committee.

769
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:49,071
- You approve?
- 'Tis well hung.

770
01:11:49,192 --> 01:11:51,445
<i>- Grazie.
- Prego.</i>

771
01:11:53,321 --> 01:11:55,574
Would everything be
to your satisfaction, Mr Turner?

772
01:11:55,699 --> 01:11:57,622
It is indeed, Mr President.

773
01:11:57,742 --> 01:12:01,246
- 'Tis a splendid cornucopia,
- Cornucopia!

774
01:12:01,371 --> 01:12:04,671
- Good morning, Turner.
- Good morning to you, Mr Leslie.

775
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:06,464
- Rabbie.
- Good morning, Mr Turner.

776
01:12:06,584 --> 01:12:08,177
My other piece,
where is it located?

777
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:11,264
- We placed it in the anteroom.
- The anteroom.

778
01:12:11,381 --> 01:12:12,928
Oh.

779
01:12:14,342 --> 01:12:16,470
- Mr Carew!
- Turner!

780
01:12:18,138 --> 01:12:20,766
- Stanny.
- Hello, Mr Turner, sir.

781
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,273
- Is it for His Majesty?
- Indeed.

782
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:27,648
- I hope it meets his expectations.
- It will.

783
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:30,700
- Grout.
- Mr Turner.

784
01:12:36,114 --> 01:12:40,745
- Ah! Sir John Soane!
- J. M. W. Turner, esquire!

785
01:12:40,869 --> 01:12:42,837
- As I live and breathe.
- My dear friend.

786
01:12:42,954 --> 01:12:44,547
Find yourself well, John?

787
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,416
- Relishing the day.
- Capital.

788
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:48,760
Only now I was admiring your seascape.

789
01:12:48,877 --> 01:12:50,379
There she is.

790
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:53,507
- Mr Pickersgill.
- Good morning, William.

791
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:55,008
Oh!

792
01:12:55,133 --> 01:12:57,056
He has the air of despondency upon him.

793
01:12:57,177 --> 01:12:59,475
- He is slighted.
- For why?

794
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:02,065
Yet again in the anteroom,

795
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:05,978
They hang us where they will, Pickers.
Take a guzzle of brown sherry.

796
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,814
Damn fine storm you have there, Billy.

797
01:13:08,938 --> 01:13:11,532
Nimbus, Sir Billy, nimbus,

798
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:19,203
Oh, beg your pardon, sir.

799
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:43,850
- Carlo the Salamander.
<i>- Amico mio.</i>

800
01:13:43,973 --> 01:13:46,567
- Harmony and unity, William
- Chemise.

801
01:13:46,684 --> 01:13:48,686
- Chemise?
- Lower.

802
01:13:51,231 --> 01:13:53,029
<i>- Molto bene.</i>
- Jonesy!

803
01:13:53,108 --> 01:13:54,906
- I want you to see...
- What?

804
01:13:55,026 --> 01:13:56,619
- Remember?
- Remind me.

805
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:58,613
- Pisa.
- Oh, Pisa!

806
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:00,490
- Fine around there, Gussy.
- You think so?

807
01:14:00,615 --> 01:14:02,492
Oh, yeah.

808
01:14:04,953 --> 01:14:07,251
- Nelson?
- With two arms.

809
01:14:10,834 --> 01:14:12,507
- Mr Leslie,
- Turner.

810
01:14:12,627 --> 01:14:17,053
Little maid, gamboge gown,
left foot instep, touch of highlight.

811
01:14:18,049 --> 01:14:19,266
Thank you, Turner.

812
01:14:19,384 --> 01:14:22,103
Paintings always benefit his remarks.

813
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,973
Carew!
This your man?

814
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:26,645
'Tis he.

815
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:29,394
Sports an elegant nostril,
does he not, Sir John?

816
01:14:29,519 --> 01:14:32,443
- Splendid nostrils.
- Thank you kindly.

817
01:14:32,564 --> 01:14:33,656
What did you say?

818
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:36,276
Elegant pair of nostrils, Mr Stothard!

819
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:38,403
Oh, yes, Yes, indeed.

820
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,623
Why on earth would he go and do that?

821
01:15:27,744 --> 01:15:31,339
Oh, I believe Mr Turner knows
well enough what he's doing, Sir Martin.

822
01:15:31,456 --> 01:15:33,675
Do you think so?

823
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:37,512
- He's ruined a masterpiece.
- I think not.

824
01:15:37,629 --> 01:15:40,132
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

825
01:15:41,382 --> 01:15:43,225
He's been here and fired a gun.

826
01:15:43,384 --> 01:15:45,386
Oh, no, no.

827
01:15:45,511 --> 01:15:48,731
John, you must not
upset yourself like this,

828
01:15:50,892 --> 01:15:52,940
The man's impossible.

829
01:15:53,061 --> 01:15:55,780
I mean, why would he go
and destroy a perfectly good painting?

830
01:15:55,897 --> 01:15:57,820
Sheer mockery.

831
01:15:59,484 --> 01:16:01,578
My sympathy is with Constable.

832
01:16:01,694 --> 01:16:05,198
He's got a damn fine picture here
and he's made a damn mockery of it.

833
01:16:05,323 --> 01:16:08,042
There's method
in the madness, gentlemen.

834
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:11,413
- If that is method, it is pure madness.
- But, what is it? Is it...

835
01:16:11,537 --> 01:16:14,336
Oh, do stop that prattling laughter,
Mr Carew!

836
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:18,382
I wager we've not seen
the end of this, gentlemen.

837
01:16:18,503 --> 01:16:20,050
He may surprise us yet.

838
01:16:22,173 --> 01:16:23,766
Haydon.

839
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:25,681
Hey!

840
01:16:35,603 --> 01:16:39,733
Ah, Mr Turner.
We were just wondering if...

841
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:45,746
I said he wasn't finished.

842
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:10,138
- It's a buoy!
- Bravo!

843
01:17:10,263 --> 01:17:12,436
Bravo! Marvellous!

844
01:17:17,478 --> 01:17:19,572
Can you explain
your rendition?

845
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:21,862
It needs no explanation, sir.

846
01:17:21,983 --> 01:17:24,987
'Tis our Redeemer's conveyance
into Jerusalem, plain as day.

847
01:17:25,111 --> 01:17:26,658
Blasphemy!

848
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:28,406
You faring well, Mr Haydon?

849
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:32,206
- This will be the finish of me!
- 50 pounds!

850
01:17:41,544 --> 01:17:43,922
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir, for your charity.

851
01:17:44,047 --> 01:17:46,300
- Haydon?
- You have been most kind.

852
01:17:46,424 --> 01:17:48,552
Most kind in your placement.
You have finished me.

853
01:17:48,676 --> 01:17:51,805
You might as well have taken my painting
and put it in the outhouse.

854
01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:54,182
Better yet, taken it out of this building
and thrown it in the Fleet.

855
01:17:54,307 --> 01:17:56,605
Haydon, I am hard... hard set

856
01:17:56,726 --> 01:17:58,694
- to understand your indignation.
- And as for you, my pupil...

857
01:17:58,811 --> 01:18:01,815
Your painting, sir, is hanging
next-door to that of Mr Turner.

858
01:18:01,939 --> 01:18:04,488
- It is in fine company.
- This is treachery!

859
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:07,689
- And do not talk to me of Turners work.
- Please lower your voice, Mr Haydon.

860
01:18:07,695 --> 01:18:09,868
His pictures look as if they were
painted by somebody born without hands!

861
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:11,616
Mr Haydon, what is your quarrel?

862
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:14,301
What principles have you applied
other than those that I gave...?

863
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:17,373
- Mr Haydon, please lower your voice.
- I will not, sir!

864
01:18:17,538 --> 01:18:19,779
- What is your quarrel here?
- I have no respect for you.

865
01:18:19,874 --> 01:18:22,878
I certainly do not acknowledge
your presidency.

866
01:18:23,002 --> 01:18:24,219
It should have been Wilkie.

867
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:27,932
Mr Haydon, I will not have personal
attacks like this on the Academy ﬂoor.

868
01:18:28,049 --> 01:18:29,809
You will have
what I choose to give you, sir.

869
01:18:29,842 --> 01:18:31,282
This would be one
of the many reasons

870
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:32,854
why you were never accepted here,
Mr Haydon.

871
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:35,393
This man... this man has spent
a quarter of a century

872
01:18:35,556 --> 01:18:37,399
doing everything in his power
to malign me...

873
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:39,877
- I have done nothing of the sort.
- ...and spoil my genius.

874
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:41,737
- Refrain from this shouting, Mr Haydon.
- I will not!

875
01:18:41,854 --> 01:18:43,982
- I will have you forcibly removed.
- Yes, do it!

876
01:18:44,107 --> 01:18:46,405
Do it! Remove me
from your nest of portrait painters!

877
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:47,489
Have a care!

878
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:49,237
What, sir, is wrong
with being a portrait painter?

879
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:50,864
What does it do to elevate the art?

880
01:18:50,988 --> 01:18:53,388
I received the accolade
from the King for painting portraits.

881
01:18:53,408 --> 01:18:55,877
- Oh, God! I bow to him!
- And damn good ones too, sir!

882
01:18:55,993 --> 01:18:59,918
Haydon, can I point out
that I, too, hang in the inferior chamber?

883
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:02,167
I care not for your work, sir.
I care not a fig.

884
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:06,091
At least my work does not represent
self-portrait as ass.

885
01:19:06,212 --> 01:19:09,056
Give me those...

886
01:19:11,884 --> 01:19:14,433
- Unhand me!
- Remove this man!

887
01:19:14,554 --> 01:19:17,023
You swines! You swines!

888
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,643
Mr Haydon, sir,
with deep regret I must inform you

889
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:22,111
that I am on my way to the porters,

890
01:19:22,228 --> 01:19:24,447
unless you feel free to leave
of your own volition.

891
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:26,282
Shh, shh.

892
01:19:26,774 --> 01:19:28,276
Please, sir.

893
01:19:30,278 --> 01:19:32,872
Stretch me no longer on this rough world.

894
01:19:34,991 --> 01:19:36,834
I'm done with you.

895
01:21:15,508 --> 01:21:17,135
Oh!

896
01:21:44,245 --> 01:21:47,715
'Tis nice to have a bit of company
for a change.

897
01:21:47,832 --> 01:21:50,593
So you had a good walk, then?
Weren't too chippy up there by Reculver?

898
01:21:50,751 --> 01:21:54,176
Somewhat blowy and the wind
did kick up some white horses.

899
01:21:54,297 --> 01:21:56,015
Can do this time of year.

900
01:21:56,132 --> 01:21:58,180
In summertime, though,
'tis a lovely calm spot for a picnic

901
01:21:58,301 --> 01:21:59,678
up there by the Two Sisters,

902
01:21:59,802 --> 01:22:03,102
but in wintertime I have known
the whole of Marine Terrace down here

903
01:22:03,222 --> 01:22:06,476
without a pane of glass left
in the entire place.

904
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:08,774
Oh, the glaziers do get rich.

905
01:22:09,812 --> 01:22:12,736
When Mr Booth and I moved in here,
we had the whole place polished up,

906
01:22:12,857 --> 01:22:15,155
spick and span,
ready for our first visitors

907
01:22:15,276 --> 01:22:17,950
and the wind did blow
and the sea come up.

908
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:20,243
We had broken glass everywhere.
It were terrible.

909
01:22:20,364 --> 01:22:22,617
Mrs Booth.

910
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:25,036
Would you be so kind
as to look out of the window?

911
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:29,249
Where? What am I looking at?

912
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:32,502
From the tip of your nose to the bridge
to the curve of your brow

913
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:38,057
you put me in mind of a Greek sculpture
I'm familiar with, of Aphrodite,

914
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:40,889
the goddess of love'

915
01:22:41,927 --> 01:22:44,646
Oh, now!

916
01:22:44,805 --> 01:22:46,853
No one's ever said that
about my nose before.

917
01:22:46,974 --> 01:22:48,100
This old snout!

918
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:55,487
Truth to tell,
my eyes aren't so good these days

919
01:22:55,608 --> 01:22:59,784
so when I do look in the looking-glass
I be glad I cannot see so well.

920
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:03,750
When I peruse myself in the looking-glass,
I see a gargoyle.

921
01:23:04,867 --> 01:23:06,665
Now, you be fishing for compliments,

922
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:10,541
and my old ma used to say, them
what fish for compliments don't gel none.

923
01:23:10,665 --> 01:23:14,169
Besides, 'tis what's within a person
that do matter.

924
01:23:16,337 --> 01:23:18,760
I do not know you, Mr Mallard,

925
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:25,184
and I'm sure there be things about you
that are beyond my understanding,

926
01:23:26,263 --> 01:23:28,937
but I believe you to be...

927
01:23:29,058 --> 01:23:33,154
a man of great... spirit
and fine feeling.

928
01:23:38,234 --> 01:23:39,702
Mrs Booth...

929
01:23:41,821 --> 01:23:44,825
...you are a woman
of profound beauty.

930
01:23:48,786 --> 01:23:50,288
Mr Mallard...

931
01:23:56,293 --> 01:23:58,466
I am lost for words.

932
01:24:00,464 --> 01:24:01,886
Hm.

933
01:24:24,029 --> 01:24:26,657
Good night, Mr Mallard, sir.

934
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:28,743
I've cleaned your boots for'ee.

935
01:24:28,868 --> 01:24:30,711
They're by the door here.

936
01:24:33,998 --> 01:24:35,500
Mrs Booth.

937
01:24:37,543 --> 01:24:41,173
I thank you
for a most convivial evening.

938
01:24:41,297 --> 01:24:43,140
I do thank you too, sir.

939
01:26:19,103 --> 01:26:22,482
If I may be so bold as to say, mate,

940
01:26:23,941 --> 01:26:26,035
as I see it,

941
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:29,239
you're a loose cannon
rolling round the deck.

942
01:27:15,784 --> 01:27:16,910
And out.

943
01:27:20,372 --> 01:27:22,500
Cover yourself up.

944
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:23,922
Good man.

945
01:27:24,043 --> 01:27:27,638
Well, Mr Mallard
is suffering from bronchitis.

946
01:27:27,755 --> 01:27:29,302
Oh... there.

947
01:27:29,423 --> 01:27:31,721
For which we prescribe the three Bs:

948
01:27:31,842 --> 01:27:34,265
- bed, balsam and broth.
- Oh.

949
01:27:34,386 --> 01:27:38,266
To be administered in this case
by the fourth B: the admirable Mrs Booth.

950
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:39,733
- Oh!
- Thank you.

951
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:43,571
Now, Mrs Booth, if you would be so good
as to come up to the house after four,

952
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:45,109
I shall have the balsam prepared.

953
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:47,733
- Indeed I shall, sir.
- Good day, Mr Mallard.

954
01:27:47,858 --> 01:27:50,486
Rest the body, sir,
and the soul shall find solace.

955
01:27:50,611 --> 01:27:53,285
I do thank ye, Doctor.
Let me show ye out.

956
01:27:53,405 --> 01:27:55,578
- Good day to you, Mrs Booth.
- Good day to you, sir.

957
01:28:20,975 --> 01:28:22,022
Gentlemen.

958
01:28:22,184 --> 01:28:23,982
Ah, Mr Turner.

959
01:28:24,144 --> 01:28:28,274
My father and I are marvelling
at this glorious work.

960
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:30,993
Er... might I be correct in remembering

961
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:34,705
that we had the good fortune of viewing it
at the Academy last summer?

962
01:28:34,822 --> 01:28:35,948
Indeed.

963
01:28:36,031 --> 01:28:40,002
Well, I must say, it is no less impressive
on its second viewing.

964
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,039
Perhaps even more so.
Is it not, Father?

965
01:28:43,205 --> 01:28:44,377
Indeed so.

966
01:28:44,498 --> 01:28:47,627
I recall it provoked
much heated and stimulating discussion

967
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:49,719
long after our viewing.

968
01:28:49,837 --> 01:28:52,590
- It did not sell.
- Indeed not?

969
01:28:52,715 --> 01:28:54,683
No, Mr Ruskin.

970
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,724
- I'm astonished.
- But it is a masterpiece.

971
01:28:57,845 --> 01:29:00,689
- Thackeray reviles it.
- How so?

972
01:29:00,806 --> 01:29:04,356
- Sublime or ridiculous, he says.
- Well, perhaps he should make up his mind.

973
01:29:04,476 --> 01:29:06,023
He has a sharp and cynical tongue.

974
01:29:06,145 --> 01:29:09,524
There is no place for cynicism
in the reviewing of art.

975
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:11,241
Hm...

976
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:13,986
- 'Tis of no consequence.
- Quite.

977
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:16,037
It is purchasable.

978
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:18,991
Enticing.

979
01:29:19,074 --> 01:29:20,951
Perhaps.

980
01:29:23,162 --> 01:29:28,168
Typhus epidemic amongst the cargo,
slaves die on board, no insurance.

981
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:31,796
Sling 'em in the drink,
drowned dead, cash.

982
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,764
I am struck by the column of bright white,

983
01:29:34,882 --> 01:29:38,056
placed precisely off centre here,

984
01:29:38,218 --> 01:29:41,973
applied over the darkened background,
impasto,

985
01:29:42,056 --> 01:29:47,233
contrasting with the scarlet and ochre hues
in the upper left corner,

986
01:29:47,352 --> 01:29:50,777
which in turn contrasts
with the presence of God,

987
01:29:50,898 --> 01:29:54,323
revealing to us that hope exists

988
01:29:54,443 --> 01:29:57,697
even in the most turbulent
and illimitable of deaths'

989
01:29:57,821 --> 01:29:59,243
Bluebottles.

990
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:03,499
- Eh?
- Up in the muslin, Knock 'em out.

991
01:30:04,661 --> 01:30:06,914
Well, I didn't put 'em there.

992
01:30:10,334 --> 01:30:14,885
Would it not sit splendidly
above the fireplace in the library, Father?

993
01:30:15,005 --> 01:30:18,726
It would, but I fear
it may be beyond our purse, John.

994
01:30:18,842 --> 01:30:21,220
I'm sure some arrangement
can be come to, sir.

995
01:30:22,763 --> 01:30:24,436
Mind your heads.

996
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:28,152
You're just...
you're just knocking 'em up and down.

997
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:29,937
Scrape 'em out.

998
01:30:30,062 --> 01:30:32,440
Now you've...
Now you've knocked it over there.

999
01:31:10,018 --> 01:31:11,986
There. 'Tis a nice day for'ee.

1000
01:31:15,774 --> 01:31:17,902
<i>Au revoir, madame.</i>

1001
01:31:22,156 --> 01:31:23,783
T'other way.

1002
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:27,207
- Morning, Mrs Stokes.
- Morning.

1003
01:31:57,733 --> 01:32:02,330
Dr Price, Mrs Booth has summoned you here
under false pretenses.

1004
01:32:02,446 --> 01:32:04,073
Shh! Let the doctor do his work.

1005
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:05,495
Breathe in.

1006
01:32:07,075 --> 01:32:09,077
Breathe out

1007
01:32:09,203 --> 01:32:11,922
Have you been exerting yourself
unduly, Mr Mallard?

1008
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:13,791
No more than is usual, sir.

1009
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:15,714
Remind me again,
what is your profession?

1010
01:32:17,252 --> 01:32:20,051
- Master of Chancery,
- Breathe in.

1011
01:32:20,172 --> 01:32:22,345
Forgive me, sir,
but I beg to differ.

1012
01:32:22,466 --> 01:32:25,015
Breathe out

1013
01:32:25,135 --> 01:32:28,560
I suggest that you are Mr Turner,
the illustrious painter,

1014
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,934
and I am greatly honoured
to make your acquaintance.

1015
01:32:32,809 --> 01:32:34,436
My apologies to you both,

1016
01:32:34,561 --> 01:32:37,405
but rest assured
that my discretion can be relied upon.

1017
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:42,074
Now, allow me to examine your eyes.

1018
01:32:42,194 --> 01:32:44,993
The eyes of a master.

1019
01:32:45,113 --> 01:32:46,535
Open wide.

1020
01:32:47,282 --> 01:32:48,750
Mm-hm.

1021
01:32:49,618 --> 01:32:51,040
Look up.

1022
01:32:52,371 --> 01:32:53,793
Hmm.

1023
01:32:55,165 --> 01:32:58,510
Mr Turner, you are suffering
from a disorder of the heart.

1024
01:32:59,711 --> 01:33:02,089
There is no immediate
cause for concern, Mrs Booth.

1025
01:33:02,214 --> 01:33:04,216
- But he will have to be careful.
- Oh, dear.

1026
01:33:04,299 --> 01:33:09,681
Live moderately, sir, and you shall enjoy
a long and fruitful life.

1027
01:33:09,805 --> 01:33:13,981
Exert yourself unduly
and you will go to an early grave.

1028
01:33:14,101 --> 01:33:15,944
Oh, dear.

1029
01:33:17,437 --> 01:33:18,438
There, now.

1030
01:33:36,415 --> 01:33:38,167
Good day, sir.

1031
01:33:40,836 --> 01:33:43,009
Have you nothing to say to me?

1032
01:33:45,632 --> 01:33:47,885
I am most sorry for your loss.

1033
01:33:49,052 --> 01:33:51,054
Our loss, Father!

1034
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:53,432
Your own dear daughter's funeral.

1035
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:55,025
Indeed.

1036
01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:00,861
I did not find myself in the city.

1037
01:34:00,981 --> 01:34:05,532
As ever, sir,
painting your ridiculous shipwrecks.

1038
01:34:08,488 --> 01:34:10,490
Have you no feelings?

1039
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:14,081
Speak!

1040
01:34:20,584 --> 01:34:22,336
Come, Evelina.

1041
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:25,255
There is nothing here for us.

1042
01:35:14,388 --> 01:35:16,390
You're tired, my dear.

1043
01:35:19,851 --> 01:35:22,730
'Tis too much of a strain
for you these days,

1044
01:35:22,854 --> 01:35:27,200
trawling back and forth on that old steamer
every time you wants to see me.

1045
01:35:28,527 --> 01:35:32,248
And even when they've finished
building that new railway,

1046
01:35:32,364 --> 01:35:35,208
we none of us do know
what lies ahead.

1047
01:35:38,412 --> 01:35:41,086
I have bethought me of a plan

1048
01:35:41,206 --> 01:35:43,834
and here is what we must do.

1049
01:35:43,959 --> 01:35:45,632
If you will find
a little house for us,

1050
01:35:45,752 --> 01:35:50,178
somewhere by your beloved River Thames,
but not too far from London Town,

1051
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:53,094
with good, solid, wooden ﬂoors,

1052
01:35:53,218 --> 01:35:55,641
nice bright light for you to work by...

1053
01:35:56,847 --> 01:35:59,020
...then I will buy the lease.

1054
01:36:02,686 --> 01:36:04,688
I can sell this house.

1055
01:36:06,857 --> 01:36:09,076
I think we would be happy.

1056
01:36:09,192 --> 01:36:10,785
The two of us.

1057
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:21,087
There she is.

1058
01:36:21,204 --> 01:36:24,879
- The saucy Temeraire.
- Going to her death, I fear.

1059
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,422
She's served her time.

1060
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:29,175
The auctioneer's hammer
has struck that final blow.

1061
01:36:29,296 --> 01:36:30,718
Indeed.

1062
01:36:30,839 --> 01:36:34,013
If not for her, the Victory might
never again have seen our shores.

1063
01:36:34,134 --> 01:36:36,102
Aye, nor the body of Lord Nelson.

1064
01:36:36,219 --> 01:36:39,143
The little saviour of Trafalgar.

1065
01:36:39,264 --> 01:36:43,485
They say 5,000 oaks
went into making that ship.

1066
01:36:43,643 --> 01:36:47,022
Now she's destined to be reduced
to 5,000 tables and chairs.

1067
01:36:47,147 --> 01:36:50,071
To be sat on by 5,000 fat arses.

1068
01:36:52,194 --> 01:36:53,662
Gentlemen, a toast.

1069
01:36:53,778 --> 01:36:57,908
Raise your pot of grog.
To the fine, fighting Temeraire!

1070
01:36:58,033 --> 01:37:00,456
- The Temeraire!
- The Temeraire!

1071
01:37:00,535 --> 01:37:02,082
Here's to her.

1072
01:37:04,289 --> 01:37:06,633
- A ghost of the past.
- No, Rabbie.

1073
01:37:07,417 --> 01:37:10,387
The past is the past.
We're observing the future.

1074
01:37:11,546 --> 01:37:15,176
Smoke, iron, steam.

1075
01:37:16,426 --> 01:37:18,426
She'd make a fine subject
for you to paint, Turner.

1076
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:22,267
Oh, is that so, Stanny?
I shall cogitate upon it.

1077
01:37:23,225 --> 01:37:25,023
Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

1078
01:37:33,401 --> 01:37:36,371
It's that Mr Haydon.

1079
01:37:39,741 --> 01:37:42,745
He's brought a cold blast of air
in with him.

1080
01:37:50,544 --> 01:37:54,265
Mr Haydon, to what do I owe
the honour of your presence this morning?

1081
01:37:54,381 --> 01:37:58,011
I trust that this is not
an inconvenience to you, Turner.

1082
01:37:58,134 --> 01:38:01,729
Now, will you accept ten pounds?

1083
01:38:01,846 --> 01:38:04,565
- Ten pounds, sir?
- I wish to be free of the debt.

1084
01:38:04,683 --> 01:38:08,358
- It weighs heavily upon me.
- Sir, you owe me 50 pounds.

1085
01:38:08,478 --> 01:38:13,154
Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle,
I have been giving my lecture.

1086
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:15,494
Edinburgh, fair city.

1087
01:38:15,569 --> 01:38:18,243
Only in London is my genius
not appreciated.

1088
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:21,909
Consider this as a statement of intent.

1089
01:38:22,033 --> 01:38:24,912
- Mr Haydon, pray be seated.
- I had rather not.

1090
01:38:25,036 --> 01:38:27,164
I do not wish to prevail upon your time
more than is necessary.

1091
01:38:27,289 --> 01:38:29,462
And I prevail upon you, sir,
to take a seat.

1092
01:38:31,251 --> 01:38:33,720
- Where would you have me sit?
- Wherever you wish.

1093
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,592
- Will this suffice?
- Indeed.

1094
01:38:38,758 --> 01:38:41,728
Mr Haydon, do you still find yourself
in a position of impecuniousness?

1095
01:38:41,845 --> 01:38:46,897
Impecunity? Turner, that has been
my constant state these 30 years.

1096
01:38:48,143 --> 01:38:50,566
You are most well-appointed here.

1097
01:38:51,313 --> 01:38:55,784
I do not recall the last time
we had as much coal in our scuttle as that.

1098
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:58,494
I fear we shall be burning
our furniture this winter.

1099
01:38:58,612 --> 01:39:00,865
Does Mrs Haydon
find herself faring well?

1100
01:39:00,989 --> 01:39:04,539
She does not.
She has not recovered.

1101
01:39:04,618 --> 01:39:06,791
I fear that she may never do so.

1102
01:39:06,911 --> 01:39:08,754
What ails her, sir?

1103
01:39:09,664 --> 01:39:11,587
We have buried five children.

1104
01:39:13,251 --> 01:39:16,175
- Indeed?
- In Paddington old churchyard

1105
01:39:16,296 --> 01:39:19,175
they remove the soil,
extract the coffins,

1106
01:39:19,299 --> 01:39:20,596
dig the hole deeper,

1107
01:39:20,675 --> 01:39:24,475
then reinter the coffins
with another atop.

1108
01:39:24,596 --> 01:39:27,566
Five times
she has had to suffer that indignity.

1109
01:39:27,641 --> 01:39:30,520
- 'Tis pitiable.
- It is pitiable, Turner.

1110
01:39:31,269 --> 01:39:33,189
You have never had to endure
the loss of a child.

1111
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:36,073
I have not, sir.

1112
01:39:36,191 --> 01:39:38,068
A dying child,

1113
01:39:38,193 --> 01:39:40,787
'tis a potent subject
for a painting, is it not?

1114
01:39:42,656 --> 01:39:45,034
And what is your present endeavour, Turner?

1115
01:39:45,158 --> 01:39:49,004
- Er... marine piece
- A marine piece?

1116
01:39:50,413 --> 01:39:52,882
Do not you tire of boats
and the fiery firmament?

1117
01:39:53,667 --> 01:39:55,089
I do not, sir.

1118
01:39:57,045 --> 01:39:59,514
Sometimes I consider
it might make a better course for me

1119
01:39:59,631 --> 01:40:01,633
were I to set light to the house

1120
01:40:02,717 --> 01:40:06,688
with my wife, my surviving children
and myself within it.

1121
01:40:06,846 --> 01:40:09,019
Then they would no longer
be saddled with me.

1122
01:40:09,349 --> 01:40:13,195
Your pain is your own, sir.
Do not inﬂict it upon your loved ones.

1123
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:17,524
Will you take my ten pounds?

1124
01:40:19,693 --> 01:40:22,993
I will not, sir.
You are free of your debt.

1125
01:40:23,113 --> 01:40:25,662
- Free? How so?
- 'Tis expunged.

1126
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:28,710
Er... no, sir. I do not come here
a seeker after charity or pity.

1127
01:40:28,868 --> 01:40:31,212
You have neither charity nor pity nor debt.

1128
01:40:31,329 --> 01:40:33,206
I do not wish it
in such a circumstance.

1129
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:36,426
Mr Haydon, I am much preoccupied.

1130
01:40:36,543 --> 01:40:39,342
Me damsel, be so kind
as to escort the gentleman into the street.

1131
01:40:39,462 --> 01:40:41,135
Good day to you, sir.

1132
01:40:41,256 --> 01:40:43,725
This does not sit well with me, Turner.

1133
01:40:48,346 --> 01:40:49,472
Damn his eyes.

1134
01:40:49,597 --> 01:40:50,598
Oh...

1135
01:41:07,907 --> 01:41:11,036
- Turner and Jones.
- Mr Turner, Captain Jones.

1136
01:41:11,161 --> 01:41:13,289
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- Mr Ruskin!

1137
01:41:13,413 --> 01:41:14,460
Good evening to you.

1138
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:15,981
I trust you had a pleasant journey?

1139
01:41:15,999 --> 01:41:17,717
Indeed. You find yourself well, sir?

1140
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:20,796
I do indeed, thank you.
Pride of place, Mr Turner.

1141
01:41:20,962 --> 01:41:22,088
Ah, splendid.

1142
01:41:22,213 --> 01:41:24,432
As though the house
was built around it

1143
01:41:24,549 --> 01:41:27,052
- Please, come through'
- Jonesy.

1144
01:41:31,473 --> 01:41:33,066
Er, my good husband is of the opinion

1145
01:41:33,183 --> 01:41:36,483
that the gooseberry
prefers the colder climate,

1146
01:41:36,603 --> 01:41:40,073
whereas I consider
that all fruits benefit from the warmth.

1147
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:44,536
My dear late mother always insisted
that both the gooseberry and the rhubarb

1148
01:41:44,652 --> 01:41:47,496
favour the colder climes
of our victorious isles.

1149
01:41:47,614 --> 01:41:52,165
I do not doubt that the gooseberry
for its preference may enjoy the warm,

1150
01:41:52,786 --> 01:41:57,462
however I am convinced that a cold start
promotes the more vigorous specimen

1151
01:41:57,582 --> 01:42:00,005
Are we not to take
as empirical evidence

1152
01:42:00,126 --> 01:42:04,302
our many expeditions
to the warmer climes of the Mediterranean

1153
01:42:04,422 --> 01:42:08,052
where we do not exactly encounter
an abundance of gooseberries?

1154
01:42:08,176 --> 01:42:10,804
- Ha! Indeed.
- Exactly so.

1155
01:42:10,929 --> 01:42:13,182
I did not myself savour
many gooseberries in Jerusalem.

1156
01:42:13,306 --> 01:42:15,934
Ah, the holy city, Mr Turner.

1157
01:42:16,059 --> 01:42:19,404
And yet we do enjoy
fine gooseberries in Scotland,

1158
01:42:19,521 --> 01:42:20,738
do we not, Mr Ruskin?

1159
01:42:20,814 --> 01:42:23,693
Aye, and no better a cold start
than a good Scottish sun.

1160
01:42:24,818 --> 01:42:25,990
Exactly that.

1161
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:30,707
Surely, regardless of how cold the start
of the life of the gooseberry might be,

1162
01:42:30,824 --> 01:42:33,668
it is almost certainly destined
for a warm ending.

1163
01:42:33,785 --> 01:42:37,835
To which we have all borne witness
in Mrs Ruskin's excellent gooseberry pie.

1164
01:42:37,997 --> 01:42:40,967
I thank you, Captain Jones.

1165
01:42:41,084 --> 01:42:44,463
May I propose
as a topic for discussion

1166
01:42:44,587 --> 01:42:48,342
the question as to the depiction
of the seas and the oceans

1167
01:42:48,466 --> 01:42:49,968
in pictorial art?

1168
01:42:51,261 --> 01:42:54,265
Now, I appreciate
that I am honoured

1169
01:42:54,389 --> 01:42:58,860
to be in the presence of two
of our most distinguished marine painters,

1170
01:42:59,018 --> 01:43:02,363
Mr Turner and Mr Stanfield,

1171
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:06,735
not to forget Captain Jones
and Mr Roberts, of course,

1172
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:11,491
whose realisations are confined
to mere naked tetra firma,

1173
01:43:11,614 --> 01:43:13,241
exemplary though they are.

1174
01:43:15,368 --> 01:43:18,042
My point being that, alas,

1175
01:43:18,162 --> 01:43:22,884
I find myself harbouring
a perhaps rather controversial opinion

1176
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:25,340
regarding the long deceased Claude

1177
01:43:25,461 --> 01:43:29,341
- Indeed?
- I am afraid so, Captain Jones.

1178
01:43:29,465 --> 01:43:31,342
I must confess

1179
01:43:31,467 --> 01:43:37,224
that I find his rendering of the sea
rather insipid, dull and uninspiring.

1180
01:43:37,348 --> 01:43:40,147
That is an extremely bold statement,
young Mr Ruskin.

1181
01:43:40,268 --> 01:43:41,895
Thank you very much.

1182
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,897
Claude was a man of his time.

1183
01:43:44,022 --> 01:43:46,320
My point exactly, Mr Turner,

1184
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:48,910
but that time is now long past.

1185
01:43:49,068 --> 01:43:52,789
When I experience
a modern masterpiece such as yours,

1186
01:43:52,906 --> 01:43:57,036
I am struck by the clarity
with which you have captured the moment.

1187
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,458
Take, for example, your slave ship,

1188
01:43:59,579 --> 01:44:03,834
"Slavers Throwing Overboard
the Dead and Dying - Typhoon Coming On",

1189
01:44:03,917 --> 01:44:06,761
by which I have the good fortune
to be greeted every morning

1190
01:44:06,878 --> 01:44:09,222
on my way into my meagre breakfast.

1191
01:44:09,339 --> 01:44:13,845
The impact of the foaming brine incarnadine

1192
01:44:13,927 --> 01:44:17,898
consuming those unfortunate Negro slaves

1193
01:44:17,972 --> 01:44:21,852
never ceases to quicken
the beat of my heart.

1194
01:44:21,935 --> 01:44:25,735
Yet when I gaze
upon a work of Claude

1195
01:44:25,855 --> 01:44:28,074
I find myself enduring nothing more

1196
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:31,365
than a mere collection
of precise brushstrokes

1197
01:44:31,486 --> 01:44:34,535
which instil in me
no sense of awe whatsoever,

1198
01:44:34,656 --> 01:44:36,078
let alone the sea.

1199
01:44:36,199 --> 01:44:37,701
Preposterous!

1200
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,753
I do beg your pardon, Mrs Ruskin.

1201
01:44:42,789 --> 01:44:45,212
- Claude Lorrain was a genius.
- Quite so.

1202
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:49,634
I sense an excess of modesty in Mr Turner
and there is no need for such humility.

1203
01:44:49,754 --> 01:44:51,597
Mr Ruskin, sir,

1204
01:44:51,714 --> 01:44:56,811
to conjecture upon the matter
of seascape painting is one thing

1205
01:44:56,928 --> 01:44:59,556
but to stand amongst the elements

1206
01:44:59,681 --> 01:45:04,778
and to experience
and to interpret what one sees

1207
01:45:04,894 --> 01:45:06,316
is something quite other.

1208
01:45:06,437 --> 01:45:08,189
- Hear, hear.
- Quite.

1209
01:45:08,314 --> 01:45:09,816
That is as it may be.

1210
01:45:09,941 --> 01:45:14,321
Claude painted from the land,
looking at the sea becalmed by the harbour.

1211
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:17,039
- Oh, indeed.
- "Bless the Lord, oh my soul

1212
01:45:18,157 --> 01:45:20,831
"Who layeth the beams
of his chambers in the waters

1213
01:45:20,952 --> 01:45:23,455
"and walketh
upon the wings of the wind."

1214
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:25,047
How apt, Mother.

1215
01:45:25,206 --> 01:45:26,503
Thank you, John.

1216
01:45:26,624 --> 01:45:27,750
Oh...

1217
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:30,219
When my son was but a small boy,

1218
01:45:31,337 --> 01:45:33,510
he was overheard to remark that...

1219
01:45:33,631 --> 01:45:36,931
"waves of sea
are indeed lovely to watch

1220
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:39,479
"but they are always coming or gone,

1221
01:45:39,595 --> 01:45:41,768
"never in any taken shape to be seen..."

1222
01:45:41,889 --> 01:45:43,562
- For a second,
- "...a second."

1223
01:45:45,601 --> 01:45:49,196
I find myself marvelling
at my own wealth of perception,

1224
01:45:49,313 --> 01:45:51,236
even at the early age of four.

1225
01:45:51,816 --> 01:45:53,033
Quite so.

1226
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:57,497
Mr Ruskin, can I pose you
a somewhat conundrous question?

1227
01:45:57,613 --> 01:45:59,456
Ah, please do, Mr Turner.

1228
01:46:01,868 --> 01:46:04,997
To which do you find yourself
the more partial,

1229
01:46:05,079 --> 01:46:09,676
a... steak and kidney pie
or a veal and ham pie?

1230
01:46:13,713 --> 01:46:16,011
I must confess, Mr Turner,

1231
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:19,185
that I find myself quite unable
to answer your question

1232
01:46:19,302 --> 01:46:21,976
with the precision
that I would wish.

1233
01:47:35,545 --> 01:47:37,047
Your Majesty.

1234
01:47:59,026 --> 01:48:00,778
Terribly ﬂat.

1235
01:48:01,988 --> 01:48:04,582
- Dull.
- It's rather dark, isn't it?

1236
01:48:05,992 --> 01:48:08,086
- Sir Martin.
- Sir?

1237
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:11,631
- Who is the artist?
- I believe, sir, it's...

1238
01:48:17,336 --> 01:48:19,213
Mr John Ferneley, sir.

1239
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:21,599
- Oh, Mr Ferneley.
- Hm.

1240
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:32,318
Ah...

1241
01:48:43,863 --> 01:48:45,615
Turner.

1242
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:48,209
He is clearly losing his eyesight.

1243
01:48:51,537 --> 01:48:53,960
And this one is vile.

1244
01:48:57,793 --> 01:48:58,885
Unbelievable.

1245
01:48:59,003 --> 01:49:01,131
- What it that?
- I don't know.

1246
01:49:01,214 --> 01:49:03,683
A dirty, yellow mess.

1247
01:49:14,769 --> 01:49:17,522
It is a truly frightful piece.

1248
01:49:17,647 --> 01:49:20,617
It is indicative of mental disease.

1249
01:49:20,733 --> 01:49:22,952
It is wretched and abortive.

1250
01:49:27,073 --> 01:49:28,575
Sad.

1251
01:49:29,075 --> 01:49:33,421
Mr Turner seems
to have taken leave of form altogether.

1252
01:49:33,537 --> 01:49:36,131
He has on former occasion
chosen to paint

1253
01:49:36,249 --> 01:49:40,755
with cream or chocolate,
yolk of egg or currant jelly.

1254
01:49:40,878 --> 01:49:45,133
But here he uses
his whole array of kitchen stuff.

1255
01:49:45,258 --> 01:49:49,809
- Eggs and spinach.
- No, soap suds and whitewash.

1256
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:54,434
Jam tarts! Jam tans!
Fresh jam tarts!

1257
01:50:03,067 --> 01:50:04,284
Oh!

1258
01:50:04,402 --> 01:50:06,154
Where is that wretched baker's boy?

1259
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:08,122
His fate, I fear, he won't enjoy.

1260
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:10,333
He will indeed the lad destroy!

1261
01:50:10,491 --> 01:50:11,413
Aha!

1262
01:50:11,534 --> 01:50:13,286
I have an inspiration.

1263
01:50:13,411 --> 01:50:16,210
- What's that?
- We're filled with fascination.

1264
01:50:16,289 --> 01:50:18,758
- What is he doing?
- And why is he doing it?

1265
01:50:18,874 --> 01:50:21,798
Whatever he's brewing,
we'll soon be viewing it.

1266
01:50:21,919 --> 01:50:26,595
A masterpiece I here present
which Mr Turner has just sent.

1267
01:50:28,342 --> 01:50:33,189
While mostly blessed
with good intent, we have our doubts.

1268
01:50:33,306 --> 01:50:35,479
But who's this gent?

1269
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,603
Ye common throng and hoi polloi,

1270
01:50:38,728 --> 01:50:41,322
I am a rich and cultured boy.

1271
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:44,568
My wealth derives
from tricking knaves

1272
01:50:44,692 --> 01:50:47,161
and selling coffee, tea and slaves.

1273
01:50:47,278 --> 01:50:50,157
My house is full of things of beauty,

1274
01:50:50,281 --> 01:50:53,125
paintings, sculpture and other booty.

1275
01:50:53,242 --> 01:50:56,496
I like to drink and gourmandise...

1276
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,338
But what is this that greets my eyes?

1277
01:50:58,497 --> 01:51:00,170
It is the latest thing in art.

1278
01:51:00,291 --> 01:51:02,589
It looks like bits of old jam tart.

1279
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:07,682
'Tis Mr Turner's latest piece,
which placed above your mantelpiece...

1280
01:51:07,798 --> 01:51:10,551
Oh, cease your costermonger sounds!

1281
01:51:10,676 --> 01:51:12,178
I'll buy it.

1282
01:51:13,346 --> 01:51:17,567
- Here's 1,000 pounds.
- Oh, I thank you in my humble way.

1283
01:51:17,683 --> 01:51:21,563
- Don't grovel, send it round today.
- I'll do so, sir, without delay.

1284
01:51:21,687 --> 01:51:24,987
Rejoice! Hurrah!
Hip, hip, hooray!

1285
01:51:25,775 --> 01:51:27,823
Though ignorant of an and taste,

1286
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:29,996
I'm filled with boundless glee,

1287
01:51:30,112 --> 01:51:33,958
for what's good enough for Turner...
is good enough for me!

1288
01:52:15,574 --> 01:52:18,953
Mr Ruskin, I fail to see
wherein lies the charity

1289
01:52:19,078 --> 01:52:21,957
in misleading people
as to the amount of talents they possess.

1290
01:52:22,081 --> 01:52:23,754
Talent is something
that lies dormant

1291
01:52:23,874 --> 01:52:26,172
and needs to be drawn out
in the right circumstances.

1292
01:52:26,293 --> 01:52:28,842
If one has the opportunity
to have it drawn out.

1293
01:52:28,963 --> 01:52:32,058
My wife, Effie,

1294
01:52:32,174 --> 01:52:36,054
I am still waiting for her talents
to arise and be drawn out.

1295
01:52:36,178 --> 01:52:39,432
I think talents can be crushed
as much as they may be drawn out.

1296
01:52:39,557 --> 01:52:40,604
Precisely.

1297
01:52:40,724 --> 01:52:41,941
Perhaps it is the duty
of the husband...

1298
01:52:42,059 --> 01:52:46,439
Plutarch said,
"Painting is silent poetry."

1299
01:53:01,954 --> 01:53:04,833
Are you interested in poetry, sir?

1300
01:53:04,957 --> 01:53:07,676
Sublime.

1301
01:53:14,175 --> 01:53:15,472
Loneliness...

1302
01:53:17,970 --> 01:53:19,972
...solitude...

1303
01:53:20,973 --> 01:53:23,476
...'tis not the same.

1304
01:53:25,019 --> 01:53:28,023
Indeed not, Mr Turner.

1305
01:53:29,148 --> 01:53:30,866
It will come.

1306
01:53:32,359 --> 01:53:36,956
Mrs Ruskin... it will come.

1307
01:53:39,283 --> 01:53:40,626
Love.

1308
01:53:52,505 --> 01:53:54,428
Oh...

1309
01:53:55,883 --> 01:53:57,476
What is the hour?

1310
01:53:57,551 --> 01:53:59,895
- Five-and-twenty to seven.
- Oh.

1311
01:54:00,012 --> 01:54:01,514
Oh, God!

1312
01:54:02,264 --> 01:54:03,982
Oh...

1313
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:14,993
The sun's up in all its glory.

1314
01:54:15,653 --> 01:54:17,496
I must get on.

1315
01:54:37,925 --> 01:54:40,769
- Don't you want your breakfast?
- No, thank you kindly.

1316
01:54:46,183 --> 01:54:48,311
Are you faring well?

1317
01:54:48,435 --> 01:54:50,403
Yes, thank you'

1318
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:54,449
- And yourself?
- Yes, yes.

1319
01:54:57,236 --> 01:54:59,580
Will I be seeing you tonight?

1320
01:54:59,697 --> 01:55:01,916
- Unlikely.
- Tomorrow?

1321
01:55:03,617 --> 01:55:05,711
- No.
- Oh.

1322
01:55:09,582 --> 01:55:12,756
I might as well stop
changing the bed sheets in here.

1323
01:55:42,573 --> 01:55:44,075
Mr Booth!

1324
01:56:08,182 --> 01:56:09,650
Good day to you.

1325
01:56:20,986 --> 01:56:23,785
- 'Tis warmer now.
- Sultry day.

1326
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:30,334
- Ooh, what d'you have there?
- Bit of drift bark.

1327
01:56:30,454 --> 01:56:32,206
Ooh!

1328
01:56:32,331 --> 01:56:34,333
Has the look of a fallen angel.

1329
01:56:35,501 --> 01:56:38,050
- Pretty colours.
- Mm.

1330
01:56:41,632 --> 01:56:43,350
Oh! Sticky.

1331
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:47,934
Horrid parched,

1332
01:57:22,297 --> 01:57:25,301
- Good morning, sir.
- A very good day to you, sir.

1333
01:57:25,426 --> 01:57:27,349
- Nice day, sir.
- Mm-hm.

1334
01:57:34,643 --> 01:57:36,441
Ah! Good morning, sir.

1335
01:57:36,562 --> 01:57:38,360
Greetings and welcome.

1336
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,107
A hearty good morning to you, sir.

1337
01:57:40,232 --> 01:57:43,111
- Now, you would be Mr...
- Mr Booth.

1338
01:57:43,235 --> 01:57:46,079
Ah, Booth, yes. Mr Booth.

1339
01:57:46,196 --> 01:57:48,915
- At the appointed hour, I believe.
- Indeed, sir.

1340
01:57:49,032 --> 01:57:50,659
Mayall, John Mayall.

1341
01:57:50,743 --> 01:57:52,586
I had made that assumption, sir.

1342
01:57:52,703 --> 01:57:54,797
At your service, Mr Booth,

1343
01:57:54,955 --> 01:57:58,585
Now, if you would be so kind
as to make yourself comfortable...

1344
01:57:58,709 --> 01:58:01,178
- This is the contraption?
- Indeed, sir.

1345
01:58:01,295 --> 01:58:03,514
That is what we call the camera.

1346
01:58:04,423 --> 01:58:06,767
- The cam-ra?
- Yes, sir.

1347
01:58:06,884 --> 01:58:08,261
Not the cam-er-ah?

1348
01:58:08,385 --> 01:58:11,104
Er... no, sir.
The camera.

1349
01:58:11,221 --> 01:58:13,144
- The camera?
- Yes, sir.

1350
01:58:13,265 --> 01:58:15,359
As in camera obscura?

1351
01:58:15,476 --> 01:58:18,400
Ah, precisely, sir.
The camera.

1352
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:21,273
Now, if I may ask you
to take a seat, please, here.

1353
01:58:21,398 --> 01:58:23,571
- Name of manufacturer?
- Er...

1354
01:58:23,692 --> 01:58:25,786
It comes to us
from the United States, sir.

1355
01:58:25,944 --> 01:58:27,821
The name eludes you?

1356
01:58:27,988 --> 01:58:29,615
Oh, no, sir.

1357
01:58:30,491 --> 01:58:33,586
My name eludes me
from time to time.

1358
01:58:33,702 --> 01:58:35,500
Indeed, sir?

1359
01:58:36,663 --> 01:58:37,789
Now...

1360
01:58:37,915 --> 01:58:39,337
Hm...

1361
01:58:46,089 --> 01:58:50,469
I denote from your brogue
that you hail from the Americas.

1362
01:58:50,594 --> 01:58:52,813
From the fine city of Philadelphia, sir.

1363
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:55,649
Philadelphia?
'Tis on the eastern coast, is it not?

1364
01:58:55,766 --> 01:58:57,018
That is correct, sir.

1365
01:58:57,142 --> 01:58:58,359
Ow!

1366
01:58:58,477 --> 01:59:01,947
You shall have to forgive
the whip-crack of my knees.

1367
01:59:02,064 --> 01:59:06,240
- Hat on or hat off?
- Er... may I ask your profession, sir?

1368
01:59:06,985 --> 01:59:08,703
Master of Chancery.

1369
01:59:08,821 --> 01:59:11,415
- A man of the law.
- Indeed.

1370
01:59:11,532 --> 01:59:15,002
Then I should recommend the hat on, sir.

1371
01:59:15,118 --> 01:59:18,497
Now, if I might deploy this device...

1372
01:59:18,622 --> 01:59:20,420
Hey!

1373
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,843
What is this heinous implement?

1374
01:59:23,001 --> 01:59:25,254
Merely a gentle holding brace, sir.

1375
01:59:25,379 --> 01:59:27,256
Puts me in mind of a surgical instrument.

1376
01:59:27,798 --> 01:59:30,142
- Dues it hurt?
- Not in the slightest, I assure you.

1377
01:59:30,259 --> 01:59:32,478
So, if I may...

1378
01:59:35,806 --> 01:59:38,184
Not too uncomfortable for you, Mr Booth?

1379
01:59:39,768 --> 01:59:40,815
Thank you, sir.

1380
01:59:40,894 --> 01:59:43,613
What is the significance
of the looking-glass?

1381
01:59:43,730 --> 01:59:47,780
It is to illuminate your good self, sir.

1382
01:59:50,487 --> 01:59:52,114
As the sun upon a lake.

1383
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:55,869
Oh! Most droll, Mr Booth.

1384
01:59:55,993 --> 01:59:57,210
Most droll.

1385
02:00:00,122 --> 02:00:03,672
What is concealed
behind the small brass cap?

1386
02:00:03,792 --> 02:00:08,047
- An optic?
- Yes, sir, a glass lens.

1387
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:09,514
As a telescope?

1388
02:00:10,382 --> 02:00:12,851
Not unlike a telescope, sir.

1389
02:00:12,926 --> 02:00:14,519
Thank you, Cornelius,

1390
02:00:14,636 --> 02:00:17,480
- It is prismatic?
- I fear not, sir.

1391
02:00:17,598 --> 02:00:20,226
- It is an achromatic lens.
- Achromatic.

1392
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:22,773
Now, let me peruse you.

1393
02:00:24,521 --> 02:00:27,900
Why are you shrouded
in the manner of a condemned monk?

1394
02:00:28,066 --> 02:00:30,910
I am simply shutting out the light,
Mr Booth.

1395
02:00:32,487 --> 02:00:34,831
Ah, splendid, sir.

1396
02:00:34,907 --> 02:00:37,535
The image you create
is not of colour.

1397
02:00:37,659 --> 02:00:38,911
For why?

1398
02:00:39,077 --> 02:00:42,832
Er... I am afraid that is a question
we have yet to answer, sir.

1399
02:00:42,915 --> 02:00:44,883
It is a mystery.

1400
02:00:44,958 --> 02:00:46,210
Thank you, Cornelius,

1401
02:00:46,335 --> 02:00:48,838
And long may it remain so.

1402
02:00:48,921 --> 02:00:53,552
Now, if I may ask you
to focus your gaze here, on the ﬂowers,

1403
02:00:53,675 --> 02:00:56,269
and we are almost ready.

1404
02:00:56,386 --> 02:00:57,979
Thank you, Cornelius,

1405
02:01:02,851 --> 02:01:03,852
Now...

1406
02:01:03,936 --> 02:01:08,908
I will require your absolute stillness
for the next ten seconds.

1407
02:01:12,903 --> 02:01:15,281
And... we begin.

1408
02:01:35,592 --> 02:01:37,686
And there we have it.

1409
02:01:37,803 --> 02:01:41,273
- 'Tis done?
- It is finished, sir.

1410
02:01:42,349 --> 02:01:44,943
I fear that I, too, am finished.

1411
02:01:45,018 --> 02:01:46,861
Oh, come, come, sir.

1412
02:01:50,357 --> 02:01:52,030
This be one of them there photographs.

1413
02:01:53,235 --> 02:01:55,488
The Queen had one of these taken
with Prince Albert.

1414
02:01:55,612 --> 02:01:57,614
- Did she so?
- She did.

1415
02:01:57,739 --> 02:01:59,616
- Oh!
- Hm.

1416
02:01:59,741 --> 02:02:02,290
Oh, you do look most handsome.

1417
02:02:02,411 --> 02:02:04,459
- 'Tis known as a daguerreotype.
- Oh.

1418
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:07,002
Whatever next?

1419
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,594
- Where'd you have this done, then?
- Up in town on the Strand.

1420
02:02:10,711 --> 02:02:12,213
Fellow with a box.

1421
02:02:18,135 --> 02:02:19,853
- We're going there.
- Where?

1422
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:22,018
- Have our likeness taken.
- When?

1423
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,182
- Thursday.
- Oh.

1424
02:02:24,307 --> 02:02:26,526
I've arranged an appointment.

1425
02:02:26,643 --> 02:02:29,021
- Well, you'll have to cancel it.
- 'Tis painless.

1426
02:02:29,146 --> 02:02:30,944
Oh, I care not.

1427
02:02:31,023 --> 02:02:33,151
You don't want my old face
in one of these.

1428
02:02:33,275 --> 02:02:35,778
I do, the two of us together.

1429
02:02:36,695 --> 02:02:38,242
Forever.

1430
02:02:41,366 --> 02:02:43,334
I do thank you for this.

1431
02:02:44,202 --> 02:02:46,045
But I ain't going.

1432
02:02:50,667 --> 02:02:52,419
'Tis the camera.

1433
02:02:54,004 --> 02:02:56,678
Mr Mayall, may I beg your indulgence
with a question?

1434
02:02:56,798 --> 02:02:58,050
Why, certainly, sir.

1435
02:02:58,175 --> 02:03:00,052
Do you take landscapes
with your contraption?

1436
02:03:00,177 --> 02:03:03,101
- I do, sir, from time to time.
- Such as what?

1437
02:03:03,263 --> 02:03:06,312
Why, I have recorded
the great falls of Niagara, sir.

1438
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:09,978
- The Niagara Falls?
- Indeed, sir.

1439
02:03:10,062 --> 02:03:12,190
The greatest wonder in nature.

1440
02:03:12,314 --> 02:03:15,989
It was there that I was once able
to capture a rainbow.

1441
02:03:17,652 --> 02:03:19,575
I'm green-eyed with envy.

1442
02:03:20,697 --> 02:03:22,540
The Niagara Falls...

1443
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:26,996
Wis a natural phenomenon
that I have long desired to witness.

1444
02:03:27,079 --> 02:03:28,706
Is that so, sir?

1445
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:32,505
Now, madam, sir,
if I may ask you to fix your gaze here

1446
02:03:32,626 --> 02:03:34,594
upon these beautiful ﬂowers.

1447
02:03:34,711 --> 02:03:36,304
Thank you, Cornelius.

1448
02:03:36,421 --> 02:03:37,843
Niagara Falls.

1449
02:03:39,758 --> 02:03:42,602
Soon painters will go about the world

1450
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:45,563
with a box, like a tinker,

1451
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:48,684
instead of a portfolio under their arms,

1452
02:03:48,809 --> 02:03:51,938
Well, I'm sure they will, sir.
I'm sure they will.

1453
02:03:53,313 --> 02:03:57,363
Now, if you are comfortable,
madam, sir,

1454
02:03:57,484 --> 02:03:59,737
we may proceed,

1455
02:04:32,561 --> 02:04:34,484
- Thank you, miss.
- Thank you, sir.

1456
02:04:41,319 --> 02:04:44,448
- Your good health, sir.
- And yours, Mr Gillott.

1457
02:04:48,702 --> 02:04:50,079
- Turner.
- Sir.

1458
02:04:50,162 --> 02:04:52,506
- I have a proposition to make.
- Oh?

1459
02:04:52,622 --> 02:04:54,920
- I like your pictures.
- Well, thank you, sir.

1460
02:04:55,041 --> 02:04:56,509
My wife is especially partial

1461
02:04:56,626 --> 02:04:59,300
to your companion pieces
that grace our drawing room.

1462
02:04:59,421 --> 02:05:02,220
Please convey my felicitations
to your dear lady.

1463
02:05:02,382 --> 02:05:04,180
I will, thank you.

1464
02:05:06,303 --> 02:05:09,182
And now I wish to show you
one of my pictures.

1465
02:05:09,347 --> 02:05:11,850
Oh, indeed, sir?
I am much intrigued.

1466
02:05:16,521 --> 02:05:18,398
Five-pound note,
exceeding pretty.

1467
02:05:18,523 --> 02:05:19,991
Quite so.

1468
02:05:20,108 --> 02:05:23,078
For all of your paintings,
I will give you 20,000 of these,

1469
02:05:23,195 --> 02:05:25,243
100,000 pounds.

1470
02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:30,870
All your oils, your watercolours,
your drawings, your sketchbooks,

1471
02:05:30,994 --> 02:05:32,667
everything you've ever produced.

1472
02:05:32,787 --> 02:05:35,210
100,000 pounds.
What do you say?

1473
02:05:40,045 --> 02:05:42,218
Turner, I am a man of wealth,

1474
02:05:42,339 --> 02:05:44,262
a self-made man.

1475
02:05:44,424 --> 02:05:46,984
Throughout the world
three quarters of everything that is written

1476
02:05:47,052 --> 02:05:49,521
is written with a Gillott pen nib,
one of my nibs.

1477
02:05:50,597 --> 02:05:52,975
I enjoy my wealth.

1478
02:05:53,099 --> 02:05:56,228
Two things delight me in my life:

1479
02:05:57,103 --> 02:05:59,856
fashioning a nib from steel
and making money,

1480
02:05:59,981 --> 02:06:03,360
and I like to spend my money
on things that give me pleasure.

1481
02:06:03,485 --> 02:06:06,580
And your pictures
give me much pleasure.

1482
02:06:06,696 --> 02:06:09,119
I want them, all of them.

1483
02:06:09,241 --> 02:06:11,209
Sir...

1484
02:06:12,577 --> 02:06:15,251
...with a modicum of regret

1485
02:06:15,413 --> 02:06:17,211
and somewhat of a heavy heart,

1486
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:21,591
I'm sorry to say,
'tis out of the question.

1487
02:06:22,837 --> 02:06:25,135
- How so?
- They are bequeathed,

1488
02:06:25,257 --> 02:06:27,259
Bequeathed? To whom?

1489
02:06:27,425 --> 02:06:29,177
To the British nation, sir.

1490
02:06:30,095 --> 02:06:32,689
And what will the British nation
pay you?

1491
02:06:35,016 --> 02:06:37,940
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1492
02:06:38,061 --> 02:06:40,780
Turner, I am offering you a price
you will never see again.

1493
02:06:40,897 --> 02:06:43,491
Indeed, sir,
by which I am much humbled.

1494
02:06:43,608 --> 02:06:46,111
- Then accept my offer.
- I cannot, sir.

1495
02:06:47,028 --> 02:06:48,905
I wish to see my work...

1496
02:06:50,282 --> 02:06:52,535
...displayed in one place,

1497
02:06:53,326 --> 02:06:55,454
all together,

1498
02:06:55,578 --> 02:06:56,875
viewed by the public,

1499
02:06:57,706 --> 02:06:59,504
gratis.

1500
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,468
Turner, this is perverse.

1501
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,298
- So be it.
- You cannot give your pictures away.

1502
02:07:06,423 --> 02:07:10,144
They are too valuable.
Don't be a fool, man. See sense.

1503
02:07:29,195 --> 02:07:31,356
- I wish you good day, sir.
- I wish you good day, sir.

1504
02:07:31,489 --> 02:07:34,083
Me damsel, be so kind
as to show the gentleman out?

1505
02:07:59,142 --> 02:08:00,234
Oh!

1506
02:08:03,855 --> 02:08:05,528
Oh, there! Oh!

1507
02:08:05,648 --> 02:08:07,616
Oh, there.

1508
02:08:07,734 --> 02:08:09,532
Oh! Oh, there.
Stay there, stay there.

1509
02:08:09,652 --> 02:08:11,950
- Don't move.
- I... slipped.

1510
02:08:12,072 --> 02:08:13,494
Oh, Lord.

1511
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:17,077
- Oh, dear. All right?
- It's passing.

1512
02:08:17,202 --> 02:08:18,294
There, stay.

1513
02:08:18,370 --> 02:08:20,748
Stay there.
Oh, my dear.

1514
02:08:20,872 --> 02:08:22,590
- Oh, there.
- No,

1515
02:08:22,707 --> 02:08:25,210
It's passed.
I've got to get on.

1516
02:08:25,335 --> 02:08:28,214
No, no, no, no.
Sit ye down, sit ye down.

1517
02:08:28,338 --> 02:08:31,808
No, no. Got to gel on now.
Got to get on now.

1518
02:08:31,925 --> 02:08:34,178
- No, you must sit down and rest now.
- The canvas.

1519
02:08:34,302 --> 02:08:36,521
- The canvas is damaged.
- Oh, that's all right.

1520
02:08:36,638 --> 02:08:39,016
Come and sit down.
Sit ye down.

1521
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:40,892
- There.
- Now, bustle about.

1522
02:08:41,017 --> 02:08:44,647
- Bustle about.
- Oh, there! There be no helping you!

1523
02:09:00,787 --> 02:09:02,539
"Be still, my dear Molly

1524
02:09:02,664 --> 02:09:04,086
"Dear Molly, be still

1525
02:09:04,207 --> 02:09:07,051
"No more urge

1526

- "Dear Molly, be still"

Oh...

1541
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:15,948
Thank you.
How many do you want?

1542
02:12:16,065 --> 02:12:17,408
- One, please,
- One?

1543
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:20,862
There you go.

1544
02:12:38,713 --> 02:12:39,930
There.

1545
02:12:43,968 --> 02:12:46,096
What ails thee?

1546
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:47,847
Let me take your hat.

1547
02:12:52,852 --> 02:12:54,354
Here.

1548
02:12:54,479 --> 02:12:57,403
- My sketchbook.
- Oh.

1549
02:12:57,523 --> 02:13:00,618
- It's not here.
- 'Tis in your other pocket, then?

1550
02:13:00,693 --> 02:13:03,572
- No, it's not.
- Don't ye worry about it now.

1551
02:13:03,655 --> 02:13:06,704
'Twill be somewhere.
We can look for it later.

1552
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:10,127
Where is the canvas?

1553
02:13:10,244 --> 02:13:13,123
- 'Tis behind you, dear, on the chair.
- Eh?

1554
02:13:14,415 --> 02:13:16,292
Oh...

1555
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:19,633
- You want I should take it upstairs?
- What?

1556
02:13:20,546 --> 02:13:21,889
Your canvas.

1557
02:13:22,674 --> 02:13:24,472
No, no, no, no, no.

1558
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:30,353
I'll get you a drink.

1559
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:38,239
There.

1560
02:13:38,356 --> 02:13:40,529
Er...

1561
02:13:46,155 --> 02:13:47,156
So...

1562
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:52,250
- ...where have you been today?
- Hm?

1563
02:13:52,370 --> 02:13:56,091
Did you go back to Hyde Park?

1564
02:13:56,207 --> 02:13:57,709
Oh.

1565
02:13:57,792 --> 02:13:59,760
How be it all progressing?

1566
02:14:01,379 --> 02:14:03,677
It's an engineering phenomenon.

1567
02:14:05,049 --> 02:14:08,223
Crystal pane upon crystal pane,

1568
02:14:09,095 --> 02:14:11,097
reaching up beyond the clouds.

1569
02:14:11,222 --> 02:14:13,725
'Twill be a marvel to behold.

1570
02:14:13,808 --> 02:14:15,151
Mm.

1571
02:14:15,268 --> 02:14:17,236
It's a glass cathedral.

1572
02:14:20,898 --> 02:14:22,445
It's the one...

1573
02:14:24,444 --> 02:14:25,787
Oh, here.

1574
02:14:29,699 --> 02:14:31,542
Oh, shh, shh...

1575
02:14:35,371 --> 02:14:37,123
Oh, there.

1576
02:14:39,083 --> 02:14:42,337
Oh, there.
Shh, shh, shh...

1577
02:14:43,796 --> 02:14:45,548
Shh, shh.

1578
02:14:50,344 --> 02:14:51,687
Huh!

1579
02:14:51,763 --> 02:14:55,017
So bad!
Look at your messings.

1580
02:14:56,434 --> 02:14:58,528
Naughty pussy.

1581
02:15:02,774 --> 02:15:04,367
I don't know!

1582
02:15:45,191 --> 02:15:48,286
Now, dear,
here be good Dr Price for ye.

1583
02:15:49,153 --> 02:15:51,622
He has come all the way from Margate.

1584
02:15:51,739 --> 02:15:54,117
- Dr Price.
- Good morning, Turner.

1585
02:15:54,242 --> 02:15:56,085
If there be anything
you do need, Doctor...

1586
02:15:56,202 --> 02:15:59,456
- Thank you, Mrs Booth.
- ...I shall be downstairs.

1587
02:16:00,373 --> 02:16:03,627
Now, my dear Turner,
how are you feeling?

1588
02:16:04,085 --> 02:16:07,089
Somewhat weakened, sir.

1589
02:16:07,213 --> 02:16:08,931
I'm so sorry.

1590
02:16:13,845 --> 02:16:15,722
We all miss you in Margate.

1591
02:16:15,847 --> 02:16:17,099
Oh...

1592
02:16:20,309 --> 02:16:22,277
Margate, yes,

1593
02:16:22,395 --> 02:16:23,817
Are you in pain?

1594
02:16:24,605 --> 02:16:25,902
Here.

1595
02:16:26,691 --> 02:16:28,785
- Shortness of breath?
- Yes.

1596
02:16:29,861 --> 02:16:31,363
Now, then...

1597
02:16:34,198 --> 02:16:36,417
Did you come up on the railway?

1598
02:16:36,534 --> 02:16:41,040
I did, and the truth is,
I can never travel by train

1599
02:16:41,163 --> 02:16:43,632
without recalling
your miraculous painting.

1600
02:16:43,749 --> 02:16:44,796
Oh.

1601
02:16:54,218 --> 02:16:58,894
My dear Turner, I am obliged to inform you
that your condition is grave.

1602
02:17:01,183 --> 02:17:03,311
Your days are numbered

1603
02:17:03,436 --> 02:17:06,440
and if you have affairs
to attend to in this world

1604
02:17:06,564 --> 02:17:10,740
you should do so now
and prepare yourself for the next.

1605
02:17:11,444 --> 02:17:12,821
Dr Price...

1606
02:17:14,572 --> 02:17:17,121
...with the utmost respect,

1607
02:17:17,241 --> 02:17:22,088
may I suggest you take yourself
downstairs to Mrs Booth,

1608
02:17:22,204 --> 02:17:25,799
avail yourself
of a large glass of sherry,

1609
02:17:25,917 --> 02:17:29,922
come back up here
and reassess your opinion?

1610
02:17:31,255 --> 02:17:34,259
No, sir, I'm afraid
I shan't be doing that.

1611
02:17:35,384 --> 02:17:36,476
Oh.

1612
02:17:39,597 --> 02:17:42,817
So I'm to become a non-entity.

1613
02:17:44,268 --> 02:17:47,522
I do not understand exactly
what you mean by a non-entity.

1614
02:17:54,779 --> 02:17:57,532
- Good day to you, Doctor.
- Good day, Mrs Booth. Thank you.

1615
02:17:57,657 --> 02:18:00,285
Oh, I shall send out
for the laudanum directly.

1616
02:18:00,409 --> 02:18:02,207
Splendid,
He couldn't be in better hands.

1617
02:18:02,328 --> 02:18:03,750
I do my best

1618
02:18:03,871 --> 02:18:07,171
So, will you be taking the boat back
from Chelsea Pier there?

1619
02:18:07,291 --> 02:18:09,965
Indeed. I shall catch the midday train
from Charing Cross.

1620
02:18:10,044 --> 02:18:13,548
Well, I do wish'ee a safe journey,
and I thank you, Doctor.

1621
02:18:13,673 --> 02:18:15,425
I shall return shortly,

1622
02:18:35,987 --> 02:18:36,988
Eh?

1623
02:18:56,382 --> 02:18:57,804
Number six.

1624
02:19:17,486 --> 02:19:18,908
- I need a rest.
- Pardon?

1625
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:20,532
I need a rest.

1626
02:19:27,204 --> 02:19:29,206
Can we help, my dear?

1627
02:19:33,335 --> 02:19:37,090
- I'm looking for an old gentleman.
- An old gentleman?

1628
02:19:37,256 --> 02:19:40,510
- Do you have a name?
- There's a lot of old gentlemen round here.

1629
02:19:40,634 --> 02:19:42,728
- He lives next door.
- Number six.

1630
02:19:42,845 --> 02:19:46,691
There is an old gentleman
lives next-door with his good lady wife.

1631
02:19:47,683 --> 02:19:49,902
They say he has the sickness.

1632
02:19:52,021 --> 02:19:53,694
Are you a relative?

1633
02:19:58,861 --> 02:20:00,454
No matter.

1634
02:20:01,781 --> 02:20:03,454
- Good day.
- Good day.

1635
02:20:03,574 --> 02:20:04,746
Good day.

1636
02:20:17,713 --> 02:20:21,513
Shh, shh, shh.

1637
02:20:21,634 --> 02:20:24,137
- Aargh!
- No, 'tis I.

1638
02:20:24,303 --> 02:20:25,680
'Tis I, There!

1639
02:20:25,805 --> 02:20:28,433
Shh, shh, 'tis I'

1640
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:35,649
Poor, wretched soul.

1641
02:20:35,773 --> 02:20:37,775
She be drowned dead.

1642
02:20:38,859 --> 02:20:40,577
There.

1643
02:20:40,694 --> 02:20:43,493
The suffering she must have seen.

1644
02:20:46,117 --> 02:20:48,745
If there be a God,
he be a cruel one.

1645
02:20:53,541 --> 02:20:57,296
- What are you doing?
- I have to sketch her.

1646
02:20:57,419 --> 02:21:00,798
Get back into bed now,
Joseph Mallard William Turner!

1647
02:21:00,923 --> 02:21:04,928
No, no, no, no, no, no.
There be no shoes on your feet!

1648
02:21:16,147 --> 02:21:17,319
Poor creature.

1649
02:21:30,244 --> 02:21:32,372
Oh, there.
Let me take you in.

1650
02:21:32,496 --> 02:21:33,998
There... No!

1651
02:21:34,123 --> 02:21:36,842
Come in.
You can finish that later.

1652
02:22:15,581 --> 02:22:17,504
Me damsel...

1653
02:22:37,978 --> 02:22:40,276
The sun is God.
