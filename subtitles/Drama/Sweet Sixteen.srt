1
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,534
- Right, who wants a shot?
- Me!

2
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,769
25p a go.
Pay Pinball.

3
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,802
Get in a line.

4
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,178
Get in the back, you.
Money.

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,412
Do you not want a shot?
Get in the queue.

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,784
Have you paid?
Sure you've paid?

7
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,413
Money.
Can you see anything?

8
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,481
Can you see anything?

9
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,597
See the big one?
That's Saturn.

10
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,404
- Can you see it yet?
- No, still stars.

11
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,809
- Still stars.
- There?

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,972
- Still stars.
- How about now?

13
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,243
Stars.

14
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,683
That big one, that's Saturn.
You can tell by its rings.

15
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,310
Next.

16
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,413
Who's paid?

17
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,920
Pinball, have they paid?

18
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,554
They only get five seconds
because they only paid half.

19
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,430
- What do you see?
- Stars.

20
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,002
I'm putting 25p
in your pocket.

21
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,598
Get out of here.
Move.

22
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,601
You know how long a day is up there?
10 hours, 14 minutes.

23
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,841
Fuck all time up in Saturn
if you want to do anything.

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,350
- There's not much time, young man.
- Next.

25
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,150
You looking for any cheap fags?

26
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,163
What kind are they?

27
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,564
Make you look better
than you already do.

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,369
Hiya, ladies. Do you wanna buy
any cheap fags?

29
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,468
These will prevent heart disease.

30
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,171
Over 60, even help you
with a hard-on.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,685
Thanks for doing business.

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,417
Cheap cigarettes?

33
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,758
Cheap fags?

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,029
Tom, those boys
are back in again.

35
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,270
Hey, you two. Come on.

36
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,002
That's two or three times this week.
You've been up here flogging stuff.

37
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,010
We're only trying to keep
your customer satisfied.

38
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,605
Out the door,
Simon and Garfunkel!

39
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,242
Don't get in a strop, you cunt.

40
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:56,584
You want some?
Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.

41
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,714
- How did you get on?
- Fucking buzzing.

42
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,284
- Magic.
- What you got?

43
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:07,093
- Empty bag.
- Do you want this load?

44
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,625
- Shit, it's the coppers.
- Bastards!

45
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,571
What do you want to do?
Do you want to stand about?

46
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,070
- Hold on a minute.
- Liam, where are you going?

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,479
- What are you doing?
- What's he doing?

48
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,980
All right, mate?

49
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,354
- Is it all right to come out?
- Brand new. Yeah. Come on.

50
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,668
- What the fuck?
- You little bastard!

51
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,731
- Oh, fucking brilliant!
- Fuck's sake!

52
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,742
Don't you use
your fucking mirrors?

53
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,607
How am I supposed to see
a bike parked there?

54
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,635
Fucking hell,
look at the state of it.

55
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,670
It's a fucking gateway.

56
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,320
Where's my helmet?

57
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,788
There's the wee bastard there
with your helmet.

58
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,417
You bastards!

59
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,360
- He's coming. Go!
- Stop!

60
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,159
For fuck's sake.
Quick!

61
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,992
Give it up, boys.

62
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,532
Stop!

63
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,430
Oh Christ, look at the time.

64
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,492
Do you know what time it is?

65
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,767
We're late. That's what time it is,
you little prick.

66
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,939
What did I tell you?
You never listen.

67
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,177
Where were you?

68
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,481
Is that all you can say?

69
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,011
Your granddad's talking to you.

70
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,820
You know your ma's
gonna be worried sick, don't you?

71
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,826
She's gonna be sitting
in the waiting room,

72
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,850
wondering where the fuck we are.

73
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,780
Put that in your mouth.

74
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,753
- Top of your teeth.
- Tell him to fucking do it.

75
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,585
Just do as you're fucking told.
I've had enough of you today.

76
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,182
Stick up these in your gums.
Hurry up.

77
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,227
Press it and flatten it.

78
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,629
Okay, the other side.

79
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,566
Let's see it.
Look at me.

80
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,876
Smile.

81
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,344
Let's see you fucking smile!

82
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,808
That's better. Like a friendly
little hamster the boy is.

83
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,656
When we get in there...
happy families, okay?

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,982
I'll go for coffee,

85
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,892
come back with the coffee.

86
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,363
Wee accident, coffee spills.

87
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,392
I jump up.
Granddad jumps back, right?

88
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,770
In all the confusion,
you kiss your ma, pass it over.

89
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,706
Have you got that?

90
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,447
Can you take your cap off?

91
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,358
Thanks. Just lift your arms up.

92
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,853
That's great.
Just grab your stuff.

93
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,299
- Come on, Liam. Hurry up.
- Table five, guys.

94
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,709
Hi, son. All right, Dad?

95
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,083
All right, darling, how's it going?

96
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,110
Good to see you, hen.

97
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,817
All right, angel face?

98
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,383
Did you think we were not coming?

99
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,021
It's good to see you.
We got a bit held up, didn't we?

100
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,593
He's in one of his moods.

101
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,577
What you sitting all the way
over there for? Come on over.

102
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,913
His face has been tripping all the way
here. Been like that all day.

103
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,350
How have you been getting on
at school?

104
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,375
School!

105
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,411
He's turned into
a right regular little scholar.

106
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,617
He hasn't seen the inside
of a school for nine months.

107
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,459
Who fancies a cup of coffee then?

108
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,694
- Yeah, I'd love one.
- Milk and one sugar?

109
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,495
We've missed her, son,
haven't we?

110
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,039
Are you all right, Mum?

111
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:31,021
What's wrong with you?
Come on, you can tell me.

112
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,045
No, I'm all right.

113
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,116
Somebody giving you
a hard time in here?

114
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,151
Are you clean?

115
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,893
You know I've been clean for years.
What are you saying that for?

116
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,765
What the fuck
is this all about, then?

117
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,227
Stan set it up.

118
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,366
It's for the women in here.
It's not for me.

119
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,802
Stan set it up for the women,

120
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,780
and he's getting a fortune
off their boyfriends.

121
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,545
You're caught with this,
it's six months minimum.

122
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,646
You can't last
another six months in here.

123
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,053
Do they strip search you?

124
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,688
They pick out a couple of us
at random.

125
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,823
What if they pick you?

126
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,131
Just swallow it.
I've done it before.

127
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,797
This isn't going on anymore.
It's finished.

128
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,807
You already took the rap once
for that bastard.

129
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,345
He's gonna be pissed
when I don't do this.

130
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,283
Whatever he says,
don't get upset.

131
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,487
Liam, don't start, eh?

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,482
Oh, for fuck's sake!

133
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,723
Liam, give your ma a hug.

134
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,963
Sorry about the language,
I can't believe myself sometimes.

135
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,697
Like a bull in a china shop!

136
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,398
I can't believe I just did that.

137
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,935
Here, drink your coffee.

138
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,444
Rab, go and get us another cup.

139
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,444
I'll sit with my wee friend here.

140
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,117
So what do you think
of your boy here then?

141
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,420
Wanna give your ma a kiss?

142
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,995
- Fucking tell him.
- Give your mum a kiss.

143
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,062
What do you think, Gramps?
Do we have a laugh with him or what?

144
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,301
He's a laugh a minute.

145
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,368
A right wee comedian.
Don't need a telly when he's about.

146
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,574
Kiss your fucking mother.

147
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,345
- See you later, Mum.
- Liam, please, don't.

148
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,375
Listen, by Christ...

149
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,048
see, if you don't kiss your mother goodbye,
you little cunt,

150
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,887
I'm gonna boot your fucking arse
all the way to fucking Greenock.

151
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,519
Now kiss your fucking mother,
you little cunt!

152
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,189
Stan, calm down.

153
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,223
See you later, Mum.

154
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,257
Let him go.

155
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,673
Do you know how much
that's fucking cost me?

156
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,690
- Give us the gear.
- You want it?

157
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,725
- Hand it over.
- Fucking get the gear.

158
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,795
You fucking twat!

159
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,670
Don't hit him in the face.
His fucking ma will see it.

160
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,807
You fucking idiot!

161
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,288
That's fucking enough, right?
You fucking idiot!

162
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,725
Where's the fucking gear?

163
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,927
Next time you will be walking
like fucking Charlie Chaplin.

164
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,493
I'll break your legs,
you little cunt.

165
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,598
It never went
as far as that.

166
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,336
It's over the fence there.

167
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,366
You bastard!

168
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,402
For fuck's sake!

169
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,781
A fucking Laurel and Hardy fucking family.
Get over the fucking fence.

170
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,719
My fucking balls are caught,
you cunt!

171
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,522
Fucking feeble, you cunts.

172
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,253
Just you wait!

173
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,796
- Hi, Liam.
- All right, Hazel, love?

174
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,672
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, hen.

175
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,698
You sure?

176
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,750
I've been keeping an eye out for you.
Are you all right?

177
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,022
Sure?

178
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,797
Take a bag. I phoned Chantelle,
she knows we are coming.

179
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,337
Hey. boys.

180
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,001
That's your lot. You get it,

181
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,671
get this fuck and don't come back
near this school again.

182
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,841
My fucking caring grandfather, eh?

183
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,578
My own fucking flesh and blood,
you fucking old bastard.

184
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,144
I love your fucking grandfather.
He's so funny.

185
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,019
Here, you old bastard.

186
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,651
How's your balls, you old cunt?
Are they sore?

187
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,024
You'll give the place a bad name.
Fuck off.

188
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,794
Did you dye
your hair as well, blondie?

189
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,195
Who was that?

190
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,961
- What was that all about?
- They started it.

191
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,969
Don't forget
I've gotta live here.

192
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,597
- Hello.
- Get in.

193
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,538
Stop staring.

194
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,448
Who's the bird, Chantelle?

195
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,281
The bird can speak for herself,
wee man.

196
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,986
- It's Suzanne.
- That's a nice name.

197
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,256
That's my brother Liam
and his pal Pinball.

198
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,422
I met Suzanne
at my night class.

199
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,364
- What night class?
- The call center one.

200
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,234
- It's that one we were gonna join.
- It's that 0800 one.

201
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,463
Where are you going?

202
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,736
There's no rush.
Sit down.

203
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,335
- I can make tea.
- No. It's all right.

204
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,312
Chantelle, I'll phone you.

205
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,838
I'll phone you
if I can get your number.

206
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,942
See you later.
What are you like?

207
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,975
Has she left?

208
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,989
Don't go to the window.

209
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,389
Is she there?

210
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,587
- Is she there?
- Hey, man, look at that.

211
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,153
Get away
from the window.

212
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,859
No, Calum,
we need to see this.

213
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,507
- What have you done?
- I'm telling you, I tripped.

214
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,278
You didn't trip.
Turn around.

215
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,684
- What happened to you?
- I fell.

216
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,814
You did not fall.

217
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,050
This'll sting.

218
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,826
Easy, Chantelle.

219
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,266
You haven't asked me
about Mum yet.

220
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,435
I don't need
to ask about her.

221
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,149
If you're good for wee Calum,
you can stay.

222
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,311
No, I'll pay my way.

223
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,184
Don't you listen?

224
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,850
If you're good for wee Calum,
you can stay.

225
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,325
And I won't be playing
social workers.

226
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,857
I won't be taken
for a ride.

227
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,996
We share the cooking
and the housework.

228
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,031
There will be no swearing.
It's bad for Calum.

229
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,543
There will be no smoking.
It's bad for Calum.

230
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,512
No farting-- bad for Calum.

231
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,482
Turn around.

232
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,245
They won't take you
back at school?

233
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,157
That's one way
of putting it.

234
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,024
What about
the Children's Panel?

235
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,293
I'm not up for a review
'til Mum gets out.

236
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,561
Why don't you come
to my call center class?

237
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,592
It doesn't cost nothing.

238
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,072
And they might take you on
when you're 16.

239
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,235
Pinball might be a priest, eh?

240
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,973
Look at the state of you.

241
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,003
Look at yourself.

242
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,076
You gonna get yourself
sorted out?

243
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,783
Liam, look at me.

244
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,658
You gonna sort
yourself out?

245
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,492
- Aye.
- Promise me?

246
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,808
Get it, get it,
get it.

247
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,601
Calum, my man.

248
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,933
Who's that pal?
Is that daft Pinball?

249
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,065
Where did you get that?

250
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,565
Pinball's been driving about looking
for one with a child seat all day.

251
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,705
No chance.
Chantelle will kill us.

252
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,238
No, she won't.
How she gonna find out?

253
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:03,447
Calum, are you coming in?
Course you are. Come on.

254
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,046
Come with Pinball,
won't you?

255
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,886
I mean it,
none of your crap.

256
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,021
If she finds out,
she'll go mad.

257
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,621
Go.

258
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,960
Ready, Calum?

259
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,939
Are you all right,
wee man?

260
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,452
You're a prick.
Fucking get hold of it.

261
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,959
You fucking idiot!

262
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,371
- We've got the wee man in the back.
- Calm down, it was miles away.

263
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,307
- You all right, wee man?
- Sorry, Calum.

264
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,443
For fuck's sake.

265
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,176
What are you fucking
turning it up for?

266
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,814
Here, here, stop here.

267
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,356
Hold on, Calum.
I'll be back in a minute.

268
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,891
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna look at this place.

269
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,201
Where are you going?

270
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,640
Six grand.
It's all right, man.

271
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,570
What are you doing?

272
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,143
Oh look at it, man.
I'm gonna look at this.

273
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,459
Look at that, man.
Two bedrooms,

274
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,586
telly, microwave.

275
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,619
You'd get six
around that table, no bother.

276
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,272
Oh, look at that view, man.

277
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,780
Oh, yes, man.

278
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,617
This is the stuff. Imagine being here
at night with a clear sky.

279
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,283
Fishing rod. Couple of cans,
couple of hens as well.

280
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,156
Suzanne to keep
you company.

281
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,184
No cunt telling you
what to do.

282
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,925
Year's supply of pizzas.
Oh, lovely.

283
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,332
Mum would love this, after all that time
cooped up in that fucking cell.

284
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,497
Paradise, man.

285
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,616
All right, Mum,
it's your handsome wee boy here,

286
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,312
sending you a tape
to cheer you up.

287
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,753
I'm sitting here
with a few of the boys--

288
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,723
Pinball, Nighttime,

289
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,090
Sidekick-Joint employees
of the month.

290
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,152
The fastest pizza slingers
in the west.

291
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,289
"And that's official,
by the way!"

292
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,233
Me and Pinball
were in the country today.

293
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:15,398
See this wee place we found.
Right by the water.

294
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,236
Brilliant for a picnic, Mum.

295
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,264
I'm gonna take you there
as soon as you get out.

296
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,972
Just 10 more weeks,
we'll be together.

297
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,811
- What was it like, Pinball?
- A lovely view. You'd love it, Jean.

298
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,019
As soon as you're out,
I'm gonna take you there.

299
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,215
Your wee man's doing brilliant.
What a laugh he is.

300
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,054
- All right, boys?
- All right.

301
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,390
- I'll see you later. I need to go home.
- Hold on.

302
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,124
I'm making a cassette for my ma.
You want to say hello?

303
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,564
- No bother.
- Go on, Suzy.

304
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:46,160
Hello, my name's Suzanne.

305
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,934
I hope to meet you soon
and good luck.

306
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,100
See you later.

307
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,683
What's all the fuss about?

308
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,485
What are you all doing?
Where are you going?

309
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,685
Is she there?
Oh, there she is.

310
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:14,663
- Pinball, come on.
- Is she not stunning?

311
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,633
You got the night lenses
on them glasses?

312
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,068
I know, stunning.

313
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,197
Pinball, that's the best sight
you could ever imagine.

314
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,038
- I'll be having that sight soon.
- You wish.

315
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,341
- She'll be mine.
- Sidekick, say something.

316
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,611
Hope your porridge
isn't too lumpy, Jean.

317
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,183
What? I'm serious.

318
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,552
What are you all laughing at?

319
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,653
A lass is getting changed
in the house over there.

320
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,716
- Let us see.
- No, she's away.

321
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,921
She's away,
it's all right.

322
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,123
- What did you see?
- Nothing. Not a thing.

323
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,961
- See her tits?
- No.

324
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,669
There's your dad
with your grandpa.

325
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,336
- He's not my fucking dad, all right?
- Stan, then. Sorry, mate.

326
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,210
- He could be your dad.
- Fucking shut up!

327
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,374
Fucking arsehole.

328
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,284
- Who's that?
- That's Slobodan.

329
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,345
- Who?
- Slobodan McTavish.

330
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,382
- Who's that?
- Scullion, you fucking dickhead.

331
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,088
Hold these.
I'm gonna wind this cunt up.

332
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,996
Your grandpa?

333
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,127
How the fuck would my granddad
have a phone?

334
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,933
- Look at him.
- Give me them.

335
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,974
Hello, Stan speaking.
What can I do for you?

336
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,538
Excuse me, sir. Can I interest you
in some double-glazing windows?

337
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,209
Not today, son.

338
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,310
What about a fitted
kitchen, then?

339
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,220
I've told you, I don't want fuck all.
You know what I mean?

340
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,724
What about our new top
of the range dildos?

341
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,748
Because you sound
like a bit of a cock-jockey.

342
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,319
Who the fuck are you, little...

343
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,887
Cunt?!

344
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,193
Look, he's fucking angry.

345
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,205
- Think he knew it was me?
- No.

346
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,978
He's passing Scullion
some dough.

347
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,710
That means
they're gonna get a delivery.

348
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,411
Fuck's sake.

349
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:54,280
Fucking dancer, wee man.
This is our score.

350
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,622
I know where
they stash the drugs.

351
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,686
- We could get it, no bother.
- What are you talking about?

352
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,789
The gear,
I know where it is.

353
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,560
You wanna break
into Stan's house?

354
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,536
Yeah, get the gear.

355
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,506
You're nuts.
Don't be stupid.

356
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,202
What's wrong with you?
You know how to cut it.

357
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,438
I may be daft, but I'm not dumb.
It's a daft idea.

358
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,872
I could get
a caravan for my ma.

359
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,043
I know your ma,
but I'm not even thinking about this.

360
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,020
- We're getting nowhere with the fags.
- I'm happy with the fags.

361
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,114
We're getting fucking coppers.
Look at the state of this place.

362
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,455
- I know the state of it.
- Think of the caravan.

363
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,586
The fucking money
we're gonna get here.

364
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,995
Look, mate,
this is big fucking bucks.

365
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,958
The caravan, plus plenty left.

366
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,665
We won't get near it
with the money we have.

367
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,765
What, 50-50?

368
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,040
- Fucking 50-50. What do you think?
- I should think so.

369
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,109
- So where do they stash it?
- Under a board.

370
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,680
- In the house?
- No, in the kennel with the dogs.

371
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,625
The dogs?
I'm definitely not doing it now.

372
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,426
Oh, fuck off.
The fucking dogs are there.

373
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,333
- You're a fucking shitbag.
- You said you'd get rid of them.

374
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,304
Fucking move.

375
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,276
Hairy Balls. Here, boy.

376
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,577
It's not worth it.
They'll rip you apart.

377
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,446
Fucking shush.
Come here.

378
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,110
Here, boy.

379
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,781
Come here.
No Balls, here, girl.

380
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,520
Give us the sweeties.

381
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,800
That's No Balls, there,
that's the lassie. Give her one.

382
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,997
- Here, feed them.
- I'm not feeding them.

383
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,632
They're not gonna touch you.

384
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,915
Hairy Balls, come here.

385
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,384
No Balls, whatever,
come here.

386
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,853
Keep them fuckers there.

387
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,947
Here, take it, here.

388
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,480
Wait there.

389
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,818
What are you doing?
Come on.

390
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,222
Liam, I'm serious.
Come on.

391
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,088
Liam, come here.

392
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,862
What are you doing?

393
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,874
So what did you tell the police?

394
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,004
Just left them a message
they couldn't ignore.

395
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,344
It must have been
a good message.

396
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,350
They'll need
to take the dogs out first.

397
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,181
The coppers
won't go anywhere near them.

398
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,687
That's what the hobbies
will be for.

399
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,659
Fucking idiot.

400
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,702
They're taking this fucking seriously.
That's the CID.

401
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,041
The police are going nuts
because they can't find anything.

402
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,169
He's fucking going nuts
because he thinks they've taken the smack.

403
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,736
Fucking dancer, man.

404
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,673
Oh, fucking hell,
Liam, man.

405
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,953
Hey, Gramps,
are your balls still sore?

406
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,184
Have a look at mine,
you cunt.

407
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,283
They've been in his mouth
and you just put them on my face.

408
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,852
- Give us a kiss, Pinball.
- Fuck off.

409
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,572
Do you want a shot?

410
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,912
No, man.
Can't risk losing any of this stuff.

411
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,229
How much do you reckon
we've got here?

412
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:16,363
Good bag.
It's good stuff and we can sell it.

413
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,871
Two grand.

414
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,878
We're gonna get that caravan.

415
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,848
Don't worry about that.

416
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,851
I used to watch my dad
do this sometimes.

417
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,219
He was good at it.

418
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,622
My teacher always used to...

419
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,855
wonder how I was so good
at fucking maths and fuck all else.

420
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,624
I wish I could tell her how.

421
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,034
Sure it's safe in here?

422
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,833
It's only me and my big brother.
No cunt else comes in here.

423
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,806
Anyhow, he's not into this.

424
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,641
You'll need this, mate.
Definitely.

425
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,792
I'm not wanting it.
I'll use my head.

426
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,456
These cunts will have a go,
trust me.

427
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,160
- I'll be carrying anyway.
- I said I'm not wanting it.

428
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,760
And another thing...
not using.

429
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,163
I'm fucking serious,
by the way.

430
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,402
- We're not junkies, right?
- I know.

431
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,775
And all of this goes
to the caravan.

432
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,508
Yeah, don't worry.

433
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,484
- Shake on it.
- Kiss on it.

434
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,976
- I'm fucking serious.
- Yeah, so am I.

435
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,581
Shake on it.

436
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,366
Do you want to buy
any gear?

437
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,003
No, pal. Last time I was here,
I got ripped off.

438
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,809
- Do you want to see the bags?
- No, I told you.

439
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,746
Do you want any, lads?

440
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,221
What about the cameras?

441
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,253
All right, Mum,
it's me.

442
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,321
I just put the wee man
into his bed.

443
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,062
Chantelle's away at her night class,
so I'm landed with him for the night.

444
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,094
See how big
he's getting, Mum.

445
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,702
Sometimes he looks
right at you,

446
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,212
right into your eyes,

447
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,239
as if you're the only person
he's ever met.

448
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:45,118
Anyway, big news is we're selling fags
by the barrow load.

449
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,680
We're raking it in, Mum.

450
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,625
So I might have a wee surprise
for you when you get out.

451
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,561
Just 61 days, Mum.

452
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,396
The day before my birthday.

453
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,233
Here's another one
of your wee favorites.

454
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,570
I'll come see you soon.
Maybe I'll take the wee man.

455
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,007
Cheerio, Mum.

456
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:22,386


457
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,292


458
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:30,561


459
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:36,834


460
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,468


461
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,570


462
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:48,308


463
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,910


464
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,617


465
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,785


466
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,591


467
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,829


468
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,495


469
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,538


470
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:19,512


471
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,212


472
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,053


473
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,308
That's 4,500

474
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,004
to be payable
by the 30th of November.

475
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:53,140
You'll need to get
Mrs. Maguire to sign here.

476
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,377
When will she be back?

477
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,650
She won't be back
for a couple of months.

478
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,716
She's on a refresher course
down south.

479
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,750
What's her contact number?

480
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,663
She doesn't like to be disturbed.
It's a pretty intensive course.

481
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:14,263
What's her employment?
If you don't mind me asking.

482
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,273
She's part of the prison service.

483
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,669
See you later. Bye.

484
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,350
- You're a pure brass neck.
- How?

485
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,819
- How are you gonna pay for that?
- Do I ask about your financial affairs?

486
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,550
- Did you get it?
- Black and white.

487
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,353
But how are you gonna
get all that money?

488
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,951
- I'm the businessman.
- In what?

489
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,985
I just struck a deal
with this guy from Bristol.

490
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,521
He's gonna bring us up fags,
van loads of them.

491
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,433
- So fags will get you that kind of money?
- I've got us this far, hasn't it?

492
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:50,200
He's been selling stuff since he was seven.
I'm always falling over boxes of stuff.

493
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,210
Calum, wait for me.

494
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,974
Don't drop him.

495
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,841
You get the gate.

496
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,046
That's it.

497
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,954
Run, run...

498
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,482
Wait 'til I get the door, mate.

499
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,223
Get it open.

500
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,561
I wanna get keys cut
for all of you,

501
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,726
even Nighttime.

502
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,363
Man, the picnics
we're gonna have in here.

503
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,769
Go on, settle there. Get in there.
Calum. We'll get a picture.

504
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,214
- Hands off my sister.
- Sorry.

505
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,447
Hey, you.
Keep your hands to yourself.

506
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,456
Get in a bit closer.
Cheese!

507
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,748
I'm going out with your sister,
by the way.

508
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,792
You might fall.
Come on.

509
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,806
- You'll fall on these stones, Calum.
- Walk very slowly then.

510
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,102
See, shall I hold
your hand?

511
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,783
That was a nice one there.
That's the record so far.

512
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,184
That was about 15,
16 I got there.

513
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,518
Where are you gonna get the money?
Four and a half grand?

514
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,683
We'll get it.

515
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,622
- What, by November?
- Aye.

516
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,197
- Don't think so, Liam.
- Trust me.

517
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,805
He's got Chantelle's eyes.

518
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,010
She was gorgeous
at that age.

519
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,645
She was a really good baby.

520
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,550
I tell him about you
all the time.

521
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,923
- No, you don't.
- I do.

522
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,361
I've put your photo above his cot
so he'll know when you get out.

523
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,629
She's lovely.

524
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,333
- He's beautiful, isn't he?
- He looks like you.

525
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,434
He doesn't.

526
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,707
Chantelle's dying
to hear from you, Mum.

527
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:14,181
You should write her
a wee note.

528
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,742
She can't stand me.

529
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,952
Anyway, got
a wee surprise for you--

530
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,187
got a big surprise for you.

531
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,525
- What is it?
- Take it.

532
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,552
- Let me see it.
- I'll bring it up next time.

533
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,328
- Show me.
- No, I'll take it next time.

534
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,665
What is it?

535
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,734
- What is this?
- It's a caravan.

536
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,711
- It's our caravan.
- I know it's a caravan, but...

537
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:46,340
Not the council's, not the bank's.
It's ours, Mum.

538
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,283
Ours.
I've bought it.

539
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,619
- This must have cost a fortune.
- I'm getting paid a fortune.

540
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,988
- How much?
- Don't worry about that.

541
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,789
I've already paid the deposit
and the first installment.

542
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,727
Looks lovely,
doesn't it?

543
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,062
Nobody to annoy you-- no junkies,
no police. Just me and you.

544
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,399
And Chantelle and Calum if they want.
There's plenty of room in it.

545
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,735
All you need to do
is sign for it.

546
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,669
It's in your name.
It's yours.

547
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,077
Sign here.
It's yours.

548
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:22,551
Have you really thought
about this?

549
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,077
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Just going to sign?

550
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,421
Sign. Aye.

551
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,044
And another two.
How many is that?

552
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,981
- How many is that?
- That's 42.

553
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,348
Fucking hell!
They must be making a fortune.

554
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,377
Yeah, definitely.

555
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,653
If we caught them off
that wee shortcut,

556
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,422
we could do more business in an afternoon
than we could in a week.

557
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:10,023
Do you know who stays there?
Big Jay fucking Ellis, serious coconut.

558
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,056
We'll be careful
about that--

559
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,660
keep a lookout a couple of days
and then we'll do the business.

560
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,330
You want
throwing out a window?

561
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,966
Stabbed in the balls?
A pitbull set on you? Don't be daft.

562
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,237
All we need is a couple of days
to make the contacts.

563
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,771
Cut them off there, do the business.
Then we'll lay low somewhere.

564
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,148
Where, one of your daft fucking planets?
They'll find us there as well.

565
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,346
I could lose
the fucking caravan.

566
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,719
Fuck your caravan!

567
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,123
Know what?
Fuck you. I'll do it myself.

568
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,151
- And don't come back to me fucking.
- Fuck you, you prick.

569
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,758
You'll fucking never do it.
Fucking nutcase.

570
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,739
Where are you off to?

571
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,682
- I'm going down the road to get stuff.
- I've got a bit of gear here.

572
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,049
- Any good?
- Brilliant. Best of stuff.

573
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,078
- Sure?
- Better than that cunt Ellis' anyway.

574
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,886
Give us a toke.

575
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,472
- All right, boys.
- Hi, wee man.

576
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,610
- You looking for any gear?
- What you got?

577
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,554
Good idea.

578
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,143
Give me my fucking gear,
you prick.

579
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,923
Hard man, eh,
you prick?

580
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,194
- Give us my fucking gear.
- Fuck you.

581
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,507
I'll be all right.

582
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,210
Give me my fucking gear!

583
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,655
I'm telling you,
you fucking stay back this time.

584
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:55,755
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Now fucking stay down!

585
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,494
- Fucking dickhead.
- Arsehole.

586
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,561
- Fucking done my nose.
- I think my nose is broke.

587
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,097
- It's all right.
- He's broke mine, too.

588
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,837
Don't fucking worry about it.

589
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:21,046
- Give me my fucking gear.
- He's a fucking nutter!

590
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,525
I'm gonna kill
this bastard.

591
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:30,589
- Give him the stuff.
- Give him fuck all.

592
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,033
Give us the fucking gear!

593
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,627
You fuck off!

594
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,277
I'll fucking have him!

595
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,011
You want that caravan,
don't you?

596
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,683
Fucking nuts, mate.
Nuts.

597
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,400
How many times
have I done this?

598
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,571
- Done what?
- This.

599
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,308
"Hey-ho, hey-ho,
orphan weans have to go."

600
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,685
Do you remember?

601
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,781
At the children's home?

602
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:33,124
"Where's your mummy?"

603
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,791
Remember you ran out
and you fought three big boys?

604
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,234
They all thought
you were brave.

605
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,169
But I didn't.

606
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,570
I was screaming
through the window.

607
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,481
And I heard
your arm snap.

608
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,654
When they let you go, you still
managed to laugh in their face.

609
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:03,385
You didn't fight them
because you were brave.

610
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,883
You fought them because you just
didn't care what happened to you.

611
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,621
That's what broke my heart.

612
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,999
It was just
another kicking for you.

613
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:22,773
How can you really care about us
if you don't care for yourself?

614
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,940
Turn around.

615
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,007
Turn around!

616
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,425
What am I supposed to tell
the wean in the morning?

617
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,559
You tripped?

618
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,299
Some junkie stole your fags
and nearly killed you?

619
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:57,272
All wee Calum's got in the whole world
is me and you.

620
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,210
Nobody else.

621
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,847
What happened to us
isn't gonna happen to him.

622
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,915
Never.

623
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,228
Over my dead body,
and I swear it.

624
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,069
I want peace
in this house.

625
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,740
Hi, Suzanne.
How are you doing?

626
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,371
You fucking prick.

627
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,439
She said she sent me a text.
She wants a date with me.

628
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,783
- Don't talk shite.
- She fucking does. She wants me.

629
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,351
You two better be
on your best fucking behavior,

630
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,881
because we don't even
want you to be here.

631
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:19,291
Right, the bar's clear.

632
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,524
Fucking stand there.

633
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,902
Don't fucking break anything.

634
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,840
Just fucking stand in peace,
wee man.

635
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,083
Just fucking
shut your mouth, son.

636
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,261
Stop fucking ogling at the pool.

637
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,096
Fucking get your arse in line.

638
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,306
How are you,
gentlemen?

639
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,679
- I told you-- Al Capone.
- What did you say?

640
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,241
Say that again,
you wee fanny.

641
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,948
Al Capone.

642
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:23,150
Cheeky wee cunt.
Give him a cold shower.

643
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,059
Hey, hold on.

644
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,721
He's nothing to do with it.

645
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,958
I'm the one you want.
I organized everything.

646
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,535
- Sit down.
- What are you gonna do to him?

647
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,836
Fuck him.
Sit down.

648
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,409
Show me your arms.

649
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,676
Do it.

650
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,447
- Aye, he's clean.
- Good.

651
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,923
- How old are you?
- 15.

652
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,324
Who supplied you?

653
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,257
Are you afraid
we'll shop you?

654
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,700
I don't do that.
Ever.

655
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,000
I don't need to.

656
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,233
I do need to know
who supplied you, though.

657
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,837
Do you know why
I'm asking you that?

658
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:20,508
- In case somebody else tries to muscle in.
- Is that the case?

659
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,448
I stole it from Stan.

660
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,345
Stan Irvine?

661
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,582
Aye, he's going out
with my mum.

662
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,251
I knew he stashed it in
with the dogs, so I stole it.

663
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,817
And my granddad's teeth.

664
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,295
Could be true.
He's blaming a bent cop.

665
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,992
It is true.
I set him up.

666
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,864
I only phoned
the police to cover me.

667
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,268
Stan's not the sharpest.

668
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:46,104
So you thought we were gonna tell him
and you were gonna take a tanking?

669
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,975
He doesn't bother me.
But he might take it out on my mum.

670
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,947
That's some chance,
wee man.

671
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,006
You stay away
from our fucking shops.

672
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,984
Especially Big Jay Ellis's.

673
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,545
Now you might be
a breath of fresh air, kid,

674
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,649
but there's a lot of fucking wasters
out there trying my patience.

675
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,060
Do you know
what initiative is, kid?

676
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,826
Laughing at your boss's jokes?

677
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,304
We might just get on.

678
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,733
Give me my fucking trainers.

679
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,433
Next time, you'll be leaving here
with two broken legs.

680
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,705
Get to fuck!
You're getting no trainers.

681
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,544
- Fuck's sake. I'm fucking freezing.
- Couldn't keep it shut, could you?

682
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,676
- Give me your jacket.
- Fuck off. You'll get it wringing.

683
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,653
- Look at the stare of you.
- Fuck you.

684
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,492
Look, there's your fucking pal.

685
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,398
I'm gonna fucking get him back.

686
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,699
It looks like it too,
you fucking idiot.

687
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:54,902
If we prove we can do this,
and that's a big fucking "if,"

688
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,495
he's gonna give us
a regular supply.

689
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,872
The more we sell, the bigger the cut.
Just like a business.

690
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,178
See, they want reliable dealers,

691
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,613
no fucking junkies that are using
more than they're selling.

692
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,310
What's wrong
with what we're selling now?

693
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,218
What happens when it runs out?
Where are we gonna get the gear from?

694
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,189
How do we know
it's not shite?

695
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:18,090
- The guy's cool, man.
- No, he's a cunt.

696
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:21,027
You saw the health club.
He's a fucking different class.

697
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,395
And then he'll do you on
just like that. Trust me.

698
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,162
Who cares?
All we need is a couple of months.

699
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:30,035
Stick together, no fucking about,
and we're rolling in it.

700
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,767
What happens
to me and you?

701
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:34,241
We do it together, don't we?
A fucking partnership.

702
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,678
- I don't trust him.
- We can learn from this guy.

703
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,809
Yeah, learn to arse lick.

704
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,752
Look, fucking make up your mind
or I'll find somebody else, right?

705
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:49,484
Do you wanna end up a waster
like your old man?

706
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,959
Or do you want
to do something?

707
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,358
- Have a chip.
- Fuck off. He's still a cunt.

708
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,301
A rich cunt.

709
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:03,998
So, what's next, then?

710
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,940
I tell you,
we've gotta prove ourselves.

711
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,240
We've gotta sell more
than anybody else without getting caught.

712
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,940
We've gotta move fast,
that's the secret.

713
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,506
- I can get a fucking motor, no problem.
- Too flash.

714
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,851
I've fucking got it.

715
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,413
What?

716
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,256
Tell me.

717
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,489
Gonna fucking tell me?

718
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,122
Mopeds.

719
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,048
I'll be back
in two minutes.

720
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,176
You'd better be, because I've got
another delivery to do.

721
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,782
Better hurry up, all right?

722
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:02,222
- A tenner.
- Right.

723
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,323
It's brilliant stuff,
I'm telling you.

724
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,994
Have you got a phone number
so I can contact you?

725
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,567
Where is he, man?

726
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:20,047
- Hurry up.
- I'll be back in two minutes.

727
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,844
Fuck's sake, man.

728
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,052
A bit of speed,
come on.

729
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,857
Second left,
then first right.

730
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:36,489
- Fuck off. I've not got time for a detour.
- Fucking hurry up. We need to take this.

731
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,999
- I'm not fucking doing it.
- I mean it.

732
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,831
Hello, Nighttime?

733
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:44,828
This is fucking ridiculous, by the way.
This cunt's taking his time.

734
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,569
I've been out 20 minutes
and only delivered one pizza.

735
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,567
He's here.
I need to go.

736
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,706
Fucking move!
Fuck's sake.

737
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:57,343
- I told you two minutes.
- You've been up there fucking five.

738
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,252
Fucking hurry up.
Move!

739
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,813
Fuck's sake.
Fucking arsehole.

740
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,621
Calm down, man.

741
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:09,460
It's not my fault and I'll tell you now,
this is fucking bad for business.

742
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,866
Yeah, and I've got pizzas here
fucking freezing.

743
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,635
Fuck's sake.

744
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,764
If you drove half as much as you talk,
we might get somewhere.

745
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,774
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

746
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,344
For fuck's sake,
where have you been?

747
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,440
Sorry if it's caused
any inconvenience.

748
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,077
An hour and a half. I fucking phoned
for that a fucking hour and a half ago.

749
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,109
- I had transport difficulties.
- I'm trying to go for a pint

750
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:37,147
and fucking only want a pizza. You could
have got one from Italy quicker.

751
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,491
- I got held up.
- You think you're Dick Turpin or what?

752
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,226
- Sorry, mate.
- Hope it's the right fucking pizza.

753
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,201
And it's fucking freezing. You know
what you can do with your fucking pizza?

754
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,533
Stick it right up your arse
and that will heat it up a wee bit.

755
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,835
Now fuck off
out of my sight.

756
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,108
- What is this? Funghi or Hawaii?
- Funghi.

757
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,612
No bother.
I can't read your writing.

758
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,548
Where have you been?

759
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,386
- Calm down, man.
- There're 16 orders here not been done.

760
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,619
Have a word with him.
He takes ages.

761
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,958
- We took a wee detour.
- Where, Western Europe?

762
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,589
Fuck's sake,
we've got a reputation to protect--

763
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,758
the slickest,
the fastest--

764
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,496
and all destroyed
in one night.

765
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:26,170
- How much in tips do you make a night?
- That's nothing to do with you.

766
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,869
Before I came on board, how much in tips
did you make a night?

767
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,434
Five, six quid,
it all depends.

768
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,278
That's fucking pish.

769
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:38,142
Do you want your money or not?
Come here.

770
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,982
Plenty more where that came from
for you both if you stop fucking greeting.

771
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,186
- Is that for me?
- And him.

772
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,094
We can make a compromise
if it works like this.

773
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,155
He's all happy now.

774
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,633
He's fucking shut up now.

775
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:57,126
- You cut that gear yet?
- No, I'll do it a bit later.

776
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,640
Sitting there on your lazy arse.
Go and get the gear cut.

777
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,233
Don't talk about lazy arse.
I've been in here before fucking you.

778
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,802
Exactly. Go get the fucking gear cut.
What are you doing here?

779
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:08,543
- I'll cut it later.
- Better be cut tonight, by the way.

780
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,677
Get out!
Get out!

781
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,942
Fuck's sake.

782
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,814
Oh, look, my wee brother's
all grown up.

783
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,912
He's turning into a man.

784
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,923
What a man gotta do
for a bit of privacy?

785
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,788
What are you shaving, son?

786
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:55,023
Fucking look at that.
It's not funny.

787
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,292
You missed a bit.

788
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,300
Get out!

789
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,802
- Don't you want me to do it for you?
- Get out!

790
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,599
I'm being serious.
Do you want me to help you?

791
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,936
I'm serious. Get out!

792
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,375
Did you ask
what they wanted us for?

793
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,320
Just said be there
for half 9:00.

794
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,914
- Are you worried?
- No, we're all right.

795
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,085
Did they sound fucking nervous
or angry or something?

796
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,426
What have they gotta be angry about?
We're fucking doing good business.

797
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,591
Fucking raking it in.

798
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:35,262
Just be cool, my man.

799
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,532
They're on time anyway.

800
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,234
Just play it cool, right?

801
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,114
Hi, Jack.
Hi, Tony.

802
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:58,123
- Where do you think you're going?
- What are you fucking doing?

803
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,252
- What are you fucking doing?
- See you later, son.

804
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,160
Liam, come on-- fuck!

805
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,358
Tony, what's going on, man?

806
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,368
Fuck's sake, man.
Liam!

807
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,495
Come on-- fuck.

808
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,770
Fucking hell!

809
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,722
Fuck's sake.

810
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,890
You wanna dump
that wee prick.

811
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,160
That's my best pal
you're talking about.

812
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:42,032
If you want to go anywhere,
drop him.

813
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,538
He's right, Liam.
Listen to Tony.

814
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,906
Do you know this man?

815
01:02:56,939 --> 01:03:00,512
- Aye, Scullion.
- Scullion.

816
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,286
- Be sure to remember his face, okay?
- Yeah.

817
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:10,325
Hello, Maureen.
Hi, it's Tony.

818
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:14,301
We'll be there in a minute.
Just wait at the back door, okay?

819
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,265
See that door?

820
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,869
Maureen's the barmaid.
She'll let you in.

821
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,903
She'll have something
for you.

822
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,849
Scullion's in there
with his team.

823
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,751
You wait 'til he's half pissed
and goes for a slash.

824
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:36,552
You follow him into the bog.
We'll make sure nobody gets in.

825
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,560
He's not gonna expect nothing
from you. Okay?

826
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:43,792
- Okay what?
- You're gonna do him in.

827
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,300
- You mean, kill him?
- Aye.

828
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,132
You're doing him,
wee man.

829
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,105
You're in with the big boys now, son.
Off you go, son.

830
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,282
You Okay?

831
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,192
Good.

832
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,573
If you'd just like
to come through here.

833
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,543
Listen, the bar's through here.

834
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,842
Your guy's out there,
just sitting over there at the bar.

835
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,816
The toilet is through there.

836
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,784
Have you got that?

837
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,946
I've got something
for you.

838
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,853
I'll be through
at the bar,

839
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,055
and I'll let you know
when he's coming through, okay?

840
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:49,495
See you soon.

841
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,584
Liam.

842
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,353
He's gone now.

843
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,217
Put it down!

844
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,823
It's all right, big man.

845
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,854
Nearly had my fucking
knackers off there.

846
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:07,095
You've got balls, son.
You're one of the team.

847
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,731
You're all right,
you're all right.

848
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,104
Fucking bastards.

849
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:18,044
I thought you were after
my fucking tadger, son.

850
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:22,514
Liam, see that?
You can fucking keep that.

851
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,610
Because you done
fucking brilliant!

852
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,357
Get this boy
a fucking drink!

853
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:02,645
Chantelle, what did you bring?
Did you bring sconies?

854
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,658
What do you normally take
to a picnic?

855
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,682
- Did you bring juice?
- Aye.

856
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:10,060
- Hands off. You're not getting any.
- I'm dying of thirst here.

857
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,690
That's for the picnic.

858
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,030
- What's she like?
- Tell him, Calum.

859
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:18,004
You're not getting any
'til we go to the picnic.

860
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,685
What happened?

861
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,325
Liam, what's happened?

862
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:48,592
I want to go over
and see what's happened.

863
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,901
- Just you stand there.
- What happened, Liam?

864
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,740
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

865
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:06,950
Don't go in there,
Uncle Liam!

866
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,217
Don't!

867
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,025
Who would have
done this to you?

868
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,508
You stand there
with Suzanne.

869
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,284
You've upset the wean.
Come out.

870
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,483
I'll fucking kill him.

871
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,342
Open this fucking door, Stan!

872
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,287
You're fucking dead!
Get out here!

873
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:19,316
- Piss off!
- Open the fucking door!

874
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,827
He's not fucking here.

875
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,523
Get him fucking here,
you old bastard!

876
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,226
- Fuck off, you stupid wee cunt!
- Tell him to get fucking out here!

877
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:27,666
He's not fucking here.

878
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,939
Hey, you, fuck off.

879
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,638
Away back
to your wee hovel.

880
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:41,045
You old cunt. Tell him when I get
my hands on him, he's fucking dead.

881
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,549
Fucking shut it.

882
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,517
What? Put your teeth
in your gummy old fucker.

883
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,077
Shut up.
You just try that.

884
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,783
You fucking try it
and I'll come down there.

885
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,486
Fuck off.
You fucking dare!

886
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,187
You dare!

887
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,560
See you, you cunt.

888
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,662
You stupid wee
fucking boy you!

889
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,193
See you,
you monkey wee cunt.

890
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,172
You fucking wait
'til I get a hold of you.

891
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:09,005
You stupid
wee fucking arsehole!

892
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,375
You just wait
'til I get a hold of you!

893
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,778
You skinny wee cunt you!

894
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,305
A fucking mess
you've made here!

895
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,545
No, I am all right, Mum.

896
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,350
We're just gonna stay in with Liam,
me and Chantelle.

897
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,914
He's just had a little bit
of bother today.

898
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,688
Nothing, don't worry about it.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

899
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:32,260
Mum, it's all right, don't panic.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

900
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,598
I'm fine, Mum, aye.

901
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,731
I don't need my pajamas,
I'll get some of Chantelle's.

902
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,672
- Is that all right?
- I've nothing clean.

903
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:42,676
You'll need
to get some of Liam's.

904
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,943
It's shut.
The doors are already locked.

905
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,782
Bye, Mum.

906
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,517
She's a pure
little bletherer.

907
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,251
Sounds all right.

908
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,520
She's a pure nightmare.

909
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:13,267
They'd better stop
that noise out there.

910
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,297
They're gonna wake
that wean up.

911
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,402
Who is it, Liam?

912
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,879
- Douglas.
- Who?

913
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:23,782
- Fuck me.
- Who's Douglas?

914
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,808
Nobody.
The pair of you, stay in here.

915
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,447
You'd better not be
causing trouble in my home.

916
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:29,581
Who is it?

917
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:38,888
Douglas' car, wee man.
Who's got it? Pinball's got it.

918
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:41,424
I told you
I'd get revenge on the prick.

919
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:44,597
- What the fuck are you all about?
- Fucking magic.

920
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,628
Are you fucking stupid?

921
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,006
Fuck off,
you fucking brown-nose.

922
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,068
Do you know
what you've fucking done?

923
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,671
We're fucking dead
if you don't take this back.

924
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,343
What are you talking about "we"?
You and me are no more.

925
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,910
- You're a fucking idiot.
- We'll fucking see.

926
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:03,219
Do you know who he is?
You're a daft wee fucking boy.

927
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:07,318
- Fuck off. I'm out of here.
- Fucking hold on!

928
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,663
Am I fuck.
Get out of my road.

929
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,826
Get out of my road.
I'm gone.

930
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,067
Fuck!

931
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,106
You fucking knob.
Don't fuck with me.

932
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,380
Don't you give me
a cold shower!

933
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,316
Let's go!
Come on!

934
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,316
All right, kid?

935
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,822
Look, Mr. Douglas--

936
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,448
Hi, can I get you
a coffee?

937
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,117
- Yeah, espresso.
- And for you, sir?

938
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:22,060
- The same as him, please.
- Sure.

939
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:25,725
I swear on my nephew's life
we'll pay every penny back.

940
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,257
Never mind that.

941
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:32,295
I've just bought your pizza place.
Put it in Tony's name.

942
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:35,103
- You bought Franco's?
- Aye.

943
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,633
I want you to buy
three new bikes,

944
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,341
sort out some good boys
and run the show.

945
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,243
When does your ma get out?

946
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,186
Three weeks.

947
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,953
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Fuck knows.

948
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,587
If she stays with Stan, she may as well
get a season ticket for where she is.

949
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,030
I'm trying to get
another caravan lined up.

950
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,897
Forget about it.

951
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,504
I rent out flats.

952
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:10,271
One's come free.
It's modest.

953
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,609
Nice views
over the river.

954
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:15,046
Decent neighbors.

955
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,482
You can take
your ma there.

956
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:21,079
And if it works out,
and I think it will, Liam...

957
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,851
you can buy it
over a period of time.

958
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,883
Why are you doing this?

959
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:30,453
You work for me, I take care of you.
Easy as that.

960
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,567
You can have these...

961
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,833
as soon as you take care
of that wee prick, Pinball.

962
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:43,809
Look, Mr. Douglas, he didn't know
what he was doing.

963
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,870
He's had a hard time.
His dad was a junkie.

964
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:50,076
I'm all he's got.
I'll sort it out. I swear.

965
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:53,086
He'll come and apologize
and I swear I'll pay back every penny.

966
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,678
Both of us.

967
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,418
If you can't deal with this,
you get out now.

968
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:02,824
He's like a brother to me.

969
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:06,822
Listen, an opportunity like this,
for somebody like you,

970
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,734
only comes once.

971
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:43,029
Are there any flats up here
where the junkies stay?

972
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,696
- Just the end one.
- Up there?

973
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,637
- Yeah. The end one.
- Cheers.

974
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:08,126
- Any of you seen Pinball?
- No.

975
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,926
I'm fucking serious.
Any of you know where he is, tell me.

976
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,159
We haven't seen him.

977
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,566
We haven't seen him anywhere.

978
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:20,065
Mate, wanna sign my stookie?

979
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:22,632
All of you get out.
I want a word with him.

980
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:24,644
Stay here, lads.
Don't move.

981
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,646
- Get fucking out.
- Don't move.

982
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,205
I said get the fuck
out of here.

983
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,649
Get the fuck out, all of you.
I mean it.

984
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,984
Get out.
I'm not in the fucking mood.

985
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,755
No bother.
Hold on. Wait.

986
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,922
In case somebody steals it.
Fuck's sake.

987
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,956
I'll get my jacket, too.

988
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:50,959
- See you later, pal.
- See you later, Pinball.

989
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,701
Brown-nose.
Don't move.

990
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,300
What's that
on your nose?

991
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:59,778
A speck of shite--
rich man's shite.

992
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,475
Shut the fuck up.
We need to talk.

993
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,177
Here to do me in,
are you?

994
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:07,881
Do me in, go on.
Fucking do me in, go on.

995
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:11,186
Put one arms behind my back.
I'll give you a chance.

996
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:14,023
Muhammad Al Pinball, eh?

997
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:16,586
"Fly like a butterfly,
sting like a bee."

998
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,495
We're in trouble.
Fucking calm down.

999
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,898
Put your fucking hands up.

1000
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:24,768
- Pinball, listen to me.
- You like that?

1001
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,774
Go on,
put your hands up.

1002
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:31,369
Have you got anything in here?
Any drugs?

1003
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,177
- What's this?
- Put it down.

1004
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:38,184
A blade.
What you gonna do with that?

1005
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,083
You gonna go like that?

1006
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:43,112
- And that?
- Fuck off, put it down.

1007
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,056
Put it down.

1008
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,458
So you were here to do me in.
Here you are.

1009
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,428
Take it.

1010
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,729
Are you fucking man or mouse?
Fucking take it.

1011
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:56,599
I'll help you.
Ready?

1012
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,003
The caravan...

1013
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,473
that's right,
fucking Pinball burnt it.

1014
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,533
It wasn't Stan,
it was me.

1015
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:06,136
- No way.
- Don't fucking move.

1016
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,648
I knocked a motor can
of petrol.

1017
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,843
Boom!
Up she went.

1018
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:14,410
A fucking shame so it was.
Don't fucking move.

1019
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:18,822
You fucking hurt me.
I'd have done anything for you.

1020
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:22,351
Fucking anything.
But you fucked me about, didn't you?

1021
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:25,297
You don't believe me?
Fucking get back.

1022
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,561
You want the chance now?

1023
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,762
- There you are, fucking do it.
- Fucking bastard.

1024
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:32,465
You're still not doing it?
I'll fucking do it then.

1025
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,475
Because you fucking put me
through pain. A bit of this?

1026
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,239
What the fuck
are you doing?

1027
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:41,076
Do you see
what you've done?

1028
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,945
What the fuck
are you doing?

1029
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:46,509
- Give me the knife.
- Leave it.

1030
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,816
You came to fucking
do me in.

1031
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,052
Fucking clown,
what did you do that for?

1032
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,584
My fucking pal,
and you came to do me in.

1033
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,120
You were gonna do it,
weren't you?

1034
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:06,066
Ambulance, please.
119 Mitchell Street.

1035
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,938
- Fuck your ambulance.
- Hurry up, please.

1036
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:15,210
What the fuck,
you stupid bastard!

1037
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,148
Let me see your face.

1038
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:20,483
- You were gonna do it.
- I wasn't gonna do anything.

1039
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,045
You stupid bastard.

1040
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,917
Tony-

1041
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:04,396
All right, mate.
It's been done.

1042
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,817
Two tenner bags, mate?

1043
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:06,917
- There you go.
- Cheers.

1044
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:11,425
And here's your pizza.

1045
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:28,374
Excellent, by the way.
Thanks a lot.

1046
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,144
Hi, Angela.

1047
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:36,084
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm selling pizzas.

1048
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,318
- Pizzas, aye, right.
- Honest.

1049
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,724
You're not selling pizzas,
you're selling drugs. I've seen you.

1050
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,320
- It's only pizzas.
- She's got a wee boy in there!

1051
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,092
- I'm in a hurry.
- I'm not finished with you.

1052
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,862
You know she's got a wee boy.
Do you know what you're doing to her?

1053
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:51,632
You're scum, that's what you are,
and I'll be doing something about it.

1054
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,023
I've got some news.

1055
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,427
- I came first in my test.
- You did?

1056
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:17,930
Brilliant.

1057
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,592
I've got myself
a wee job in the call center.

1058
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,967
- That's great, sis. I'm proud of you.
- It's only part time, mind.

1059
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:28,668
And Suzanne's mum's gonna help me
with Calum. I'm dead chuffed.

1060
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:36,675
See that guy we sell the fags for?
He rents out flats as well.

1061
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:40,117
He's really pleased the way
I'm running the pizza shop.

1062
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:42,985
He's offered me a flat
for when mum comes out.

1063
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:47,221
Right.
That's great.

1064
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,353
It's what you've always wanted.

1065
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:53,594
It's got everything in it--
new washing machine, central heating.

1066
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:58,968
There's plenty of room for you
and Calum as well.

1067
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:06,037
Why don't you just give her
one more chance?

1068
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:12,149
She didn't want me.
She didn't want you.

1069
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:14,653
She was only a wee lassie then.

1070
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:17,316
- And nothing's changed.
- You're not giving her a chance.

1071
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:20,758
How many chances
has a wean got to give?

1072
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,827
Your problem is
you're far too hard on her.

1073
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,663
- She's desperate to see Calum.
- You're lying!

1074
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:33,730
I got a set of keys
cut for you.

1075
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,139
These are yours.

1076
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,314
Come on.

1077
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,341
I don't know.

1078
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:49,321
What's holding you back?

1079
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,346
I'm scared.

1080
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,919
I know you think
it's for the best.

1081
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,862
It is for the best.
A new start for all of us--

1082
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,923
you and Calum away from here
and my mum out of jail.

1083
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:06,005
I don't know.

1084
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,890
Open the door.

1085
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,925
I didn't mean
to upset you.

1086
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,397
I'm just thinking
of you and Calum.

1087
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,068
Come on,
open the door.

1088
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,797
No, I'm all right.

1089
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:40,806
- Please open the door.
- No.

1090
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,977
I'll give you a cuddle.

1091
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,774
- So, what time is she due out?
- Half 10:00.

1092
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:36,059
Hello?

1093
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,530
All right, Tony.
How are you doing?

1094
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:41,591
Aye.
Did you see Stan for us?

1095
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:47,165
Are you sure that cunt's
not gonna turn up?

1096
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:50,802
Cheers, Tony.
I appreciate it.

1097
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:53,972
All right, mate.
Ta. See you.

1098
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,640
It's a long time since
I've been down this side of town.

1099
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:35,052
- You better get used to it.
- What are you talking about?

1100
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:37,522
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

1101
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:39,957
You'll find out when we get there.

1102
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,592
Do you know
where we're going, driver?

1103
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:46,963
Don't ask me.
My lips are sealed.

1104
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:50,834
- Liam, where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

1105
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,772
Who lives here?

1106
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:00,269
Just opposite
this set of stairs.

1107
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:03,444
This is brilliant.

1108
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,786
Here we are.

1109
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,795
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1110
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:24,099
Go on, just open it.

1111
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,709
Have a look.

1112
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,789
I still think
you're kidding me.

1113
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:50,690
I'll show you
the kitchen.

1114
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:57,265
Built-in oven
with microwave.

1115
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:02,501
Dishwasher.
Very nice.

1116
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,136
Very classy.

1117
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,544
Balcony.

1118
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,182
Imagine this
in the summer, Mum.

1119
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,742
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1120
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:17,180
Let's see the bedroom.

1121
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,597
Your dressing-table.

1122
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:31,536
Your ensuite bathroom
just through there.

1123
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,838
A bathroom in my bedroom.

1124
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:40,573
- And a shower.
- Like it?

1125
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,342
I don't know what to say.

1126
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:45,010
Don't need to say anything.
It's all yours.

1127
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,281
Does Stan know
about this?

1128
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,945
Give a big warm welcome back
for wee Jean.

1129
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:26,948
We've all missed her
very much.

1130
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,291
So, Jean,
this is a song from me.

1131
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:33,288
A big one from Robbie Williams,
"Let Me Entertain You."

1132
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:43,570
- Any sign of Stan?
- No. I've not seen him.

1133
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,407
- Keep an eye out for him.
- I will. Aye.

1134
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:14,104
- You look nice.
- I know.

1135
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:16,267
Cheers for coming.

1136
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,709
- How are you, young man?
- Watch your fingers.

1137
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:21,680
- Looking smart.
- Where have we to go?

1138
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:25,013
In here?
Oh, look, there's Suzanne.

1139
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:31,689
Chantelle, you came.
Thanks, love.

1140
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,714
It's good to see you.

1141
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:36,957
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

1142
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:38,986
Look at your lovely suit.

1143
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,834
Come to see your granny, Cal?

1144
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:47,863
We don't call him Cal.
His name's Calum.

1145
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:51,035
- What do you mean?
- His name's Calum.

1146
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,544
Do you want
a little drink?

1147
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,607
"You Stole the Sun
from My Heart."

1148
01:32:57,638 --> 01:33:00,642
Come on,
I wanna see you all dancing.

1149
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:09,093
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

1150
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:11,619
Good.
It's nice to see you again.

1151
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:13,689
- How have you been?
- All right.

1152
01:33:57,898 --> 01:34:01,072
- Is he asleep?
- That's him asleep now.

1153
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,742
No point disturbing him.
You should just stay the night.

1154
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:07,048
It's a shame to wake him.
We'll stay.

1155
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:36,177
- Morning.
- Morning.

1156
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:39,912
- What are you doing up so early?
- You're just up late.

1157
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,325
- Where's Calum?
- He's still in bed.

1158
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,297
All the excitement last night
must have tired him out.

1159
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:58,962
My head's fucking pounding.
Are you gonna stick the kettle on?

1160
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,517
Is Mum up yet?

1161
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,793
What's wrong with you?

1162
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:29,193
She's gone.

1163
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:35,030
Wee walk will do her good.
Think she had one too many last night.

1164
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:37,975
No, Liam, she's gone.

1165
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:42,003
Gone where she normally goes,
the same usual as always.

1166
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:53,184
Liam, calm down.

1167
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,894
This is your fucking doing.
What did you say to her?

1168
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:04,232
I never said nothing to her.

1169
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:07,137
- Get out of my fucking way.
- Calm down!

1170
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:14,538
Where's my fucking other shoe?

1171
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:16,912
Liam, let her go.

1172
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:20,714
She'll drive you mad.
Let her go, for Christ's sake.

1173
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:22,482
Listen to me.

1174
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:26,083
It's not that she doesn't care.
She can't care.

1175
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:28,320
She's a fucking crazy
mixed-up lost soul

1176
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:30,454
and she's gonna ruin you too.

1177
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:34,227
I saw you talking to her last night.
What were you saying to her?

1178
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:38,260
- If you drove her back to Stan--
- Drove her back to Stan?

1179
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:42,570
If it's not Stan, it'll be somebody else
and somebody else!

1180
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:44,576
I've never seen her
as happy as last night.

1181
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:46,578
Stop lying to yourself, Liam.

1182
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,103
Where's my fucking trainer?

1183
01:36:57,244 --> 01:37:00,657
- Give me my shoe.
- Liam, calm down.

1184
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:02,683
- Give me my fucking shoe.
- Please, Liam.

1185
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:06,459
- It's me that cares for you.
- So that's your fucking game?

1186
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:08,592
- Worming your way in here.
- We need you.

1187
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:10,624
Your twisted fucking lies
drive my ma away.

1188
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,695
I'm not like that!

1189
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:15,570
You've never liked her.
Never gave her a fucking chance!

1190
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:17,940
I gave her too many chances,
you know that.

1191
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:20,241
"We don't call him that.
His name's Calum"--

1192
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:22,304
rubbing her face in it
in front of everybody.

1193
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,213
Liam, listen to you!

1194
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,912
- What did you say to her?
- I never said nothing.

1195
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:29,046
Just give me the fucking trainer.

1196
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:32,548
Give me the trainer
before I'll do something I'll regret.

1197
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,685
- Go on, then.
- Don't make me do it.

1198
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:38,492
Go! Just like Granddad,
like our fathers! Like Stan!

1199
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,692
Like all the other losers
destroying everything they touch.

1200
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:42,598
Like our mum!
Join the club.

1201
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:45,263
Be one of them,
because that's what you are!

1202
01:37:47,795 --> 01:37:49,866
Liam, don't!

1203
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:53,435
You fucking poisoned wee cow!

1204
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:56,641
I fucking swear to God.
Look at me.

1205
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,412
By the time I get back,
you'd better be out of here.

1206
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,784
Do you hear me?

1207
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:34,714
- Are you on?
- Aye.

1208
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:37,222
Gilmore Street, Greenock, pal.

1209
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:13,949
Where's my ma?

1210
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:16,928
What the fuck you want here?
You wanna see your ma?

1211
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,431
Big man here,
the boy's come to see you.

1212
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,831
What are you doing here?

1213
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:26,827
- You come for another hit?
- No, that's not it.

1214
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:31,102
- Mum, let's go.
- I can't.

1215
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:34,601
Never mind what he,
Chantelle or anybody says.

1216
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:37,275
- This is so sad.
- It's just me and you, Mum.

1217
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:40,114
- Son, you don't understand.
- Nothing matters, come on.

1218
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,586
I can't.

1219
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:44,452
- Fuck's sake.
- Stan, don't.

1220
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:47,015
Don't be scared of him.
He can't hurt us anymore.

1221
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:50,893
Come on.
Where's your bag?

1222
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:53,330
Fucking hell!

1223
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:56,301
- Liam, come here.
- You're wasting your time, son.

1224
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:58,701
- Shut up.
- You wanna get him fucking told?

1225
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:01,002
- You keep winding him up.
- Telling me to shut up?

1226
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:03,668
- Come storming in here--
- Come on, Mum.

1227
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:05,267
I can't.

1228
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:08,143
- I've got a flat. It's a fresh start for us.
- I can't.

1229
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:11,706
Chantelle's gone. I've got rid of her.
It's just me and you.

1230
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:14,015
Do you think your mother wants
to fucking move in with you?

1231
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:16,749
- You make her fucking stomach turn.
- Shut up.

1232
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:19,986
Liam, go on.
I'll come and see you later. Please.

1233
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:23,928
- Come on, Mum, let's go.
- I can't. You don't understand?

1234
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:26,761
Say bye-bye to your mother.
You know what you can do, son.

1235
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:28,926
- Leave him.
- Fucking sit down!

1236
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:31,994
- Don't talk to my mum like that.
- Send one of your fucking little tapes.

1237
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,506
"Mummy, I love you..."

1238
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:38,340
Tell him about the caravan.
What did you say about the caravan?

1239
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:41,403
"A field in the middle
of nowhere. Great, eh?"

1240
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:44,473
- It wasn't like that. Don't listen.
- It was like that.

1241
01:40:44,505 --> 01:40:48,009
Tell him what you fucking mean.
Tell him the fucking truth, Jean.

1242
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,988
That is the truth, son.

1243
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,012
And your silly wee fucking house?

1244
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,822
Think you're fucking going up
in the world in fucking Gourock,

1245
01:40:54,848 --> 01:40:57,852
with a view across the Clyde?
I won't shut up.

1246
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:01,958
I love you. He doesn't love you.
I need you, Mum.

1247
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,764
"I love you."

1248
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,362
Well, I love your ma
and she loves me.

1249
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:08,669
Get that through
your fucking thick head.

1250
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:10,231
There's the fucking door.
Now leave!

1251
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:13,006
- Stop it!
- Do as you're told, pal.

1252
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:15,411
Fucking leave, son.
Fucking little bastard, you.

1253
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:19,418
What are you doing?

1254
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,147
- Liam!
- Bastard!

1255
01:41:21,175 --> 01:41:24,645
What have you done?
Stop it!

1256
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:28,385
What have you done?

1257
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,292
Liam! Stop it!

1258
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:32,263
Fucking look at me!

1259
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:37,062
No, stop it!

1260
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,368
- I'll kill the cunt.
- What have you done?

1261
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:42,931
Oh my God!

1262
01:41:44,998 --> 01:41:48,002
Get a fucking ambulance.

1263
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:51,881
The fucking bastard
stabbed me!

1264
01:42:40,787 --> 01:42:43,495
Hi, Liam.

1265
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:46,937
It's Chantelle.
Are you okay?

1266
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:50,999
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

1267
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:54,401
Is it true?

1268
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:59,547
Everybody's looking for you.
The police have been round.

1269
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,650
What a waste.

1270
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:09,092
What a waste.

1271
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:12,290
It's your birthday. You're 16.
Did you know that?

1272
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,490
What are you gonna do?

1273
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,507
My batteries are running down.

1274
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,773
I love you, Liam.
