1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:03,365
<i>Previously
on "Wayward Pines"...</i>

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,468
<i>You didn't think Wayward Pines
ran itself, did you?</i>

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:11,507
Hey. Who are
all of these people?

4
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,975
Volunteers.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,710
We were changing the world,
and, as a result...

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:15,911
Oh!

7
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:18,313
...we, ourselves,
were beginning to change.

8
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:24,319
Testing cryonic suspension was
both dangerous and illegal.

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:26,321
- They're all asleep.
- Yes.

10
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:28,524
This isn't a little town,
Ethan.

11
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:29,525
This is
a new civilization.

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,193
You have to
tell them the truth.

13
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,661
People are fragile.

14
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:34,629
They need time to adapt.

15
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:37,198
Young minds are fearless.

16
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,000
Welcome
to the First Generation.

17
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:40,669
They're less ingrained
in the old world.

18
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:42,671
They can accept the truth.

19
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:43,972
There's a new threat.

20
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,840
We don't know
who they are,

21
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,342
but they're gonna take down
the fence.

22
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:49,544
If they succeed...

23
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:51,179
They're not
going to succeed.

24
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:55,416
It's ready.

25
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:02,122
Ethan.

26
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:04,458
It is imperative
you tell no one about

27
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:07,460
what you've seen
and what you've heard.

28
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:10,130
I believe
the survival of humanity

29
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,666
may well be
in our hands.

30
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,425
Ethan.

31
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,259
When did you get back?

32
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:42,929
Have you been sitting here
all night?

33
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:45,098
Please tell me
you found something.

34
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:46,866
We have got to get back
to Seattle.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,434
I cannot get ahold
of anybody.

36
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,103
Mom's surgery is
on Wednesday.

37
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:53,606
Theresa, Theresa.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,875
There is no Seattle.

39
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,579
What are you
talking about?

40
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,853
Look.

41
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:10,723
When we were pulled
from those car wrecks...

42
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:16,527
...we weren't taken
directly here.

43
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:19,397
We were put into
some kind of a...

44
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,234
suspended animation.

45
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,570
What happened to
your arm?

46
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,740
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

47
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:34,211
But there's these creatures
out there...

48
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,881
monsters.

49
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:39,884
I saw them
with my own eyes.

50
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:43,220
Cities destroyed.

51
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:46,056
This...

52
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:49,927
this fake little town
is all that's left.

53
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:54,064
Ethan, what did they do
to you?

54
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,234
What did they do
to you?

55
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,903
Did they take you back
to the hospital?

56
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,905
No.

57
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,239
I need you to
try to remember

58
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:04,741
if they did
anything to you,

59
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,611
- if they injected you with something.
- You don't believe me.

60
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,780
- Are you sure?
- I wasn't at the hospital!

61
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:17,987
4,028?

62
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:20,656
Now, what... Okay,
what does this mean?

63
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:22,758
That's the date.

64
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:27,263
Ethan.

65
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,009
What's wrong?

66
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,279
It's the starter.

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,084
This might take a while.
You guys should walk.

68
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:53,155
Okay.

69
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,990
Sure.

70
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,358
Let's go.

71
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,864
Oh. Sorry, sorry.

72
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:46,785

_

74
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:30,240
Good morning,
Mr. Burke.

75
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:33,076
Can I help you
with something, Pam?

76
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:36,679
No, but I think I can help <i>you
with something.</i>

77
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:38,882
Really?

78
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:43,053
Oh. Franklin Dobbs.

79
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,189
Do you think he's involved
with these subversives?

80
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:48,858
I don't know.

81
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,361
But when I find out the answer
to that question,

82
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:53,496
you'll be
the first to know.

83
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,164
Until then,
I've got to do my job,

84
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,333
so if you don't mind...

85
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,003
No, I don't mind.
Go ahead. Do your job.

86
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,938
I'm just here to help.

87
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,375
I would do anything
for my brother.

88
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,545
Even work hand-in-hand
with you.

89
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,047
So, how about it?

90
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,882
You can't do this alone.
You need some help.

91
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,053
I can be
a very good friend.

92
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,526
How about giving me access
to the surveillance system

93
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,562
so I can see
what Franklin's been up to?

94
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,934
S... I kind of thought
we had moved past

95
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:35,604
this whole
"walk your kid to school" thing.

96
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:40,175
I just wanted to spend time
with you, if that's all right.

97
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,280
Everything okay?

98
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,615
Yeah.

99
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,318
You ever miss Seattle?

100
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,955
I don't really think
about it.

101
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:54,989
Really?

102
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:58,326
Not even camping
with your cousins

103
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,760
or playing with Stanley?

104
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:02,597
Stanley.

105
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:06,100
We're not supposed to
think about the past.

106
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,902
Right.

107
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,104
Good morning.

108
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:12,974
Good morning,
Dr. Jenkins.

109
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:17,611
Hey.

110
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:20,447
I like it here, Mom.
I have friends.

111
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,282
I like school.

112
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:23,950
You'd probably like it,
too,

113
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,786
if you gave it
half a chance.

114
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,655
Okay, well, I'm glad things
are working out for you.

115
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:31,658
Good morning, guys.

116
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,827
Nice to see you,
Theresa.

117
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:34,928
Hi.

118
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,097
Hey, Ben.
Mrs. Burke.

119
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:40,433
Amy, will you help Ben
find a biology textbook?

120
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,435
There's a big stack of them
behind my desk.

121
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,338
Yeah, sure.
Come on.

122
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,008
You know,
I have not set foot

123
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,708
inside that school
or your classroom.

124
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:50,809
Is there a tour

125
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,311
or a parent/teacher
conference coming up?

126
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:54,313
School is for children,
Theresa,

127
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,115
not their parents.

128
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,519
Your job is to feed them
and keep them safe.

129
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:00,853
Let us do the rest.

130
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,189
Oh, that's my cue.

131
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,857
Nice to see you.

132
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:10,495
Yeah,
it looks really bad.

133
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:47,489
I want to thank you
for coming down, Franklin.

134
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,725
As the new Sheriff
in town,

135
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,060
I'm making a point
of getting to know

136
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,896
all the shopkeepers
on Main Street.

137
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,397
Never really had

138
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:58,567
a "get to know you" meeting
with Sheriff Pope.

139
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:06,408
Franklin, we don't talk
about the past here.

140
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,910
You know that.

141
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,913
Lighten up, Franklin.

142
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,815
I'm just messing
with you.

143
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:15,049
Oh.

144
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:18,552
But, listen, I did have
something of a personal nature

145
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:21,089
that I'd like to discuss
with you.

146
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,725
Gophers.

147
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:28,997
- Gophers?
- Yeah, that's right.

148
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,833
They're destroying
my lawn.

149
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,001
And I remember looking
through your file one day

150
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,969
and it said that
you worked in, uh...

151
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:39,039
explosive demolition.

152
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:42,310
Hmm.

153
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:49,183
Afraid I c-can't help you,
Sheriff.

154
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,018
Yeah,
I should really be

155
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:52,786
getting back
to the shop.

156
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:54,822
So...

157
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,644
Open your books to page 17.

158
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:23,950
Go ahead and look
at all the pictures.

159
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:28,520
Giggle if you want.

160
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,189
For obvious reasons,

161
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:34,460
your textbooks
will remain here in class.

162
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:39,465
Parents tend to be uncomfortable
with these sorts of images.

163
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:43,469
Even biology can be
misunderstood.

164
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,804
The point is,

165
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,811
procreation is
a beautiful and blessed thing.

166
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,813
And here in Wayward Pines,

167
00:12:54,848 --> 00:13:02,153
that really is
your most important job.

168
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:05,023
Ben, Amy.

169
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:07,658
Would you step up front,
please?

170
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,364
Come on, quickly.

171
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:21,038
Ahh. Behold,
the male and the female.

172
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:24,542
Two bodies,
beautifully designed

173
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:30,580
to fit together
effortlessly, seamlessly.

174
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:35,085
Two perfect puzzle pieces,
like hand in glove.

175
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:39,256
Yes, yes, it's embarrassing
to talk about.

176
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,258
But what if...

177
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:45,129
what if Ben was a bee
and Amy was a flower?

178
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:49,833
Well, that wouldn't be funny
at all, would it?

179
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:57,340
Wayward Pines needs
a new generation.

180
00:13:57,374 --> 00:14:01,678
And one day,
not too long from now,

181
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:07,750
you all will have the honor of
parenting the first generation

182
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:13,756
of 100% originals.

183
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,425
Now, take a look
around the room.

184
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,428
This is a small town.
Right?

185
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:24,099
Chances are, your mate...
your co-parent

186
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,602
is sitting right here
in this room.

187
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,439
And it's part of my job
as your teacher and counselor

188
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:33,776
to help you
find each other.

189
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,947
You two may sit down.

190
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,726
That was weird.

191
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,204
Ah, there you are!

192
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:04,506
Nurse,
could you give me

193
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,474
a moment alone
with Dr. Jenkins, please?

194
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:07,475
Thank you.

195
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,811
Wonderful news.

196
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:14,281
You know, I'm doing my annual
fertility consults this morning.

197
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:18,619
And already,
two new pregnancies.

198
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:21,622
Imagine.

199
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:26,026
Two new members
of our First Generation.

200
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,663
That is wonderful.

201
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:33,567
David, what is it?

202
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,905
Why are they
trying to undermine us?

203
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:38,906
Is it inevitable,

204
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,841
this... passion
for self-destruction?

205
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,743
Have you eaten today?

206
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,914
Pam...
is it happening again?

207
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,750
You always
get like this.

208
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,420
You worry so,
and you forget to eat.

209
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,422
Then once
your blood sugar drops,

210
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:59,091
the whole world
looks gloomy, hmm?

211
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,930
Ethan Burke will ferret out
these troublemakers.

212
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,600
Sheriff Burke
will get us through

213
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,070
this present difficulty.

214
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,905
That's very generous
of you.

215
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,074
Oh,
you believe in him.

216
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,277
I believe in him.

217
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,447
Dr. Jenkins?
Wayne Johnson is here.

218
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,449
Oh.
Thank you, Nurse.

219
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,452
Back to work.

220
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,920
Great news
about the pregnancies.

221
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,289
Oh, indeed.

222
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,545
Just be careful.

223
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,714
- All right, great.
- Okay.

224
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,083
- For sure.
- Yeah. Byebye.

225
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,821
Morning, Ethan.

226
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:06,090
Friend of yours?

227
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,758
Oh, Franklin?

228
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,760
Yeah. I mean,
you know, it's a small town.

229
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,562
Yeah, you guys have been
seeing a lot of each other.

230
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,398
I'm gonna need you
to come with me

231
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,401
so we can talk more...
privately.

232
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,504
Sure, what about?

233
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,473
About the damn bomb
in my truck, Harold.

234
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,810
I-I don't know anything
about this.

235
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,313
Okay.

236
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,848
Well,
let's go to my office,

237
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:34,184
and you can tell me about
what you don't know.

238
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,928
All right, let's go.

239
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:57,606
Don't make me subdue you
again, Harold.

240
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,941
Next time,
I won't be so gentle.

241
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:04,026
It's okay, folks.
He tripped and fell.

242
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:05,534
Let's go.

243
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:16,879
Franklin made the bomb,

244
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:19,715
and you or somebody
who works for you

245
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,351
planted it
in my truck.

246
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:24,020
I swear, I don't know anything
about a bomb in your truck.

247
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:27,023
But you know about the other
bombs that Franklin made...

248
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:29,525
the ones that are
still out there.

249
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,027
'Cause that's what this is
all about, isn't it?

250
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:35,698
You want to take down
the fence.

251
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:38,367
Don't you
want to get out?

252
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,871
Just go somewhere,
anywhere?

253
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:45,540
There is no somewhere,
no anywhere.

254
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:48,377
I want names...

255
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,713
...of everybody
in your group,

256
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:54,049
starting
with your leader.

257
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:56,352
Who is he?

258
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,321
Or maybe it's a she.

259
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,865
There's no one else.

260
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,200
- Really?
- I acted alone.

261
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,803
- You acted alone?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:15,837
So that means that

263
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,839
you <i>did</i> plant the bomb
in my truck,

264
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:20,174
and you were lying about it
when you denied it,

265
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,177
but you're telling me
the truth now, is that it?

266
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,513
Great.

267
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,726
Okay.

268
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,895
Give this to Kate.

269
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,930
You can go now.

270
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,501
Um, I don't understand.
I confessed.

271
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,170
Yeah, I got it.

272
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,871
You can go.

273
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:07,020
Morning, beautiful.

274
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,855
Sorry I'm late.

275
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:12,191
I wish I could blame it
on the traffic.

276
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,694
But somehow, I don't think
that'll fly.

277
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,029
Good morning.

278
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:17,697
You seem like
you're in a great mood.

279
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,832
Hey.
Crispy like a cracker.

280
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:22,301
I passed by that lot
this morning, Plot 33?

281
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,970
And I think
I found something.

282
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,705
There appears to be
a substructure of some kind

283
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,541
underneath the soil.

284
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,276
It felt like metal.

285
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,011
Oh, well,
a water tank, maybe.

286
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:36,014
Y... But it's buried in
an empty lot, Bill, that...

287
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,850
Life's full of mysteries,

288
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:41,219
all chock-full
of head scratchers.

289
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,722
I wouldn't think about it
too much.

290
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:48,393
Besides, you really shouldn't
snoop around out there.

291
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,962
And why is that?

292
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:58,536
The secret to
a safe and happy town

293
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,539
is everyone minding
their own business.

294
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:05,310
People need to do
what they're supposed to.

295
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,479
And not do
what they're not.

296
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:09,013
Right.

297
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,516
Now, uh, I need you to go down
to the hospital a bit

298
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,518
and pick up some files
for me.

299
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:17,187
If... if you're not
too busy.

300
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:30,834
I got your note.

301
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:33,170
I came
as soon as I could.

302
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:36,106
Good. Come on in.

303
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:39,610
Here, sit down.

304
00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:40,777
Don't worry.

305
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:44,080
I disabled
all the surveillance in here.

306
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:46,216
I thought you didn't care
about that.

307
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,885
It's not for <i>my</i> safety.

308
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,054
Coffee?

309
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:54,057
I heard about the bomb
in your truck.

310
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,559
You have to believe me.
I-I don't know who did that.

311
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:58,227
Good.

312
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:02,231
But you can figure out who did,
can't you?

313
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:05,067
Because
you're their leader.

314
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,969
What if I was?

315
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,972
Come on, Kate!
Of course you are.

316
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:11,574
Look, Harold was
an accountant.

317
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,643
If there's anybody leading
a resistance in this town,

318
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,645
it's not Harold,

319
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,981
so who else is involved
in this group?

320
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:22,617
This group is the only thing
that's kept me sane here.

321
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:25,453
How long
have you been active?

322
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:29,124
It evolved over time.

323
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,827
We started
as something else.

324
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:35,731
Just a few of us
trying to connect.

325
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:38,400
We'd meet in secret,

326
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,435
just to be real
with each other.

327
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:43,638
Uh...

328
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:48,643
Kate Hewson,
um, Seattle.

329
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:52,647
I miss the ferry boats,
oysters,

330
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:55,649
hiking Burroughs Trail.

331
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:58,019
My friends.

332
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,992
I'm, uh... I'm...
I'm Franklin.

333
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:08,029
Uh...

334
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,132
It's all you, man.

335
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,903
Harold Ballinger, St. Paul.

336
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,572
Um...

337
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,274
I have a fiancée.

338
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:31,118
How come you didn't
tell me any of this

339
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:33,186
when I first got here?

340
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:36,189
Ethan, I've been trapped here
for 12 years.

341
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:39,025
Try and imagine
what that's like.

342
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,193
And then you show up.

343
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:42,028
And a week later,
you're Sheriff?

344
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:44,297
All right, look,
it stops now.

345
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:47,667
Why would I stop trying to
escape this prison?

346
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:54,173
Look, the world
that you and I knew,

347
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:57,243
the world outside the fence,
that no longer exists.

348
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,912
It's not 2014.

349
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:03,382
It's not... It's not even
the 21st century anymore.

350
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:06,051
What... What do you mean,

351
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:09,021
it's not
the 21st century anymore?

352
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:17,396
Hey.

353
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:19,395
- Good class today.
- Oh, thanks, Amy.

354
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,396
Yeah.

355
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:22,698
You and Ben look so nice
together.

356
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:24,233
How is that working out?

357
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:26,568
It's great, actually.

358
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:29,739
I really like him.
Like, a lot.

359
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:31,240
Oh, I'm so glad.

360
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:34,143
As a teacher,
it's so fulfilling

361
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:37,146
when an assignment
turns into something more.

362
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,982
Yeah, he's sweet.
Kind of shy.

363
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:42,484
I don't think
he's had much experience.

364
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,156
You might be
his first real girlfriend.

365
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,823
I was thinking of

366
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:53,495
maybe asking him out
later tonight.

367
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,830
Go some place secluded
and romantic.

368
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:57,165
Mm.

369
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,167
I just... I feel like

370
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:04,172
I'm ready for us
to be more... intimate.

371
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:07,142
He's not
pressuring you?

372
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:09,144
Ben?

373
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:10,812
Oh, God, no.

374
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:13,314
I just hope I don't
have to pressure him.

375
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:15,816
I'm so happy for you.

376
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,151
Enjoy this moment.

377
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,587
There's nothing like
being young and in love.

378
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:29,463
So, let me
get this straight.

379
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:30,798
Whoever's
behind all this,

380
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:32,966
the people up there
pulling the strings,

381
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:35,602
you work for them now?

382
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:44,845
Hand over whoever it was that
planted the bomb in my truck,

383
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,680
surrender your arms
and explosives

384
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:47,847
by tomorrow morning,

385
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,017
and everything
stays between us.

386
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,052
You can't take down
that fence.

387
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,724
Okay.

388
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,782
You were right.

389
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,619
They got to Ethan.

390
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,887
We have to advance
the timetable.

391
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,057
He knows about us,
knows about Franklin.

392
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,394
Exactly. We have
a very narrow window.

393
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,262
And we're not gonna get
a second chance.

394
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,031
We have to
tell everyone.

395
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,868
We execute tonight.

396
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,144
Ballinger Toys.

397
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:55,980
Oh. H-Hello, Pam.

398
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,315
Of course.

399
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,651
Uh, it slipped my mind
completely.

400
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,288
We've been backlogged
with orders and...

401
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,791
I-Is it... is it possible
to reschedule?

402
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,126
Of course, I-I understand
the importance.

403
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,663
Uh, we'll be right over.
All right, then.

404
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,735
It's our annual
fertility consult.

405
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,737
Of course it is.

406
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,275
There's no point
in making her suspicious.

407
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,112
So...

408
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,750
We have a married couple...

409
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,920
young, fertile,
in their prime...

410
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:41,425
and yet, somehow...
not pregnant.

411
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,928
Yeah.

412
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,996
I don't understand it.

413
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:48,832
Your lab work is all good.

414
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:51,000
- There's no problem with the sperm count.
- Good.

415
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:54,971
And you.
Periods regular?

416
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:59,074
- Everything is in working order. Hmm.
- Hmm.

417
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,050
Well, thanks so much
for coming in.

418
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,023
You know,

419
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:18,026
I've always thought
so highly of the two of you,

420
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:20,528
ever since
I introduced you.

421
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:22,230
Hmm.

422
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:24,899
I mean,
what a blend of genetics.

423
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,068
The perfect Wayward Pines
couple.

424
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:29,303
Hmm. Don't let me down.

425
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:31,406
<i>Pharmacy, pick up 512.</i>

426
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,742
<i>Pharmacy, pick up 512.</i>

427
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:36,410
How much time do you need
to gather the team?

428
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:38,479
Whatever
you can give me.

429
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:39,613
And get with Ted

430
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,916
and set the backup plan
in motion.

431
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,751
Wait.

432
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:45,753
Do you think
we need both?

433
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:48,327
We're only gonna get
one shot.

434
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,397
Kate.

435
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:20,666
Do you have a minute?

436
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:24,770
I'm very worried
about Ethan.

437
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:29,241
- Come on.
- Okay.

438
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,944
Did he tell you
the story

439
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,946
about it being 2,000 years
in the future?

440
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,113
How the world
is destroyed,

441
00:29:35,147 --> 00:29:37,148
and we're
the only humans left?

442
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:40,151
What is going on?

443
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:41,653
I don't know,

444
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,822
but I think they have some way
of brainwashing people

445
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:46,157
up on that mountain.

446
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,325
- Now, I...
- Kate, there's more.

447
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,995
The week
after I got here,

448
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,963
I finally found a phone
that worked.

449
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,466
I called a secure line
belonging to the Service,

450
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,434
and Agent Hassler
left me a message.

451
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:57,435
- Adam Hassler?
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,569
What did he say?

453
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:01,739
That I was entering
a government experiment.

454
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:04,542
That I should lay low,
blend in,

455
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:07,512
and that I may be
severely tested,

456
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:09,680
possibly
by another agent.

457
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:11,148
You think
that Ethan is...

458
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:13,818
I don't know,
but I can't rule it out.

459
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,486
Theresa,
you know Hassler.

460
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,822
He is nothing
if not a straight shooter.

461
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,689
How much of this
have you told Ethan?

462
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:23,527
I haven't, and I'm not sure
it's a good idea to.

463
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,398
I really have to go.

464
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:37,340
You're a good person,
Theresa.

465
00:30:37,374 --> 00:30:42,012
And I wish we had met
under different circumstances.

466
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:44,480
I'm so sorry.

467
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:49,385
Ethan,
we're worried about you.

468
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,220
You're worried
about me?

469
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,388
Yes.

470
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:55,091
What, you think this
is all in my head?

471
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,426
What do you think?

472
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,595
You think, uh,
I was brainwashed?

473
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:02,465
I saw stuff out there, Theresa.
I'm not making this up.

474
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,200
Everything I told you
is true.

475
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,602
But you're telling me
that everything is gone.

476
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:09,772
Except us.

477
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:12,107
And I want to keep it
that way.

478
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:15,444
So please, tell me.
What else did she say?

479
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:16,912
She told me not to tell you
anything,

480
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:19,748
and then she left.

481
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:22,084
She was very emotional
when she said goodbye,

482
00:31:22,118 --> 00:31:25,020
like it was
a permanent goodbye.

483
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:29,357
Where's Ben?

484
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:30,892
He's at school.

485
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:34,129
Okay,
I'm gonna go get him.

486
00:31:34,163 --> 00:31:37,332
I think
they're planning something.

487
00:31:39,635 --> 00:31:41,936
Hey,
so I was thinking.

488
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:43,437
How about later tonight,

489
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:46,440
you and I sneak out
for a walk in the woods?

490
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:49,110
Isn't that
against the rules?

491
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:51,779
Well, there are rules,
and then there are <i>rules.</i>

492
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:54,448
There's a sweet spot
I've been meaning to show you.

493
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:58,952
It's like a little meadow
up in the trees.

494
00:31:58,987 --> 00:32:01,021
How will we get there?

495
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,427
I have a plan.

496
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:10,063
Meet me after dinner?
Corner of Birch and 9th?

497
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:13,234
Yeah, sure.

498
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:16,737
It was fun
in class today, huh?

499
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:17,871
I don't understand

500
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:21,041
why people get so nervous
talking about biology.

501
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:23,376
Yeah, I... Yeah,
I know, right?

502
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,245
It's just nature.

503
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,081
Ben!

504
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:29,249
One second.

505
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:32,418
What?

506
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,887
Look, I'm gonna need you
to come home.

507
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,890
I'm kind of busy
right now.

508
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,325
Oh. Hi!

509
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,327
I'll explain it to you
in the car.

510
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:43,663
- Say goodbye.
- Come on, Dad.

511
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,965
Amy, I-I'm terribly sorry,
but Ben's got to come home.

512
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,134
- Okay.
- H-He'll talk to you later.

513
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,169
Go ahead.
Say goodbye.

514
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:55,574
Sorry.
I got to go.

515
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:58,210
It's okay.
Meet me later.

516
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,753
I just need to know,

517
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,660
did you put that pipe bomb
in the Sheriff's truck

518
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,995
this morning?

519
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,965
Damn it, Ted.

520
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,801
The last thing we need is
him breathing down our necks.

521
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:30,135
We're not murderers.

522
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,305
Why not?
They murder.

523
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:35,875
You've been to
your share of reckonings.

524
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:43,715
Do you want me to do this
or not?

525
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:30,594
Second camera
just went out at Cell 33.

526
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:34,264
No, it's Kate.
She's trying to throw us off.

527
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:42,272
In about 10 minutes,
the guards circle around.

528
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:45,108
And once that fence is breached,
there's no turning back.

529
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:47,310
They'll be on us...
fast.

530
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,116
Where are
the blind spots?

531
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:56,286
There's one at Zone 41,
right at the fence.

532
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,454
Almost there.

533
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:59,789
So if anyone's
having second thoughts,

534
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:01,557
now is the time to go,
all right?

535
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:02,625
Okay, that's it.

536
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,593
Everybody stay
right where you are!

537
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:06,595
- Down on the ground!
- Ethan!

538
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,430
I'm not letting you
blow up that fence.

539
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:11,600
Get down on the ground.

540
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,936
Okay, Franklin,

541
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,072
disarm that bomb.

542
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:19,642
Don't do it.

543
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:22,311
Disarm the bomb,
or she's dead.

544
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:23,646
No.

545
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,748
No, Franklin.

546
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:34,556
No.

547
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:54,175
I trusted you.
Let's go.

548
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,980
Come on, on your feet.
Let's go.

549
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,138
We had a deal, Kate.

550
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:27,307
They did something
to you, Ethan.

551
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:30,310
You just don't know it.
You'll see very soon.

552
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,312
We will be back in Seattle,
overlooking that bay.

553
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:36,149
Seattle? No, forget it, Kate.
That's not gonna happen.

554
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:41,154
You've got to convince these
people to stop this insanity!

555
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:43,022
It's not gonna stop.

556
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:47,393
It's just begun.

557
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:52,832
Where's your husband?

558
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:57,737
There's another bomb.

559
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:00,406
There's a backup.

560
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,341
Where's Harold, Kate?

561
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:05,978
Where's Harold?!

562
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:04,401
It should be here
any second.

563
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:07,771
It's always right on time,
right at 8:00.

564
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:11,107
We can catch it
right up to the pines.

565
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:12,943
Uh,
we could just walk.

566
00:38:14,846 --> 00:38:18,315
It's more fun this way.

567
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,817
Just relax, newbie.

568
00:38:20,852 --> 00:38:23,619
I've done this
plenty of other times.

569
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:26,792
I need you
to locate Harold.

570
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,667
Harold Ballinger.

571
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:39,704
Last seen at the Biergarten
less than an hour ago.

572
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:43,041
Who's that?

573
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:46,544
That's...

574
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:49,314
Ted Laufer.

575
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,983
He drives
the delivery truck.

576
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,985
Where is
the truck now?

577
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,486
Well, he takes the same route
every day.

578
00:39:55,521 --> 00:40:00,658
Finishes up on 16th,
heads up Main to access one,

579
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:02,993
drops off the truck,
and picks up another one.

580
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,829
And where does he switch
the two trucks?

581
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,164
At the fence.

582
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:12,469
What's that?

583
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:10,125
What's that?

584
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,205
Here he comes.
We got to slow him down.

585
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:12,953
Get up.

586
00:42:59,532 --> 00:43:01,700
Are you okay?

587
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:07,072
Amy.

588
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:09,274
Amy, what are you
doing here?

589
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:19,618
Ben.

590
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,336
Ben!

591
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:36,892
