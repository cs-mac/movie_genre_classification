1
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:29,173
<i>Sittin' here waiting for tomorrow</i>

2
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:34,227
<i>But I don't think it'll ever come</i>

3
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:37,196
<i>Well...</i>

4
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:41,136
<i>just to think that I'm a young dude</i>

5
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:47,230
<i>My whole life is almost gone</i>

6
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:49,931
<i>Well, well...</i>

7
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:54,404
<i>This prison life's a pressure</i>

8
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,285
<i>Keeps my back against the wall</i>

9
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:07,417
<i>Constant lookout
for the snakes and the bandits</i>

10
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:12,962
<i>Program leans toward us in law</i>

11
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,546
<i>I keep my back against the wall</i>

12
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,059
<i>Back against the wall</i>

13
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,852
<i>Back against the wall</i>

14
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,864
Morning, fellas.
Open the gate.

15
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,740
Can I get inside?

16
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,456
Take these.

17
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,432
<i>Brown, is that you?</i>

18
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,955
<i>Big Brown.</i>

19
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:36,280
<i>Oh man. Hey, Mr. Browns,
what's happening up there?</i>

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,350
- <i>Comin' off the pavement or what?</i>
- <i>Yo chill, little kid.</i>

21
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,138
<i>Some of that old
ham and eggs for breakfast.</i>

22
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:41,966
<i>[?], a little overtime?</i>

23
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,866
<i>[?] after retiring at last, huh?</i>

24
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,223
- Yeah, I gotta make that money, bruh.
- <i>Señor Brown!</i> - <i>It's okay.</i>

25
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,833
<i>Officer!</i>

26
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,918
- Aight, listen up. - <i>Officer!</i>
- <i>Spread that motherfucker, Omar.</i>

27
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,398
I said listen up!

28
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,138
<i>Coño, man. Está bueno.</i>

29
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,896
<i>Now when I call your name,
give me your cell locations.</i>

30
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,135
<i>Now if I have to call your name
more than once, pray.</i>

31
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,988
<i>Your soul may belong to God,</i>

32
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,006
<i>but your ass is mine.</i>

33
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:11,856
<i>Aight, lockout, criminal court.

42
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,082
Allahu Akbar.

43
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:43,179
<i>Enough now.
I don't know who you are,</i>

44
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:46,221
<i>but you've got to come out
in this dayroom sooner or later.</i>

45
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,458

<i>I'm headed for the bigfoot country!</i>

<i>You mispronounced my name.
The country is Korea, I'm Correa.</i>

52
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:09,392
<i>Guys, bring your belongings
to the B-side dayroom.</i>

53
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:14,275
- <i>Aight, on the hold-ins,
on the lockout!</i> - <i>Oh shit!</i>

54
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,906
<i>Alright, Go-Go and Cha-Cha

<i>Did you check him out?</i>

59
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,484
On the hold-ins, give me
a column of ducks right here.

60
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:43,459
Are you going to court, sir?

61
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,948
Uh...

62
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:49,501
I'm supposed to go to court for [?].

63
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,092
Okay, move out.

64
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,496
Two.

65
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,344
- Four.
- <i>Alright gents, wake up!</i>

66
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:58,546
- It's mental health time! Store's open!
- Cigarettes, two for one! Cookies, three for one!

67
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,769
- Walkin' down, walkin' down!
- Oreos, parfaits...!

68
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:04,090
- Store's open, go ahead!
- Cigarettes two for one, fellas!

69
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:05,845
Peace, God.
What can I get you, bro?

70
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,203
- Whoa. - Come on, what can I get God?
- Keep steppin', bruh.

71
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,418
Well if Class As and parfaits
ain't your speed,

72
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,006
then P can drop some rollies
of what you need, bro.

73
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:16,021
Hey, what you want, man?
Pack of Pall Malls? You got a combo slip?

74
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:18,175
Come on, let me see.

75
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,811
All right! The man got
some money in the store.

76
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,361
Okay, give him one.

77
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,806
Yo, yo! Get up, get up!

78
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,311
Get up, get up, motherfucker!
Come on, motherfucker. Get up here!

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,094
Yo, it's two packs of smokes.
You got combo this week?

80
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:36,060
Then we're gonna have to
double up on you, brother man.

81
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:38,285
- That's the way it goes.
- I'm gonna tell you something, man...

82
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,168
You don't get commissary
this week, man,

83
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,757
there's gonna be blood on my knife
or shit on my dick, you got it?

84
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,988
Dig that.

85
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,740
Vaya, Cupcakes, mi nene lindo, ¿qué pasa?
What's happenin' with you, pasa, papi?

86
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,666
Hello there, my man.
What can I do for you, papi?

87
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:56,293
Hey, that's my kid, man.
I talk to him that way.

88
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,703
Tell you what, Cupcakes.
Here's two packs of cigarettes.

89
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,085
You don't need no combo slip.
Just give me a smile.

90
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,054
- Hey man, I don't play that shit.
- Ooh! - Aww!

91
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:08,222
- Looks like he wants to take it to
Dukes City with you, though.
- That's because of you. You're so ugly, man.

92
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,847
- Me? - Yeah, you, man. - Damn, man.
- You don't wanna rumble with me.

93
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:13,132
I'll tell you what. You can rumble,
throw all the punches.

94
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:14,720
I'll throw all the kisses.

95
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,507
Come on, man. Let's get out of here
before they lock up.

96
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,211
Come on, hombrecito.
You know I love you.

97
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:22,715
- <i>I love you, papi... Hey Cupcakes!
¡Mira, nene, papi!</i> - Fuck you.

98
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:26,338
<i>This is your papi speaking, um...
You know about them smokes you owe me?</i>

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,157
<i>Well you can chalk 'em up, man.
Just throw me down your underwears.</i>

100
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:32,757
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

101
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:37,699
Te tengo que tener la cosa al lado,
porque si no, tú sabes, no?

102
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,130
Tengo que... hacerme aquí con la cosa
porque el negocio siempre pa'lante.

103
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:46,406
- <i>Ey, búscate ese calzoncillo.</i>
- <i>Es para mí. That's my, that's my baby.</i>

104
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:49,749
- <i>Eso es para Feis.</i>
- <i>Estáte quieto.</i> - <i>¡Cállate!</i>

105
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,256
I started calling her name out.

106
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,042
Very softly.

107
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,381
Like...

108
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:04,435
Jane.

109
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,842
Jane, baby.

110
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:16,031
Aw, Janey... mama.

111
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,343
Jane, Jane...

112
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:29,319
Now you come here,
and get a part of some real...

113
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,706
down-home,

114
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,256
gut-stomped,

115
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:35,177
black buck fucking.

116
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,070
Hey man, I was like...
I'm like running...

117
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,468
<i>You know something?</i>

118
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,736
I don't understand
you niggas sometimes.

119
00:07:44,737 --> 00:07:49,104
I mean here you've got an opportunity
to learn about yourselves,

120
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,592
about the greatness of the black man.

121
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,131
But what do you do?

122
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,875
You spend your time reading filthy books,

123
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,842
talking negative shit,
and beating your meat at night!

124
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:01,573
Nothing...

125
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:05,021
that will benefit you in
the future world of the black man.

126
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:08,500
Now the time for whitey is almost up.

127
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,743
He was meant to rule
for a certain period of time.

128
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,906
- <i>Shut up, motherfucker!</i>
- And his time is near.

129
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:16,459
Nigga, let me tell you something!

130
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm a hope-to-die dope fiend,

131
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,936
not 'cause I'm black or 'cause
I got some kind of personality disorder.

132
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,229
It's because I like being a dope fiend.

133
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,142
You hear me, nigga?
I like being a dope fiend!

134
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,606
And ain't nothing gonna
change that in me.

135
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:34,862
Now if Allah come down
from wherever he is

136
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,026
and he ain't sellin' no good dope,

137
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:39,335
I ain't gonna cop
from the motherfucker,

138
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:42,949
and I'll put out a wire
that his shit is cut with rat poison.

139
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,429
So you go back to your lessons
and get off my back,

140
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,330
'cause I do as I please.

141
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,509
Now when the time comes
that I want to become

142
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:53,794
a Black God, a muslim, or a Panther,
then I'll become one.

143
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:57,244
So all that you shit you keep talkin'
about us being niggas,

144
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:00,150
stupid and ignorant,
ain't gonna get you nothing

145
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,519
but a good swift kick
in your motherfuckin' ass.

146
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:20,658
<i>On the lockout!</i>

147
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,238
You got, you got the, uh... money?

148
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:40,247
It's about motherfucking time, man!

149
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:44,008
We was locked up in that motherfucker
all day long, homie!

150
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:49,442
Do I look like a...
Do I look like a fucking kid?

151
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,420
- Fuck the cans. - Fuck you, man.
You niggas sleep too fuckin' long, man.

152
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,255
- Don't be tellin' me...!
- Come on, I sleep in the...!

153
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:13,293
<i>Hey, look up. I hope you guys got
them cells cleaned up there in the back.</i>

154
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,759
- Yo, Mr. Brown! - Yeah?
- Mr. Brown, can we have the dominoes?

155
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,963
- <i>Yo Paco!</i>
- <i>Five dollars.</i>

156
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:23,130
Hey Paco, here come your stuff.

157
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:29,973
- Hey, cut that loose.
- Ven pa' áca, compay.

158
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:32,351
- Come on!
- ¡Me cago en Dios!

159
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't you think the kid
gets tired of that every morning?

160
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:37,937
Hey man, we just jivin'.

161
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,401
Cupcakes... you ain't got
no plexes behind there, do you?

162
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,062
No, I'm alright, Ice.

163
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,962
You see, Juan?
Eh, Cupcakes don't mind, man.

164
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,047
Hey, Juan, man! I don't mind.

165
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,301
That motherfucker...

166
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,109
Hey, but that doesn't mean that I like to
listen to that shit every morning.

167
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,370
You're like cavemen.
I call you guys by your names.

168
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,189
Why don't you call me by mine?

169
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,141
All right!

170
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,770
My name ain't Cupcakes, it's Julio.

171
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,945
Acknowledge that you are God,

172
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,499
and your name will not be
Cupcakes, Julio, or anything else.

173
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,936
It would be Dahoo.

174
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:20,443
- Already? Can't you spare us that shit
early in the AM? - God damn!

175
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,790
No one is talking to you...

176
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:25,946
...Yacoub.

177
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,677
The name is Longshoe Charlie Murphy,
Mr. Murphy to you.

178
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:32,107
Yacoub,

179
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:34,596
maker and creator of the Devil,

180
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,589
swine merchant.

181
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,836
Your time is near at hand.

182
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,423
Fuck with me
and your time will be now.

183
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:44,459
Soon, all devils' heads will roll.

184
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:49,683
A new river shall flow through the cities
created by the blood of whitey.

185
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:53,015
- Salaam Alaikum. - Salami con bacon.
- ¡Pa'lante, mi hermano!

186
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,480
- Devil... beast!
- <i>Power to the people!</i>

187
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:58,003
A la lucha, a la lucha,
que somos muchas.

188
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,434
Power to the people, honey.

189
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:03,997
Hey, what kind of
original black man talk is that?

190
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:09,508
Your presence here affects
the mind of my people like a fever.

191
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:19,974
You, Yacoub, are the bearer
of 9,999 diseases, evil, corrupt...

192
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:23,334
...porkchop-eatin' brain.
- I'm sick and tired...!

193
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,996
You see, brothers? Now he admits
that he is sick with corruption.

194
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:29,375
- You stupid son of a...!
- Who, me?

195
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:32,488
He? Him? They? Those? Us?
"U" for the unknown.

196
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,227
- I think maybe...
- I think I...

197
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,249
Oh, aye!

198
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,871
Aye, aye.

199
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,865
Oh, ahh!

200
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:44,799
Hi.

201
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:47,598
Games, huh?

202
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,373
The way of life...

203
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:52,208
...is no game, lame.

204
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:57,449
G-O-D, D-O-G. God spelled backward is dog.
Dog spelled backward is God.

205
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,461
If Allah is God, Allah's a dog!

206
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,039
Break it up!

207
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:14,044
- I'll break your face, motherfucker!
- Stand down!

208
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,802
Mr. Nett.
Yo, Mr. Nett!

209
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,123
You better let them two get it off.

210
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:22,428
Elsewise, we gonna have
mucho static 'round here, jack.

211
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:25,817
That's right, Mr. Nett. They been having
a personality thing going on for weeks now.

212
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,886
- Fair fight, Murphy?
- Yeah, that's what I want.

213
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:31,989
- Johnson? - El Raheem.
Johnson is a slave name. - <i>Look out!</i>

214
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,589
Alright, Morrison, watch the front.
We're gonna take this to the back.

215
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,408
Uh huh, got one!

216
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:50,756
Open.

217
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,873
- Got you, motherfucker! - Don't let him up!
- Throw that right! Come on, Shoe!

218
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:43,293
- Come on, man!
- Throw that right! - Oh shit!

219
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,894
- That's it. That's it.
- Hey, Mr. Nett. - That's it.

220
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:49,925
Hey Mr. Nett, how come you ain't
break it up when that whitey was on top?

221
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:52,159
- Exactly, man... exactly!
- That's it.

222
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:58,707
That's it. I want you to clean up.
We'll be one big, happy family, alright?

223
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,603
That's it, okay?

224
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,735
Back to the dayroom!

225
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,832
Let's go! Back to the dayroom!

226
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,118
Fight him!

227
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,835
Go back to dayroom!

228
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,032
Yo, Mr. Nett, Mr. Nett.

229
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:35,866
Look here, can I speak to you
for a minute, please?

230
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:37,008
What do you want, Omar?

231
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,436
You know, like, I've been here
over ten months now,

232
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:41,897
and I'd like to know
why I can't get on the help.

233
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,055
I've asked you over a dozen times,

234
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:47,034
and dudes that just come in
get a shot over me and I get shot down.

235
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:49,348
I mean, like, why?
Have I done something to you?

236
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:52,092
Is there something about me you don't like?
I mean, you know, what is...?

237
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,669
I got nothin' against you.

238
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,585
It's just that when you came in here,
you had the claps.

239
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:01,467
Come on, man. That was 10 months ago.
I ain't got it no more.

240
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:04,136
How many fights have you had
since you came on the tier?

241
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:11,398
- Seven.
- Seven?

242
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,023
I count over 10!

243
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:15,942
Look, if I put you on the help,
there'll be trouble in no time,

244
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:19,099
but if you can be cool,
give me your word that you won't fight,

245
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:21,536
I'll give it some
deep consideration, okay?

246
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,895
Mr. Nett, I'll try to be cool.

247
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:26,204
At least you're honest.
I'll think about it.

248
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,253
<i>I am God.</i>

249
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:34,320
<i>I am a poor... righteous teacher
of Almighty Allah.</i>

250
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:41,508
<i>And by his will, I am here to awaken
the original lost in these prisons.</i>

251
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,958
<i>The original black man is a secret.</i>

252
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:49,564
<i>This here is your school
of self-awareness.</i>

253
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:53,950
- <i>The black man is asleep.</i>
- Got mine's ready? - <i>Wake up!</i>

254
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,865
You like it?

255
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:04,367
- Will it hold up on a man's chest?
- Hm, just a few slashes.

256
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,805
- Three packs.
- Three?

257
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,856
Okay, I'll give it to you
on the lock-in.

258
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,667
I'll give it to you on the lock-in.

259
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:16,158
You spics don't trust anybody, huh?

260
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,405
<i>I'm telling you guys...</i>

261
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:25,953
<i>The door is open.</i>

262
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:40,570
Another devil.

263
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:42,462
Hey, Longshoe.

264
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,575
Hey, one of your kin lookin'-like-sin
just walked in, bro.

265
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,121
Yo, what's up?
He looks like squeeze.

266
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,200
Hey, hey.

267
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,710
What do you say?

268
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:58,073
Name's Longshoe Charlie Murphy.
Call me Longshoe.

269
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,663
What's your name?

270
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,277
Davis... Clark.

271
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:04,273
I mean, I'm Clark Davis.

272
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:08,191
- Clark Kent.
- And a mild-mannered one, too!

273
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:10,182
Fast as a speeding b-b-b-bullet.

274
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,366
Clark is my first name.

275
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,522
- It's a plane! - No, it's Superman!
- No, it's Super Spic!

276
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:18,858
Oye, oye. Oye, Shoe.

277
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,522
Está bueno para rajarlo.

278
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,891
Hey, back, back, boy.
No está bueno.

279
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,865
Anyway, no mucho como Cupcakes.

280
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,743
- Vaya, vaya...
- Shoe, you'd fuck up a wet dream!

281
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:31,773
Pay them no mind.
They're crazy spics.

282
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:35,305
- Where you lockin'?
- Upper D15.

283
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,057
Siberia, huh?

284
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,240
Tough.

285
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,925
- First time in the joint, huh?
- Yeah.

286
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,470
Well I better hip you
to what's happening fast, huh?

287
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:49,797
Come here.

288
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:54,157
This is our section.

289
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:55,958
White, dig?

290
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:58,402
- Look out for your homie, Shoe.
- Second!

291
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:02,110
Clark, say hello
to my main man Tony.

292
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:04,446
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,362
That's the Rican table over there.

294
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,482
You can sit there
if they give you permission.

295
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,171
Same goes with the black section.

296
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,962
Some of the fellas are in court.

297
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:16,065
I'm the Don Gee here.
You know what that means, right?

298
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:17,398
Good.

299
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:20,387
Niggas and spics, they don't
give us honkies too much trouble.

300
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:21,894
We're half-ass cool.

301
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:25,359
It's a good floor.
Dynamite hack on all shifts.

302
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,664
Stay away from the Black Gods.

303
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:31,697
- <i>Aight, listen up. On the gravy train!</i>
- You'll know 'em when you see 'em.

304
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,614
Blacks go in the front of the line
and we stay in the back.

305
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,060
It's okay to rap with the blacks,

306
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:42,294
but don't get too close
with any of them, Ricans too.

307
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:45,338
We're the minority here,
so be cool.

308
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:46,786
Thank you.

309
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:51,971
If you hate the 'yams,
keep it to yourself. Don't show it.

310
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,962
But also, don't let 'em
run all over you.

311
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:02,950
Ricans...

312
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:04,961
Funny people.

313
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,759
Took me a long time
to figure 'em out.

314
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:09,457
And you know what?

315
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,135
I realize I still got
a lot to learn about 'em.

316
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,164
I rap spic talk,

317
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:17,768
and they get this big-brother attitude
about the white folks in prison,

318
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:20,448
but they'll also
back the niggas to the T.

319
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,149
If a spic pulls a razor blade on you,

320
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:26,636
and you ain't got no mop wringer
in your hands... run.

321
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:30,473
You have any static with a nigga,
and there ain't no whites around,

322
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:32,469
you can get a spic to watch your back.

323
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:36,024
You may stand a chance,
but that ain't no guarantee.

324
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,753
You have any static with a spic,

325
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,711
don't get no nigga to watch your back,
'cause you ain't gonna have none.

326
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,213
- You can say that again!
- Two times.

327
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,485
- You're a good-looking kid.
- What you say!

328
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,725
You ain't stuff and you don't wanna be stuff.
You stay away from the bandits.

329
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:59,032
- Paco! - Yo?
- He's one of 'em.

330
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,069
You take no gifts from nobody.

331
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,268
Let's get something to eat.

332
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,033
<i>Don't nobody move!</i>

333
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:11,131
<i>Don't nobody move!</i>

334
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,074
Alright, Brown. On the gate.

335
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:23,728
- Clark Davis.
- That's me.

336
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,381
You listen, and you listen good.

337
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,630
Because I'm only gonna say it once.

338
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:37,101
This is a nice... quiet floor.

339
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,772
We never had too much trouble
on this floor.

340
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,271
With you, I smell trouble.

341
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:48,076
Why the warden or the captain
put you here...

342
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,593
I don't question their motive.

343
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:53,972
But for once I'm gonna ask...

344
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,612
why they put a sick...

345
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,538
fuckin' degenerate like you...

346
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:02,520
...on my floor.

347
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:07,208
If you look at me from the side,
if you talk from the side of your mouth,

348
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:09,339
if you mispronounce my name,

349
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,752
if you pick up more food
than you can eat,

350
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,041
if you undersleep,
if you oversleep,

351
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,596
if you call me when I think
it's unnecessary,

352
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,389
I'm gonna bust
your fuckin' face up so bad,

353
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,092
your own mother
ain't gonna know you.

354
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:23,463
- Mr. Nett is being kind of hard.
- Shut up!

355
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:25,958
My eight-year-old daughter...

356
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:29,348
was molested by one of these bastards,

357
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:33,089
and I'd just as well pretend
that it was you, Davis.

358
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,074
Short eyes...

359
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,391
Davis, are you one of
these short eyes freaks?

360
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,810
- Are you a short eyes freak?
- Stay out of it, Murphy!

361
00:22:43,982 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm talkin' to this scumbag!

362
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,907
This child rapist!

363
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,023
How old was she? Eight, seven?

364
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,502
Disgusting bastard,
you stay out of my sight.

365
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:57,265
You look at me wrong
and I'll take a nightstick

366
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,578
and I'll shove it dead up your ass.

367
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:02,737
I hope to God
they send you to Sing Sing.

368
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,478
The men up there,
they'll know what to do with you.

369
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:07,647
Short eyes, man.

370
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:09,782
Hey Davis.

371
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:12,279
Captain wants to see you.

372
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,224
They better take you off this floor.

373
00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:40,837
Hector, que está caliente, mira.

374
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,274
Vamos, vamos, ya.

375
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,889
What's happenin', bro?

376
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:15,336
Hello there.

377
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:16,721
¿Cómo está?

378
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:28,855
Mr. Black, you better check out
the shower, man.

379
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,298
Go-Go.

380
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,146
- There'll be no takeoffs on this floor.
- Aw man, what you talkin' about?

381
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:39,928
- Don't play no games, Ice.
- Let me tell you something, man...

382
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,628
If a dude is willing to up it,

383
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:43,950
then I'm gonna take it
and that's all there is to it.

384
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,325
That's right.

385
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:48,967
If a kid's willing to up a shot of life,
then I'm willing to live.

386
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:52,627
Ain't nobody willing to give up nothin'
but hard times and bubblegum,

387
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,495
and you know they don't allow
chewing gum in the joint.

388
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:57,204
And we're the hard times.

389
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:01,103
- Man, ya'll serious?
- We're as serious as terminal cancer.

390
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:03,883
And that is the final stage,
brother man.

391
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,521
So long as I'm on the floor,
there won't be no young kid...

392
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:09,744
...giving up shot of life.

393
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,335
Which might not be too long.

394
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:13,986
¿Y qué carajo tú quieres decir con eso,
maricón de mierda?

395
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:15,883
Say if you think you bad.

396
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,476
I don't think I'm bad...
I know I'm bad!

397
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,313
¡Ey brother, jara!
¡Ahí viene jara, brother!

398
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:24,292
- ¡Oye, escóndete!
- Fuck this, man. Settle down.

399
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:27,537
You heard me.
What's going on on this floor?

400
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,660
Ain't nothing but a little doo-wop.

401
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,658
You better doody-wop
back into that dayroom.

402
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,208
Battling beauties are at it again.

403
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:38,690
Alright, let's move back
to the dayroom.

404
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:49,350
- What's your problem?
- I'm going to my cell... banged my hand.

405
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,208
Now get your feet off the bench!

406
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:54,644
If you let 'em,
they'll drive you ape-shit.

407
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,606
Nice things are happening here today.

408
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:58,926
¿Qué?

409
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,078
¿Qué?

410
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,428
Ya'll motherfuckers don't want me here,
bail me the fuck out!

411
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,534
Get your commissary slips together!

412
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:37,560
Hey, fuck ya'll!

413
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:43,167
- Yeah, keep on steppin', man.
- That's right.

414
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,256
Ask your momma to bail you out, bitch!

415
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,992
Hey, that's right, ladies and gentlemen,
damas y caballeros.

416
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,500
Every night is latin night
here at the house of detention.

417
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:56,497
Today I got a sho' nuff, sho' nuff
show for you.

418
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:58,528
I got my man Willie
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Bing-Bing-Bang,

419
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,105
está aquí con [?],
y está Louis La Cara, por favor.

420
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:04,468
Louie Face, por favor,
sit right here and [?].

421
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:07,735
- Vaya, vaya. - Hey Longshoe, you ready
for the steps, man? We're goin' through that.

422
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:10,428
- Sing one for me, baby!
- Mira, una cosa más, señores y señoras.

423
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:13,417
Queremos que sepan que aquí vamos a tener
un debate musical tremendo,

424
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,839
con el hombre con el palo,
por fa... - Uh...

425
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,806
- Este...
- Nice, nice, Cupcakes!

426
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,418
<i>Cuando yo la vi</i>

427
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:21,193
<i>por primera vez</i>

428
00:27:21,313 --> 00:27:23,650
<i>yo me enamoré</i>

429
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:28,735
<i>Sus brazos, sus labios,
su boca, su forma de hablar</i>

430
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,399
<i>¡Qué linda es, ay morena,
qué linda es!</i>

431
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:36,265
- <i>¡Qué linda es!</i> - <i>¡Ay, morena!</i>
- <i>¡Qué linda es!</i> - <i>¡Morena, morena!</i>

432
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:38,658
- <i>¡Qué linda es!</i> - <i>¡Qué buena que está!</i>
- <i>¡Qué linda es!</i>

433
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,086
¡Espérate, Paco, espérate!

434
00:27:40,144 --> 00:27:42,972
Charlie D, Charlie D,
you gotta sing for me, bro.

435
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:46,209
- You gotta sing!
- <i>¿Qué pasó? Estás bárbaro...</i>

436
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:48,362
Give me a slow beat!
Give me a slow beat.

437
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,787
- Slow beat.
- Alright.

438
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:55,196
- Sing it, Johnny.
- ¡Música!

439
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:03,460
- <i>Break it down!</i>
- Break it down!

440
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:07,627
Yeah!

441
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:12,033
- <i>Break it down!</i>
- Break it down!

442
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:16,172
- <i>Wastin' away...</i>
- Break it down...

443
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:20,294
- <i>I'm getting old...</i>
- Go ahead!

444
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:24,205
<i>Don't make no waves...</i>

445
00:28:25,077 --> 00:28:29,204
- <i>Do what I'm told...</i>
- Do what I'm told, that's right!

446
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,685
<i>'Cause there's too much fear...</i>

447
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:37,787
- <i>And it turns a kind man cruel...</i>
- Cruel, that's what!

448
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:42,206
- <i>So don't waste your tears...</i>
- Don't waste 'em, man!

449
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:45,977
<i>I'm not the only fool...</i>

450
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:51,263
- Sing it, bruh!
- <i>And the man on the gate...</i>

451
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,812
<i>Has a hand in my face...</i>

452
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:59,570
- Get out my face now, yeah!
- Yeah, that's right.

453
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:05,755
- <i>I belong to the state...</i>
- Yeah!

454
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:11,377
- <i>Break it down!</i> - Break it down,

break it down, baby, now!

456
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,550
<i>But my mind's still free...</i>

457
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:28,444
<i>And I can't give that up
for no one...</i>

458
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,912
- No one... - No one!
- That's right.

459
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:33,908
<i>For this uncertainty,</i>

460
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,852
<i>I'm goin' insane,</i>

461
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:41,579
<i>but it isn't showin'...</i>

462
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,901
- <i>So any day...</i>
- Any day!

463
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,403
- <i>When the pain cuts through...</i>
- When the pain cuts through now!

464
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:59,257
<i>I play the lonely game,
and wonder when the A-train's due...</i>

465
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,657
- A-train, that's the one!
- Sing it, sing it.

466
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,147

- <i>But you can't hide the scars...</i>
- Can't hide the scars...

468
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:19,173
<i>Livin' life from a jar...</i>

469
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:24,463

<i>Break it down!</i>

471
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:34,771
Hey Mr. Brown, turn up the music!

472
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:39,763
- Out of sight, young gato. - Hey Pappy,

473
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,970
- Aw man! - You can do better
than this cat on the radio, man.

474
00:30:43,752 --> 00:30:45,474
You wanna take him off, man?

475
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,792
- Well if you don't,
then nobody else is. - I'm hip.

476
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,796
It's all right. Si no, vamos a meter mano.
A meter mano, fuck it.

477
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,095
I'm with it, man. I'm down.

<i>So save some of mine for me</i>

488
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,226
<i>If you got to give it up
don't desert me </i>

489
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,798
<i>'Cause leaving me
you know it would hurt me</i>

490
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,473
<i>Snake cuts and Lucifer's burns</i>

491
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:00,040
<i>Can't take the strength
I've earned and learned</i>

492
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,589
<i>Grease, it just ain't greasy</i>

493
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:09,771
<i>And nasty baby come so easy</i>

00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:42,779
<i>Hey now I plan to be

503
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,757
<i>And I plan to stay
a black motherfucker</i>

504
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:52,211
<i>Stepped in depth
of the same living hell</i>

505
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:57,003
<i>So I ain't too proud to
die here as well</i>

506
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,348
- Ya'll know you straight, homie.

507
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:15,321
Oh shit! Yeah!

00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:19,984
<i>Aww, Do Do Wap is strong in here</i>

00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:21,685
That's it!

00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,841
<i>Do Do Wap is strong in here</i>

511
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,719
<i>Wakin' up to find yourself creamin'</i>

512
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:33,230
<i>Check your fears and hope
that you're dreamin'</i>

513
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:37,426
<i>A little space is all that I need</i>

514
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:42,255
<i>If these suckers
just allow me to breathe</i>

515
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:12,677
- All right, listen up!

516
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,115
- On the frisk!
- <i>¡Viva mi hermano! ¡Que venga!</i>

517
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,777
Take your clothes off!

518
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:20,700
Put 'em on the bed, and bring
your naked asses out of them cells!

519
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,337
- All right, let's go. You heard the man.
Let's go! - Aw shit! Assholes.

520
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,647
All right, Paco.
Rags off, you heard the man.

521
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,119
<i>I'll be dating other...</i>

522
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:36,781
Son of a bitch.

523
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,792
<i>On the gate!</i>

524
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,920
You passin' again, man?

525
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:18,419
Captain Allard.

526
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:24,998
I guess you wouldn't happen to know
how this got in your cell, Mr. Howard.

527
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:26,657
I don't think it's his, Captain.

528
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:29,276
- <i>Yeah, he was jammed!</i>
- Administrative segregation.

529
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:32,090
Which is a nice way of saying
solitary confinement.

530
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,190
- Take him down after the lock-in.
- Who thought that up, your momma?

531
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,472
Okay, Howard.

532
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,931
<i>Lock in!</i>

533
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:43,709
Okay you two beauties,
on a quick clean-up.

534
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,006
<i>Rotten shit, Emerson did it!</i>

535
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,067
I'll take care of it, brother.
Don't even...

536
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,346
It's only a light clean-up, man.
I'll take it out, man.

537
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:52,036
- <i>On the gate!</i>
- Thanks a lot, man.

538
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,750
Hey faggot! You, scumbag.
I'm talking to you.

539
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,730
What do you want, what do you want,
what do you want, man?

540
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,581
On the lock-out... me and you.

541
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:06,543
- Get your sneakers together.
- All right, how do you want it, man?

542
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:08,415
How do I want it?
Any way that you want it, man.

543
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,862
Pipes, knives, any way... razors.

544
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,436
- All right, a fair one... just rags.
- Rags?

545
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,789
All right, just rags.

546
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:24,704
You know, that was dirty, what you
y ese maricón de mierda did to Pappy.

547
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,248
It be's that way, brother.

548
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:30,059
Yes, it be that way sometimes,
motherfucker! Get ready!

549
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:35,700
- <i>Go-Go, you ready?</i>
- All right, you guys, come on.

550
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,297
Grab everything out
if you wanna drop out now.

551
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,177
- Who's locked out?
- Uh, I'm out here, you in there... sir.

552
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:53,133
Wise guy...

553
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,870
<i>On the lock-up!</i>

554
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:10,294
Yo, ah... watch the garbage, man.
Watch the garbage, man.

555
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:13,295
Watch the garbage, man.
Don't be droppin' it all over the place.

556
00:37:17,714 --> 00:37:19,456
¡Ah jo... ah joder, cabrón!

557
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:23,009
- Die, bitch. - We should've
broke your neck, motherfucker!

558
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:25,583
- My arm is broken...
- Cheese-eatin' motherfucker!

559
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,856
<i>¡Saca la mano, coño!</i>

560
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,486
Hey Nett!

561
00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:33,659
It's an accident, man.

562
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:36,832
Now let's go!
Everybody in dayroom!

563
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,944
- Let's go, come on! Let's go!
- My arm, my arm!

564
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:40,873
Let's go!
Move it out, come on!

565
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:43,322
- Let's go!
- Hurry, look here, get a stretcher.

566
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:45,690
- Get a stretcher!
- Don't move, don't move.

567
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,524
- Let's go! Everybody move inside!
- Hurry, get a stretcher!

568
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:51,421
- Let's go help.

569
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:54,570
Over here!
Let's go, move it out!

570
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,755
- Let's go!
- <i>¡Que lo hiciste, maricón!</i>

571
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:00,586
Come on, let's go. Move out!
I don't want no fire alarm.

572
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:02,291
Let's go, move it out!

573
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:07,249
Yeah, that's what you'd better fucking do.
You'd better get off of this floor.

574
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,759
Pero déjame decirte algo, maricón.

575
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,792
That was really dirty,

576
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:15,002
what you and that scumbag did
to that poor old man, settin' him up.

577
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:17,464
Esa fue una cosa bien sucia,
y usted lo sabe.

578
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,211
It be's that way sometimes.

579
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:22,194
¡Me cago en Dios, coño!

580
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,333
Hold it, hold it.

581
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:36,366
- <i>Entra uno así, compadre.</i>
- <i>¿Y no iba a venir Juan?</i>

582
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,557
<i>Oye, no me están cogiendo, man.
No me están cogiendo.</i>

583
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:44,419
<i>Cuidado, cuidado con la mesa.</i>

584
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,291
All right, listen up.
On the lock-in.

585
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:04,645
Omar, on the house gang.
Juan, stay out and clean up the dayroom.

586
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:07,840
And Clark Davis, stay in the dayroom.

00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:10,439
All right, come on, let's go.
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,341
<i>Aight, let's go. On the gate.</i>

590
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:28,560
Okay, Juan, on the clean-up.

591
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:55,032
<i>Hey officer!</i>

592
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,052

<i>God damn it, you faggot!</i>

597
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:54,727
<i>You fuckin' ape!</i>

598
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,343
Thank you.

599
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:25,345
<i>Hey, Paco!</i>

600
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,285
<i>Hey, Paco!
Your pussy's out there!</i>

601
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:31,536
<i>Bullshit!</i>

602
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,890
Hey man, did you really do it?

603
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:48,743
I don't know.

604
00:42:49,043 --> 00:42:51,741
What do you mean you don't know, man?
I mean, what do you think I am?

605
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,420
Some kind of a fool or something
out of a comic strip?

606
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:56,255
- I know, I don't mean to
sound like that. I'm... - Look...

607
00:42:56,489 --> 00:43:00,130
Either you did it, or you didn't.
That's all there is to it.

608
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:02,467
I don't know if I did it or not.

609
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,519
Look, wait a minute.
You better break that down for me.

610
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,091
Because you lost me.

611
00:43:07,342 --> 00:43:10,191
I don't remember.
I don't know whether I did it or not.

612
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,798
I may have or I may not have.

613
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:18,536
I don't remember.

614
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:26,252
I mean, I spent 33 days
in that observation ward,

615
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:29,430
and I don't remember doing
anything like that to that little girl.

616
00:43:31,162 --> 00:43:34,824
Hey... you done something like that
before, haven't you?

617
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:39,997
Haven't you?

618
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:45,060
Yes.

619
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,625
How did you know?

620
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,422
Because the guilt flies off
your tongue, man.

621
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:56,161
You sound like one of those guys
in an encounter session

622
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,715
looking to dump your shit off
on somebody.

623
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:00,718
You know, you need help.

624
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:03,032
And the problem is that you know it.

625
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:05,303
Help?

626
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:07,617
I know.

627
00:44:08,514 --> 00:44:09,955
I'm afraid to find it.

628
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,029
Why?

629
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,732
This fear...

630
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:18,976
I'm just, uh...

631
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:23,227
afraid of finding out that I may have to be
locked away for the rest of my life.

632
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:29,463
I got a wife and kid
and I love them very much.

633
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:31,907
I want to be with them.
I don't want to be away from them.

634
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:35,267
Now this has happened.

635
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,196
I don't know what to do.

636
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:40,695
If I fight it in court,
they're gonna get hurt.

637
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:43,435
If I don't, they're gonna get hurt.

638
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:47,748
Jesus, help me.

639
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,650
'Cause man won't.

640
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,915
Yeah... man won't.

641
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,797
Listen...

642
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:02,348
You got a half an hour before lockout.

643
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,384
So go ahead, run it.

644
00:45:07,397 --> 00:45:08,451
I don't know.

645
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:11,842
I got these little pictures
runnin' through my brain, you know?

646
00:45:14,457 --> 00:45:16,401
I can remember being...

647
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:18,294
...fifteen.

648
00:45:19,794 --> 00:45:21,493
Waking up in the morning...

649
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:25,360
voices coming
from the other room...

650
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:32,277
...cartoons on the TV. Yeah, they were
watching cartoons on the TV.

651
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:34,244
Two little girls.

652
00:45:34,544 --> 00:45:36,429
It's my sister and a friend of hers.

653
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,347
And then, right, you know
what it's like...

654
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,717
when you wake up in the morning...

655
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:47,371
...inevitable hard-on
gets up with you, you know?

656
00:45:48,715 --> 00:45:50,731
So I drape these sheets over me.

657
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,728
And everyone else was asleep.

658
00:45:58,152 --> 00:46:00,843
And this little girl,
friend of my sister's...

659
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:03,079
She was, uh...

660
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:06,655
...about eight or nine.

661
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:13,104
She was very pretty.

662
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,574
Black hair...

663
00:46:15,758 --> 00:46:17,735
...her dark, flashing eyes.

664
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:27,060
My sister said,
"I... gotta go do number two."

665
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:30,518
She said, "Wait for me, I've gotta go
do number two," and she left the room.

666
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,358
And I sneaked in.

667
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,682
And this little girl sensed
my presence, and uh, she...

668
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,929
...turned around and smiled.

669
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:44,020
And I said, "I'm a vampire."

670
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:45,899
She laughed.

671
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,944
Then I spread the sheets.

672
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:51,745
And she stopped laughing all of a sudden.
She just looked at me.

673
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:57,859
I started coming closer towards her
like a vampire, you know, and uh...

674
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:01,628
She got out and she ran for the door.

675
00:47:02,683 --> 00:47:03,876
Then she stopped.

676
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:07,180
She turned around and she looked at me.

677
00:47:12,138 --> 00:47:14,828
She didn't look at my face.
She just looked at my body.

678
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:17,799
I don't know whether it was, uh...

679
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,560
fear or what, but I'll never
forget that look.

680
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:25,102
One time...

681
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,076
I was alone at home,
I was watching TV, and uh...

682
00:47:30,946 --> 00:47:32,931
There was this little Puerto Rican girl.

683
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:36,184
She used to live next door.
She was the janitor's daughter.

684
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,137
I'd see her around all the time.

685
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:41,987
She was always sliding down
the banister.

686
00:47:43,436 --> 00:47:45,196
Her panties always looked dirty.

687
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,359
Then I get in the bathroom with her.

688
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:56,615
Yeah, I was combing her hair.

689
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,850
Her little red curly hair,
I was combing it.

690
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,264
And I was naked, except for...

691
00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:07,312
...white, uh, boxer shorts I had on.

692
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:14,467
And all of a sudden, I get this feeling
all over me, you know?

693
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:16,673
It's like a flash fever.

694
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:18,710
And I'm hard.

695
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:25,050
Then I put my arms...
around her, and I...

696
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,492
...held her little shoulders.

697
00:48:30,376 --> 00:48:31,874
Then I took her hand...

698
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:34,757
and I pressed it...

699
00:48:35,656 --> 00:48:37,075
...down on my penis.

700
00:48:43,697 --> 00:48:45,575
Then I started to take my shorts off,

701
00:48:45,614 --> 00:48:49,017
and then I felt really naked
so I poked 'em, pulled 'em back up on.

702
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,933
My eyes were closed.

703
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,799
But there was like this big eye somewhere
off in space staring at me, you know?

704
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,694
So I opened my eyes and I looked up
and she's staring at me in the cabinet mirror.

705
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:08,105
Then I pulled her back away
from the mirror so she couldn't see.

706
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,228
Then I started to take her shorts off.

707
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:16,896
Her little panties.

708
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:19,559
She resisted a little bit,
and then she...

709
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:23,112
She stopped and she turned around
and she giggled,

710
00:49:23,146 --> 00:49:26,159
and she threw her arms around my neck
and kissed me on the mouth.

711
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:36,300
Then I lubricated myself.

712
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:44,016
I heard this scream.

713
00:49:45,723 --> 00:49:47,089
And it was my own.

714
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:50,795
And there was
a spot of blood on my shorts,

715
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:54,561
so I took 'em right off and I tore 'em up,
flushed 'em right down the john.

716
00:49:57,717 --> 00:49:58,708
And then...

717
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,902
By that time, she was dressed.

718
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:03,651
She... she came over to me,
and uh...

719
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:07,436
She said did that mean
that I was her boyfriend now,

720
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,954
and were we going to
do it again tomorrow, and I said yeah.

721
00:50:11,265 --> 00:50:14,912
When I wasn't with her, I'd be with that...
be in the children's playground,

722
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:17,437
or else I'd be in
the children's section at the movies.

723
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:22,516
You wanna know something?

724
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:26,613
- Uh, what...?
- Juan. - Juan. Yes, Juan.

725
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:28,402
I became a...

726
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,557
...what, a pro?

727
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:32,823
A professional degenerate.

728
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,825
It seemed like I almost had
a second sense about children.

729
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:41,913
You know, I would sit there
on that park bench for hours.

730
00:50:41,978 --> 00:50:43,804
And then I'd talk to
a little girl for a minute.

731
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:46,100
I'd know right away whether we were
gonna do it or not.

732
00:50:48,606 --> 00:50:51,628
The little Puerto Rican girls
and the black girls were the easiest.

733
00:50:54,702 --> 00:50:57,449
Little white girls would masturbate you
right there in the park

734
00:50:57,525 --> 00:50:59,418
for a quarter or whatever,

735
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:02,078
depending on how much emphasis
their parents put on money.

736
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:09,482
I couldn't stop myself.

737
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:13,390
I couldn't stop myself.

738
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:21,631
I thought of killing myself...
but I couldn't go through with that.

739
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:23,209
I don't wanna die.

740
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:27,175
I thought maybe I was crazy, but uh...

741
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:31,182
I read somewhere or heard
that crazy people

742
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:33,752
don't know the difference between
right and wrong,

743
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:36,226
and I know right and I know
what I'm doing is wrong,

744
00:51:36,246 --> 00:51:37,995
but I just can't stop!

745
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:43,536
Well why didn't you go
to a police or to a psychiatrist?

746
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:46,703
Well I thought of that many times,
but, uh, I...

747
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:49,108
Well if I went to the police,

748
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:52,197
they would either find
some pretext to kill me or else...

749
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:54,494
they'd turn me over to a psychiatrist,

750
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:56,695
and then if he couldn't help me,
he'd turn me back over to them

751
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:59,005
or else I'd spend the rest of my life
in a nut ward.

752
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:02,826
Listen, Juan. Try to understand me.
I'm, I'm... will you try to understand me?

753
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,071
Motherfucker, try to understand you?
Let me tell you something!

754
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:08,612
If I wasn't trying to understand you,

755
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,681
I woulda killed you stone dead, punk,

756
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:14,050
that moment that you said
that thing about the Rican girl.

757
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:15,696
Look...

758
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:17,256
Look, man...

759
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:20,522
You better ask for
a transfer to protection,

760
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:24,464
because if you remain on this floor...

761
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:28,151
...you're asking to die.

762
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,927
You're asking to commit
involuntary suicide.

763
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:38,345
Ah, Jesus!

764
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:46,123
I mean, why the fuck...
did you have to tell me all of it?

765
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:48,118
You don't know me from Adam!

766
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:52,485
Why did you have to make me
your Father Confessor? Why?

767
00:52:53,524 --> 00:52:55,217
Why, why didn't you stop?

768
00:52:55,832 --> 00:52:57,098
Jesus!

769
00:52:57,218 --> 00:52:58,437
Why?

770
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:03,462
Because you asked.

771
00:53:20,417 --> 00:53:21,736
<i>Superman?</i>

772
00:53:23,925 --> 00:53:25,684
<i>There's only five of us.</i>

773
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,331
<i>Paco, hurry up.
You got a council visit.</i>

774
00:53:32,451 --> 00:53:34,272
Stay on your bullshit, bullshit...

775
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,950
- Your shot, your shot.
- You ain't do nothin'.

776
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:50,002
Okay, it went out.

777
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:58,400
- Well that comes from...
- Ayo, Shoe. - Mhm? - Here, man.

778
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,421
Have you got anything to drop?

779
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:03,330
I got some A-trains left
for a deuce a piece.

780
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,374
- Class As for an ace.
- Hmm.

781
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:09,625
Hey, you know something, you guys
give some heavy motherfuckin' prices, yeah?

782
00:54:09,702 --> 00:54:11,703
Well the streets are
right out there, my man.

783
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:15,222
Hey Shoe, dig this.
Let me cop... a deuce,

784
00:54:16,028 --> 00:54:18,296
and I'll lay the money on you
at the end of the weekend.

785
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:22,044
I thought you ain't had
no commissary downstairs, buddy.

786
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:27,316
- You ain't got no combo downstairs?
- No, I don't have no combo downstairs.

787
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:30,600
But I expect some money...
uh, this week.

788
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,916
Yeah, and I expect to get out some day.

789
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,860
Let's go, fellas. It's track time.

790
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,034
Okay, fellas. The odds are 3:1, even,
2:1, and 3:1 on the end.

791
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:50,703
Aight, gentlemen place your bets.
Here's the board.

792
00:54:50,823 --> 00:54:54,908
In post #1, we have Mr. Allard.
In post #2, we have Mr. Morrison.

793
00:54:55,028 --> 00:54:59,007
In post #3, we got Mr. Brown.
And in post #4, we got Mr. Nett.

794
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,539
Place your bets.

795
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:04,061
All right, the bets are coming in.
The board is starting to clear.

796
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:05,914
Let's get 'em up to the post line.

797
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:07,566
Okay, we got 'em up at the gate.

798
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:09,224
Everybody set?

799
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:11,956
The board is cleared, the gates are open,
and the race is off!

800
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,447
And there goes Mr. Allard's
going down the first pole.

801
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:16,713
Watch out, here comes Mr. Nett
up the second furlough.

802
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:19,191
Watch out, here comes
Mr. Morrison and...

803
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:21,995
...Mr. Brown wins.
- I win! - Aw, man!

804
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:26,083
Alright, everybody got their thing in?
This is the second race.

805
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:27,711
Alright, the bets are placed.

806
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:31,528
- Mine looks like she come from Queens.
- Okay, ready?

807
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,188
Post is clear, the bets are in,
the gate is up.

808
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:37,463
And they're off... they were off.
Get 'em outta there.

809
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:41,085
Look at this, here comes Mr. Morrison
off the ledge. What an opportunity.

810
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:42,973
Get your finger off the rows!

811
00:55:43,293 --> 00:55:44,676
There we go, look!

812
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,550
- Push!
- Get it out of the row!

813
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,515
Man, come on, come on, man!
Come on, yeah!

814
00:55:51,943 --> 00:55:53,950
Hold the phone there.
We'll wait a while.

815
00:55:54,192 --> 00:55:55,723
Oh man, stomp 'em!

816
00:55:56,689 --> 00:55:57,981
Oh shit!

817
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:02,027
- Hey, what do you want, man?
- All over the pot! - It was on Brown!

818
00:56:02,078 --> 00:56:04,391
The roach still fuckin' died.
What the fuck is...?

819
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,853
Hey, anybody want to play
Dirty Hearts?

820
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:08,607
I ain't got no money,

821
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,509
but I'll get some cigarettes later on
in the week and I'll pay you guys back.

822
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,686
Cupcakes, you know what they say...

823
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:17,468
...money on the wood,
makes the betting good.

824
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,995
Julio... there you go, bro.

825
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:22,461
- Hey, thanks a lot!
- Alright, bro.

826
00:56:23,043 --> 00:56:24,246
Shoe.

827
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,875
- Hey, Paco. That was a sure enough
fast visit. - Not fast enough.

828
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:36,390
- ¿Qué pasó? - Esa tipa me tiene a mí
los huevos hinchados, man.

829
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:39,514
She wants me to cop out
to a motherfuckin' D.

830
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:41,524
Seven and a half to fifteen.

831
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,633
She must think my dick
is made of sponge rubber.

832
00:56:44,963 --> 00:56:47,929
I told her, "You tell the D.A.
to rub it on his chest!",

833
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:50,339
and not to bother to
come to court on my behalf.

834
00:56:50,403 --> 00:56:53,839
She must've made a deal with the D.A.
for one of her paying customers.

835
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:57,055
Man, if I wait, I can get a misdemeanor
my own motherfuckin' self!

836
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,712
What I need with a legal aid?

837
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,809
And guess who they got
out on the motherfuckin' bench.

838
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:03,914
- Who they got out there?
- Cop-out motherfuckin' Levine, my man!

839
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,482
First they give me the student,

840
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:07,154
and now they give me
this double-crossin' bitch.

841
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:09,207
- We all gotta make a living.
- On my expense?

842
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:11,038
No fucking good.

843
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:16,015
Brother man, don't you know
what justice really means?

844
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,930
Just us white folks.

845
00:57:22,123 --> 00:57:23,401
Look here, my man.

846
00:57:24,264 --> 00:57:26,791
I don't expect nothing from nobody...

847
00:57:27,566 --> 00:57:29,447
...especially them yankees.

848
00:57:31,546 --> 00:57:34,580
Man, this ain't my first time
in front of them people,

849
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,238
behind these walls,
because I ain't got the bail to get out.

850
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:40,828
And you can bet your ass
it's not gonna be the last time,

851
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:44,642
not as long as I am poor
and un puertorriqueño, baby.

852
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,806
Hey freak!

853
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:55,733
You standin' on my
chinese handball court.

854
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,066
<i>All hoes to the back of the gallery, homie.</i>

855
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:10,052
That there is where I hang
my wet clean clothes.

856
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:11,863
Move, creep.

857
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,214
Hey freak.

858
00:58:19,155 --> 00:58:22,134
You are in God's walking space.

859
00:58:22,394 --> 00:58:26,728
- That is Paco's walking space, my man.
- Hey Clarky! Hey Clark!

860
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,833
Hey man, you don't have to
listen to these dudes, bro.

861
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:32,767
I know a spot that's not taken.
Here, over here.

862
00:58:32,995 --> 00:58:36,238
The toilet bowl. You'll find you got
a lot in common with it, too.

863
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:41,333
Look, I'm not gonna stand for
this kind of treatment.

864
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:44,584
You say something out your face,
you motherfucker?

865
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:47,962
You talking to everybody
or to somebody in particular?

866
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:50,024
I know you ain't talkin' to me.

867
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,736
You got something you want to say to
somebody in this room... faggot?

868
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,688
- No, I was talking to myself.
- Don't talk to yourself too loud.

869
00:58:57,761 --> 00:59:00,224
Hey yeah, talk to the toilet bowl.
You go well with each other.

870
00:59:00,278 --> 00:59:03,374
Alright, come on, man.
Hey, drop it man, cut it loose, alright?

871
00:59:03,494 --> 00:59:04,727
Uh huh?

872
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:07,398
¿Y dónde está La Mancha?

873
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:10,399
Or did Sancho move upstairs?

874
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:14,478
You know, Paco, one of these days
you're gonna get me very, very angry, man.

875
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:16,843
Yeah, well I'm very, very scared.

876
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,515
I mean, like, I'm tremblin', man.

877
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:22,948
Can't you smell it? I'm shittin' bricks.

878
00:59:23,013 --> 00:59:25,806
- Don't...! - Just, just...
cool it, god damn it. Just cool it.

879
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,888
I don't know why you want to
front for that freak.

880
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:32,457
But you don't go against your own people.
You be wrong, Juan.

881
00:59:32,496 --> 00:59:34,095
I ain't going against
my own brother, man.

882
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:36,833
All that I'm saying is that
if the dude is a freak, cut him loose.

883
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:38,790
All that is not necessary, Ice.

884
00:59:40,872 --> 00:59:44,126
Man, I'll tell you, this man's got
special interests, man.

885
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:48,056
Don't come out your face wrong, Paco.
We both know where you comin' from.

886
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,560
Don't make me put your business
in the street.

887
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,263
And Juan, you out of order.

888
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,863
- This ain't your turn, baby.
- Hey, let's go do up them clothes, Juan.

889
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:01,849
Aight, get the buckets, kid.

890
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:06,822
- Man thinks he's a grande pingú.
- Squash it.

891
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,457
Hey man, don't leave.

892
01:00:12,629 --> 01:00:15,383
- I want you to hold it for me
while I pee. - What?

893
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:18,461
I want you to hold my
motherfuckin' dick while I pee, sucka,

894
01:00:18,503 --> 01:00:21,629
so I don't get my hands wet.
- I can't do that.

895
01:00:21,787 --> 01:00:23,529
Oh you can't do that?

896
01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:26,690
But you can rape
seven-year-old girls, huh?

897
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:31,894
I never, I never did
anything like that in my life.

898
01:00:33,544 --> 01:00:34,734
I didn't.

899
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:49,352
Check this pussy out, man.

900
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:54,417
You're welcome to some.

901
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:56,008
Some?

902
01:00:57,383 --> 01:00:59,355
I'm welcome to all of them, creep.

903
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,142
Take him out.

904
01:01:02,262 --> 01:01:04,019
- What about me?
- What about you?

905
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,626
- Well, I... they're all I have.
- Kick.

906
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:09,958
- Well, uh... - Kick.
- Kick, motherfucker, kick.

907
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:14,077
Hey...!

908
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:16,030
What's this?

909
01:01:17,205 --> 01:01:19,528
A gold chain.

910
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:21,641
How many carats?

911
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,150
Fourteen.

912
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:25,647
Fourteen...

913
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:28,808
Damn, Shoe. If you're gonna take
the chain, take the chain.

914
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,453
Me, take?

915
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,636
Who said anything
about taking anything?

916
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,970
That would be stealing,
and that's dishonest.

917
01:01:38,746 --> 01:01:40,362
Ain't that right, Clarky baby?

918
01:01:41,182 --> 01:01:43,511
You wanna give that chain, don't you?

919
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:45,461
After all, we're both white.

920
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:47,677
We both gotta
look out for each another.

921
01:01:48,092 --> 01:01:49,740
Ain't that true, Clarky baby?

922
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,883
I mean, you're gonna be real white
about the whole thing,

923
01:01:52,935 --> 01:01:54,610
ain't you Clarky baby?

924
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,434
It was a gift from my mother.

925
01:01:57,554 --> 01:01:59,268
Aww!

926
01:01:59,644 --> 01:02:02,314
I didn't know you had a mother.

927
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:06,273
I didn't know human beings
gave birth to dogs, too.

928
01:02:08,676 --> 01:02:12,251
Uh-oh, look like the freak
ain't uppin' the chain, Shoe.

929
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:15,910
Oh man, Clarky baby...

930
01:02:16,754 --> 01:02:19,910
How you gonna show in front of
these people, huh, man?

931
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:22,497
You want 'em to think we're
that untogether?

932
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,363
What are you tryin' to say, man?

933
01:02:28,803 --> 01:02:30,673
You mean to stand there...

934
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:34,470
in your nice, cheap summer suit...

935
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:36,670
lookin' very white...

936
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:41,210
and deny my whiteness
by refusing to share a gift with me?

937
01:02:42,656 --> 01:02:44,986
That's totally uncool.
You're insultin' me.

938
01:02:45,055 --> 01:02:47,147
Man's tryin' to say
you ain't white enough, Shoe.

939
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,137
You tryin' to
put a wire out on me, creep?

940
01:02:49,177 --> 01:02:51,852
- He said you's a nigga-lover.
- You sayin' that I'm a quadroon?

941
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:56,405
He say this devil's got some
royal Congo blood runnin' through his veins?

942
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:58,988
Freak say you were tryin' to pass.

943
01:02:59,866 --> 01:03:02,779
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, you callin' me a liar?

944
01:03:03,156 --> 01:03:05,740
- No. - Then you did say it.
- I didn't say that.

945
01:03:08,295 --> 01:03:12,496
Look, here, take the goddamn chain.
Just leave me alone, alright?

946
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:16,988
- Pick up the motherfuckin' chain, freak.
- Pick up the chain, bitch!

947
01:03:19,097 --> 01:03:20,444
That's right.

948
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:24,958
And you tell that boy over there
he's not good enough to talk to you.

949
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:28,227
First I'm a nigger-lover,
then I'm a quadroon,

950
01:03:28,295 --> 01:03:30,746
and now I'm not even
good enough to talk to.

951
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:33,662
Boy, didn't I tell you about walking in
God's walking space, didn't I?

952
01:03:34,827 --> 01:03:37,415
You better answer God
when he talks to you, boy.

953
01:03:37,535 --> 01:03:39,480
Don't turn your back on me,
motherfucker!

954
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:42,689
<i>Watch out, Clark is down there!</i>

955
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:45,953
Ayo, Mr. Nett, Mr. Nett! This man here,
he started the fight with Omar.

956
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,761
- That's right... - We just broke it up.
- That's right, man.

957
01:03:48,847 --> 01:03:50,075
You all right, brother man?

958
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,322
- Yeah, he just cold-cocked him
in the jaw, man. - Fuck 'em. - Yeah!

959
01:03:54,904 --> 01:03:56,639
You guys know the rules.
Get him up.

960
01:03:57,017 --> 01:03:59,215
No sleepin' on the floor.

961
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:10,830
You guys really ought to
learn how to touch up a dude.

962
01:04:11,324 --> 01:04:14,279
- Fuck it, I'ma get a bucket of water.
- Fuck the bucket of water, Omar.

963
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:16,499
Put the sucka's head in the toilet bowl.
There's water there.

964
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:19,587
Hey man, he's still a devil,
but I will not do that to no man.

965
01:04:20,845 --> 01:04:22,994
Oh shit, Shoe!
There's still piss in there, man!

966
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:25,131
Fuck it, you put his head in there,
Omar, and I'll flush it.

967
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:27,642
No, Omar. Let him put his head
in there and you flush it.

968
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:30,297
It makes no difference.
Flush the motherfucker, Omar.

969
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:33,026
I baptize thee in the name
of the Father,

970
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:36,434
the Son, the Holy Ghost,
and his mama.

971
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:41,446
Hallelujah!

972
01:04:42,352 --> 01:04:44,277
And...

973
01:04:53,238 --> 01:04:55,924
You know, it's kinda like a shame,
what those dudes did to that

974
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,355
poor, ugly, misbegotten
son of a bitch.

975
01:04:59,749 --> 01:05:01,664
I almost feel sorry for the slob.

976
01:05:03,673 --> 01:05:05,170
If anybody ever...

977
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:09,708
did that to me or even thought of it,
it would be war to the bitter end.

978
01:05:10,372 --> 01:05:11,556
Hey, spare me.

979
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:16,714
- Where did they take him? - I don't know,
don't care, and don't give a fuck.

980
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:19,890
They took him down
for positive identification, man.

981
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,894
- Yo, Omar.
- Yo, what's happenin'?

982
01:05:24,014 --> 01:05:25,226
Homie...

983
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:28,773
- Yo bruh, look here. How old are you?
- None of your business, motherfucker.

984
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:32,107
Omar, what you got on the street,
but beside the sidewalk?

985
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:34,077
Hey man, what is it with you, anyway?

986
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:37,895
Now what are you, CBS News?
An FBI agent?

987
01:05:38,015 --> 01:05:40,646
The fuck you tryin' to be,
Geraldo Rivera or somebody?

988
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:42,100
Nah, bruh.

989
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:45,847
<i>Hey guys, I knew you
had no combo downstairs,</i>

990
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,007
<i>so lighten up on that nigga's ass.</i>

991
01:05:48,622 --> 01:05:51,237
Looks like you made the wrong move
that time, governor.

992
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:53,744
Seems that, um...

993
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:57,245
I'm gonna have to prove to you
young whippersnappers that you can't...

994
01:05:57,947 --> 01:06:01,175
...fool around with the old man.
- Yeah, you talk a lotta shit, Ice.

995
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,034
Yo, Omar!

996
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:06,085
- Yo, what's happenin'?
- Yeah, I wanna get a few things down.

997
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:10,909
You talkin' about all these things,
like sell the kid, but keep the Cadillac,

998
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:14,108
and, uh, 'cause you need
wheels to move.

999
01:06:14,613 --> 01:06:18,765
But bruh, you ain't movin' nowhere...
'cause this is your life here.

1000
01:06:19,424 --> 01:06:20,987
This is your home, bruh.

1001
01:06:21,513 --> 01:06:23,041
You found yourself a home.

1002
01:06:23,137 --> 01:06:25,776
Hey man, why you comin' down
on me like that?

1003
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:27,780
What I done done to you, man?

1004
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,510
You're 33.

1005
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:33,542
Seventeen of those years you've
been on this planet, you've been in jail.

1006
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:35,057
I mean locked up.

1007
01:06:35,588 --> 01:06:38,245
People been telling you
where to go, what to do,

1008
01:06:38,445 --> 01:06:40,919
how to shit, when to shave,
when to shower,

1009
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:43,480
when to eat,
and when to sleep...

1010
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:47,225
when to masturbate
and how to masturbate...

1011
01:06:48,878 --> 01:06:50,186
Omar, you ain't got nothin',

1012
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:52,536
so don't be messin' with me
when I'm tryin' to get somethin'.

1013
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:53,855
I'm sorry.

1014
01:06:54,228 --> 01:06:56,230
Okay, man? I'm sorry.

1015
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,877
Sorry didn't do it... you did it.

1016
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:01,864
- Squash it, man, please?
- Yeah, okay. We'll squash it.

1017
01:07:02,038 --> 01:07:03,454
But you be cool, man.

1018
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:06,177
Don't do me like that.

1019
01:07:06,474 --> 01:07:10,019
I dig you a lot, Omar... and I'd never
do nothing like that to you.

1020
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:12,696
<i>Aw, come on!
Give the sucker a break!</i>

1021
01:07:14,357 --> 01:07:15,809
You're in check.

1022
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:18,484
Ten months and I finally beat
this motherfucker.

1023
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:21,318
Excuse me while I answer nature's call.

1024
01:07:28,492 --> 01:07:33,583
- <i>Look guys, it's Sunday morning!</i>
- <i>Hallelujah! Hallelujah!</i>

1025
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:15,341
Aight, knock it off!
Knock it off!

1026
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:18,036
All you supposed to be killers!

1027
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:20,633
You ain't nothing but a bunch of
counterfeit pussy-lovers!

1028
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:21,832
<i>Why don't you...!</i>

1029
01:08:24,236 --> 01:08:27,954
And like I always say,
if you'll shuffle, you'll deal!

1030
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:33,228
<i>How about sucking these,
Mr. Brown! You first!</i>

1031
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:41,449
<i>I said suck it, bitch!</i>

1032
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:51,822
<i>Hey poet, you got a visit!</i>

1033
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:56,647
I knew my mammy wasn't gonna
let me swim this ocean by my lonesome!

1034
01:08:56,713 --> 01:08:58,162
<i>You too, Murphy.</i>

1035
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:00,816
<i>On the gate!</i>

1036
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:04,276
<i>Come on, Murphy!</i>

1037
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:06,813
What are you gonna
keep your people waiting, man?

1038
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:11,277
- I refuse my visit, Mr. Nett.
- <i>That's up to you.</i>

1039
01:09:11,491 --> 01:09:13,525
Hey Murphy, man,
what kind of talk is that?

1040
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:16,760
Your people, they come all the way
up here from Coney Island...

1041
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:20,063
...and what are you gonna refuse?
What are you gonna show like Cagney?

1042
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:24,481
Juan, I like you, but don't go
in my kitchen without permission.

1043
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:27,197
I'm sorry, solid.

1044
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:29,514
- Later, bro.
- Hey Juan, wait.

1045
01:09:30,193 --> 01:09:31,366
It's cool, man.

1046
01:09:33,352 --> 01:09:36,446
Oh yeah, hey man, it's cool.
Me and you is all right, sure.

1047
01:09:37,976 --> 01:09:39,048
Hey Juan, wait!

1048
01:09:41,539 --> 01:09:43,086
Don't go, man.

1049
01:09:43,474 --> 01:09:45,069
Don't make your visit.

1050
01:09:45,371 --> 01:09:47,563
Wait a minute, man. What do you mean
not to make my visit?

1051
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:50,630
What are you, crazy?
You been fuckin' with them A-trains lately.

1052
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:53,552
- And that goddamn homemade wine.
- That's right.

1053
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:55,868
But you know,
like everybody else knows,

1054
01:09:55,932 --> 01:09:58,725
that I know what I'm saying,
even if I don't say it out loud.

1055
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:03,078
You know, Murphy... you're lucky I don't
put you in the bing for being stoned.

1056
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,703
You wouldn't do that, Mr. Nett.

1057
01:10:06,429 --> 01:10:08,202
Mr. Nett, you wouldn't do that,

1058
01:10:08,322 --> 01:10:11,660
because what would happen to your bread
on the white side of the road?

1059
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:13,529
Hey, man. Be cool, Shoe.

1060
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:16,851
I said white side,
not Puerto Rican side, Paco.

1061
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:21,327
Hey, man... if I blow,
you're gonna have to answer.

1062
01:10:21,414 --> 01:10:27,274
- Hey Murphy... - I should have you
call me Mr. Murphy, Mr. Nett.

1063
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:28,853
Don't push it Murphy, heh?

1064
01:10:28,973 --> 01:10:31,099
You don't want your visit,
that's your right.

1065
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:32,683
I give less than a fuck.

1066
01:10:32,714 --> 01:10:34,577
- Let's go, Juan.
- No.

1067
01:10:35,174 --> 01:10:38,258
Hey, look, look, man. Don't do that,
don't ever do that, alright?

1068
01:10:38,306 --> 01:10:40,387
Don't ever attempt to think for me.

1069
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:42,230
Man, it's the freak.

1070
01:10:42,443 --> 01:10:45,816
I feel it, man. You're gonna
seem out of place when you show back.

1071
01:10:46,219 --> 01:10:48,409
Don't you see he's got the mark on him?

1072
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:49,979
It's like I told you before, man.

1073
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:53,081
It's the same thing as coming out
of the joint. You're branded.

1074
01:10:53,201 --> 01:10:56,640
A week, a month, sooner or later they're
gonna take you off the count, you know that.

1075
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,851
Don't you think this place is any different.
It's all the same thing.

1076
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:02,084
You in the life, you know, Juan.

1077
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:06,583
Alright, look, man, you lost me,
but keep me lost,

1078
01:11:06,645 --> 01:11:09,672
'cause I got a feeling if you find me,
I'm not gonna like it.

1079
01:11:11,646 --> 01:11:15,235
Alright, go ahead, get your part of it,
but let me tell you this...

1080
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:17,803
You better not bring it
back on the floor with you.

1081
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:20,787
'Cause if you do, you better
walk pretty hard, Juan.

1082
01:11:20,934 --> 01:11:22,775
No, Shoe. I walk soft...

1083
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,320
...but I hit hard.

1084
01:11:24,736 --> 01:11:26,989
And visits and mail
are my ounce of freedom,

1085
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:29,298
and I'm not gonna
give that up for nobody.

1086
01:11:34,109 --> 01:11:35,919
<i>Now that's fuckin' heavy.</i>

1087
01:11:58,121 --> 01:12:00,602
What the fuck?
Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!

1088
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:02,276
Hey Paco, man, what the hell
is the matter with you?

1089
01:12:02,327 --> 01:12:04,803
- What's the matter with you, man?
- Hey, you know what. I don't play that shit, man.

1090
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:08,400
- You don't play what? - You know what, papi. Stop...
- You don't play what? - That faggot shit!

1091
01:12:08,496 --> 01:12:11,694
Oh man... just because I kiss you
doesn't mean you're a faggot.

1092
01:12:11,763 --> 01:12:13,837
No, it means that you're a faggot
and don't do it again!

1093
01:12:13,902 --> 01:12:17,733
- What you gonna do if I do?
- Nothing, man. Just leave me alone.

1094
01:12:18,058 --> 01:12:21,932
- Why I should I stop it? I dig it.
- Well I don't, man. I'm tellin' you to stop.

1095
01:12:22,668 --> 01:12:25,697
- You don't tell me nothing, boy!
- Alright, Paco. I'm askin' you, uh?

1096
01:12:25,764 --> 01:12:28,332
And you ask me right. You ask me
like a daddy should be asked.

1097
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:30,922
- Hey man, stop threatening on me.
- ¿Y qué?

1098
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,228
Oyeme, negrito. Déjame decirte algo.

1099
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:36,602
Tú a mí me tienes loco.
Me tienes enchulado, man.

1100
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,901
Yo quiero ser tuyo.
Quiero que tú seas mío.

1101
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,607
Dime lo que tú... ¿Qué es lo que
quieres que yo haga por ti?

1102
01:12:42,648 --> 01:12:44,753
Que me dejes quieto, man.
Yo no soy un maricón.

1103
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:48,235
- No estoy diciendo que tú eres maricón, man.
Yo no pienso así. - ¿Y qué tú piensas?

1104
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,242
Que te quiero.

1105
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:54,276
- Que te adoro, nene.
- Oye, yo no soy ningún nene, Paco.

1106
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,940
Tú vas a ser mío.
Tú vas a ser mi nene lindo.

1107
01:12:59,248 --> 01:13:01,051
I know you're a man.

1108
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:04,205
Que Dios bendiga la tierra que tú pise.

1109
01:13:04,325 --> 01:13:07,288
- ¡Echa, que está caliente, Paco!
- Ponme frío, man.

1110
01:13:07,408 --> 01:13:09,819
- Motherfucker, cabrón!
- Oh you little punk!

1111
01:13:09,873 --> 01:13:12,486
- Man, I oughta take you right now!
- Leave me alone, Paco. Come on, déjame.

1112
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:16,520
Nah, man. I don't wanna take you, little brother.
I don't wanna take you the hard way.

1113
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:18,823
Hey man, well that's all you're gonna get
is the hard way to go,

1114
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:20,145
and don't you be callin' me
your brother!

1115
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,586
If you considered me your brother,
would you be tryin' this shit?

1116
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:25,175
Oh man, if my brother
were as pretty as you, yeah.

1117
01:13:25,222 --> 01:13:29,590
- Man, you're sick, Paco!
- What, I'm sick? Don't you say that to me!

1118
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:32,223
Don't you tell me that I'm sick,
you motherfucker!

1119
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:33,835
I'm sick because I'm in love with you?

1120
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:37,431
Man, you use words you don't even know
the meaning of... brother, love.

1121
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:40,542
Shit, there's a gringo who does it to little girls.
Why don't you mess with him? Why?

1122
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:43,754
'Cause he's white and you're scared of whitey,
but you fuck with your own kind.

1123
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:47,999
I'm not scared of nothing or nobody.
Not God, not man, nor spirits.

1124
01:13:48,277 --> 01:13:49,764
And you remember that.

1125
01:13:49,835 --> 01:13:52,684
- But I don't want him. I want you.
- Yeah, well you can't have me, Paco!

1126
01:13:52,824 --> 01:13:56,123
Yeah, well I can take you.
Push come to shove, I could take you.

1127
01:13:56,985 --> 01:13:59,068
But I don't wanna do that, man!

1128
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:02,549
'Cause I know I'm gonna have to
hurt you in the doing.

1129
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:07,079
Look, man... look,
I'll go both ways with you.

1130
01:14:08,687 --> 01:14:10,574
Who you lookin' for? Juan?

1131
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,051
Listen, let me tell you this.

1132
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:16,379
It makes me no motherfuckin' difference
if he does have your back.

1133
01:14:16,714 --> 01:14:20,281
I'm gonna show you that you got a man
that's gonna protect you.

1134
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:24,211
I'm gonna take that freak, and you...

1135
01:14:25,217 --> 01:14:27,556
You... are gonna help me.

1136
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:29,234
What?

1137
01:14:38,472 --> 01:14:41,269
Man, how you let that creep
talk to you like that?

1138
01:14:43,363 --> 01:14:45,964
All you oughta do
is swing and keep swingin'.

1139
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:50,679
Fuck it if you win, man,
and fuck it if you lose.

1140
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:53,187
It makes no difference either way,

1141
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,014
but you got to let him know
that you a man.

1142
01:14:57,621 --> 01:15:02,134
Now I ain't the smartest guy in the joint,
but I know some people you can't talk to, man.

1143
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:05,994
- Some you gonna have to fight 'em!
- Well I took a swing at him, didn't I, Omar?

1144
01:15:06,329 --> 01:15:09,496
Not hard enough.
Not at the right place.

1145
01:15:09,697 --> 01:15:13,339
- You know, you better wait till Juan get back.
- Man, I don't wanna use no Juan.

1146
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:16,466
Aw bullshit, if you drownin',
you'll use anything.

1147
01:15:17,584 --> 01:15:18,638
Uh...

1148
01:15:22,037 --> 01:15:25,714
You's a fine motherfucker, Cupcakes.

1149
01:15:26,659 --> 01:15:28,404
And like I say...

1150
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:31,582
I ain't the smartest guy
in the world...

1151
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,704
but I get the feelin' that you like
being a fine motherfucker and just maybe...

1152
01:15:35,769 --> 01:15:38,776
Hey look, man. Hey, we're gonna do it
to the white freak, bruh.

1153
01:15:41,364 --> 01:15:43,144
I'm down either way.

1154
01:15:44,537 --> 01:15:46,019
What you mean either way, Omar?

1155
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:49,193
I like you, Cupcakes...

1156
01:15:50,407 --> 01:15:53,183
and if you gonna give it up
with an excuse...

1157
01:15:53,794 --> 01:15:55,317
...then I want some.

1158
01:16:00,725 --> 01:16:03,644
Alright, listen up. On the sick call.

1159
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,321
And I don't mean you pill freaks.

1160
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:08,296
If you're not sick...

1161
01:16:08,718 --> 01:16:10,385
...don't come out of your cell.

1162
01:16:13,286 --> 01:16:14,755
<i>Back here, man!</i>

1163
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,193
<i>Aight, move your bottoms up.
Move up against the gate.</i>

1164
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:35,651
Alright, let's go, hurry up.
Column of twos, on the wall.

1165
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,113
- <i>Motherfuckin' God!</i>
- What's wrong with you?

1166
01:16:39,233 --> 01:16:41,690
Some prick almost
broke my arm in the gate.

1167
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:44,825
Hey Juan, get [?], okay?

1168
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,890
- Juan, how was the visit?
- Oh hey, it was beautiful, man.

1169
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:51,173
I told her to chalk up the bail money,
but only to go for the lawyer.

1170
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:53,034
- I think that's more important,
don't you? - That's right.

1171
01:16:53,065 --> 01:16:55,841
If I had someone out there lookin' out for me,
I'd do the same damn thing.

1172
01:16:56,026 --> 01:17:00,129
I say, you know, she ain't very pretty
and she's not very smart, but she's all I got,

1173
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,820
and I burn her every night, brother!
- Look out.

1174
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,651
What's wrong with you?

1175
01:17:04,771 --> 01:17:07,622
I got a white swelling. When you
get the white out, the swelling goes down.

1176
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:09,272
Yeah, okay.

1177
01:17:10,934 --> 01:17:12,512
Aight, let's move out.

1178
01:17:35,308 --> 01:17:36,599
Juan?

1179
01:17:38,271 --> 01:17:39,928
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1180
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,520
Yeah, what is it, Clark?

1181
01:17:45,017 --> 01:17:46,077
Listen, ah...

1182
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:48,190
What I said before...

1183
01:17:48,907 --> 01:17:51,155
You know that's just between
you and me, right?

1184
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,723
I mean, I don't know why I said
all of that stuff.

1185
01:17:54,882 --> 01:17:56,139
It's just that, uh...

1186
01:17:56,184 --> 01:17:58,864
everything was coming down on me
at once and everything.

1187
01:17:59,492 --> 01:18:00,933
Like in the hospital.

1188
01:18:03,371 --> 01:18:05,506
Like, um, my wife...

1189
01:18:05,809 --> 01:18:08,123
She didn't look at me once.
Not once.

1190
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:13,440
Will you please
keep it to yourself, alright?

1191
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:17,619
I mean, I promise I'll go
to seek help this time, I promise.

1192
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:20,365
What happened at the P.I. stand?

1193
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:24,750
Um... well, I don't know.
Nothing happened.

1194
01:18:24,837 --> 01:18:26,531
Did she identify you?

1195
01:18:26,972 --> 01:18:28,129
Did she?

1196
01:18:28,505 --> 01:18:30,763
Uh, I don't know. They just, uh...

1197
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:35,366
Well, they put me with a bunch of guys
that were my own size and weight.

1198
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:37,857
Eh, the whole line-up routine, you know.

1199
01:18:38,624 --> 01:18:39,926
And there was this...

1200
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,569
voice that kept sayin', um...

1201
01:18:42,736 --> 01:18:46,401
It'd say, "Turn around," and it'd say,
"Hello, little girl." Stuff like that.

1202
01:18:46,629 --> 01:18:48,970
Did they ask you to sign
some piece of paper?

1203
01:18:49,055 --> 01:18:50,711
No, I didn't sign anything.

1204
01:18:51,415 --> 01:18:54,659
Well wasn't there a lawyer for you there,
somebody from the courts?

1205
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:59,670
Uh, I don't know. They just hustled me in,
hustled me right back out.

1206
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:02,722
Well that means you have a chance
to beat this case.

1207
01:19:02,763 --> 01:19:04,838
Did they tell you
what they're holding you for?

1208
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:07,038
No, they didn't tell me anything.

1209
01:19:07,723 --> 01:19:10,027
Well if they're rushing the P.I.,

1210
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,748
that only means that they're waiting for
the limitations to run out.

1211
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,636
- Well what does that mean?
- What does that mean?

1212
01:19:17,658 --> 01:19:21,157
That means you're gonna get a chance to
scar up some more little girls' minds.

1213
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:28,111
Juan, why do you say a thing like that...
if you don't know...?

1214
01:19:28,446 --> 01:19:31,331
Juan, why are you doing this to me?
What have I done to you?

1215
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:33,536
Listen, what have
you done to me? It's...

1216
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,932
It's the stance that you're
forcing me to take.

1217
01:19:39,053 --> 01:19:41,883
- You hate me.
- I don't hate you man, but uh...

1218
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:43,643
I hate what you've done.

1219
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,691
I hate what you're capable of doing,
what you might do again.

1220
01:19:47,335 --> 01:19:48,770
You sound like a judge.

1221
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:52,686
Well, in this time and place,
I happen to be your judge.

1222
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:55,163
No you're not.
You are not my judge.

1223
01:19:55,283 --> 01:19:57,572
I am sick and tired
of people judging me!

1224
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,129
Listen, I don't give a fuck
what you're sick and tired of.

1225
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:02,735
And what you told me under pressure...

1226
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:06,909
People do strange things under pressure.

1227
01:20:09,765 --> 01:20:13,254
- I'm not used to this.
- I don't care what you're used to.

1228
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,838
Now I gotta make
some kind of a thing about you.

1229
01:20:15,887 --> 01:20:18,958
- No you don't. You can just let me live.
- Let you live?

1230
01:20:20,823 --> 01:20:23,487
I can't.
I can't make this.

1231
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:27,071
- Hey motherfucker, don't cry on me!
- Why shouldn't I cry?

1232
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:30,515
Why shouldn't I feel sorry for myself?
I got some rights, you know.

1233
01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:35,589
Look, when they come back,
I'm gonna tell 'em what Captain told me.

1234
01:20:35,648 --> 01:20:38,991
That if anybody touches me,
I'm gonna tell. I'm gonna tell 'em!

1235
01:20:39,111 --> 01:20:41,760
- Listen, then you will die.
- Well I don't care!

1236
01:20:42,758 --> 01:20:44,828
Juan, when I came in here, I...

1237
01:20:45,148 --> 01:20:47,541
I'd already been beaten by the police...

1238
01:20:48,526 --> 01:20:52,321
threatened by a mob
that the newspapers created,

1239
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:55,545
and then the judge, for my benefit
and the benefit of society,

1240
01:20:55,665 --> 01:20:59,922
committed me some nut ward,
where I was looked over by some kind of...

1241
01:21:00,925 --> 01:21:03,628
like some kind of god damn animal...

1242
01:21:03,686 --> 01:21:05,067
Yeah, I know the scene.

1243
01:21:05,104 --> 01:21:09,567
No you don't!
Electrodes, sedatives, hypnosis...

1244
01:21:10,553 --> 01:21:13,793
and then some crank nurses
who strapped me to my bed and...

1245
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:17,383
played with my penis to see if I could
get it up for "big girls like us."

1246
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:20,527
- Did it?
- Yes, it did.

1247
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:26,803
You know, my father used to say...

1248
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:31,845
He'd fuck 'em eight to eighty...
blind, crippled, or crazy.

1249
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:41,202
Juan, you're the only
human being I've met in here.

1250
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,296
Come on, man.
Don't try and leave me out,

1251
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:46,289
because I don't know how much of
a human being I would be...

1252
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:48,597
...if I let you make the sidewalks.

1253
01:21:49,836 --> 01:21:50,970
¡Qué barba...!

1254
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:53,175
I don't know how to stop you...

1255
01:21:54,893 --> 01:21:56,917
...short of taking you off the count.

1256
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,958
<i>Aight, give me a column of twos.</i>

1257
01:22:12,578 --> 01:22:15,163
Hey Juan... can I talk to you
for a second?

1258
01:22:18,002 --> 01:22:19,439
Yeah, Ice. What is it?

1259
01:22:21,426 --> 01:22:25,766
Uh, do you remember what was said
after the, um... last riots here?

1260
01:22:25,864 --> 01:22:28,093
Come on, you should, man.
You suggested it, didn't you?

1261
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:31,237
- Yeah, I remember everything
that was said. - Everything?

1262
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,933
Anything that affected the whole floor,
we hold council on it.

1263
01:22:39,363 --> 01:22:41,379
Well the freak affects the whole floor.

1264
01:22:42,182 --> 01:22:44,903
- What's happening, man?
- He's white like I am.

1265
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:46,996
And you ain't got no right,
according to the rules,

1266
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:49,030
to take his back if he's stuff.

1267
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:52,108
- He isn't stuff.
- Well we say he is.

1268
01:22:52,179 --> 01:22:54,317
- Who says that he is?
- I say that he is.

1269
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:58,595
Besides which, man... anybody that
rapes little girls is a faggot.

1270
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:01,256
He is stuff, squeeze.

1271
01:23:01,438 --> 01:23:04,511
- I say he ain't.
- You ain't got no say in this.

1272
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:06,130
Oh he got say.

1273
01:23:06,829 --> 01:23:09,391
Not that it means anything,
but he got say, right?

1274
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:12,130
- Paco, be cool.
- Yeah, Paco. You be very cool.

1275
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,753
This ain't necessary.

1276
01:23:13,937 --> 01:23:16,251
And neither is your
gettin' in the way of the council.

1277
01:23:17,147 --> 01:23:20,276
The council was set up to help,
not to destroy.

1278
01:23:20,423 --> 01:23:22,927
Oh, "the council was
set up to help, not to destroy."

1279
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:26,961
Man, will you listen to this, man?
Very, very pretty bullshit.

1280
01:23:27,835 --> 01:23:31,061
He's fuckin' Cupcakes and now
he wants the freak for himself too.

1281
01:23:31,109 --> 01:23:32,973
Man, ain't nobody fuckin' me, Paco.

1282
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:38,493
Maybe not yet...
but he's settin' you up to.

1283
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:41,973
Giving you all that fatherly advice,
my fuckin' ass!

1284
01:23:43,295 --> 01:23:45,489
He is just like El Raheem.

1285
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,211
He wants to fuck you too.

1286
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:50,503
Puttin' the wisdom in front of
the knowledge and all that shit!

1287
01:23:51,982 --> 01:23:54,346
He's callin' you a girl!
That's what he means by that.

1288
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,338
And Omar...

1289
01:23:57,131 --> 01:24:01,503
...playing exercises with you so you can
take showers together, right?

1290
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,579
Right?

1291
01:24:03,887 --> 01:24:05,045
And Shoe...

1292
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:08,930
...giving the kid some cigarettes
and some short-heist books.

1293
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:12,838
Aw man, everybody wants
to fuck you, Cupcakes.

1294
01:24:14,528 --> 01:24:15,668
Cupcakes...

1295
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,259
Ice gave you that name, didn't he?

1296
01:24:20,023 --> 01:24:22,844
Ain't that your woman's name
out on the block, Ice?

1297
01:24:33,576 --> 01:24:35,347
Ain't nobody sayin' anything.

1298
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:37,855
Why?

1299
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,435
'Cause I hit the truth.

1300
01:24:42,422 --> 01:24:43,919
Pushed that little button.

1301
01:24:44,172 --> 01:24:47,593
Everybody on this motherfuckin' floor
is trying to cop,

1302
01:24:47,757 --> 01:24:50,052
and the only one
that's gettin' his share is Juan.

1303
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:54,028
And now he wants
the white freak for himself, too.

1304
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:56,752
You know, man, you are sick.

1305
01:24:57,991 --> 01:24:59,672
- ¡Tu madre...!
- Nah! No, no!

1306
01:24:59,745 --> 01:25:01,858
¡Tu madre, hijo de la gran puta, cabrón!

1307
01:25:01,978 --> 01:25:04,643
- Let him go! - No!
- Let that motherfucker go!

1308
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:06,127
Hell no!

1309
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,328
- Why you fightin' over
some bullshit for? - Let me go.

1310
01:25:11,814 --> 01:25:12,977
I'm cool.

1311
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:16,594
Okay, Juan. You check this out...

1312
01:25:18,009 --> 01:25:19,469
I want him!

1313
01:25:21,152 --> 01:25:24,790
Longshoe is white, he says it's okay.
That means that he wants him.

1314
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,425
And Omar wants a piece,

1315
01:25:27,741 --> 01:25:29,226
and so does El Raheem.

1316
01:25:29,807 --> 01:25:32,482
El... El, are you in this too?

1317
01:25:34,139 --> 01:25:36,212
He's a whitey, a devil.

1318
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:38,187
Anything goes.

1319
01:25:38,357 --> 01:25:40,107
What about you, Cupcakes?

1320
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:42,594
Julio...

1321
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,026
- Julio...
- Come on, man.

1322
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:47,890
It's either him or...

1323
01:25:49,074 --> 01:25:50,438
I'll go with you, Paco.

1324
01:25:54,205 --> 01:25:57,709
You punk, you little fucking punk...

1325
01:25:58,902 --> 01:26:01,933
Did everything I say to you
just go in one ear and out the other?

1326
01:26:02,475 --> 01:26:04,467
What do you want to be an animal too?

1327
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:06,678
You're gonna let this place
destroy you?

1328
01:26:07,867 --> 01:26:09,592
- Ice?
- What?

1329
01:26:10,203 --> 01:26:11,592
Which way, man?

1330
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:17,865
- Man, I don't want no part of it.
- You what?

1331
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,325
- You don't want a part of it?
- You heard me.

1332
01:26:21,161 --> 01:26:22,560
Juan is right.

1333
01:26:24,964 --> 01:26:28,385
- This places makes animals out of us.
- Ah man! - Ah man what?

1334
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,388
You think you know anybody here
good enough to take me?

1335
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,709
Take us.

1336
01:26:33,237 --> 01:26:36,285
- If that's the way you want it.
- Hey motherfucker, that's the way it is!

1337
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:40,441
- Ice... you don't have to
take whole part. - Dig that!

1338
01:26:41,098 --> 01:26:44,302
You my man, but you stickin' up
for that honkey is wrong.

1339
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,988
You goin' upstate, you know that.

1340
01:26:47,212 --> 01:26:48,671
But Juan here...

1341
01:26:50,724 --> 01:26:54,227
He's likely to hit the street.
He got somebody out there, you don't.

1342
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:56,309
Only thing you got is a plea to cop.

1343
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:00,221
You know, I dig you a whole lot,
but what you doing is wrong, man, it's wrong.

1344
01:27:00,285 --> 01:27:03,841
You don't have to take part.
Play chickie, that's all.

1345
01:27:04,313 --> 01:27:06,335
- Play chickie.
- Dig it.

1346
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:09,867
Okay, I'll play chickie.

1347
01:27:10,301 --> 01:27:12,288
You still got me to deal with, man.

1348
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,840
Come on, Ice, grab him.

1349
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,379
- Come on!
- I got 'em! - Ice, Ice!

1350
01:27:16,549 --> 01:27:18,992
- I got 'em! - Ow!
All right, okay, all right.

1351
01:27:19,018 --> 01:27:20,586
- Who got 'em?
- Got 'em? - I got 'em!

1352
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:22,832
Come on, man, come on.
Who gonna stick him first?

1353
01:27:22,892 --> 01:27:25,876
- Wait! - <i>Kick his ass, too.</i>
- <i>Stay out of it.</i> - <i>Don't beef.</i> - <i>Stop 'em!</i>

1354
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:28,527
Mr. Nett, don't think you can
walk away from this!

1355
01:27:29,115 --> 01:27:31,175
Okay, look, do what you want.
Just leave me alone.

1356
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:34,887
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me, please.

1357
01:27:37,467 --> 01:27:41,096
- Man, it ain't Cupcakes, but it will do.
- No! I'll tell the Captain!

1358
01:27:41,216 --> 01:27:44,194
- I'll bring you all before the courts!
- You're gonna do what?

1359
01:27:44,277 --> 01:27:46,088
He's gonna squeal.
He's gonna rat us out.

1360
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:47,396
Shut up, shut up!

1361
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:49,432
- <i>I didn't even like him.</i>
- <i>Come on, you gotta let me through.</i>

1362
01:27:49,459 --> 01:27:51,946
Now look, you're in this too, Ice.
We all gonna get more time.

1363
01:27:51,996 --> 01:27:54,339
I'll see that you get life,
you son of a bitch!

1364
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,186
- I'll lose my job.
- I'll see you all go to jail!

1365
01:27:57,253 --> 01:27:59,622
Come on, shut up, shut up,
you crazy mother...!

1366
01:27:59,712 --> 01:28:01,841
I ain't gonna do
any more time than I have to!

1367
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,642
- No, Paco. That's murder.
- Kill the motherfuckin' rat!

1368
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,510
- Kill the motherfucker!
- Kill him in self-defense!

1369
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:08,327
It's still a suicide.
He did it to himself.

1370
01:28:08,374 --> 01:28:10,868
Kill him, kill him!
Kill the sick motherfucker!

1371
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:12,716
No!

1372
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:17,816
- Yeah! - No! - He's a devil, man.
Kill him! - Kill him!

1373
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:20,475
Come on, man. You said the devil
was gonna die anyway!

1374
01:28:21,191 --> 01:28:24,810
- Shit! - <i>Man, don't kill him!</i>
- Man, hold him, man. Hold him!

1375
01:28:24,961 --> 01:28:27,515
- Cut his throat! - Yeah, cut his throat!
- Cut his throat!

1376
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:30,048
- Do it, El! Do it, do it!
- Be chill, do it.

1377
01:28:30,242 --> 01:28:32,276
- Kill him!
- Do it, El. Do it!

1378
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:35,307
- Come on, nigger. Kill him.
- No!

1379
01:28:35,427 --> 01:28:38,906
- No! - Kill him! - Do it, El!
- Come on, nigger. Kill him! - Do it!

1380
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:40,954
Kill him, kill him...

1381
01:28:41,563 --> 01:28:42,655
Kill him.

1382
01:28:43,879 --> 01:28:45,195
I can't do it, man.

1383
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,821
What do you mean you can't do it?
You talk about killing whitey every day.

1384
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:50,795
Man, let the honkey up
and let him fight, then I can kill him.

1385
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:53,579
Kill him laying down, sitting, standing up,
either way he's dead.

1386
01:28:53,654 --> 01:28:55,683
- <i>Quick!</i>
- Please, please, don't kill me!

1387
01:28:55,726 --> 01:28:58,362
I won't tell anybody!
I won't tell anybody!

1388
01:28:58,853 --> 01:29:00,107
I got a wife and kid!

1389
01:29:00,164 --> 01:29:03,242
- I don't wanna do anything I said!
- Allahu Akbar, you...!

1390
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:14,606
Give me that knife, punk.

1391
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:46,119
<i>Brown! Report an accident!</i>

1392
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:34,776
Aight, listen up!

1393
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:36,466
On the lockout!

1394
01:30:48,787 --> 01:30:50,888
Let's go, let's go! Shit!

1395
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:59,603
- Oh shit! - Oh, this motherfucker!
- What the hell!

1396
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:13,875
All right, knock it off, men.

1397
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:19,967
I'm Captain Allard, men.

1398
01:31:21,765 --> 01:31:26,146
I'm here investigating the terrible tragedy
that occurred here today.

1399
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:29,445
And I'm satisfied...

1400
01:31:31,743 --> 01:31:33,400
...that it was a suicide.

1401
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:41,027
But I would like to state
that I and Clark Davis' parents...

1402
01:31:41,687 --> 01:31:43,828
...hold you all morally guilty.

1403
01:31:46,148 --> 01:31:50,383
If you had taken some time out from
your own problems to help this poor man,

1404
01:31:50,619 --> 01:31:53,504
that was placed in here
because of mistaken identity...

1405
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,095
Knock it off, men!

1406
01:31:57,641 --> 01:32:01,262
Now we took him down for
a positive identification line-up...

1407
01:32:02,007 --> 01:32:06,532
and the person who Mr. Davis
was supposed to have assaulted...

1408
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,461
...was not in her right mind.

1409
01:32:10,059 --> 01:32:13,150
She had already pointed out two,
maybe five other men...

1410
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,747
...as the man who assaulted her.

1411
01:32:17,175 --> 01:32:20,640
Clark Davis was an innocent victim
of circumstances!

1412
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:22,987
Innocent!

1413
01:32:26,904 --> 01:32:28,328
Good night, men.

1414
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,441
All right, on the lock-in.

1415
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:39,464
- ...fuckin' white man,
always with a black man. - Let's go!

1416
01:32:39,816 --> 01:32:42,751
The man was guilty.
I know, I could tell it from his eyes.

1417
01:32:42,829 --> 01:32:44,248
He did himself.

1418
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:46,873
Hey man, the kid was clean.

1419
01:32:53,222 --> 01:32:57,204
<i>Someday I'm gonna be walking down
the streets, minding my own business...</i>

1420
01:32:57,324 --> 01:32:58,661
...and bam!

1421
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:03,421
I'm gonna be shot by some pig
who's gonna swear that it was a mistake.

1422
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:07,000
I accept that as a part of my destiny.

1423
01:33:07,925 --> 01:33:10,827
Si es mi destino morir en la calle
como un perro.

1424
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:24,865
<i>¡Ay Dios mío!</i>

1425
01:33:27,595 --> 01:33:29,304
So don't worry about me.

1426
01:33:29,843 --> 01:33:34,185
<i>Okay, Mercado. Get your shit together!
You're on the bail.</i>

1427
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,881
<i>¡Juan, sácame de aquí por favor!
¡Quiero salir!</i>

1428
01:33:44,336 --> 01:33:49,780
<i>Juan, ¡sácame de aquí!
¡No puedo soportarlo más! ¡Ayúdame!</i>

1429
01:33:55,985 --> 01:33:57,185
<i>Juan!</i>

1430
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:58,672
<i>Juan!</i>

1431
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:00,485
<i>Juan!</i>

1432
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:10,079
- <i>All right, on the gate!</i>
- <i>¡Ayúdame, sácame!</i>

1433
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:12,440
<i>¡No puedo, ayúdame!</i>

1434
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:18,774
Peace.

1435
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:30,434
Ey, Juan.

1436
01:34:32,203 --> 01:34:34,598
Dime la verdad del tipo ese,
que tú sabes.

1437
01:34:35,593 --> 01:34:38,596
And what's there to tell? You got it all
under your belt, don't you?

1438
01:34:38,972 --> 01:34:40,178
Hey Juan.

1439
01:34:41,464 --> 01:34:44,068
You better tell this kid something.
He thinks you some kind of a guru.

1440
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:45,656
If you don't tell him something,
he's gonna go out there

1441
01:34:45,675 --> 01:34:48,187
and run this thing down on
somebody who shouldn't hear it.

1442
01:34:50,697 --> 01:34:52,324
Can you dig what I'm saying, right?

1443
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:57,652
Cupcakes, I've killed and I'm not afraid
to do it again, you understand me?

1444
01:34:57,913 --> 01:35:00,732
<i>Okay, Mercado, let's go.
Get your ass out of here.</i>

1445
01:35:00,852 --> 01:35:03,861
<i>Hey Paco, what are they
doing down there?</i>

1446
01:35:04,015 --> 01:35:05,688
Oye, espera. No corras.

1447
01:35:05,857 --> 01:35:07,573
Just one thing, brother.

1448
01:35:07,887 --> 01:35:10,457
Your fear of this place
stole your spirit.

1449
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,321
And this ain't no pawnshop.

1450
01:35:21,764 --> 01:35:24,059
Yo Cupcakes, I mean Julio!

1451
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:27,905
Hey listen, little brother.
Hey, do me a favor when you get out.

1452
01:35:28,254 --> 01:35:31,735
You know, call my woman, and tell her
I say to come up and see me, man.

1453
01:35:31,794 --> 01:35:35,017
You know, say it's important.
Okay, little brother?

1454
01:35:41,384 --> 01:35:43,600
<i>See you in Sing Sing, Cupcakes!</i>

1455
01:35:44,263 --> 01:35:46,354
<i>Don't O.D. on me, sucka!</i>

1456
01:36:11,538 --> 01:36:13,904
<i>Shit, I ain't lost him yet.</i>

1457
01:36:18,901 --> 01:36:20,378
<i>Aw shit...</i>
