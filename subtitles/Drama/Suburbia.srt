1
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:35,460
Thanks a lot.

2
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:37,817
Sure. Where are you going?

3
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,700
To the end of the highway.

4
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,900
You are not running away
from home, are you?

5
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:51,802
Did you hear me?

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mummy...

7
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Hi, mom! Any more groceries out in the car?

8
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,473
No, couldn't afford any more groceries.

9
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,000
How come you're so late?

10
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,350
Stopped by for a couple of drinks
with someone from work.

11
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,500
Any objections?
-No, I was just wondering...

12
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,055
Evan!!! -What?
Don't scream like that.

13
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,406
I marked this label, you know.
-You did what?

14
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,466
I said I marked it.

15
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,720
And now not the hell of a lot
left in where I marked.

16
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:36,750
Well, I didn't drink it.
-You're lying to me.

17
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:39,100
I swear to god, it must have been you.
-Breathe on me.

18
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,650
Come on...
-Come on! Breathe on me!

19
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,059
God damn you!
I told you to throw out this trash this morning.

20
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,467
Wait, mom, I forgot,
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,380
Sorry? Don't tell me to cool it.
God damn it!

22
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,900
I don't wanna work all day so you could
sit on your ass and read comic books.

23
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,700
You make me sick when you look like that.

24
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:15,650
It's your father in you.
Makes me sick...

25
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,700
Well, that's not my fault.

26
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,400
I didn't choose him to be
my father, you did.

27
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,300
Yeah, and that was the biggest
mistake I ever made.

28
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,881
Where are you going?

29
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,320
I'm going away for a while.
Mom's having a hard time right now.

30
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,290
But I don't want you to go anywhere.
-It's ok, and it's for the best.

31
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,220
She'll be better when she has
one kid to take care of.

32
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,000
You understand.

33
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,000
But where are you gonna go?
-I don't know. I'll find somewhere.

34
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
Just don't worry about it.
I'll call you up some time, ok?

35
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,062
SUBURBIA

36
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,100
<i>Now, what's this guy?
-Get a job.</i>

37
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,950
Come on. Have some
fucking fun. Move up.

38
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,616
Come on, you've got some money there!
-I spent it all on this...

39
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,280
Now, remember, watch the floor.

40
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,406
Speedily follow down their clashes by [...]

41
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,383
so bouncers know where the trouble is. Okay?

42
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,661
Hey, get going out of there!

43
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,113
Hey, what about some drugs?

44
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,950
Black triangles, man.
They are fucking excellent, I'm telling you.

45
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,500
OK, if you change your mind,
I'm here.

46
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,200
I think I'd like to fuck your brains out.

47
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,670
What?
-I said I think I'd like to fuck your brains out.

48
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh you would, huh?
Yeah, but it doesn't look like you have any.

49
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,703
Hey, cut it off! Hey, leave her alone!
Come on you homos!

50
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,534
Perfect example
of punk rock aggressiveness.

51
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,381
Gonna get this club closed down
or something before...

52
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
You, guys, have minds this big.

53
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,716
All right, listen up, now get off!

54
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,209
[...] turn that spot off, stupid!
And I'll give her goddamn clothes back!

55
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,767
And you guys wanna hear more music you
give her clothes back right now, suckers!

56
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,862
Attention, please!
Don't [...] and give her clothes back!

57
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,809
All right, that's, fine, show's over.

58
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,721
You guys are blowing your own city now.

59
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,400
Fuck you!

60
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,198
That's fucking typical.

61
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,935
<i>All right, give them the muzak.</i>

62
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,672
Come on, kid, on your feet.
Party's over.

63
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:08,445
<i>You're such a fucking bitch.
You're so stupid, I swear that.</i>

64
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,800
Get out.

65
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,633
And don't kick my car, pig!
-You call that a car?

66
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,200
What a total asshole!

67
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,247
Hey, kid, pretty fucked up, huh?
-Aha.

68
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,500
Get up. Need a lift home?

69
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,200
I can't go home.
-Can't sleep on the grass.

70
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:39,047
The snails will crawl on your face.
Come on.

71
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,524
What's your name?
-Jack.

72
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,987
Jack?

73
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah, Jack Diddley.

74
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,750
Looks like it's starting to rain.

75
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,500
No, that's just the acid rain

76
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:01,850
that comes down every night
about this time.

77
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,900
Oh, yeah?

78
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,889
Did you hear of a guy named Joe Schmo?
-Nope, never.

79
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,950
Well, his old man's a homo and he
can't stand living with him anymore,

80
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:22,308
so we're gonna go to pick him up
and take him out to the T.R. house, ok?

81
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,920
What's T.R. house?

82
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,616
It's one of those houses out by the 605.

83
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,642
County bought them up years ago

84
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:31,800
and just left then sitting there
all boarded up and rotting.

85
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,700
A bunch of us live in one of them.

86
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,900
It's pretty trashed but it's free.
Are you up for it?

87
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,415
It's not like I have anywhere else to go.

88
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Keep going, fuckers.

89
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,393
My old man's a cop.
He's my stepdad.

90
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,967
My real father died in Vietnam
and mom got married again.

91
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,183
God, your stepdad's a cop.
-Yeah, that's not the worst of it though.

92
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,250
He's black.
-Black? God! What a drag!

93
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,804
Yeah, he came over to T.R.
one time to check it out.

94
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,852
Told everyone he was my father.

95
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,300
They laughed him right outta the door.

96
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,700
Parents are so lame.

97
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,742
What's that?
-My mom's diary. Listen to this.

98
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,895
May 10th, 1968. Dear diary, Mark
and I are gonna be very happy here.

99
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,275
The air is clear, skies are blue, and all
the houses are brand new and beautiful.

100
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,500
They call it "suburbia" and
that word's perfect

101
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:09,423
because it's a combination of
the words "suburb" and "utopia".

102
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,781
They didn't realize it would
be the slum of the future.

103
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,350
I'm sure with Mark's job at Lockheed

104
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,900
I'll never have to work again.

105
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,577
Huh, you wish...

106
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,400
Oh, and by the way, diary,
we want to have a child soon.

107
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,398
Suburbia is a great place for children.

108
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,739
And if it's a boy we're gonna name him
Evan Mark Johnson.

109
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,800
You know, sometimes I wish
she would have had an abortion.

110
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,140
Oh, yeah? They were illegal
in those days.

111
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,432
Hand me one of those bottles, will you?

112
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,139
I hate buses.

113
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,224
Hi, ya. Joe here?
-Hello, Jack.

114
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Where's Joe?
-In his bedroom.

115
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,749
See if you can wake him up.
I gave up three hours ago.

116
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,400
Dad, I thought I told you
to leave that alone.

117
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,850
Oh, it's you...
What's going on?

118
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,200
Moving out again, hey, Joe?
Don't I even get a good-bye this time?

119
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,687
Later days.

120
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,539
Hey, look at those dogs over there.

121
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,144
Yeah, they are kind of nasty.
You gotta watch out for them.

122
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,300
I heard they killed a little kid
out here the other day. - No shit?

123
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,300
Where do they come from?

124
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,980
Well, I heard that when people were forced
to move from their houses,

125
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
that some of them left
their dogs behind them.

126
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,753
Coyotes came down from
the hills and fucked them.

127
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,550
After a while... wild dogs!

128
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,937
Jees! That's pretty amazing.
-Where did you hear that from?

129
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,038
There is a welcoming committee.

130
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,234
Close your windows.
-Shit, I'm stuck.

131
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,825
Oh, my god!

132
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,100
Fleabags. Razzle - one of the guys
of the house - captured a couple of them.

133
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,275
He thinks he can train them,
but we think he's a little bit tweaked.

134
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,139
What's up?

135
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,850
Shit, I forgot something.

136
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,357
You wanna be next?
-Huh?

137
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,949
A haircut.
How about a haircut?

138
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,223
Ah, no, thanks,
I just had a haircut.

139
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,078
You did? Could have fooled me!

140
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,450
Slim pickings.

141
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:20,550
Come on.

142
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey, Jack. Who's that girl
getting a haircut?

143
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,496
Ah, that's Sheila.

144
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,181
<i>Ha-ha-ha, that's very funny. Stay with us,
we'll be back after these messages.</i>

145
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,724
<i>Are you experiencing feelings of alienation
and depression or loneliness?</i>

146
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,725
<i>We at Southwest Woodside Hospital
know that these are cry for help.</i>

147
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,370
<i>We're only a phone call away.</i>

148
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,680
Oh yeah? I know somebody checked in
in one of those places.

149
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,950
And you know what they cost?

150
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,782
What?
-800 bucks a week.

151
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,900
What did you say?

152
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,200
I said if you had 800 bucks a week,

153
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
you probably wouldn't be
depressed in the first place.

154
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,170
That's true. What's your name?
-Evan.

155
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,850
Did you get a burn, Evan?
-A burn?

156
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,900
Now, what's a burn?

157
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,950
Nobody is supposed to stay here
unless he gets a burn.

158
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,100
See. It's kinda nice.
Comes out like this.

159
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,700
Jesus, that will be there all your life.

160
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,700
Well, that's the idea.
See, if we didn't do that

161
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,650
we'd had all finds of flakes
hanging around.

162
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, that's may be a stupid question, but
what does it stand for anyways?

163
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,150
Stands for "rejected".

164
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,150
Sounds really stupid to me.

165
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,900
Yeah. Well, stupid or not,
I don't have anywhere else to go.

166
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,100
It's like some kind of ridiculous
initiation of something.

167
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:55,600
So?
-So, I'm leaving.

168
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,700
Do you wanna me to drive you back?

169
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:04,245
No, I'll hitch.
Ain't you got better things to do?

170
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,231
Watch out for big bad wolf.
-The dogs, watch out for the dogs.

171
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,341
Dad? Let me in, it's me.

172
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,499
Came back?
-Oh, yeah.

173
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,855
How come?
-Well, because...

174
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,543
Well, I'll tell you about it some day.
If I ever get to know you better.

175
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:10,008
Are you gonna get a burn?
-I guess so.

176
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,700
And I thought twice about getting mine.
-Is that right? Why not?

177
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,190
Because I've got so many scars already.
-What kind of scars?

178
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:24,285
Hmm... This kind.

179
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,500
Jesus! What's that from?

180
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,868
I'll tell you about it some day
if I ever get to know you better.

181
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,121
What's going on?

182
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:44,619
Looks like they are killing the dogs.

183
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
They are not killing my dogs.

184
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,503
Where are you going?
Come back!

185
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
These are my dogs.

186
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,465
What the hell are you dressed up for?
-Yeah. - Where's the war?

187
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,986
Up your ass.
-Up your ass?

188
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,059
I'd like the long end of this rifle up your ass.
-[Wait it], Skinner, look.

189
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
What's the occasion?

190
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,451
We just thought we're doing
our good Americans' work for the day.

191
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,300
Did you hear about the little boy
that got killed by the dogs the other day?

192
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,690
We heard of that.
-Hey, we've got a little one over here.

193
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,702
[Put] that god damn gun.

194
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,550
Well, little ones grow up
to be big ones, you know.

195
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,250
Have you got papers for these guns?

196
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,486
Officer, we are from
"Citizens against Crime".

197
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,497
Most citizens are against crime, sir.

198
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,200
The question was do you have
papers for the guns?

199
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
Guns are all registered.

200
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,058
Jim Tripplett? Bob Skokes?
-That's right.

201
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:32,200
You know it's against law
to use fire arms

202
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,650
inside the city limits, don't you?

203
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,304
Yes, sir, we sure do, but this side of the street
is county property.

204
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,300
May be if decide to come back again

205
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,350
we should inform
the department or officer... Rennard.

206
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,602
May be you should.
-I know what you're probably thinking.

207
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,031
You just don't like private citizens
doing your work for you.

208
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,578
You're right.

209
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:54,618
By the way, officer,
is that legal inside of city limits?

210
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,010
What the hell?

211
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,991
Hey, may be we should look into there.
-No, that's our job. We'll handle.

212
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,386
Got a big kick out of
shooting that dog, didn't you?

213
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,600
Yeah, it's kinda fun.

214
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,612
Fu-uck.

215
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,600
That car looks awful to me.
Maybe we should run a make on it.

216
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,650
It should. This car I gave
my son Jack last year

217
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,550
when I bought my new one.

218
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,225
It sure looks like he's fucked it up.

219
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,765
Son of bitch, that IS your old Ford.
Come on, let's go check the place out.

220
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
No, I'm more worried
about our vigilante sharp shooters

221
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,215
then I am about a bunch of
teenagers in a crash pad.

222
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,700
There's one.
Hoodi-doo, hoodi-doo!

223
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,456
Mew! Bye, kitty.

224
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,417
Ha-ha, that was so close!

225
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,825
The big guy would have sat on me!

226
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Garage sale

227
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,300
"When guns are outlawed
only outlaws will have guns"

228
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,696
It's a nice camper.

229
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
But if you're so in love with it,
why are you selling it?

230
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,762
Oh, we don't want to.
Got a lot of money tied up in this.

231
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,491
Yeah, you know, we've used it just about
every weekend for the last three years, but...

232
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,152
since the layoff we had to cut back
a little on recreation.

233
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,666
Oh, you were with GM?

234
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:31,364
12 long years.
-14 for me.

235
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,050
It's a helluva amount.

236
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,379
Makes it tough to get out and have
a good time when you can't afford the gas.

237
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,805
I'll tell you what.
Let me think about it.

238
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,600
Maybe I'll give you a call.
Have a nice day!

239
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,600
Have a nice day in my ass.

240
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
<i>We can't work, can't hunt,</i>

241
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,350
<i>can't get sold the damn camper,
can't do jackshit.</i>

242
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,691
Come on, let me buy you a beer.

243
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,020
Is there something special
you're looking for?

244
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,310
Yeah. Got any vibrators?

245
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,600
Not you again!

246
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,126
You know what he said?
If we had any vibrators.

247
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,800
Go, bastards and chickenshits!

248
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,900
Oh, somebody's been
on a garage raid.

249
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,550
French fries!!!

250
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,900
<i>If you are at least 18 years old you may
designate a donation of your body or heart[...]</i>

251
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,032
<i>for medical transplanting in case of your death.</i>

252
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,700
If you are looking for fine quality sofas,
look no more.

253
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,200
Today and tomorrow only
with name brand new low prices

254
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,500
you can have the sofa you've been looking for
plus the matching chair

255
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,750
at a price you'd expect to pay
for just a sofa.

256
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,274
Where are you going, kid?
-Get a drink of water.

257
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,749
Here, sit down. Drink this.
Water is no good.

258
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,765
Just here or everywhere?
-Everywhere.

259
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,650
Yeah, you never know
where the toxins are gonna creep in.

260
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,173
My aunt lived in a house that was built
on a hazardous waste dump.

261
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,050
Last April she had a baby and it
was born with no ears.

262
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,578
No ears? Fuck...

263
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,350
Yeah, I know these people who had a baby
that was born with two rows of teeth on top.

264
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,773
Jesus, this seems kind of a monster.

265
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:51,250
Yeah, just think. By the year 2000
there will be one big chemical wasteland.

266
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,550
Yeah, all contaminated and creepy
with gross, bubbling vines

267
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,050
hanging off the dead trees.

268
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,783
And the mutants will be roaming around
bumping into each other.

269
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,834
Yeah, my dad was in Vietnam and he had some
of that Asian orange crap dumped on 'im.

270
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,700
It had some adverse effects.
-Like what?

271
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,700
Hmm, his fingernails fell out,
loss of sexual appetite and...

272
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,213
this!

273
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,937
Hey, guess what?
-What?

274
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,500
Chicken butt!

275
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,150
So, I walked in the house and my father,
he threw me down on the living room floor

276
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,900
and held me there. And my mother
cut all my clothes off with the pair of scissors.

277
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,400
And then they made me stand there while
they burned them right in front of me.

278
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,600
You know, I was nude.

279
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,197
Really? All because they didn't like
the way you dress?

280
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,932
Yeah. And I looked just the way I do now.
I don't know what their problem was.

281
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:51,200
Hey, Jack.
What's with that Sheila girl?

282
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,397
Yeah, she is pretty weird. Why?

283
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,865
I don't know. She bugs me.
She's always staring at me.

284
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,227
She is? I heard she doesn't
even like guys.

285
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,184
What do you mean?
She likes girls?

286
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,094
No, no. I heard she hates sex.

287
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,100
How can anybody hate sex?

288
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,089
You're asking the wrong guy.

289
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:17,666
She looks so sad all the time.

290
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,700
These poor little
rich bitches always look that way.

291
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,500
Razzle told me she tried to
kill herself a couple of times.

292
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,800
Really?
-Yeah. He asked why.

293
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,336
You know what she said? -What?
-She said: pick a reason.

294
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,000
Hey, Cream, Cheese!
I know this is what you have been waiting for.

295
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,400
Ya, ya. Come here.
Come on. Sit!

296
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,003
Hey, check it out,
they did it!

297
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,300
What?

298
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,964
Chicken butt!

299
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,335
Oh, my god...

300
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,700
I wept.

301
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,581
Count: "1001", "1002".
This makes about two seconds.

302
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,200
Hey, stupid muck!

303
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,750
See what happens
when you get so wiped out?

304
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,800
You gotta stop bringing dope around here.

305
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:39,579
You're like some old 60's hippy dirt merchant.
-Yeah, groovy, man.

306
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,104
Thanks for helping me out, brother.

307
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,150
You must be a Pisces.

308
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,998
Jeez, this person looks like
a worse driver than me.

309
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,179
My mom's got a car like that.

310
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,200
Vehicle, driven by 35-year-old
Jina Johnson, came...

311
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,126
That IS her car!

312
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,390
Three shoppers were seriously injured

313
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:08,900
and Mrs. Johnson was booked
on felony drunk drive.

314
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:10,979
Nice going, mom.

315
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,900
Hey, bike!
Get me a bike!

316
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Do I have to go to school?

317
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,974
No. Not for a while anyways.
-All right!

318
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,890
This is the cool band.
I think the lead singer a real...

319
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:43,500
Where's the house, Flea?
-Hold on, it's coming, it's coming.

320
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,600
Come on. We've been driving
around for hours... days, weeks.

321
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,500
Hey, my name is Razzle, man.

322
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,810
Oh, there it is!

323
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,534
9 out of 10 Americans would perish
in an all-out nuclear attack.

324
00:44:58,535 --> 00:45:03,600
Not all would die instantly. Many fatalities
would be delayed for days or weeks

325
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,300
until the effects of injuries, burns
and radiation sickness took their toll.

326
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:13,656
And death from radiation is almost always
excruciatingly painful and prolonged.

327
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,850
Any survivors of an initial onslaught
would be four times more likely

328
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:23,486
to suffer from leukemia, sterility,
inherited disorders, birth defects

329
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,431
and other conditions
which wreck havoc on living cells.

330
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,750
If you do not live
in a possible target zone

331
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,075
it would seem to be little point
building a blast-proof shelter

332
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,300
because they need to be built
of very expensive materials

333
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,007
and most people
don't have that kind of money.

334
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,215
Tell me now.
-Tell you what?

335
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,588
What happened to your back.

336
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,043
Well... My dad used to beat me all the time.

337
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,779
That's what I thought you were going to say.

338
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,300
You'd think he was crazy.
He would get this look in his eye

339
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,539
and I would know, "Oh-oh... trouble".

340
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,750
He'd wake up in the night
and get touching me all over.

341
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,300
He got all turned on, you know,
and instead of actually raping me

342
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,753
he would stop himself by beating me up.
Does that make any sense?

343
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Hey, where are you going?
Are you all right?

344
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,350
Hey, what does that "T.R." stand for?
"Totally ridiculous"?

345
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,200
Heh, that guy's begging for it.

346
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,366
Come on, fucker.

347
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,632
Hey, there's Skinner.

348
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,072
All right! That's enough of that.

349
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,966
Get away from my house.

350
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,001
Now!

351
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,872
Hey, what was that all about?

352
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,077
Just a couple of assholes
looking for a fight.

353
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,450
Do you think they're
gonna come inside, do you?

354
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,700
No, this isn't their kind of scene.

355
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,600
Yeah, one of those guys had a knife.
-Don't worry about it.

356
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,213
Wimps like that always carry knives.

357
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,299
Oh, shit...

358
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,435
Do I need a stamp to get out of here too?
-Watch it, smartass.

359
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,331
Hey!
You've got a rat on your shoulder.

360
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,950
Take your jacket off, hide the "T.R."
-What for?

361
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,538
We'll tell you later.
Just do it.

362
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,413
Ain't you got finally your turn to sleep in the bed?
-I sure am.

363
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,400
It's kinda like my bed was at home.

364
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,949
But the sheets were cleaner at home.

365
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:08,079
Ethan? Do you miss your mom?
-Yeah, I kinda do.

366
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,859
But I bet she doesn't miss me.
-Why do you say that?

367
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,981
Because she used to always call me
a pain in the ass. That's why.

368
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,685
Ahh... I bet she didn't mean it.
You're a real good little kid.

369
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,950
All that you do is play all day and
mind your own business, you're sweet.

370
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,672
"Have you hugged YOUR kid today"?
-So fuck off, Razzle.

371
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,538
All right. Where were we?
-"Hansel and Gretel".

372
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,541
In the morning the wicked witch got Hansel
by the hand and carried him to the shed.

373
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,000
She said to Gretel, "You must draw water and
cook something nice for your brother

374
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,665
and when he's fattened up I'll eat him".

375
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,505
"Dear God", Gretel cried,
"I want you to help us".

376
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,993
"Stop your blubbering", said the wicked red-eyed
witch, "it won't do you a bit of good".

377
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,858
Every morning the witch would say,

378
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,672
"Hold out your finger and
let's see if you're getting fat".

379
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,449
"But Hensel held out a chicken bone".

380
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,410
Oh, come on, don't stop.
-But he's asleep.

381
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,695
But we are not.
Read it to us, come on.

382
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,300
Aren't you too old for fairytales?
-Uh-uh.

383
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,000
Please.

384
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:32,383
Soon the witch got very impatient.

385
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,300
Hold there, Gretel.
Go get water and don't dawdle.

386
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,260
Skinny or fat, I'm gonna cook
your Hensel tomorrow.

387
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,467
See, you hold one hole closed,
you blow real hard

388
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,146
and all the snot will come
through the other hole.

389
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,459
That a boy! Now you won't get
your shirt sleeve so dirtied.

390
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Could I have some change, mem?

391
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,049
Let God be on your side!

392
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,850
We don't do that anymore.
-I can't help it, I've got a jones.

393
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,341
Yeah, I've been using that
[...] lately.

394
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,000
Hey! Clear out of here.
No loitering allowed.

395
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,137
Oh yeah? And maybe we're doing our shopping.
Ever think of that?

396
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,535
Right, wise guy. Just get the hell out
before I call the police.

397
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,274
What a character...
-Yeah, for sure.

398
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,950
That guy is an asshole.

399
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,943
I saw him selling
PCP to some little kids once.

400
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,202
What a dick...
-Yeah.

401
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,500
What we need is some beer.

402
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,700
Yeah, our nerves are wrecked.

403
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,800
Beer? I hate beer.
-And an ice-cream for Ethan.

404
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,050
All right.

405
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,000
Hey, walk like this.

406
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,306
Nice day, huh?

407
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,500
All right, very funny.
Let's see some ID.

408
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,637
Look, I don't need this.
Don't come back here.

409
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,700
I don't need your business.

410
00:59:29,905 --> 00:59:34,400
Okay. But let me have one of those slushies
over there. And make it a blue one.

411
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,600
All right. That's... 3.23.
-Thanks!

412
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,372
Happy Easter, asshole.

413
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,400
Hi!
-Quack-quack. -Bye!

414
01:00:25,278 --> 01:00:28,661
God damn little bastards!
Came in here and fucked up my store.

415
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,200
Scum of the earth.

416
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,459
See you later.
Put the sock in it.

417
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,800
And I live over on Heatherton Avenue,
which is a nice neighborhood

418
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,500
or at least it used to be.

419
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,000
Now all you get are these wild teenagers
parading through

420
01:01:02,016 --> 01:01:02,950
like a bunch of terrorists.

421
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,200
Hear, hear.

422
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,012
Yes. The little bastards were
fighting on my front lawn.

423
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,377
I had to hold them up with the shotgun
while my wife called the police.

424
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,500
And it took me over an hour to get through.

425
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,826
Yeah. And that's another thing: the police
ain't doing a god damn thing.

426
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,944
Excuse me, reverend Farrell.

427
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,880
Just so happens we have a member of
the police department with us here tonight.

428
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,834
We have reports of vandalism and robbery
just like any other city.

429
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,200
And we follow up each and every one of them.

430
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,578
Follow up? You came to my house
three hours later!

431
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,120
Well, we've got a responsibility by law
to adhere to certain procedures.

432
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,961
Well, while you're going through procedures
people's homes are being ruined by these monsters.

433
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,918
Look, I've had to repaint the side wall
of my store five times already.

434
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,644
Every time I turn around there is
a "T.R." spray-painted.

435
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,910
What the hell is "T.R." anyway?

436
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,468
Sandra says there was a stabbing recently
at the club where she was molested.

437
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,387
And that those same letters
were left near the weapon.

438
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,600
In blood.

439
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Did you investigate that house
like you said you would?

440
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,311
No, not yet.
-Typical.

441
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,865
You know, Rennard, I get the feeling
you're not doing your job.

442
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,500
And I get the feeling you're using
innocent people as scapegoat.

443
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,473
Scapegoat?

444
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,950
We're talking about a bunch of psychos!

445
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,550
Mental rejects running wild on our streets!

446
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:28,229
We're talking about kids!

447
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,609
Kids like yours and mine.

448
01:02:30,644 --> 01:02:32,935
Ha! Oh, I'm damn sure
they ain't my kids.

449
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,500
Gentlemen, please!
Can we be reasonable?

450
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,200
I know, times are tough and some of
you, people, are up against it.

451
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,889
Look, Rennard. If the police can't
protect the people,

452
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,450
then the people have to
protect themselves.

453
01:02:44,658 --> 01:02:46,364
And take the law in their own hands?

454
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,285
If that's what it comes down to!

455
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,100
And use guns to solve your problems?

456
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,700
You're damn right!

457
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:11,042
Okay, mister! Hold it right there.
Identify yourself.

458
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:15,696
Hi! I'm Bill. Don't shoot.
Where's Jack?

459
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,600
Peeling potatoes.

460
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,846
Perfect.
What are you doing here?

461
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,931
I need to talk to you.

462
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,729
Let's go outside then, ok?

463
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,958
No, I need to talk to all of you.

464
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,727
What for?

465
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,550
Hi! I'm Jack's father.

466
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,750
Stepfather.

467
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,332
You're a cop!

468
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,400
Yes I am, but that's not the reason
why I'm here to talk to you.

469
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,200
I hate cops.
To the max.

470
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,248
Listen. You, kids, are making a pretty bad
reputation for yourselves.

471
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,385
Last night I was at a meeting and...

472
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,500
Just let me tell you...

473
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,290
You got people down on you.

474
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,236
What happened?

475
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,595
Well, you're gonna have to listen up
sooner or later.

476
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,500
I am not leaving until you do.

477
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,800
What do I have to do,
for Christ's sake? Pay you?

478
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,200
So, I think it's best for all of you
to go back to your homes

479
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,585
until this thing blows over.

480
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,200
You don't seem to understand.

481
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,794
Most of us don't have homes to go back to.

482
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,093
My parents are dopers and the state
won't even let me go home.

483
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,504
All they do is shove me into foster homes.

484
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,098
Let me tell you,
that sucks big eggs.

485
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,171
What do you do here all day?

486
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,437
Nothing.
-Watch TV.

487
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,664
Don't you wanna make
anything of yourselves?

488
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:02,900
What's the [...]?

489
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:06,591
Well, there's families for one thing.
Careers? College?

490
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,226
Families... Everyone knows
families don't work.

491
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:12,807
College? Most of us couldn't
afford lunch in high school.

492
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,400
What do you, kids, do for money?

493
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,079
Take bribes off cops.

494
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,300
Please, mister policeman,
don't make us leave our home.

495
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,648
We'll be good from now on.
We promise.

496
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,515
Yeah. This is the best home most of us ever had.

497
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,794
Besides, if we didn't have each other
we wouldn't have anything.

498
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,500
You gonna have to stay out of trouble.

499
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,000
If you don't, somebody's gonna get hurt.

500
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:44,928
Everybody's got guns these days
and they are just itching to use them.

501
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,800
<i>Do you understand?</i>

502
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,840
<i>Let this be the last time I hear of T.R.</i>

503
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,483
"Let this be the last time I hear of T.R."

504
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,851
Maybe we should get guns too.

505
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,768
I already have a gun.

506
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,731
Let's just move some place else.
-My old man's a shotgun.

507
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,300
Come on. Don't get so worried.
Everything will be all right.

508
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,751
<i>I know I can get a forty-five,
but I have to steal it.</i>

509
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,353
Let's go to Frisco!

510
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,800
What a pigsty!

511
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,534
Jesus Ch-rist!

512
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,041
At least they got good taste in women.

513
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,820
Sit down!

514
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,497
See that? See it?

515
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,222
What do you want?

516
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,921
We want to let you know
we are sick of your shit.

517
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,904
This is what you might call
a warning.

518
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:01,176
If there's any more trouble from you,
creeps, some heads are gonna roll.

519
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,691
You dirty whore!

520
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,500
You get the message?

521
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:12,060
Next time we'll do more
than tear up somebody's shirt.

522
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,087
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

523
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,000
You know what I was thinking?

524
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,620
No, what was you thinking?

525
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,194
Has anybody seen my shirt?

526
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
Yeah, you're wearing it.

527
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:41,383
Not this shirt, asshole.
My yellow shirt.

528
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,202
If somebody took that shirt
I'll knock their fucking teeth out.

529
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,916
Who will want that shirt.
-Don't call me an asshole.

530
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:51,026
Well, where is it then?
-What the hell is wrong with you?

531
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,635
Can't find my fucking shirt,
can't you hear?

532
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:58,183
And I can't find my fucking dope.

533
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,800
This is not where I had it.

534
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,026
I know you. You were probably
too twisted to remember where you put it.

535
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,371
I remember distinctedly.
-Distinctly.

536
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:15,374
Whatever. I had a jar of
25 black triangles in it.

537
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,712
Put them in my sleeping bag
down by my feet.

538
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,749
And now they're gone.

539
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,803
All I know is I go to all the trouble
putting nails up all over the place

540
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,947
to keep things organized and now
I can't find my god damned shirt.

541
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,768
My sentiment precisely.

542
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,284
Hey! Open this door!

543
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,483
Open this door right now!

544
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,550
Sheila?

545
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,200
What's going on?

546
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,655
You and your stupid dope!
That's what I think of your dope.

547
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,150
What are you doing?

548
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:20,292
Man, what did you do that for?

549
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,800
It's crazy!

550
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,446
Sheila's dead.

551
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,850
That's what happened to your stupid dope!

552
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,600
What?
-Sheila's dead.

553
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,900
Go ahead, read it.

554
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,766
To my friends.
Don't be mad at me for doing this.

555
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,400
But I really don't wanna
stick around any longer.

556
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,150
I'm sorry.

557
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,300
I hope all of you have fun with your lives.

558
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,600
The time I've lived with you was
the best part of my life. Thanks.

559
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,234
I love you all, especially Joe.

560
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,145
Gone forever, Sheila.

561
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:49,677
P.S.: I hope you don't have to move.

562
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,043
Huh, that's funny.
"I hope you don't have to move".

563
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,950
Did you hear something out there?

564
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,443
No, Ethan, just sit down and
be quiet for a while.

565
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,700
So, what are we gonna do?

566
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,700
I think we all should decide.

567
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,877
Ain't you supposed to call the police
when somebody dies?

568
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,206
Great. And that's just what we need.

569
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,231
What about the coroner?

570
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
We do that and they'll
call the police.

571
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,538
Right. And then they'll probably
gonna try and blame it on us.

572
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:31,899
Don't you think we should let
her parents know?

573
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,200
God damn it, Keef, man,
if it wasn't for you

574
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,420
none of this shit
would happen in the first place.

575
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,350
I always knew something
because of it happens.

576
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,572
Some friend you are.

577
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,650
He's just a choking fucking druggy.

578
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,400
Why don't you just leave him alone?
-Why don't you shut up?

579
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,140
Keef is our friend too,
you don't have to rag on him.

580
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:51,650
Wait a minute.

581
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,100
Just take her home.

582
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,650
Do what?

583
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,481
Let's just take her home.

584
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,850
Yeah. When Sindy Bartholomew o.d.-ed

585
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,400
her friends put her on the front seat
of her mother's car.

586
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,400
Well, that's pretty crappy.
We are not gonna do that.

587
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,500
I know where Sheila's parents live.
We could just bring her home.

588
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,800
Yes?

589
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,800
Are you Sheila's father?

590
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
Yes, I am.

591
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,650
Well. Sorry to tell you this, but...
she killed herself.

592
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,900
What is this? A joke?

593
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,332
No, it's not.

594
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,500
Please, take her.
We didn't know what else to do.

595
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:53,900
We'd like to go to the funeral.
If you don't mind.

596
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,732
Oh, god...

597
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,150
I'm sorry, but the mother requests
that you leave.

598
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:36,583
All of you.

599
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,966
Leave? How come?

600
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:41,286
Please, just do as we ask.

601
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,100
Mother is really very upset.

602
01:16:43,101 --> 01:16:45,501
We aren't feeling that great either.
Believe me.

603
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,840
We understand.

604
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,500
Good. Then will you leave?

605
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,481
The mother really doesn't want you here.

606
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,000
Neither do I.

607
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,696
But we don't wanna to leave.

608
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,095
But you have to.

609
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,000
I mean, look at you.

610
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,256
We didn't have any nice clothes to wear.
We're sorry.

611
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,745
Will you please show
these young people out?

612
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,089
Why don't you just visit the grave
after we'd left?

613
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,520
Or maybe tomorrow.

614
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,782
Sheila was our friend. And we have
every right to be here if we want to.

615
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,763
We're staying right here.
-No, you are not.

616
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,650
We're sitting all the way in the back here.

617
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,850
Can't you just ignore us?

618
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,420
No, we can't ignore you!

619
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,016
We don't want you here.

620
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,332
We didn't like you when Sheila was alive
and we don't like you now.

621
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,250
If it wasn't for you
she'd probably still be alive.

622
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,599
No, asshole, if it wasn't for YOU,
she'd still be alive.

623
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,850
Don't you say that, you don't
know anything about us.

624
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,043
Yes, I do. Sheila told me all about you.

625
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,000
She told me how you couldn't
keep your hands off her.

626
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:45,032
You shut up!

627
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,250
You molested your own
daughter, you scumback,

628
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,679
and then you beat her -
she showed me the scars.

629
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,046
You're a fucking asshole,
you know that?

630
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:51,217
Hey you, T.R.! -Me?
-Yeah, you. Come here!

631
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,585
Where's Jack?
-Inside, I guess.

632
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,130
Go in there and find him. And tell him
to get his ass out here RIGHT NOW.

633
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,900
Yeah?
-Don't "yeah" at me.

634
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,750
And don't come up with
no fucking attitude

635
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,300
after what you've pulled.

636
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,106
We went to our friend's funeral, all right?
Big deal.

637
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,500
And beat the shit out of
your friend's father!

638
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,950
He's in the hospital,
in case you didn't know.

639
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:24,000
You can't piss off people
the way you do, Jack.

640
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,212
This time you've bit off more
than you can chew.

641
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,644
Somebody's gonna stop you.

642
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,680
Personally I'd like to see
all of you in jail for a while.

643
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,250
Yeah, "book 'em Danno".

644
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,200
I am not gonna arrest you.

645
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,318
But I DO want you out of that house.

646
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,550
If you don't leave
somebody's gonna get hurt.

647
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,845
I want you out tonight!

648
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,600
What?
-No way.

649
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:44,956
You can forget it.

650
01:21:44,957 --> 01:21:46,088
Where are we supposed to go?

651
01:21:46,123 --> 01:21:49,000
Anywhere!
Just get out of that place.

652
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:52,200
If these people can't find you,
they can't hurt you.

653
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,681
I want you to tell your friends

654
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,150
to get out of there and
pack up their things TONIGHT.

655
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,650
It's for your own good.

656
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,600
I'll be out there in a few hours
and make sure that you're gone.

657
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,100
Hey.

658
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,545
You could come home, you know.
Your mother would like that.

659
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,200
I like your personality.

660
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,168
Here.

661
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:01,066
So, do you feel anything?
-Aha, I feel kinda scared.

662
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,266
Oh, you shouldn't.

663
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,508
Hey.
Ain't nothing worth saving in here.

664
01:24:11,543 --> 01:24:12,398
Yeah, but...

665
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,521
Don't you think we really gonna
trash this place before we leave?

666
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,023
Trash it?

667
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,226
This is so-o fucked,
I can't believe it!

668
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,985
So, what are you gonna do?

669
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,042
Go back home, I guess.

670
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,009
Fag city.

671
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,750
What about you?
-I don't know.

672
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,193
All right, I've got it!
Here's what we're gonna do.

673
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,710
Check it out.

674
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,764
I'm gonna go syphon
some gas out of your car.

675
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,386
Then when we get ready to leave -
right before we leave -

676
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:07,820
we'll set the whole place on fire.
Boom!

677
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,099
Will be fun to watch it burn.

678
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,150
What do you think?
-Whatever.

679
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,666
Here you are.
-Hey, buddy, what's happening?

680
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,500
Sit down. This is great.

681
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,400
I've been looking all over for you.

682
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,396
Your wife doesn't even know where you are.
-So?

683
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:48,029
Come here I wanna talk to you.
Over here.

684
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,868
Do you know what happened?
-No, what?

685
01:26:00,903 --> 01:26:02,950
Hi...
-I don't wanna anything, thanks.

686
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,900
Give him a scotch, Marox.

687
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:07,850
They buried one of those kids today.

688
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,450
A 16-year-old girl.
-Really?

689
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,200
O.D.?
-I don't know.

690
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:13,700
Were you ready for this:

691
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,355
those kids busted in and
raided a funeral home.

692
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,900
They tore the place apart.

693
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,300
Are you shitting me?

694
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,400
Wait a minute.

695
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,600
What the fuck are we doing?

696
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,442
I don't know about you,

697
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,842
but there's no way anyone's
gonna make ME leave this place.

698
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,887
Uh-uh, wake up
and smell the coffee, man.

699
01:27:01,472 --> 01:27:02,653
It's hopeless.

700
01:27:02,688 --> 01:27:04,430
Your old man only wants us to leave

701
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,118
because he doesn't think
we can take care of ourselves.

702
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,696
That's bullshit.

703
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,850
We're smarter than those assholes.

704
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,403
Yeah, seems like if they
run us out of this place

705
01:27:13,405 --> 01:27:15,752
the others will run us out of
the next place we'll find.

706
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:17,497
My old man's coming back later

707
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,545
and if we're still here
he's gonna shit Twinkies.

708
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,001
Can you imagine how
that girl's mother felt?

709
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,400
Her only daughter's up there in a box

710
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,523
and those son-of-a-bitches come in

711
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,014
wreck the place and
than brutalize the family.

712
01:27:34,775 --> 01:27:36,630
Un-be-lie-vable.

713
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,891
I mean, I am not religious.
But if you ask me...

714
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,462
that's downright simple.

715
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,800
Well, Jack, what's it gonna be?

716
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,850
We've got a match?
Any match?

717
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,848
Save it, Razzle.
We're staying.

718
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,950
Staying?

719
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,818
Yeah, we're not leaving this place
without a fight.

720
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,300
Shit.

721
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,000
We're gonna have to go back
out there.

722
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,600
That's what I was thinking.

723
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,089
Hasta luego, shitface!
