1
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,631
Stop. What the fudge?
You have your own fries.

2
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,464
-You'd let Howard.
-Shut up! Stop.

3
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,094
Howard? Who's Howard?

4
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,901
Oh, Howard?
She loves the Lexus-loving, grunge poser,

5
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,340
pathetic slave to juvenile delinquent Mitch

6
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,436
whose head I happened to splatter
at paintball last week.

7
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,548
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

8
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,519
Oh, great. Thanks.

9
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,249
I'll be right there.

10
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,824
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,064
-Mel!
-Jen?

12
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,302
Okay. I know.

13
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,909
Jen? Okay.

14
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,415
I know I left 10 minutes ago,
but there was nobody here.

15
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,111
It's dead, so can... Thanks.

16
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,154
Hey, you! Can you hear Mommy?

17
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,326
I love you. I love you.

18
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,233
Okay, my battery's going so...
Can you say bye?

19
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,499
Bye.

20
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,738
I'm sorry. What can I get you?

21
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah. The special. No mayo.
And if it's got no sugar, an ice tea.

22
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,351
-Okay.
-Excuse me. On second thought,

23
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,181
I'm gonna take the mayo.

24
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,313
And an ice tea, however the hell it comes.

25
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,291
Congratulations. Lucky number 7.
It's for when you pay.

26
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,953
Get down! Come on, get down!

27
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,499
Assist. Evac's running late.

28
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,999
This is the shooter, the customer.
We lost them both on the way.

29
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,101
We're gonna have to get going on this one.

30
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,975
There was another one that was
dead on the scene. A busboy.

31
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,675
-I guess he went straight to the locker.
-I was just there 20 minutes ago.

32
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,751
Come on, let's scrub in.

33
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,452
Well, I wish we had an affordable house.

34
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,720
Ours?

35
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,596
Find your perfect place.
It's easy at remax.com.

36
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,760
Nobody sells more real estate than RE/MAX.

37
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:43,008
My dad was a minister, as you know.
The question he always used to ask...

38
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,237
Hey, Jimmy, how are you doing, bud?

39
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,649
What will He have us do?

40
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:56,654
Bear witness. From our lips to His ear,

41
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:02,455
in the language of our inmost longings,
we humbly pray.

42
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,225
Hey, Jimmy, I'm Ron.

43
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:19,240
It's my job to talk to people
after upsetting experiences,

44
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,971
like accidents or crimes.

45
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,584
The doctor who examined you

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,054
thinks maybe we should
get to know each other.

47
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,650
Though I hear you're not saying much.

48
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,818
Will you talk to me?

49
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,262
Will you shake your head "yes" or "no"?

50
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,539
Will you write down your answers
if I ask you a few questions?

51
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:56,608
When you want to figure out how you feel
about what happened, will you see me?

52
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:25,644
You've got superficial trauma,
maybe a concussion when you fell.

53
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:30,205
You may sleep a few days straight,
have some blurs and blanks.

54
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,476
One thing's sure,
you are some kind of lucky.

55
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,089
Beyond lucky.

56
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,029
He's already gone. Let's call it.

57
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,125
No, no, wait. Maybe I can...

58
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,804
Shit, I nicked an artery.
Looks like a bone frag's hit the aorta.

59
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:58,139
I'm gonna have to clamp and start over here.

60
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,946
Bruce, there's nothing to clamp it to.
There never was.

61
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:22,959
Honey!

62
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,868
Oh, my God!

63
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,134
Don't cry, Mom. Don't cry.

64
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,683
I'm so sorry.

65
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,956
Thank you.

66
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,538
It's different odds down here.
No one wins them all.

67
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,271
You went the extra mile. And a half.

68
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,537
Gave it your best.

69
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,063
Right now, authorities still are
officially searching for motives.

70
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,437
Meanwhile, here at
Baird Community Hospital,

71
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,067
the gunman has been declared
dead on arrival.

72
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,840
One victim in critical condition
is set to be airlifted.

73
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,245
And the hospital says its emergency...

74
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:38,202
-Miss Davenport?
-I gave it already. My statement.

75
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,097
I'm not police. I'm with the
County Mental Health Department.

76
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,505
Are you a doctor?

77
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,943
No, but the hospital consults with us
in these cases.

78
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,318
So...

79
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,414
Well, I tried to call out,

80
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,517
-but the battery on my phone died.
-It's not your fault.

81
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,892
-It's normal to feel that way.
-No, I know that.

82
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,158
In the next few days and weeks,
you may experience a lot of new feelings,

83
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,204
including loss of sleep, even appetite.
There's a list.

84
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,374
Everyday life may feel different.

85
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,003
You might start to remember things
that you really don't want to, Carla.

86
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,647
I'm sorry. Can I call you Carla?

87
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,749
Wait now.

88
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,257
You got these printed out before?

89
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,287
In case something like that happens?

90
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,898
And then you give them out after?

91
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,291
Well, that's not important.

92
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:47,062
It's that if you need to talk, you can.
About how you're feeling.

93
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,701
To you?

94
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:52,878
Yes.

95
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,659
Excuse me, ma'am,
can we speak with you for a second?

96
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,325
You were at the scene, right?

97
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,056
-That's right. I was.
-Well, were you hurt at all, ma'am?

98
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,527
No. Not myself.

99
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:55,404
But you lost someone in your family,
someone that you know, right?

100
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,408
No, but...

101
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,569
-Excuse me. Thank you.
-Hold on. Thanks...

102
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,082
Belmont police continue to deflect
questions about their investigation,

103
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,456
while citizens struggle to reclaim
the notion of a town that was,

104
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,655
reconstruct a timeline of the actual moments

105
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,698
when life and death hung in the balance.

106
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,029
In the blink of an eye,
for ordinary townspeople...

107
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,999
-Hi.
-Oh, my God, Carla, you drove here?

108
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,075
I took a bus from the hospital.

109
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:35,341
From the hospital? Oh, my... We saw it.
Thank God you're okay.

110
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,682
You saw it?

111
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,084
Well, I guess I did.

112
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,414
I tried to call out.

113
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,513
We didn't know where to call.
I mean, I told Scott

114
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,683
to call the police, but he said no,

115
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,920
that it's best to wait for word
in these situations.

116
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,792
I can't help but think 5 minutes later

117
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,731
and my Scott would have been in there.
So, are you okay?

118
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,292
Yeah, I'm okay. I guess I feel a little bit...

119
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,928
Thank God is what. That's what I say.

120
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,339
You know, I saw those girls on TV,
and that one whose father died.

121
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:09,040
But you don't have scratch on you.
I mean, just... You know, thank God.

122
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:16,050
-What's wrong with you?
-Oh, he's been a little colicky.

123
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,089
Okay, well, I guess
I'll see you at the diner tomorrow.

124
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,251
Tomorrow? You know what?
Melda's won't be open tomorrow.

125
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,022
Oh, God, yeah. Jeez.

126
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,098
Whatever. Whatever.
Just call us any time, okay?

127
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,190
We'll take him any time. It's gonna be okay.

128
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,030
Thanks. Bye.

129
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,787
$12.95 is your change.

130
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,622
You're the 100th customer this month.
You get a free bike helmet.

131
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,374
Anne, honey,

132
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,555
what is it? What are you doing out here?

133
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,922
Let's just get you back inside.
We've got something to help you sleep.

134
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,962
Okay, baby. Let's just go inside.

135
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,906
Any luck reaching him on the cell phone?

136
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,539
Nothing.

137
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,978
If you don't mind, I just have
a few questions that I want to go over.

138
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:02,311
Are you sure your father didn't know
anyone else at the scene?

139
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,981
Mr. Hagen? Mr. Carline?

140
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,490
Not absolutely sure.

141
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,827
-But I don't know.
-And between you?

142
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,931
Any recent problems?

143
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,027
My dad took us in a year ago,
after my divorce.

144
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,198
No questions. So, no, no problems.

145
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:30,747
And you're not aware of any bad feelings
anywhere, business gone wrong?

146
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,846
-You need a hand with that?
-No, thanks.

147
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,117
My dad owns his own driving school.
One room, one car.

148
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,216
Paid a small business loan off
after my momma died.

149
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,351
Mom!

150
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,259
He owns this house free and clear.
He don't owe nobody.

151
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,925
So, no, I'm not aware of any bad feelings
or business deals. Thank you.

152
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,004
Not for several years anyway,
since he owed on that gambling marker.

153
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,162
Mommy, come here!

154
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,673
-Excuse me?
-We heard about that.

155
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,142
I have no idea what you're talking about.

156
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,204
Now if there is nothing else,
I have a babysitter waiting inside.

157
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,651
Miss Hammet, I know you want any word
on your father's whereabouts and condition.

158
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,655
Thanks for saying it, Detective. Excuse me.

159
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,915
I was at the diner this morning
before it all happened.

160
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,684
You were not. Why?

161
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,422
I got a coffee on the way to the hospital.

162
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,384
What?

163
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,462
And then on the way out...

164
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,334
I held the door open for
the guy who shot everybody.

165
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,968
How do you know it was him?

166
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,167
'Cause 20 minutes later they wheeled
everyone in, and he was there

167
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,212
and he had a big fucking hole in his head.

168
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,112
Are you okay?

169
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,309
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean,

170
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,478
it's not like I was still there
when it happened.

171
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,221
-Darling.
-Crazy, huh?

172
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,684
Do you want me to get you a drink?

173
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,694
Yeah. That'd be good.

174
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,859
Did the suit come back from the cleaners?

175
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,724
I'll bring it in.

176
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,335
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

177
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,884
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

178
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,624
You know, Stu, you look at everything

179
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,759
that's happened here,
and it's hard not to speculate on the toll.

180
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,168
Had the gunman entered the scene
just 10 minutes later, during the height...

181
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,297
Do you think he's sleeping?

182
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,539
He was out like a light, last I looked.

183
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:50,074
Like the man said, keep him home, quiet.
He'll talk when he's ready.

184
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,588
Sweetie?

185
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,855
Sweetie?

186
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,006
Oh, my God!

187
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,447
Jimmy, down!

188
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,418
Come on.

189
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,836
Big crowd.

190
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,644
Half didn't even know that Hagen guy.

191
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,147
Or Hank Carline.
At least I worked for him once.

192
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,808
Well, I cleaned the tables
when they came in.

193
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,512
They know me to see me, I guess.

194
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:41,321
So, when are you gonna let me
take you out for that beer at Closkey's?

195
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,327
Looks like you could do with one.

196
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,529
Oh, hey. Hey, it's no biggie.

197
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,360
No biggie. I'll see you around, Carla.

198
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,399
Who was my father?

199
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,739
An example of the kind of faith
that we need most.

200
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,983
When we are scared or tempted by doubts,
or guilt, or hatred.

201
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:10,181
So let the Lord lead us on
to fly high to the gates of heaven,

202
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,087
to let Him judge us, and my father,

203
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,922
who gave his life for mine
and Jimmy Jaspersen's.

204
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:21,460
My father who hid us
and held on to my hand, smiling.

205
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,559
He was my dad.

206
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,045
Wait.

207
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,186
Kneel with me, Lori.
Let's be as brave as our dads.

208
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,586
Let's pray to be strong enough to forgive.

209
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,319
I want to, Anne, but...

210
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,363
-Lori, honey.
-Your dad was so brave, too.

211
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,366
It's what he'd want. I know that.
God knows that.

212
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,732
Jimmy and I are witnesses.

213
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,507
Partners in prayer.

214
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,180
Witnesses to love
and bravery to be proud of.

215
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,079
We just wanted to say how sorry we are.

216
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,417
-Bob, too...
-Thank God one of us can testify.

217
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,356
Yeah!

218
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,702
The network subscriber
you are trying to reach

219
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,571
is either unavailable or out of range.

220
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,440
Please try again later.

221
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,286
2. Crap 2 right away.

222
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,433
New shooter.

223
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,765
Gentlemen.

224
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,389
-You okay?
-No.

225
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,797
My fucking head again. I can't see anything.

226
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,360
A migraine? I'll get you something. Okay?

227
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,838
I'm not proud. I'll try anything.

228
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,568
Just put this under your tongue.

229
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,908
It's a sublingual,
so it's gonna work pretty quick.

230
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,741
My miracle worker genius.

231
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,859
I haven't had one of these
for such a long time.

232
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,327
Feeling better? Is it working?

233
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,972
-Yeah.
-It is?

234
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,839
You're a magician.

235
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,347
You think so?

236
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,148
Nothing less. Ever.

237
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,180
Anne?

238
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,556
One sec, Mom.

239
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,306
-Hello.
-Hi, Ma.

240
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,539
Carly. That's you.

241
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,410
-Yeah.
-Well, my God.

242
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:41,452
-How's the knee, Ma?
-Good enough. If I take to my pills

243
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,148
and leave the weeds grow in the yard,
good enough.

244
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,987
Now are you keeping up with your classes
at the junior college?

245
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,028
-Ma, you know what happened?
-And your boyfriend? Steve, is it?

246
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,495
How's he? Any plans for you two?

247
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,024
-Everything's great, Ma.
-Well, that's wonderful for you, Carly.

248
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,501
Oh, there's your dad now.

249
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,869
He's wandering.
I guess the phone woke him up.

250
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:04,169
-I better go.
-Okay, you take care.

251
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,107
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

252
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,544
I'm sorry.

253
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,477
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.

254
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:33,629
-What's wrong with him?
-I'm not sure. Let's try a bottle.

255
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,297
-Do you have a bottle?
-Okay.

256
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,274
Come on, little fellow. Up you go.

257
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,268
-This way.
-Okay.

258
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,506
You hungry? You hungry?

259
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,781
We have a hungry man here.
When did you last feed him?

260
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,984
Well, I tried off and on all night,
but he wouldn't take it.

261
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,890
He was crying so hard.

262
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,691
Anything different about the way
you prepared the formula?

263
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,765
No.

264
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,132
Well, I don't see the point
in running any tests

265
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,760
as long as he's alert
and he has a good appetite,

266
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:09,272
which he clearly does.
I think he'll be fine. Here.

267
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,399
That's great to hear.

268
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,775
I do think you should get yourself
a regular pediatrician, though, Carla.

269
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,848
And there are free clinics
if insurance is a problem.

270
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:20,180
I took that parenting course at the Y, and
he's never had one thing wrong before this.

271
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,186
Well, I understand,
but I think it's just for the best.

272
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,189
So, let's just see if we can keep to
a regular feeding schedule.

273
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,883
Okay. Will do.

274
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,358
See if you can't get
some more sleep yourself.

275
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:32,294
I wouldn't want those pretty eyes
getting red and tired-looking.

276
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,364
No.

277
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,627
Okay, well, thanks, Dr. Laraby.

278
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,314
He's not as nice you.

279
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,283
He acts like he never saw me, but nice.

280
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,054
-How are you feeling, Sam?
-Pecker won't stand up,

281
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,718
I got a tube in my nose,
and I'm too dry to spit. You?

282
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,296
-I think we'll both live.
-Yeah, but I'm looking forward to it.

283
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,228
You look like you could take it or leave it.

284
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,426
Mutual funds go down?
Tough match at the club?

285
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,468
Take it easy.

286
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,501
Keep eating your prunes, Sam.

287
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,306
Sam's a tough case.

288
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,541
He could go on for years,
he could drop dead on the sidewalk.

289
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,949
-Not if I can help it.
-I don't think that's our call.

290
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,987
Hey, what are they pushing
for migraines these days?

291
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,214
Molodil.

292
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,750
It's a sublingual.

293
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,292
It's the quickest vaso-constrictor out there.
It actually works like a charm.

294
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,424
Possible side effects are arrhythmia,
mild tightness.

295
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,834
-And to treat that? That's...
-Stantrocet, yeah.

296
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,906
Of course, you can end up
where you started,

297
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:52,010
which is with headache symptoms.
Stantrocet causes headaches,

298
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,941
Molodil cures it. It's a bi-polar scenario.

299
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,911
-Catch-22, huh?
-Yeah.

300
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,175
-How's Jo?
-She's good. I'll see you tomorrow.

301
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,250
Yeah.

302
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:05,050
Rumors swirling after she was spotted
in this hot, exclusive L.A. nightclub

303
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,684
talking to which hunky actor
rumored to be on again, off again

304
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,354
with his temperamental supermodel wife?

305
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,028
Mr. Fussy.

306
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,359
Hey.

307
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,529
Bruce, Sam's been in a coma
most of the night.

308
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,398
Okay, clear.

309
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,035
-Time?
-5 and a half minutes.

310
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,205
-Shit. I'm gonna do one more, okay?
-He's brain dead.

311
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,407
Clear.

312
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,053
Pulse.

313
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,223
He's breathing.

314
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,086
-Bruce...
-I just want to try one more thing.

315
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,165
I don't care if you try 10 more things.
He's brain dead, Bruce.

316
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,258
Come on, Dan.
Well, what the hell are we doing here!

317
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,768
Sorry, nurse.

318
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,931
Hey, Bruce, what's going on?
We're not playing God here.

319
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,277
You can't decide them all.

320
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,712
Man, I can't imagine what it's been like
for you, being at the diner.

321
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,382
Look, we're all stressed here.

322
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:46,154
But you've got to talk. All right?
I'm here for you.

323
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,423
I really don't want to bother anybody.

324
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,056
I just want to check with his students.

325
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,665
So, he left by 11:00?

326
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,573
You're sure?

327
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,576
Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.

328
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,644
7!

329
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,751
Winner, yo!

330
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,354
First of all, I want to thank God
for keeping me safe

331
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,789
and guiding my hand to this wonderful
opportunity to provide for my loved ones.

332
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,128
Thank you, Big Guy!

333
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,759
Keep going, keep going!

334
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,973
Hey. How're you doing?

335
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,938
I'm fine.
So, I guess we're both fine and good.

336
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,810
And there's 2 kinds of people
in this world,

337
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,247
those who are and those who aren't
fine and good.

338
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:50,811
Sir. Coming out. 7 yo. Same shooter.

339
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:55,484
Just to say, hey, hey! Hey, now!

340
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,528
7!

341
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,199
Your father and I used to take you here.

342
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,568
It hasn't changed a bit.

343
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,902
Everything has.

344
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,081
Yeah. Too much has.

345
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:26,489
We're tested. That's all this is, Mama.
Don't doubt anything now. Just forgive.

346
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,219
I know you want to forgive,

347
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,958
but forgiveness is hard. First, there's hatred.

348
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:39,395
I'm sorry, baby, but there's a lot of it.

349
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,803
Doesn't it make you mad?
What happened, honey?

350
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,877
At all? I mean, don't you miss Dad?

351
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,707
I don't doubt anything now. I just be proud.

352
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,111
Do you think that you would talk
to that man from the hospital?

353
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:54,913
No. All these doubts and fears can fly away
just the way they came.

354
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,786
Don't look at them.
That's what they want, not what God wants.

355
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:04,161
Honey, we were glad when you wanted to
go to Sunday school with the other kids,

356
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,823
but it was fine with us
when you wanted to stop going, too.

357
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:12,135
I mean, you're upset, I know.
There's been so much stress.

358
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,536
Sweetheart.

359
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,710
Come on, Mama, right now.

360
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,984
-Honey, what is it?
-Pray with me. Right here, right now.

361
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,649
Stop it, Annie. Just stop it.

362
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,125
Please, kneel with me, so God knows
you don't have a doubt in your heart

363
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,924
-and you believe in what's true.
-Anne! Right now!

364
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,499
Please, kneel with me. Lori did.

365
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,932
For me. For all of us. For Dad.

366
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,258
Mr. Jaspersen?

367
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,922
How's Jimmy? I'd like to see him.

368
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:49,000
We're up for a new medical policy
at my shop.

369
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,198
Well, there'd be no records, I assure you.

370
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:55,534
Maybe no problem, too. I mean,
like you said, he could talk at any time.

371
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,440
Mr. Jaspersen, do you have reason to
believe that Jimmy isn't going to benefit...

372
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,377
-Did my wife tell you to come here?
-No.

373
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,345
I'm here because I'm concerned
for Jimmy, that's all.

374
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,646
You know, we're also concerned
about our other son, Michael.

375
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,949
He's still stuck at the V.A., like a vegetable.

376
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,916
I'm sure Jimmy misses him, too.
Just like you.

377
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,060
What happened to Jimmy,

378
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,793
you ever experience anything like that?

379
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,574
Let the man come and see him. That's all.

380
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,134
You think Jimmy's going to talk to him
when we can't even get in a word.

381
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,180
He's got enough to think of.

382
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:14,684
You know, I've got a month before we go
on the medical policy at the shop.

383
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,549
What do you think they're going to do
if they find out about

384
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,987
Jimmy's so-called pre-existing condition?
I'll tell you what they're going to do.

385
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,286
They're gonna let me go
rather than pay the doctor bills.

386
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,726
-It'll be my job.
-Your job? This is Jimmy's life.

387
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,923
Which won't be much
without clothes on his back or food...

388
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,193
It won't be much with either if you keep...

389
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,202
Lydia, will you give him time?

390
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,571
Give him time.

391
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,553
The means to my end
is more than met with my last bet.

392
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:36,166
Thank you for your love and support.

393
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,178
Sci-Fi Suite.

394
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,582
Thank you, sir.

395
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,282
Thank you, Pete.

396
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,689
That's not my name.

397
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:08,129
Pete got fired. I just started.
My tag isn't ready yet.

398
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,928
Okay, well,

399
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:15,700
thank you, not-Pete who got fired.

400
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,067
Dan. Sir?

401
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,676
Did you really win all that?
I heard 100K, guy in a bike shirt.

402
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,181
Then it must be me.

403
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,618
Can you believe it? A C-K.
You know what that means?

404
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:37,286
-No.
-Tomorrow... Adiós.

405
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,754
I pack it in. First thing.

406
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,657
'Cause that's my step-away point.

407
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,793
Always have a walking-away point.

408
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,996
-Doug. Dan.
-Dan. Dan.

409
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:50,301
Always have a walk-away point.

410
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,807
Okay, sir.

411
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:57,004
-I hope you enjoy your stay.
-You, too, Dan.

412
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,743
Dan from Morongo Casino.

413
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,648
All rightie.

414
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,722
-Hey, calling for help?
-Yeah.

415
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:49,221
Hey, Anne. You okay?

416
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:55,460
Me and Billy made first string.
There's going to be a party at Mitch's.

417
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,296
It's just a few people, if you want to go.

418
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,196
Thanks, though.

419
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,807
Fly bar's got to align perfectly.

420
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:12,948
That's the battle, right there.

421
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,213
Tighten the hex nut against the main shaft

422
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,348
without stripping it.

423
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,782
Millimeter tolerances.

424
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,952
You know what I mean, buddy?

425
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,124
A flying Swiss watch.

426
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,504
You and I and your brother Michael,

427
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,566
we all know damn well that
talking about it don't help.

428
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,579
I've got your back there. It's under control.

429
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:48,278
You say whatever,
and whenever you're ready.

430
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,880
Tell them I say fuck them.

431
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:58,426
Think they got all the goddamn answers.
Fuck them.

432
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:04,800
Come on. Fuck them. Give me one.

433
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,995
Come on. Fuck them.

434
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,470
It's all good. That's why we're here.

435
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,408
Chopper don't got to think about it.

436
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,917
Chopper don't got to talk about it.

437
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,278
Just got to fly.

438
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,951
Above it all. Just gotta fly.

439
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:57,150
Nothing new, Miss Hammet,
about where your father might be.

440
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,519
Something else did come up.

441
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,591
We got a partial fingerprint and some blood
off the gun.

442
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,185
Not the shooter. That's all we could tell.

443
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,891
-Could be your dad's.
-I don't understand.

444
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,467
Neither do we.

445
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:16,037
You said your father had a checkup?

446
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,272
Does this mean anything to you?

447
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:27,115
-Not a thing.
-It would really help if we could talk to him.

448
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:32,053
Now, we can get a warrant
for his recent credit card bank activity.

449
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,919
That can take a day.

450
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:40,020
We're just hoping that you can help us out
by providing the PIN numbers.

451
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:44,627
PIN... I don't have a PIN.

452
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,762
We all want to close the book on this,
for your father's own good.

453
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,133
If he's in any kind of trouble...

454
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:57,540
Thanks.

455
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,678
-Hey!
-Hey.

456
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:34,978
Captain.

457
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:41,257
Good. I need some presents
to bring back to my family.

458
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,122
You get commission, right?

459
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,390
-I do.
-Beth is about 5 or 6.

460
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:52,231
She's a real pistol, Beth. About yea high.
Her mother, she... She's about your height.

461
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,464
Bigger in the shoulders, but she's a woman.
She's got the... You know.

462
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,565
Small, medium or large.
That's what we got, sir.

463
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,644
Oh, so, you're a straight shooter.

464
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:05,238
I like you, captain. You call me Charlie,
though. Call me Charlie.

465
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,441
Hey, Charlie.

466
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,280
-Charlie C-K. You could say that.
-Charlie C-K.

467
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,814
I got the stuff, plus a buck to spare, man.

468
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,261
What the hell.

469
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,131
It's tragic to waste this magic.

470
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,940
"Give a dime," they say.

471
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,240
Charlie?

472
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:36,245
-Maybe we should...
-We'll split the winnings. What do you say?

473
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,315
Gotta always leave on an up note.

474
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,699
Anne. Hey, sit with?

475
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,934
-With you?
-Yeah.

476
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,408
We want you to know
how brave we think you are.

477
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,912
It was really my dad, I mean...

478
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:19,753
God gave me the strength to be brave
and to save our lives with his faith.

479
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:25,954
Well, she means if we pray,
then maybe we'll get over it, you know,

480
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,256
-quicker.
-Yeah, sure. Whatever works.

481
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,161
Never really a popular one.

482
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,205
She's always writing her poems and stories

483
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:40,573
and acting out her plays by herself
in her room.

484
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,946
Her dad was always her best friend.

485
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,318
Always laughing, just like kids.

486
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:53,588
And then Jimmy.
They rode the bus since second grade.

487
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:55,158
So now who is there?

488
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,957
Of course, I am concerned
about her not sleeping, barely eating.

489
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,964
It was her idea,

490
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:04,933
but maybe it's too soon
for her to be back at school.

491
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,662
No, no, it's not.

492
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:10,434
She needs to re-establish her basic trust
in her physical environment,

493
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,442
her relationships with the everyday.

494
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,611
She talks like a born-again, nonstop.
All faith and forgiveness.

495
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:24,347
People do turn to their faith
in order to get them through.

496
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:25,945
Anne?

497
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,287
Hasn't been to a church once
in half a dozen years.

498
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,758
It was God who made my dad brave.

499
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,196
He provided people with homes
for their families,

500
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,324
because that's what faith is,

501
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:41,131
and having it says that
what other people think doesn't matter.

502
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,865
And when we pray with our eyes closed,

503
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,374
it means that we are with God,
in that moment.

504
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:49,378
So will you do that with me now?
For my dad?

505
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:42,160
-Hi.
-Hi.

506
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,894
Jimmy's in his room. Maybe you could
wait here while I go get him.

507
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,435
-Okay. Good.
-Good.

508
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,768
Jimmy! Jimmy!

509
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,942
Wait! Jim!

510
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,140
Damn!

511
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,054
Hello?

512
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,433
Jimmy?

513
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,935
Is it that man Abler?

514
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,969
Okay, listen to me, Jimmy.

515
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,398
What do you think you're doing, Jimmy?

516
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,777
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

517
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,279
Jimmy.

518
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:13,850
Jimmy.

519
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,052
Still, there's the 2 of us.

520
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,694
Come on.

521
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,794
Come on.

522
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:20,889
Dr. Laraby, please.
Carla Davenport. Thanks much.

523
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,659
Hi, how are you?

524
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,755
No.

525
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,857
No, I guess not.

526
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,936
He's sleeping right now.

527
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,133
Yeah.

528
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:41,273
Well, I guess just to say thanks again,
Dr. Laraby,

529
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,643
and maybe even...

530
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,582
No, sure, I will call one of those clinics.

531
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:50,686
Thanks again.

532
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,724
Everybody's lucky every now and then.

533
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,266
Not in it for a win.

534
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,336
This is to keep it real.

535
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,840
Killer shot. Seal the deal.

536
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,805
2. Craps, 2. High and away.

537
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:55,541
No, no, no, the plumbing contractor's
supposed to start in April.

538
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,179
Right.

539
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:00,218
Then the chap's coming to do the floor.

540
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:02,292
And then the finished carpentry guy
is starting.

541
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,792
Then we're done. I mean, I can't believe it.

542
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,453
Geneen made a really good point.

543
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,555
She said, "Why sit on a plane for 15 hours
all the way to Europe,

544
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,829
"when you can go to Montreal?"
They loved it.

545
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,761
And there are great restaurants,

546
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,741
great hotels, so much less expensive
than Europe. Not touristy.

547
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,743
Your head again? Another migraine?

548
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,943
Yeah.

549
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,852
Why didn't you tell me?

550
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,284
You have enough to worry about.

551
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,860
This is the same as before.
It's a vaso-constrictor.

552
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,702
Here. Under your tongue.

553
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,110
I love when you play doctor with me.

554
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,180
Thank you.

555
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,537
Hey, Charlie!

556
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,001
How you doing? You good?

557
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,911
All's good, captain.

558
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,212
Take care now, all right?

559
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,378
Anne, this seems like such a phenomenon,

560
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:44,011
such an amazing and incredible outpouring
of love and support from your community.

561
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:46,715
Are these people friends, here,
gathered to honor your dad,

562
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:50,486
or is this part of a bigger movement
back toward belief in God?

563
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,885
I think it's both, you know?

564
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,692
I think no one should be alone
with their fears and doubts,

565
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,892
and we call out and our voice is heard.

566
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:03,701
And for that,

567
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:08,176
I give thanks to friends, neighbors,
and loved ones of Calmont.

568
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:15,809
Thanks, Lori.

569
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,486
Okay, guys, let us hold hands and pray.

570
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,528
To the Lord in the hour of my distress,
I call and He answers me.

571
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:32,694
"Oh, Lord, save my soul from lying lips,
from the tongue of the deceitful.

572
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:35,636
"What shall he pay you in return,
O treacherous tongue?

573
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:40,301
"The warrior's arrows sharpened
and coals red-hot blazing. "

574
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,476
Talk to the hotel. They'll take a marker.

575
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,059
Hey, where are you from?

576
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,857
Why? Are you my friend?

577
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,659
Sorry, not me.

578
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,460
And the ones that might be
willing to stake you,

579
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:08,037
they're not your friends either.

580
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:12,006
The figure's 30%,
depending upon your collateral.

581
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:17,012
And if you miss the payback,
you don't have nowhere to go.

582
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,345
-They'll find you.
-I just need 20 grand. That's...

583
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,680
You just tell them about it.

584
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,185
Here.

585
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,081
Good luck.

586
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,490
No, no, you keep it.

587
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,935
Hello? Hello?

588
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,649
Dad? Dad?

589
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,243
Hello?

590
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,990
Keys.

591
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,698
25 K. All right?

592
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,630
See you in a couple of days. All right?

593
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:30,044
Car comes back
when you pay your debt, Charlie.

594
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:50,658
Hi.

595
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:06,376
-God damn it.
-God, you feel so big. Come on.

596
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:11,347
-Fuck!
-No! No! Stay in!

597
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,182
-Fuck this.
-Steve, wait. Come on.

598
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:18,352
No, fuck this, man. It's fucking stupid.

599
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,074
Hey, excuse me, sir. For you?

600
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,550
Mai tai. For me.

601
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,644
And a sign from on high, as they say.

602
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:21,786
If you will or if you would.
If you can or if you could.

603
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,815
You shall if you should.

604
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,963
Feeling lucky, huh?

605
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,238
It's coming along. It's off and on.

606
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,175
Well...

607
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,742
I've been known to change
one into the other, sweetheart.

608
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,751
And that's a sure thing.

609
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,371
Hey. Hello, up there.

610
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,667
Anything working for you?

611
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:27,119
Stop, stop, stop. It's the feeling.

612
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,973
This is mine. See?

613
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,925
Well, he has some congestion,
which could be an allergy,

614
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,399
but he's also a little dehydrated.

615
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:15,096
So, he could just have a fluid imbalance
from missed feedings or something.

616
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:17,105
-Missed feedings?
-Everybody misses one. It's nothing.

617
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:19,869
I'm sure he's just had the runs
and your sitter hasn't told you or something.

618
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,102
He's behind on his electrolytes.

619
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,647
The sitter, yeah, because I know I feed him.
I always... All I do is feed him.

620
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:27,308
How did you go with the pediatrician?
Did you call the clinic?

621
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:30,318
Well, I called, yeah, but maybe
they called back, maybe they didn't.

622
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,887
-I mean, I had to take Davy out.
-It's okay, it's okay.

623
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,922
-He was crying...
-I'm sorry.

624
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:37,186
Listen, we'll just feed him up
till he's nice and sleepy

625
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,557
and we'll keep an eye on him
for the rest of the day.

626
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,062
I know it's frustrating not being able to
help him when he's like this,

627
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,962
but it's nothing life-threatening. Believe me.

628
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,058
-But will you be here?
-All day.

629
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,535
So, if you'll just wait in the waiting room.

630
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,400
Okay. I'll do that. Okay.

631
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:54,204
Dr. Laraby?

632
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:58,809
Don't you think
everything happens for a reason?

633
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,383
Like us. Here.

634
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,316
After what happened in the diner?

635
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,981
We all want to believe it.

636
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,813
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

637
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:44,189
Do you think it has a personality?

638
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,253
Yeah. Of course. Why wouldn't it?

639
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:49,927
What kind does it have?

640
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,626
I mean,

641
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:55,164
what kind of people would live
in a house like this, anyway?

642
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,568
People like us.

643
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:00,204
Right. Intelligent.

644
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,877
Kind.

645
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,107
Wealthy.

646
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,411
With a great sense of humor.

647
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,244
-How are the headaches?
-They're okay.

648
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:16,291
I love the slope of the roof against that hill.
Don't you?

649
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,037
I was looking at the plans again today.

650
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:35,476
And I was thinking,

651
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,637
the sheer walls have to be
where they have to be,

652
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,113
but, in terms of the space inside,

653
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:43,614
we could actually go
with a second spare bedroom,

654
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,210
if we wanted to.

655
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:49,623
In case we decide to, you know...

656
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,088
What?

657
01:08:58,368 --> 01:08:59,767
I love you is what.

658
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:03,203
Did you know that?

659
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:29,262
Calmont Internal.

660
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,394
Yes. Hello, hi. Dr. Laraby, please.

661
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,869
Dr. Laraby isn't on tonight.
Is this a patient or regarding one?

662
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,540
Ma'am? Hello?

663
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,421
No, please. Please.

664
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,203
Come on.

665
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,270
-Ed Sacks, you remember him?
-Yeah.

666
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,969
He had a sister-in-law that couldn't talk.

667
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:24,205
-Oh, God.
-You know what they did?

668
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:27,749
I can't listen to this.
You're just worried about the insurance.

669
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,841
-I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

670
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,284
-Lydia, it's not about that.
-What is it about then?

671
01:11:34,257 --> 01:11:37,988
No, I'm asking you, what is it about?
Because if it's not that, I want to know.

672
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:40,085
Lydia, I've told you a million times,
and you just don't listen.

673
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:43,359
No! What is stopping you
from helping him? That's...

674
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,843
This is the last one I can bring you
on the house unless you play.

675
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:04,942
Okay.

676
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,649
Sir! Sir! If you're gonna play, please step up.

677
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:11,090
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
ask you to take it back.

678
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:12,525
Hey, what the hell, man?

679
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:15,153
-Sorry. Sorry.
-What's the problem with this guy?

680
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,325
Excuse me, sir,
you're gonna have to come with me.

681
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,033
-Lydia...
-He needs help.

682
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,002
By telling him how fucked up he should be?

683
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:25,472
-Nobody is gonna tell him how...
-You're crazy.

684
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,604
You're crazy.

685
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:32,204
You're crazy! You're crazy!
You're crazy! You're crazy!

686
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:35,250
Keep screaming like that,
pretty soon you're gonna start believing it.

687
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:38,910
Okay. Come on, let's go.

688
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:46,127
Can't even piss on his own.
They fucked Michael's head.

689
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,924
Michael was in a fucking war!

690
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,158
He'd be right here, right now,
at home with us if it wasn't for...

691
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:52,598
If it wasn't for what?

692
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,932
This is about Jimmy,
you self-righteous prick.

693
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,963
God, who is in all things,

694
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,870
let us fly free on the wings of angels,

695
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,047
to face fear,

696
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:46,651
avoid pride and temptation,

697
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,484
and be thankful for Thy gifts

698
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,461
above the sins of this earth.

699
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:03,371
Give us the strength
to give strength to others.

700
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:05,874
Stop!

701
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,604
In the name of Thy only son.

702
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:40,629
Good evening, sir.

703
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,344
Changing $20,000.

704
01:15:59,622 --> 01:16:00,782
Okay, Steve.

705
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:04,289
From San Diego.

706
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,660
It's risk and reward.

707
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:10,790
What we're all headed toward.

708
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,025
Now or never.

709
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:14,897
All or nothing.

710
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:17,633
I got faith.

711
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,736
I got doubts.

712
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:23,675
Is it your call?

713
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,341
Mine?

714
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:28,810
Question is,

715
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:32,381
am I lucky?

716
01:16:42,498 --> 01:16:43,931
14, sir.

717
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,365
-Hey. How are you?
-Hey.

718
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:50,598
Good. And you?

719
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,071
I'm good. Listen, I'm sorry.

720
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,165
I got a pedes case waiting.
I'm not gonna make it for lunch.

721
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,766
Do you want to
just grab something without me?

722
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:59,338
I didn't think you were going to make it.
I'm eating leftovers anyway.

723
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,478
-What leftovers?
-The soup from last night.

724
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,985
It's even better today. I've had some already.

725
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:12,327
-I didn't see you save any.
-Well, I'm not saving any for you.

726
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:15,522
Then I have to head out to the site.
I need to check some measurements.

727
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,065
Tell you what? Why don't you stay there?
Maybe I can get away.

728
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,532
You just said you couldn't, silly.

729
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,500
I'll only be half an hour.
That's all I have anyway.

730
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:24,698
Yeah, but why don't you wait?
Then maybe later we can both go out there.

731
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:28,072
Later? I'm late now if I want to
get any work done at all today.

732
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:30,737
I'll call you when I get back, okay? Bye.

733
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,540
Jo?

734
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,241
Listen, will you get the day nurse
to deal with her,

735
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:38,217
and get child services here right now?

736
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,338
Hey, Charlie.

737
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:01,335
Was just coming to see how you fared.

738
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,537
I was hoping you'd look like a winner.

739
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:13,044
Hey, Jimmy?

740
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,658
Jim?

741
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,321
Bob.

742
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:22,998
Bob.

743
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:24,894
Have you seen Jimmy?

744
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:27,794
No.

745
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:39,144
Put it down right here.

746
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,515
Just so that I'm straight here,
so that nobody misunderstood anybody,

747
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:56,394
you lost 25 and change in a day?
Is that what happened?

748
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,327
Charlie, is that what happened?

749
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,430
So, empty your pockets for me, Charlie.

750
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,853
Charlie, you use that, okay? You call a cab.

751
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,514
You call someone from your family
to come get you.

752
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:24,752
Get down on your knees.
I want you to grab the crate.

753
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,256
You know, I hate this, Charlie.

754
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:34,268
I fucking hate it, but it's happening
because you're stupid.

755
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,907
Okay.

756
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:28,014
Please. Please, no. Please! Please don't!

757
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:31,524
God, please don't! Please! Please!

758
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,923
-Please!
-Pray!

759
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:36,330
Please!

760
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,578
Anne? Anne?

761
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,846
It's Jimmy's mom.
He's been gone since last night.

762
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,050
It's okay, I know where he is.

763
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,466
Miss Davenport,
we just have a few questions

764
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:51,130
before you can see Davy. Will that be okay?

765
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:00,140
Hold it!

766
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,734
Jo! Jo!

767
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:52,196
Kath? Kath.

768
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,059
God knows they were brave, Jimmy.

769
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:23,956
Dad smiled down on me
like he didn't have a care in the world.

770
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,658
God wants you to be brave.

771
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,026
And you can be, too.

772
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:34,131
God can help you see into the hearts
of everyone who fell, like I do.

773
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:38,644
-His witness, which you are, too.
-So, witness, but tell what you really saw.

774
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:41,239
-Tell it!
-Jimmy.

775
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:43,850
This is dangerous.

776
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:48,984
Whatever you two think that
you have to hide,

777
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:50,456
-it's not worth...
-Tell it!

778
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,352
Annie.

779
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,466
I saw Dad,

780
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:07,175
and he smiled down
and he told me not to be scared.

781
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:10,302
He was so brave. And then...

782
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,073
I was holding his hand,
and he was holding mine,

783
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:15,673
-and then his Coke spilled.
-No!

784
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:20,885
Then there was more shots,

785
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:23,651
-and the alarm went off.
-No! Remember it!

786
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,357
-You go on and I will.
-Jimmy. Please.

787
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:30,895
This is enough.

788
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:34,795
Tell it.

789
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,300
He did...

790
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,639
-He did...
-Nothing!

791
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,046
Please, no. Please! Please don't.

792
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,751
God! Please don't. Please.

793
01:24:58,527 --> 01:24:59,687
Please.

794
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:01,454
Please.

795
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,257
Please.

796
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:14,361
Don't you say anything.

797
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:17,732
Ever.

798
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:31,004
Jimmy.

799
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:32,941
Give me the gun.

800
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,887
Okay? Just give me the gun.

801
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,094
Here we go.

802
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:02,768
I just sat there.

803
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:05,675
I just sat there while

804
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,640
that man shot Dad, and I...

805
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,210
I didn't do anything.

806
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,848
I didn't hold his hand.

807
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,592
I let go of his hand.

808
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:21,627
I let go of it. I couldn't help it, I...

809
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,401
He didn't die brave like I said at all.
He was just...

810
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:33,801
He was just scared, alone,
and I couldn't do anything, Mom.

811
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:37,072
I'm sorry.

812
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,679
No, it's okay.

813
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,620
I can't ever forgive that man for what he did.

814
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,881
I can't. Never.

815
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:10,907
Never again. It'll stop. Just give me this.

816
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:16,442
Jo, Jo. It's all right. It's all right. It's me.

817
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:21,278
Okay. You're okay. It's all right. It's me.

818
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:22,481
It's okay.

819
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:30,955
You're gonna be okay. I promise.
You're gonna be okay.

820
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,162
You okay?

821
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:49,103
You wanna talk?

822
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:53,109
Just wanna sit here for a while?

823
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,800

01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:08,754
In the ordinary world,
we trust in where things belong.

825
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:13,163
Everything has a place,

826
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:15,463
and believing in that makes us innocent.

827
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:20,440
And through the days under the same sky,

828
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:24,137
we hope, dream, and laugh.

829
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,742
We find and lose our way.

830
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,750
Endings are beginnings,

831
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:34,378
and moments, like pieces, fit together again.
