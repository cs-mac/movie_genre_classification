3
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:15,160
She saw me first
completely naked.

4
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:20,619
We were only seven, but
yet I have such feeling.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,422
I played for first time
doctors and nurses with her.

6
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:29,047
She saw my cock
and did not run away screaming.

7
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:33,807
Anyway, Allison and I
were made for each other.

8
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:38,645
So I knew
that when she was moving ...

9
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:42,936
that fate
would bring us back together.

10
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:45,647
Berke.

11
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,024
Berke Landers.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,734
I agree. Allison McAllister.

13
00:00:58,207 --> 00:01:04,291
Of all canteens in the world
precisely they walked inside the mine.

14
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:09,379
It was perfect. I was dating
with the most beautiful girl.

15
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:12,628
And we played still governor.

16
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:20,929
I was the first time in my life
love and it would last forever.

17
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:24,935
Was I just an idiot.

18
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:29,231
We need to talk.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,732
You know, everything in life ...

20
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:39,198
even the nicest things ...

21
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,613
eventually comes to an end,
right?

22
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,787
Trends persist,
moldy bread ...

23
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,492
people die.

24
00:01:54,298 --> 00:02:00,418
I mean ... Remember
we met for the first kiss?

25
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,638
That feeling those butterflies in your stomach?

26
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:08,476
If we kiss each other now ...

27
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:15,812
was feeling, frankly,
more or less disappeared.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,454
I've already packed all your stuff. That
makes things easier, I thought.

29
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:41,535
My parents, Frank and Beverly,
present "Love Matters."

30
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,293
That sounds cool.

31
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:47,120
This is for both partners
a good scolding.

32
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,877
And you have eye contact.

33
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:53,923
Coolio, you want one sometime?

34
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,382
We are right back.

35
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,930
Here are the CD's, Mom.

36
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:04,594
Guests are angry
if you do not know their CD.

37
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:10,269
You were home early yesterday. You okay
okay between you and Allison?

38
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:15,312
Not really. Can we talk?
- You know our rule.

39
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,900
If we are not happy ...
- Never mind.

40
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:21,027
What is it?

41
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:24,696
Frank, and Allison Berke
have problems.

42
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:29,291
Communication Problems?
- Limits on the scan?

43
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:33,416
Dependency?
- No, it's not.

44
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:35,255
Sex is.

45
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,048
She dumped me.

46
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:43,846
Poor guy.

47
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,382
I would rather not talk about.

48
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,199
I want to go home.
- It's good.

49
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:16,202
That's right. Look at that to
all those beautiful ... Is that my little sister?

50
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,043
Hey grab happy, feet home.
That's my sister.

51
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:25,293
Should you not for a pajama party?

52
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:31,844
I'm a year younger. He received
pink roller skates on his birthday.

53
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,299
It was a nice gift.

54
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,676
Have I anything to you?

55
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:43,142
Come on. That boy there
set free navel piercings.

56
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:47,235
Okay, here it is.
- So?

57
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:52,606
I said I was out of town. As
he sees me, he goes by 't lint.

58
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:56,526
You're Fri
There must get used to it.

59
00:07:56,746 --> 00:08:02,120
You had him to see. It takes a while
before it has processed.

60
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:05,086
Have you already incorporated?

61
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:09,923
Allow me.

62
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,967
Who is that?

63
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:26,306
Are you first in the U.S.?
- Well, Lucky. So hot you?

64
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,521
Hear what it sissy says?

65
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:35,688
My father was a diplomat. I lived
abroad. Shanghai.

66
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:42,525
And I have acted in Amsterdam
Swing Town with The Lads.

67
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:47,537
He was already so familiar to me.
- He talks like Madonna.

68
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,754
She is here.
- Who? Madonna?

69
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:02,461
It is perfect.
- You are not going her.

70
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,380
Then you give her your dick
onto a platter.

71
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,811
If you do, you will
its slave. You do not want.

72
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:15,729
Felix, I piss sometimes longer
then take your dating.

73
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,061
Okay?
- I think so.

74
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:26,361
It is wild to it.
Luckily I could catch you.

75
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:29,743
I'm also glad.

76
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:32,279
Will you dance with me?

77
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:41,015
She is your friend anymore.
- And that's not so bad.

78
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:46,220
Later, go to my other school.
Sometimes you wanted to marry her?

79
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:50,223
Who does that?
- Tell me not Macaulay Culkin.

80
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,151
I call her.

81
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:59,941
Do not. Do not be so familiar.
You've called her for forty times.

82
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,786
Aside.

83
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:23,630
He calls himself Striker.
# Love Scud? #

84
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:28,515
What he said when he gave this to you?

85
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:31,597
Oh, he asked them if I went out.

86
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:36,103
You should not so lightly
Duplication.

87
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,733
I think he is a splatter.

88
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:06,879
Not believe that you was dating him.

89
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:13,550
Hear that? The neighbors scream al
Now go along.

90
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,268
Just look from where you fall.

91
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:26,485
A little more left.
Other links.

92
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:32,531
Go to your feelings and turn t then
at. How hard is it not?

93
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,992
I stand there alone.
- I'm scared of you

94
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:39,074
I love you. Do you understand?

95
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,536
How you dress you?
Do you have servants for?

96
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:46,325
A Midsummer Night Rock?

97
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:50,674
Shakespeare
with a touch of contemporary music.

98
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:54,173
How did you get this number?

99
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:59,590
He has no taste,
if he hates us.

100
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:01,386
Both.

101
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,970
Lazario, your brain surgery successful?

102
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:10,063
What are you happy.
Did your exam or something?

103
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,399
No, I had a 5, 7.

104
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:20,359
Shit. Heavy shit, man.
- It is annoying, nothing more.

105
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:25,783
For example, I hear. If they
who wants to flap his turd, let her.

106
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,915
Provisional.
- What do you mean?

107
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:33,871
If I lose all Allison,
it is not such a turd flap.

108
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:40,757
He has something to fall Allison.

109
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,211
You're asleep, Landers.

110
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,927
Nice diversion, "crazy legs".

111
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:55,063
Someone with such emphasis
take it seriously?

112
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,183
Listen, give up on the nou.

113
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:02,027
No way. I
Back Street Blow Jaw who remembered that.

114
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:19,082
Knap caught with your head. Soon
you shoot three-pointers with your ass.

115
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,167
Berke, let me have a look.
- Go back train.

116
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,841
Berke, talk to do with me.

117
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:36,224
How can you replace me now
by that guy?

118
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:41,512
Nobody can replace you.

119
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:46,061
It was just time
to try something new.

120
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:50,738
So everything goes well
between you and the Striker?

121
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:56,702
No, it's just different.
Know what I mean?

122
00:14:56,912 --> 00:15:01,989
He is different than other boys.
He has developed.

123
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:07,036
We even participated in the auditions
for the spring musical.

124
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,706
You hate musicals.

125
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:13,544
False.

126
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:21,636
King of the Elves of row
Helena is near here.

127
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:24,307
I see no ball.

128
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:31,020
What happened to your face?
- Long story.

129
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:35,066
A Midsummer Night's Dream?
Will you audition?

130
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,023
Maybe.

131
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,482
I want to help you best, though.
- Are you serious?

132
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:47,412
You know her songs?
She is the new Josie Mitchell.

133
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:50,874
Joni Mitchell.
- I can help.

134
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:56,791
Shall we drink morning coffee?
- Seems a good plan.

135
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:06,094
"I want to help you best, you know."

136
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:09,225
Did you see Dennis back at me?

137
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:14,395
You must pick a monologue
for your audition.

138
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,311
This is good. Lysander.

139
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,188
She sees not Hermia ...

140
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:27,450
Wait. You should not everything
row chant.

141
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,281
Never mind. We start again.

142
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:35,490
It is difficult, but the story
is actually pretty good.

143
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,374
Hermia, it is a girl ...

144
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:43,834
lives in Athens
with her dominant parents.

145
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:51,795
She has everything. Beautiful clothes, a
intact skin, and boys galore.

146
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:54,684
Of all the boys in Athens ...

147
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:59,139
her heart belongs to
the noble Lysander.

148
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:03,020
But Demetrius appears
the scene.

149
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:09,105
Hermia's father has promised her to
him. He is as handsome as Lysander.

150
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:14,861
Maybe even prettier. And
He does everything to get to Hermia.

151
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,660
Lysander may therefore be shaking.

152
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:26,000
I understand.
You put it very well.

153
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,872
We are beginning.

154
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,509
I do not oscar, Kelly.
I want my girlfriend back.

155
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,923
Hello. How are you?
All new faces.

156
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,679
I am Dr. Desmond Forrest-Oates.
Head drama and much more.

157
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:53,893
The intention is that today
separating the wheat from the chaff.

158
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:58,857
Who knows is there among you are
a new star.

159
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:03,950
The next Peter Wong,
I say.

160
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,075
Hi, Petie. Cool T-shirt.

161
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:14,202
Who is not selected,
not despair.

162
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:20,127
You could always behind the scenes
work. That's nice.

163
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:25,301
Just kidding. I could not resist.
You turn me on to.

164
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:30,853
The procedure is simple.
We begin with the singing audition.

165
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:36,400
Discard the loose diaphragm, for now
it is time to impress.

166
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:26,101
Nice.
Who wrote that song?

167
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,561
Myself.

168
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:35,118
You expect applause? This is
an audition, not a television show.

169
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,414
Who is next?
Bentley Scrumfeld.

170
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,459
He is a member of The Swing Town Lads.

171
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:49,496
You know your boys groups.
- I follow the music closely.

172
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:51,754
I like them so well.

173
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:57,637
I would like to accompany me.
- Write on.

174
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:05,304
This is my favorite song.

175
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,648
He is the best so far.

176
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:13,244
Very well, Mr.. Striker.
Very impressive.

177
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,324
Well, this was it.
- Wait.

178
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:23,703
Who are you?
- Berke Landers. I'll audition.

179
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:28,004
Ah, Berke Landers. Lucky me briefly.

180
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:33,055
I read a monologue
Oberon in 't Act III.

181
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:38,093
Very happy.
But first I want to sing.

182
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:43,020
We sing first
and later we nominate.

183
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:51,400
Jessica, help me.
I sink into quicksand with that guy.

184
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:54,651
Sing first, then read.

185
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:11,255
No matter which song?
- That's right.

186
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:22,391
Projection, Mr.. Berke.
Can the little louder?

187
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:20,817
What are you doing?
- Nothing. Chester riding the ficus.

188
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,606
Is it a bike?

189
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:26,321
No, the dog of my aunt
staying here.

190
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:30,281
And it is hormonal upset.

191
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:37,872
Kelly is at home?
Kelly, your sister. Is that home?

192
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:42,462
Why?
- She has helped me. Give at her.

193
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,958
Well. One moment, please.

194
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,260
Since when
my friends call you?

195
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,097
Since today.

196
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,424
How did you find me?

197
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,265
You were not bad.

198
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:06,808
I thought you knew
you had to sing. You were cute.

199
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,483
Tell it to Allison.

200
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:12,863
I hope that you can play along.

201
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:17,235
I hear you gasping.

202
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,081
Warning. Staff.
Just go my way.

203
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:30,458
Move, please.
Sorry.

204
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,507
Demetrius, great.

205
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:44,928
HART, Hermia.
- Are you serious?

206
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:49,063
The school goes out of his roof, people.

207
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,859
Dance group? Worthless stuff, say.

208
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:57,731
Helen?

209
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:04,824
Good news?
- Sorry, but I did like that role.

210
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,279
That's just good.

211
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:09,740
Look, there you stand.

212
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:15,663
I hope that servant three
No need to sing solos.

213
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,502
Congratulations, Miss Woods.

214
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,042
It is a key.
- I know.

215
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,629
That you can better
not blow it.

216
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:31,098
Bobby DeNiro once said to me.
Well, I read in one article.

217
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:35,854
He said: The fact that God
has blessed you ...

218
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:40,015
does not mean
that there is never anything can go wrong.

219
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:47,649
Anyway. Until Thursday
the rehearsals. You too.

220
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:53,121
Dr. Forrest-Oates,
that is a problem.

221
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:58,206
Next week
the basketball play-offs.

222
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:02,879
Listen, mister.

223
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,550
This is your stage debut
and take you seriously.

224
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,928
All of your game is half as much as I
have given to this production.

225
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:19,515
, Or not. That is the question.

226
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:28,069
Those were my glory days.

227
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,983
Although it is not bad.

228
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:38,111
Thursday. And no more excuses,
mans sport.

229
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:46,034
Come on, Jessica. Come on.

230
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,210
Excuse me, I am teacher.

231
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:55,672
Where you going, Landers?

232
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,723
So Lysander loves Hermia
and they of him ...

233
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:07,473
but she is promised to Demetrius
Helena who is in love.

234
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:11,389
What a hoot, huh?
The breaks from pleurisy.

235
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:18,227
Mickey Rourke once said ... He was
a feast of Liza Minelli.

236
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:23,158
Mr. Landers, glad you're here.

237
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,904
And thanks that you have not showered.
Super.

238
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:32,329
The secret is obviously
that the four young lovers ...

239
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:36,328
their own destiny
not in their hands ...

240
00:27:36,548 --> 00:27:40,082
because living in the forest ...
- Fairies.

241
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:44,215
Fairies, right.
These are spirits, of course.

242
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:50,261
In particular, Titania, Oberon and Puck.

243
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:52,600
Little Stevie.
- Steven.

244
00:27:52,812 --> 00:27:59,016
They enjoy it for
playing with human feelings.

245
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:03,066
It is interesting to see
how those elves ...

246
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:10,867
Look, we have wings.
- It comes from your ass fairy dust.

247
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,786
Come along, monkey.

248
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:17,243
Hermia, you are so sexy and everything.

249
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:19,084
Hey, Red. Follow us.

250
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:24,750
You see us, but you must
obey us, bunch of suckers.

251
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:28,963
Someone flirts with you chick.
Give him ass.

252
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:33,169
Demetrius, what are you doing here?

253
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:39,226
Lysander, give to my right
your feeble claim.

254
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:42,521
En garde.
- They do not fight in this document.

255
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:44,605
Now.

256
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,625
Hell with, you.

257
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,843
From bad to worse.

258
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,177
Are we dreaming?

259
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:36,152
A musical? You call my sister?
- It helps me with things.

260
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:39,613
My sister?
- She did understand.

261
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:42,196
This is not about her.

262
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:47,534
You sit still behind Allison
on. And that's ridiculous.

263
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:50,663
See you on the field.

264
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:54,455
We need somebody else to find him.

265
00:29:54,671 --> 00:30:00,839
Difficult. Just take those old woman from
# Titanic. # She never came over.

266
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:06,342
I mean not just anyone.
You do it with technology Dora Lynn?

267
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:11,099
Last week they shot
to anyone with a staple gun.

268
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,929
It is not useful.
- Thanks to Dora Lynn ...

269
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,441
Dickie is standing Berg Well poop.

270
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,518
We ask her
to an apartment building.

271
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,189
Why would she doing?
- That's your problem.

272
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,902
Berke I edit it.

273
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,902
Dennis heard it.
That girl on your kicks.

274
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:37,122
Nonsense.
- Why should I invent?

275
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:43,253
This is a great opportunity.
The Stanley Cup for blind dates.

276
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:49,584
Those eyes, that mouth, those breasts.
- Do not forget anything?

277
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,339
Well, she is clumsy.

278
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:58,681
She's a disaster. Everywhere she goes,
accidents happen.

279
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:02,766
Rare accidents, I mean.

280
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:10,355
She could not go to school six years.

281
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,481
She was in coma.

282
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:17,234
Berke, she is pretty.
She has a great body.

283
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:23,491
And they shall not appear to require.
What could be wrong with her?

284
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:30,955
Your turn to get the ball.
- No way. Get you 'm only.

285
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:45,757
Would you like to do something for me?
- What then?

286
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:56,941
Berke, not nervous.
I am own free will.

287
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:59,480
We never really talked.

288
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:04,028
That was because I
too busy with Allison.

289
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:09,487
You had your hands full with that whole ...
- Coma-stuff?

290
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:15,787
You know, Berke. You just
start again.

291
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:19,290
I would bring misfortune.
That was then.

292
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:24,419
I pick up the thread of my life
again. And you must do.

293
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:32,599
Would you like to excuse me?
I must ... because

294
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:34,603
Pee?

295
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:47,446
Can I have some tea?
Oh, what a great music.

296
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:51,987
Tits.

297
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:14,172
Bill, please.

298
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:34,406
This is not good.

299
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:39,077
I'd be lying,
but this is three times nothing.

300
00:33:39,288 --> 00:33:41,079
I want to hear emotion.

301
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:51,463
"I wish I could pick." I
want to see you pluck, you understand me?

302
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:53,334
Theseus enters.

303
00:33:53,550 --> 00:34:00,548
Servants, a lover makes love
the daughter of your lord.

304
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:05,012
That is outrageous.
You are shocked.

305
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:07,137
Look shocked.

306
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:12,899
I said shocked, Mr.. Landers.
Not if you can not poop.

307
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,146
Dear heavens. Go ahead, Del.

308
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,815
Now, let the hunters them
with horns wake.

309
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:26,703
You would have let me know
if you had had a stroke?

310
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,829
Are you lost?

311
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:41,666
I've specified as stagehand.

312
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:46,262
Then you hear where to sit.

313
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:59,432
Say I confused, sir?
It's like I still dream.

314
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:04,396
I came with Hermia into the forest
Athens to leave ...

315
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:10,533
to go to a place where our
The Athenian law is not threatened.

316
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:16,286
Keep that but for the premiere.
- Sorry.

317
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,743
I would like to know
you do here ...

318
00:35:56,952 --> 00:36:02,787
but if a stranger my friend
would steal, I would do the same.

319
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,916
Only I 'm involved here.

320
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:08,582
You drop your sword.

321
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,932
Sorry.
I have a big game.

322
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,440
Exchange.

323
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,768
There was an accident.
- You have luck.

324
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:42,230
Next week the play-offs.
Give them their Thurs

325
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,169
I just go.

326
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:18,938
Play more comfortable.

327
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,230
At home we have no real piano.

328
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:28,907
You only busy, huh?

329
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:32,403
Yes, I was in my bare ass
on the field.

330
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:34,696
For love.

331
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:43,454
Play something for me.

332
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:49,128
It sounded good.
- I am ashamed.

333
00:37:51,512 --> 00:37:55,841
I like to write songs.
- What is it?

334
00:37:56,058 --> 00:38:00,352
Forrest-Oates finds
my number nothing.

335
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:08,442
I admire you because you
that vulnerable stage draw.

336
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:13,279
I thought it was a very beautiful song.

337
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:23,072
This is a song of mine.

338
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:46,601
Boaster.

339
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:17,463
Berke, what do you
of half naked women?

340
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,626
Where are we going?

341
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:26,465
Dennis and I have discussed
and we find that you need it.

342
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:29,765
We got special guest
tonight.

343
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:35,977
A young man by his girlfriend
is put aside.

344
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,063
See ya, casanova.

345
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:56,614
What is that?
- Monday we always crazy, people.

346
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:10,422
Behold my tasty body
in this corset.

347
00:40:10,636 --> 00:40:15,631
Police.
ID cards, and some quickly.

348
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:32,440
Can someone let me fall?
Please.

349
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:41,329
We are astonished.
The police are not calling every day ...

350
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:46,117
stating that your son
was picked up into a sex club.

351
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:52,836
Your father and I have discussed
and we are incredibly proud of you.

352
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:58,838
Because you pick up your life again.
Most children can not.

353
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:04,393
You do. You climbed back on your horse,
harness or should I say?

354
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,934
I am arrested.
Are not you angry?

355
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:11,728
Why? You're just curious.

356
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:17,813
We did not realize you were so perverse.
Who wants frozen yogurt?

357
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:22,776
Berke might want to go home
It's a crazy jerk.

358
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:25,032
Make me frozen yogurt.

359
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:34,960
Pull her up.

360
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:46,051
Ladies and gentlemen,
prisoner number 6943.

361
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:52,099
Well done, Landers.
You're photogenic, you know.

362
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:57,769
Take care with your accent.
You sound like Mary Poppins.

363
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,647
What are you talking about?
If I were you ...

364
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:06,604
Do you have makeup on?

365
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,491
That's it.

366
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,279
Watch out, Landers.
Your spot on with your life.

367
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,750
Who nou fighting sticks
in his pants?

368
00:42:25,382 --> 00:42:27,208
Peter Wong was injured.

369
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:34,301
How fortunate you are singer
and not a dancer.

370
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:38,133
I kill you,
oetlul pretentious.

371
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:40,759
This is my theater.

372
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:45,474
My version.
Forrest-Oates is my boyfriend.

373
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:47,731
That was intense.

374
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:51,775
I've never
see a bone sticking out so far.

375
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:56,068
Everything will be okay
according to the nurses.

376
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:59,866
Peter will soon
will walk again.

377
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,452
As Kevin Spacey once said:
The show goes on.

378
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,242
The premiere is already over three days.

379
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,421
Those who sign up to volunteer
the role of Lysander?

380
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:20,296
Hand away, little Steve.
You already have a role, Striker.

381
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:25,092
I know,
but I want to nominate someone.

382
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,473
I feel very flattered ...

383
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:34,646
but a man of 34
you can not keep pace.

384
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,644
I had honestly
Berke Landers on the eye.

385
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:49,121
Very interesting. Has anyone
a useful idea? Hand away, Steve.

386
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:55,286
He is inexperienced, but he does have
a certain kind of enthusiasm.

387
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:57,211
I do it.

388
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:01,170
You do it? -Yes.

389
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,929
But fixed ordering pizza, Jessica.

390
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:09,715
Keep that ice on your buttocks.
Otherwise, the swelling worse.

391
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:13,551
I need you, but not really.

392
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:18,181
What we have swords?
- Seven.

393
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:19,976
Kites, eight.

394
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:24,106
If Allison does not appreciate this ...
- What then?

395
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:28,360
You know your text well.

396
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:33,201
Yes, but then my singing?
- My song sucks.

397
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:38,204
Rewrite it.
- I never pick Forrest-Oates.

398
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:42,248
You have
more savvy than he.

399
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,620
That he sees differently.

400
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:50,543
He gave me a key.
He is an idiot, Allison.

401
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:56,217
My name is Kelly.

402
00:44:57,225 --> 00:44:59,182
What did I say? -Allison.

403
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:00,852
Nietes.

404
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:03,138
Sorry. -I shoot you dead.

405
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:08,350
That thing is dangerous.
Put it's gone.

406
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:20,489
It is my white boy
with an arrow in his arm.

407
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:22,946
I thought he was not real.

408
00:45:23,165 --> 00:45:25,074
I want to see it.

409
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:28,328
It looks awful, huh?

410
00:45:28,545 --> 00:45:35,081
The physician makes your arm and better than
play the stars of heaven.

411
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:39,512
Your arm does not look so ...
Oh, my God.

412
00:46:01,074 --> 00:46:05,652
Thursday, Kelly
quarter to twelve at you.

413
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:10,448
Felix, but it is Kelly.
She helps me to rehearse.

414
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:16,454
Keep her in the eye.
These actors are all ...

415
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:18,794
Gay?
- That they are not.

416
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:21,213
I love her in the eye.

417
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:53,287
When your parents go away?
- Today. Forget it.

418
00:46:53,495 --> 00:47:00,376
You want to organize a party.
I should have a look inside.

419
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:05,377
What should he a music store?
- Tap dance shoes.

420
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,626
And that proves once again ...

421
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:12,128
that man needed to celebrate.

422
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:18,133
You have the pressure,
but can I talk to you?

423
00:47:18,351 --> 00:47:22,680
Miss Woods, come inside.
What a nice hair clip.

424
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:29,016
It's about my song.
"Pocket full of dreams."

425
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:34,146
I wrote that song
for Diana Ross.

426
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:38,690
Miss Ross,
I have a swinging song for you

427
00:47:38,911 --> 00:47:41,153
You are in my hand, buddy.

428
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:49,542
Unfortunately interfered lawyers
with it.

429
00:47:49,754 --> 00:47:53,917
And then there was a lot of chatter.

430
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:57,336
And before you know,
The deal does not.

431
00:47:57,553 --> 00:48:01,420
It is a good song.
I like to sing.

432
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:07,428
But would you mind if I
place a few comments?

433
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:10,349
A few comments?

434
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,984
Oh, long slow night
accelerate ahead.

435
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:20,863
I thought, as you said:
The song does not.

436
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:28,402
Would you do me a favor?
Read again what is on that poster.

437
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:31,373
Eating and drinking is forbidden ...

438
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:38,036
It reads: Twelve songs
composed by Dr. Forrest-Oates.

439
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:40,746
Oh, that? -Yes.

440
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:46,091
It does not say: Numbers rewritten
by Miss hellion.

441
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:49,340
The text of Shakespeare.

442
00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:52,593
Which song do you know yet from Macbeth?

443
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:58,646
Bill Shakespeare's a great poet,
but he is not Burt Bacharach.

444
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:05,779
Sorry I'm late.
- Does not. I'm taken.

445
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:09,986
We have
find a girlfriend for him.

446
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:15,574
What was Forrest-Oates?
- An even bigger jerk than I thought.

447
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:20,000
Maybe you do to brighten it.
- A present?

448
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,581
First rehearse. Good?

449
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,596
Still 21 hours to go and I start
worse still sing.

450
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:49,725
We let the songs for what they are.
We carry the text.

451
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:54,606
Theseus has just
awakened everyone.

452
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:13,039
In this scene you play and Hermia.
I pretend I'm Allison.

453
00:50:14,091 --> 00:50:18,752
That will not be easy.
- Go ahead.

454
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:27,097
Theseus says: Now, let the hunters
awaken them with horns.

455
00:50:27,311 --> 00:50:33,313
Hermia and then says: "And I am everything,
were as conspicuous shared.

456
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:36,395
And I saw everything twice.

457
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:41,814
I know.

458
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:46,279
Say I confused, sir,
't bring me a reproach ...

459
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:50,706
It is me, if I still dream.

460
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,951
I came with Hermia into the forest ...

461
00:50:56,337 --> 00:51:00,998
planning to leave for Athens
for a place ...

462
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:04,632
us where the Athenian Law
not threatening.

463
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:09,387
And then they kiss each other.
So I will kiss Allison.

464
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:15,053
But in this case ...

465
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:28,988
Let me guess, Berke was with you.

466
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,773
Felix, where are you?
- On a party.

467
00:51:31,994 --> 00:51:37,498
Berke Tell them to go.
Everyone asks about him.

468
00:51:37,707 --> 00:51:39,783
We need to your home.

469
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:44,832
I'm impressed.
The turnout is not against.

470
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:46,790
Where is Felix?

471
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:50,376
Take deep breath,
otherwise you completely flip.

472
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:54,887
I'm looking there.
- I will murder him.

473
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:04,265
Look at, by my player.
- Have you seen Felix?

474
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:08,609
You sound tense.
Got stage fright?

475
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,147
Or are you in love with you-know-who.

476
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,321
How about the party?
- What I think of it?

477
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:23,078
What do you mean?
- What you see in the Minkukel?

478
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:28,959
Go back to the porch
light and put it orally.

479
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,669
This is Striker.
- Until the show.

480
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:37,342
What is this?
- Nothing. I plague her.

481
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:41,881
I get this to myself.
- He takes you to, that's different.

482
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:44,055
You better go.

483
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:48,595
You think I Allison
would cheat?

484
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,935
Where is the food?

485
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:05,826
Is it me,
or bowl tastes weird?

486
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:07,909
There are lumps in.

487
00:53:14,085 --> 00:53:16,540
I was wondering where you were.

488
00:53:16,754 --> 00:53:19,707
I just want to talk about Striker.

489
00:53:19,923 --> 00:53:23,837
You never keep up, huh?

490
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:47,898
You can all drop dead.

491
00:54:03,545 --> 00:54:05,289
Hi.

492
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:11,047
Sorry about this festival.
My brother is quite a jerk.

493
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:12,755
Rather.

494
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:18,557
I'm thinking to give away
he leaves his sex hidden.

495
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:20,676
That was a joke.

496
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:26,980
Kelly, why are you with me for?

497
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:33,359
You might have better things to do
than to raise a loser.

498
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,700
You're not a loser.
- Allison thinks so.

499
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:40,281
Allison is a stupid bitch.

500
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:47,408
I've really done everything
for that girl.

501
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:51,254
They just do not understand.

502
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:28,869
I can not.

503
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:38,746
Kelly, I think your great,
but I can not.

504
00:55:38,964 --> 00:55:41,799
You're the sister of Felix.

505
00:55:45,136 --> 00:55:46,678
Fuck.

506
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:50,837
Kelly, wait.
So what I meant.

507
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:56,387
What was that?
- It's not what you think.

508
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,730
What is it?

509
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:08,815
Why am I suddenly happy
that we previously left?

510
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,317
I knew nothing about a party, Berke.

511
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:18,739
Otherwise we paid a deejay.
- Put your furniture well again?

512
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:23,833
Judy just pooped in our pool
and you want a deejay?

513
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:26,003
Why are we so cool.

514
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:29,539
We trust you.

515
00:56:30,426 --> 00:56:33,759
You are my parents.
Stop it.

516
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:42,175
Poor Judy.
- I'll get the shovel.

517
00:56:56,032 --> 00:56:58,903
Interesting.
- It wasn 't.

518
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,570
I saw it myself.
He kissed you.

519
00:57:02,788 --> 00:57:07,082
I do not know why.
Berke is somewhat confused.

520
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:09,368
I kissed him.

521
00:57:11,505 --> 00:57:16,462
It is indeed quite confused.
He loves other ...

522
00:57:16,676 --> 00:57:19,712
but that's my problem, Felix.

523
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:30,393
I'd be lying if I said
I enjoyed it.

524
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:39,066
But Berke has not
how wonderful you are ...

525
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,317
he has a problem.

526
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:20,180
I agree. Berke.
I wanted to thank you for any help.

527
00:58:20,399 --> 00:58:24,895
All songwriters
Using such a thing.

528
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:29,690
If there is anyone who called
can improve, it's you.

529
00:58:29,908 --> 00:58:36,195
I believe in you, Kelly.
Toi, toi, toi.

530
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,075
Let's deal with mortals
again.

531
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:26,408
This will him
and think.

532
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:31,333
Give the sourpuss only my dose.
- Wake up.

533
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:33,752
And I'm gone.

534
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:41,551
In the forest
where the delicious smell ...

535
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:44,930
I will meet my Lysander.

536
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:58,683
Maybe you should
dreaming about someone else.

537
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:02,901
You were the first.
Nobody can replace you.

538
01:00:03,116 --> 01:00:06,816
I've enchanted your ex-girlfriend.

539
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,574
You were the ultimate couple.

540
01:00:09,788 --> 01:00:12,742
She is your friend anymore.

541
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,375
I pick up the thread of my life
again, and you too.

542
01:00:18,588 --> 01:00:21,921
We make him mad?
- Yes, we do.

543
01:00:32,058 --> 01:00:36,435
The costumes of the servants there.
- Thank Buddha.

544
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:41,473
Your wife called,
they can not come tonight.

545
01:00:41,692 --> 01:00:47,694
She said why not?
- She talked rather incoherent.

546
01:00:47,906 --> 01:00:51,109
And there is something, sir.

547
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:57,612
Del Molden Junior is sick.
- My dance partner? Shit.

548
01:00:57,831 --> 01:01:00,156
You go wash your mouth.

549
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:05,333
He has spoiled drinking bowl.
He can not occur.

550
01:01:05,546 --> 01:01:11,050
Not that it matters, because this
production is a fiasco anyway.

551
01:01:12,594 --> 01:01:18,928
That said, does anyone
role of the drunkard to play?

552
01:01:20,935 --> 01:01:26,605
Fine. Is there anyone at all
who can dance a little?

553
01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:32,604
A dance step, a twist,
or some nice movement.

554
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:37,316
The basketball coach
calls me sometimes 'crazy legs'.

555
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:39,111
Really, dude?

556
01:01:43,497 --> 01:01:48,953
Wait a minute. Take it
one half only to turn back.

557
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:50,876
Follow me.

558
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,714
This I learned
by watching.

559
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:02,084
Should you not prepare you?
- I'm in the grime.

560
01:02:02,305 --> 01:02:05,259
You must do something for me.

561
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:16,226
Ladies and gentlemen, take place.
The show will begin.

562
01:02:16,443 --> 01:02:21,519
It's over. After this performance
I stand on the street.

563
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:46,250
Remove the canvas but on the comedy
which is a great tragedy.

564
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,592
I pray for you

565
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:02,395
have you ever
read a piece of Shakespeare

566
01:03:02,609 --> 01:03:06,856
and there is nothing to understand?

567
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:10,820
but after tonight
you everything is clear

568
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:16,158
as Shakespeare may be dead,
We are here

569
01:03:18,874 --> 01:03:24,116
William Shakespeare wrote a lot,
very long time ago

570
01:03:24,337 --> 01:03:29,461
on the beautiful Hermia
and the two boys who adored her

571
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:32,379
They said Hermia, marry me

572
01:03:32,594 --> 01:03:35,381
but she wanted only one

573
01:03:35,597 --> 01:03:40,970
the fairies come at night
out and the ball tonight

574
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:43,937
because I love him
- And I love her

575
01:03:44,146 --> 01:03:46,719
he could handle him

576
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:51,353
and therefore
devised the elves a list

577
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:54,440
in this Midsummer Dream

578
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:18,591
See, here comes Helena.
- The beautiful Helen.

579
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:22,716
You call me beautiful?
Recall that clean anyway.

580
01:04:22,931 --> 01:04:25,303
What Kelly looks beautiful.

581
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:29,810
Demetrius and Lysander
love you, Hermia.

582
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,262
Oh, happy clean.

583
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:48,922
Word, Hermia, softened.

584
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:54,257
Lysander, give to my right
your feeble claim.

585
01:05:54,471 --> 01:06:00,508
You have her father's favor Demetrius.
Marry him and leave me Hermia.

586
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:02,635
You married him?

587
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:07,022
Bastard.
- Asshole.

588
01:06:07,232 --> 01:06:11,229
You really feel the tension.
- Tell me about it.

589
01:06:13,237 --> 01:06:15,693
Why do not you like me?

590
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:25,110
there is a girl
that says she loves me not

591
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:29,198
that's the girl I go for

592
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:33,996
Look, she has everything
what a girl should have

593
01:06:34,214 --> 01:06:39,718
and therefore I do not understand
why they do not love me

594
01:06:39,928 --> 01:06:44,340
Hermia, I make sure
you are in love with me

595
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:48,969
Hermia, I make sure
you going to give me

596
01:06:49,186 --> 01:06:53,266
never
one girl was so much me

597
01:06:53,482 --> 01:06:57,349
I beg you, Hermia

598
01:06:57,569 --> 01:07:00,403
Please love me

599
01:07:00,613 --> 01:07:02,237
Bitch. -Flicker.

600
01:07:04,616 --> 01:07:06,241
Asshole.

601
01:07:20,589 --> 01:07:24,254
In your eyes
This powerful juice flows down ...

602
01:07:24,468 --> 01:07:26,294
and if you wake up ...

603
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:31,849
then again tastes you salvation, top level
if you see your former sweetheart.

604
01:07:37,145 --> 01:07:39,932
About 20 minutes are you on canvas.

605
01:07:40,148 --> 01:07:45,390
I want to talk to you.
Just walk with me?

606
01:07:55,412 --> 01:07:57,618
I could eat a drink.

607
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:02,825
Keisha, you are not suitable
for. She wants a blow up doll.

608
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:07,171
I sometimes call them for advice.
- Really?

609
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:10,465
Yes, I had pimples on my balls.

610
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:14,460
Not anymore, though.

611
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:18,305
Gentlemen, would you do me a favor?

612
01:08:18,516 --> 01:08:23,675
In the fourth act, first scene,
is a special effect.

613
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:28,889
That huge flash, you mean?
- Right. Does this thing make?

614
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:32,311
No, a whole village
destroy.

615
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:41,943
I wonder if you do not
could ignite a bit earlier.

616
01:08:42,162 --> 01:08:44,534
Mr. Dan is. Landers still there?

617
01:08:44,747 --> 01:08:49,160
We let 'm just scared.
I give you a sign.

618
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:55,756
Sorry I did not believe what you said about Striker.

619
01:08:55,966 --> 01:09:00,378
Too bad you this way
had to come back.

620
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:04,758
I have no right
to ask you something ...

621
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,809
but if I could make a wish ...

622
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:13,890
I wish
that everything was as before.

623
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:16,514
We are friends again.

624
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:23,272
As for the rest of ...

625
01:09:30,038 --> 01:09:32,445
that would be handed over to fate.

626
01:09:39,755 --> 01:09:44,712
Did I mention that you are
$ 47 could earn them?

627
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:46,669
Not bad.

628
01:09:48,304 --> 01:09:52,597
Mr. Scrumfeld, we agree.

629
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:57,516
Remember it well, gentlemen.
If I throw up my sword ...

630
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:08,817
The music was good, but you know
that song Pocket full of dreams?

631
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:14,819
We call it Pocket full of ass.
- That's it. The number is adjusted.

632
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,571
This is different.

633
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:32,549
A spell is pronounced.
The lovers sleep.

634
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:38,763
While she rests, grows the love of
Demetrius for the beautiful Helen.

635
01:10:43,186 --> 01:10:49,900
Oh, long slow night
accelerate ahead.

636
01:10:50,109 --> 01:10:53,560
Come, comfort me a while,
I forget myself.

637
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:03,365
let me sleep

638
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:10,032
because when I sleep,
I dream that you are with me

639
01:11:11,003 --> 01:11:18,582
you are mine,
and all my fears are gone

640
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:23,048
I float in the air

641
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:30,428
the nightingale whistle a beautiful lullaby

642
01:11:30,645 --> 01:11:35,852
So let me close my eyes but

643
01:11:37,943 --> 01:11:42,569
and sleep, and perhaps to dream

644
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:49,779
I see that face again
I want to caress

645
01:11:49,996 --> 01:11:52,284
and cushion

646
01:11:52,498 --> 01:11:57,159
but that happens only
in my dreams

647
01:11:57,377 --> 01:12:05,669
So let the moonlight shine
the boy

648
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:09,752
to whom I wish

649
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:14,883
and when he dreams

650
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:19,395
perhaps he dreams of me

651
01:12:27,112 --> 01:12:32,023
I look at the clouds

652
01:12:32,242 --> 01:12:36,571
and I whisper
against the twinkling stars

653
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:43,454
they tell me that love
just a dream away

654
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:47,536
just a dream away

655
01:12:47,756 --> 01:12:50,673
So I keep dreaming

656
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:09,026
Now, let the hunters them
with horns wake.

657
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:18,535
Say I confused, sir?
It is my dream as I have.

658
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:22,039
I came with Hermia into the forest ...

659
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:26,336
to a place where the Athenian Law
We no longer threatening.

660
01:14:28,762 --> 01:14:30,221
However ...

661
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,265
What?
- But?

662
01:14:38,438 --> 01:14:45,353
Lord, we are endlessly
sleep, as you surely know.

663
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:50,729
Things change,
and love blossomed.

664
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:58,910
The soul will always Hermia
associated with mine ...

665
01:14:59,123 --> 01:15:03,072
but unfortunately we
goodbye forever.

666
01:15:03,293 --> 01:15:07,919
Because my heart
belongs to another.

667
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,732
Ho nou a minute.
It was not easy.

668
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:39,401
You can not just text
change. It should not be reconciled.

669
01:15:41,911 --> 01:15:44,034
Well, I can do that.

670
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:50,082
Sometimes it along, sometimes it is against.
What do you say that?

671
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:55,247
Stop cheering.

672
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,090
Stop cheering.

673
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:02,011
Do it now.

674
01:16:32,623 --> 01:16:34,247
What do I do?

675
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,661
Applause.

676
01:17:10,281 --> 01:17:13,899
Are you crying?
- No, you press on my wound.

677
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:25,451
Do write it this way.

678
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,170
You took aim at my chair, right?

679
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:31,837
Admit it.
- A little.

680
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:35,715
You see, stouterd.
Great.

681
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:42,809
Moment.
I'll be back, I promise.

682
01:17:44,395 --> 01:17:48,938
You're so in love with my sister, huh?

683
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:54,854
You're not bandy?
- No, but I'm not happy.

684
01:17:55,071 --> 01:18:00,610
But if they do get a boyfriend
will, I'm glad it's you.

685
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:09,832
Well done. It was really laughing.

686
01:18:10,043 --> 01:18:13,826
I must really go.
- Do you have something with Dora Lynn?

687
01:18:15,339 --> 01:18:19,419
Are not you afraid that ...
- An accident?

688
01:18:19,635 --> 01:18:24,296
No, Dora Lynn
has now finally happiness.

689
01:18:24,514 --> 01:18:29,852
Bye, guys.
Let's go get Chinese.

690
01:18:33,105 --> 01:18:35,596
That's okay. Nothing wrong.

691
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:40,027
He flew at least 6 meter
off of the stage.

692
01:18:40,236 --> 01:18:46,108
And when they rose
as a beautiful rocket.

693
01:18:52,414 --> 01:18:57,834
What it looks burnt.
- Tomorrow we'll do it again.

694
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:04,833
What did you think of my stage debut?

695
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:10,257
Especially in the end it was nice.
- Yeah, I was good, huh?

696
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:15,098
Tomorrow we play again.
- How is it off?

697
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,344
We can gum song
sing again.

698
01:19:20,564 --> 01:19:26,399
I'd rather get shot.
- I thought the bow was not real.
