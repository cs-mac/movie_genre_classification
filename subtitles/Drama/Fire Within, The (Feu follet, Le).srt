<i>Subtitles brought to you by The GoF Team @ Viki</i>

00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,740
This program was funded by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Creative Contents Agency

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,440
<i>Episode 22</i>

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,240
I will forfeit this competition.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,950
But in return, release Gae Dong.

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,930
Are you bring serious?

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,220
Because of Gae Dong, you're going to give up the chance to become a ceramist?

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,700
He is a friend who helped me in troubled times.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,950
I can't just ignore it.

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,900
Didn't you say you wanted to become a ceramist?

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,230
So why do you give up so easily?

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,530
I will if I can save Gae Dong.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,280
Your will was only this much?

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm disappointed in you.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,040
Take it.

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,990
Excuse me?

17
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,740
Do you think it was easy for me to rise
 to the seat of Royal Ceramist?

18
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,140
I also went through a hard situation.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,890
I will prove that all my efforts during all 
this time wasn't for nothing.

20
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,580
Hurry, take it and go.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,190
I'll release Gae Dong, but

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,970
you will be punished for taking the porcelains lightly.

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,770
Thank you.

24
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,310
Leave.

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,440
It's the same. It's exactly like the one that broke.

26
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,930
It's just the right size, too.

27
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,720
You said it would be difficult, 
but I guess you were just being fussy.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm honored, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,050
Why is this on the lid?

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,820
Because of this extra piece,
 it doesn't go in well.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,620
Please put in the protruding area first.

32
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,080
It's there to prevent the lid from
 falling off and breaking.

33
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,740
It's amazing.

34
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,020
How did you think of this?

35
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,230
You also thought of a unique idea
 for In Bin's flower vase.

36
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,290
You don't disappoint me.

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,900
Isn't it so, In Bin?

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,380
However,

40
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,310
I open and close this jar very frequently.

41
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,440
I can't help but liking the one I'm used to.

42
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,490
The details and the drawings are also 
better with Royal Ceramist Lee's.

43
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,980
Thank you, Royal Ceramist.

44
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,150
What do you mean?

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,930
Thanks to you, I learned something.

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,010
What did you learn?

47
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,490
I saw with my own eyes that

48
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,230
royal porcelains must have dignity and 
elegance that befit the royal porcelains.

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,190
From what I saw, too,

50
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,180
your lid suited the jar better than my lid.

51
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,520
Your royal face looks bright, 
which I haven't seen in a while.

52
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,720
The writings, drawings and porcelains are

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,230
what soothe my troubles, aren't they?

54
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,680
Your Highness's happy face,

55
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,260
I wish the ministers could see it.

56
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,570
That's what I'm saying.

57
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,760
They always tell me, "No, you can't!",
 "Keep your dignity!"

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,380
But what's such a big deal about me 
meeting a ceramist personally?

59
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,490
Can I, who's also buried in work,
 not enjoy even this much?

60
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,110
You're so right, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,540
So,

62
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,910
did I tell you to focus on basics or not?

63
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,110
You were being so greedy.

64
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,940
I'm saying I would've lost even if I did.

65
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,890
I also acknowledge the Royal Ceramist's skill.

66
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,810
I thought you would shrink up and starve yourself for 
at least three days, but why are you so alright?

67
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,850
There's no time for that.

68
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,610
I have to practice the wheel spinning,
 and work on drawings.

69
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm already busy with those thoughts.

70
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,480
Alright, let's do it. Sit down.

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,030
OK.

72
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,840
Relax.

73
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,010
Imagine you don't have these.

74
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,190
Just those...

75
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,100
While I was in 3 year mourning for my mother's death,

76
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,480
Prince Gwang Hae sent those letters to me.

77
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,850
Wow...

78
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,650
You are very close to him.

79
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,420
All those writings worry about the nation, 
coming from the loyal heart.

80
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,330
You all know Prince Gwang Hae's character.

81
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,920
I, too, don't disagree with the fact that 
Prince Gwang Hae is the one fit for the crown prince,

82
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,030
but I believe the timing is what matters.

83
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,410
We must step up so that His Majesty
 can decide His Royal heart.

84
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,100
I believe that's our duty as his subjects.

85
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,210
However, His Majesty's anger hasn't subsided yet...

86
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,480
Let's push for it once more.

87
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,640
I will speak up this time.

88
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,830
No.

89
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,730
This time, I will do it.

90
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,330
How tired are you with all the work?

91
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,110
This is my treat for all of you,

92
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,470
so please enjoy yourselves.

93
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

94
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,820
We only have one goal.

95
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,450
To do our best serving His Majesty.

96
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,190
So that they won't mention the crown prince 
anymore while His Majesty's still well and healthy,

97
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,390
let's do our best to lead our government.

98
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,430
Yes, you're so right.

99
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,630
We get drunk when we drink, 
and the water flows from top to bottom.

100
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,120
And His Majesty's throne is succeeded by the eldest son.

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,510
That is the natural order of things, right?

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,070
Pushing forward the discussion of installing
 the crown prince even though His Majesty hates it,

103
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,860
is treason. Treason.

104
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,720
Great Scholar and his followers' moves are suspicious,
 so you must stay alert.

105
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,090
The communication envoys have returned, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,400
According to Official Kim Seong Il,

107
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,750
there's no danger of them attacking us.

108
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,720
They wrote that

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Toyotomi Hideyoshi is not one to be afraid of.

110
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,210
Official Hwang Yoon Gil thinks differently.

111
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,620
He recommended that, since a
 Japanese attack is imminent, be ready for it.

112
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,890
Hideyoshi is known to be clever and bold.

113
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,650
Hwang Yoon Gil is a timid person.

114
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,640
When he went to Japan this time, too, 
he was scared and subservient,

115
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,430
which undermined Joseon's dignity.

116
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,940
That's why we sent Kim Seong Il along with him.

117
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,940
It's hard to find a scholar who's

118
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,180
as upright and high-spirited as Kim Seong Il.

119
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,600
Hwang Yoon Gil saw it right this time.

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,560
Japan will invade us!

121
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,830
Hwang Yeong Gil's claim doesn't even make sense!

122
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,100
How can those who were living stuck on an island

123
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,580
attack a big country across the sea?

124
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,470
Hideyoshi's response clearly states that

125
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,950
he would conquest Ming through Joseon.

126
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,250
This means he clearly stated he will attack Joseon, 
proclaiming a war against us.

127
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,860
Why do you mention the danger of war

128
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,510
whenever you open your mouth?

129
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,560
At a time when we need to soothe
 the people's hearts,

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,770
get ready for war?
 It's something that shouldn't happen!

131
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,600
You are blindly insisting Kim Seong Il is right

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,020
only because he's a part of your faction.

133
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,320
If the war breaks and this country is in chaos,

134
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,060
are the East People going to take responsibility?

135
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,720
How could you say such ridiculous
 things in front of His Majesty!

136
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,300
Rather, you're trying to defend Hwang Yeong Gil

137
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,620
because he's in your faction.

138
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,090
Enough, enough!

139
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,220
The war doesn't happen so easily.

140
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,810
Our Joseon, since its foundation,

141
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,570
has been doing well without a war.

142
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,570
I will ask this to Great Scholar.

143
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,200
I heard the Confusion classics that were managed 
by your office were damaged. Is that true?

145
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,890
I'm deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

146
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,940
Before worrying about a war,

147
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,150
you should've done your job first!

148
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,560
To punish you for neglecting the management 
of the Confusion classics,

149
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,410
I will dismiss you from the position of 
Great Scholar of your office!

150
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,350
Your Majesty!

151
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,280
The books getting damaged has always 
happened over the long hot and humid weather.

152
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,880
What do you mean, to dismiss him over this?

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,790
No.

154
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,480
Dismissal is not enough. 
I will exile him to Gyeong Heung!

155
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,340
Drag him out immediately!

156
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,010
Your Majesty!

157
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,590
His Majesty said

158
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,340
this is no use and to leave now, Your Highness.

159
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
He exiled Great Scholar to Gyeong Heung?

160
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,300
His Majesty must have been decisive.

161
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,000
Not only him,

162
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,910
but his supporters are to be
 exiled as well, I heard.

163
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,460
You have to whip the horse when it's running.

164
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,010
This is only the beginning.

165
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,840
All of this is happening according to your plan.

166
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,900
Do you think my target was him?

167
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,200
My target has been Gwang Hae.

168
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,500
I made my decision you already. 
Why do you still want to see me?

169
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,900
Your Majesty, cancel the exile, please.

170
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
He's a loyal subjects who only 
serves Your Majesty, sir.

171
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,400
Withdraw the order of exile? Then, I'll have
 to order him to die by poison.

172
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,600
Once they're dead, then you 
won't bother me anymore.

173
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,000
Honored Father.

174
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,200
You still don't understand what I'm saying?

175
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
What should I do to make you no longer angry?

176
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,600
Angry?

177
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,600
You think I'm a clumsy king ruling this 
country, based on my emotions?

178
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,200
I gave my trust to Great Scholar 
as he's deeply academic,

179
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,800
but even threatened my sovereignty, 
not knowing his place.

180
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,300
Threatened? That's absurd!

181
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,100
Did you goad him?

182
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
No!

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
What did you promise him?

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
It's all because of you.

185
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,000
Because of you, I lost my respected teacher.

186
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,800
Because of you, he's being exiled.

187
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Didn't I tell you not to do anything?

188
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,500
Look at me.

189
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,400
Whether Honored Father is 
picking on you or advising you,

190
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,300
he's doing nothing, isn't he?

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,900
When it's raining hard, 
the best way is to avoid it.

192
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,600
Hyungnim.

193
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,100
For today, just leave me alone, please.

194
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Don't even do that.

195
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200
If you keep brandishing your sword like that here,

196
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,400
you may be charged with plotting treason.

197
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Why are you looking for the letter
 Gwang Hae gave me?

198
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,800
His Majesty is misunderstanding that the 
relationship between you and him is bad.

199
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Bad relationship?

200
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I'm encouraged from reading his letter.

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, I know.

202
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,700
That's why I'm trying to tell him (the King) the truth.

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
His Majesty would be happy reading this.

204
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,800
Then, I will take my leave.

205
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,300
I heard you have someone 
extremely good at forging handwriting.

206
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,300
Find him.

207
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,900
Are you trying to forge his letter sent to Great Scholar?

208
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,200
Just one clause - 'Help me with your authority'.

209
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
It'll be enough to charge him with treason.

210
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,300
<i>I heard you can forge anyone's handwriting.</i>

211
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,900
<i>You must take this to your grave.</i>

212
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,600
From Bunwon, an order was issued not to
 bring any white clay of Bangsan for while.

213
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,700
Did you hear anything?

214
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,800
No, ma'am.

215
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
Should I go there to find out?

216
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,800
No.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,300
Why ?

218
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,700
You think I would be seeing Bunwon Chief?

219
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,800
If you really want, you'd be seeing him anyway.

220
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,900
I don't know what you might think, so...

221
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,100
I find difficulty on knowing what to do.

222
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,800
If you're not hiding anything, 
 you shouldn't have any difficulty.

223
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,200
Anyway, things are strange.

224
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,000
Even until 2 days ago, they've been
 clamoring for the white soil.

225
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Their terrain is tough, they've always relied on us.

226
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Did you call me, sir?

227
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
Yes.

228
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,800
Since we have a problem with getting in the Bangsan white clay, I need you to go dig it up and bring it here.

229
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Can you do it?

230
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,600
Pardon?

231
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,500
I thought you had good knowledge 
about soil and clay.

232
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I've done it before, but...

233
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,300
Then, that's great.

234
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,700
They're your helpers.

235
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,900
Your help will be appreciated.

236
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,600
Be careful on your long journey.

237
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,900
Your job is just finding the white soil.

238
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Manual labor will be their job.

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, sir.

240
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh dear.

241
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,100
What has happened to me.

242
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,800
Master, I'll get some medicine for you.

243
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Well, never mind.

244
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,500
Why should you be doing it?
 Let Tae Do do it.

245
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,500
For you, you should be on my side, always.

246
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,500
I haven't been troubling you and
 that's why you're not getting better.

247
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,400
You didn't do anything bad.

248
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,000
When you came to me, after your dad died,

249
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,400
I was very glad.

250
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,300
It was as if I came to have child of my own.

251
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,000
It was a revitalizing moment.

252
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,500
Since you've been here with me,

253
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,700
it was as if I've been living a really good life.

254
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,900
I'll go to tell him to get some medicine for you.

255
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,100
Why don't you rest and relax, Master.

256
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,100
Ok, ok.

257
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,800
Okay, my dear.

258
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,500
Where are you going?

259
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,800
Chief told me to get some white soil from Bangsan.

260
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,500
For you? Even to Bangsan, that far?

261
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,700
I'm leaving with them.

262
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,900
Even so. You're woman...

263
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,800
I don't mind on that, but...

264
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,400
My master is sick.

265
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,700
Ok. I'll provide breakfast and dinner for him.

266
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,900
Please take good care of him.

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,700
Then, I'll be going.

268
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
Hey!

269
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Going somewhere?

270
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
Errand for Chief. Getting white soil from Bangsan.

271
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,800
No, the swordman Hyung-nim told us
 not to get our eyes off of you.

272
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you really have to go?

273
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,200
If I don't go, then, what?

274
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,300
Since my master may worry, don't tell him.

275
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,900
But, do tell Tae Do, my brother, please.

276
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
Hey, I'll accompany you.

277
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,600
You don't even have permission to do so.

278
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,900
You've even saved my life.

279
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Permission? Well...

280
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,900
If they want to fire me, then, let it be!

281
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,300
Let's go.

282
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,200
Is it all right?

283
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,400
Prince Gwang Hae.

284
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,400
Your face is full of worry.

285
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,800
What's happened to your personal guard? 
Why are you always alone?

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,900
Being alone is more comfortable here.

287
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,600
Guard Kim Tae Do . . .

288
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
Isn't he busy protecting the Bunwon errand worker?

289
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,700
Was that Yoo Jung?

290
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,500
Your first love, sir.

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,700
On a day like today, why don't you go see her?

292
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,000
Who would be better consolation than 
the object of your first love?

293
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,700
Where the hell have you been?

294
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,500
I've been waiting for you to tell you something.

295
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,700
Gae Ddong, who does he think he is 
to say he would help Jung?

296
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,770
- Hey, hey, guys! 
- Hey!

297
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,240
Where is Jung?

298
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,960
Why are you coming back alone?

299
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,240
I... I lost the track. 
What should I do now?

300
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,820
How come?!!

301
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,750
Well, I went to the toilet just for a moment.

302
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,690
What should I do now?

303
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,440
BECAUSE OF YOU, 
WE'RE ALL DEAD NOW (by Tae Do)!

304
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Hey, guys!

305
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,320
Your Highness!

306
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,870
We have something to tell you.

307
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,180
Tell me, then.

308
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,680
Tae Pyeong... no,

309
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,250
Jung went somewhere.

310
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,960
What does that mean?

311
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,890
Chief Lee sent Jung away 
 to get some white clay.

312
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,800
Chief Lee did?

313
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,960
Did she go by herself?

314
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
She went with two other senior menial workers 
who are not even friendly to her.

315
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,620
We couldn't get in touch with that warrior bro either, 
so we are very worried.

316
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,690
I was trying to follow her, 
but lost the track.

317
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,620
Where did you send Jung to?

318
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,790
What's the matter, Your Highness?

319
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,170
To where did you send her away 
to get white clay?

320
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,530
<i>It's time to use that girl.</i>

321
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,170
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>

322
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,400
<i>I mean that girl named Yoo Jung.</i>

323
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,770
<i>No matter what excuses you make, 
send her somewhere far from Bunwon.</i>

324
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,000
<i>Why do you want that?</i>

325
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,710
<i>Prince Gwang Hae and Jung...</i>

326
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,770
<i>I just want to follow my intuition, that's all. </i>

327
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,530
That girl, Yoo Jung, said she's confident 
at getting good white clay,

328
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,710
so I had no other choice but to send her there.

329
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,690
So, where is it exactly?

330
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,290
She went to get Bangsan's white clay, 
so I only know

331
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,460
that it would be around there.

332
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,840
She went there again?

333
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,240
Huh? Where is Jung?

334
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,580
She said she would go get white clay 
as per Chief Lee's order.

335
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,270
What? Chief Lee sent her?!

336
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Darn it... Darn it...

337
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,570
Oh, Elder, where are you going this late at night?

338
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,930
My Jung... where did Jung go?

339
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm asking where she was sent to get white clay?

340
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,530
I heard she was sent to somewhere far from here!

341
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,310
By Lee Kang Cheon!

342
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,730
What? Why would he send Jung?

343
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,420
There is... something going on.

344
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,810
This bastard... This bastard!

345
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,910
Gae Ddong!

346
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,530
Yes, Elder.

347
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,710
You guys, have you seen my Jung?

348
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,430
We are also worrying about her now.

349
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,450
Then... her brother...

350
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,340
Did she go with her brother?

351
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,810
Aigo... What's wrong with all these guys 
who said they would protect Jung...?

352
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,330
Hwa Ryeong.

353
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,420
Have you heard anything from Kenzo?

354
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,610
No, I haven't heard any.

355
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,650
Really?

356
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,000
That's strange, then. 
He was satisfied with the deal for sure.

357
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,210
Why hasn't there been any news afterward?

358
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,930
There would be soon, I suppose.

359
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,040
Recently, there haven't been many ceramics 
coming from Bunwon either...

360
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,710
I'm not sure about Kenzo, but for Bunwon, 
maybe it's because of Elder Moon Sa Seung.

361
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:40,110
Since Elder Moon Sa Seung is in Bunwon, 
I guess it's difficult for Chief Lee to make a move.

362
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,830
This is quite strange.

363
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,070
What is?

364
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,150
In this kind of situation, 
you used to be more anxious than I was,

365
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,380
but now you're very relaxed.

366
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,300
Your answer also has no hesitation, 
as if it's already prepared in advance.

367
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,920
All those points are what I've learned 
from you, Madam.

368
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,830
I have been working in this company 
for many years, you know.

369
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,070
Now I can see the flow of process quite well.

370
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,830
I also started to be able to see 
when it's good to buy and to sell.

371
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,240
After hearing your words, 
I feel even more uneasy.

372
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,610
So far, my company has been increased 
by our loyalty and trust.

373
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,280
I could achieve this much with a good reputation 
despite being a woman,

374
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,740
because of my good products 
and loyalty (to my customers/suppliers).

375
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,170
However, frankly speaking,

376
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,650
I can't figure out what's in your mind.

377
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,070
I'm just trying to do my work well 
without any mistake

378
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,390
so that I can be recognized by you, Madam.

379
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,550
You'd better not include any lie in that, then.

380
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,120
I have favored especially you 
among all other workers in this company,

381
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,910
because you're a woman 
just like me.

382
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,730
Yes, I know that well.

383
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,830
As well as that you wouldn't let me 
set even a foot in this industry

384
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,420
if I fall out of your favor, Madam.

385
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,630
That wouldn't be enough (if that happens).

386
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,580
If anyone back-stabs me,

387
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,710
and if that's you of all,

388
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,150
I might even get rid of you without a trace.

389
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,940
Such a thing won't be necessary.

390
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,880
If one has big trust in another, its sense of betrayal
 (from the broken trust) is as big as the trust.

391
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
You always said so.

392
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,990
If you keep following me with your trust, 
you will become my successor.

393
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,790
But if you betray me,

394
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,500
then there is nothing but death to you.

395
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,550
Keep that in your mind again.

396
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,420
Yes, Madam.

397
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,510
Finally, this is the first deal 
between you and me.

398
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,070
Are all ceramic pieces from Bunwon 
flashy like this one?

399
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,720
In three days, I will siphon off ceramic pieces 
from Bunwon's storage room.

400
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,790
By then, we will have other kinds of ceramics.

401
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,010
I will look forward to those pieces.

402
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm curious about one thing.

403
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,730
How did you leave Madam Sohn 
out of this deal?

404
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,340
Leave out?

405
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,360
I wouldn't dare to do that to Madam Sohn.

406
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,870
I just want to make the company grow bigger.

407
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,670
So that you can swallow it whole 
once you've made it big?

408
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,490
You're too funny, Chief Lee.

409
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,600
How can I swallow up the company as a weak woman?

410
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,480
I'm just learning the trade and building the experience.

411
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,350
As the Bunwon Chief, I need a
 reliable place to do business with.

412
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,930
Even after I resign from the Chief position,

413
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,870
it will be the same since Royal Ceramist Lee
 would have become the Chief.

414
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,760
But you're as good as Sohn Haengsoo.

415
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,640
Was my Yook Do a bait?

416
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,090
Sir Chief. That's too much.

417
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,650
I sincerely respect Royal Ceramist Lee.

418
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,750
I don't know what you're trying to do,

419
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,490
but Sohn Haengsoo is not someone to take lightly.

420
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,890
It's not too late to tell her the truth,

421
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,610
and give her the whole remaining profit, or...

422
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,320
Or...?

423
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,700
Or have Sohn Haengsoo

424
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,600
definitely subdued.

425
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,440
If I happen to want to do that in the future,

426
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,520
how I'll be able to definitely subdue her,

427
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,650
please just tell me the method.

428
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,890
Your Majesty.

429
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,840
I met with some ministers,

430
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,270
and became sure that Prince Gwang Hae

431
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,540
goaded the Chief Scholar.

432
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,970
What do you mean, goaded him?

433
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,200
In the house of Great Scholar,

434
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,860
there was a gathering among ministers.

435
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:40,970
At that time, they say the Chief Scholar showed 
them a letter which Prince Gwang Hae wrote.

436
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,540
However, the content is...

437
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,470
What was the content?

438
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,320
I'm deeply sorry to say this,

439
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,880
but it was all about discussing the national matters.

440
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,390
I would... this Gwang Hae...

441
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,530
Is there anybody outside!

442
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

443
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,200
Go to the Chief Scholar's house immediately 
and find Gwang Hae's letter!

444
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,820
Search!

445
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes!

446
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Teacher.

447
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,360
I saw a poor person who said

448
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,310
tributes are scarier than drought or the rainy season.

449
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:47,820
Teacher... I caught a Japanese spy, and that man

450
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,650
had a Joseon's military map.

451
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,820
In the three southern provinces, 
there's severe famine, so...

452
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,820
How dare he!

453
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,670
Teacher,

454
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,090
please be my strength.

455
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,270
Gwang Hae.. this scoundrel!

456
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,060
Your Majesty. Prince Im Hae is here.

457
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,400
Honored Father! Gwang Hae has disappeared!

458
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,980
Where in the world did he disappear to?

459
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,740
Your Majesty. This is a lady's instinct,

460
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,460
but I heard that a female errand worker 
whom Gwang Hae treasured

461
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,820
has also disappeared from Bunwon.

462
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,210
What?

463
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,190
Disappeared with a woman?

464
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,440
How pathetic is he!

465
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,530
Is the head guard outside?!!

466
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,320
What a relief that I hated language study?

467
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,400
If I liked reading and writing like 
 Gwang Haeand wrote a letter...

468
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,570
What a relief that every conversation I had 
with the Chief Scholar was verbal.

469
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,620
What are you doing not going out there catching him?

470
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,820
Pardon?

471
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,040
I should boast my achievement by catching him
 faster than Honored Father's guards.

472
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,400
Gather some fast men and depart soon.

473
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,330
Your Highness!

474
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,510
Are you the assistants that came with Jung Yi?

475
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,980
Yes!

476
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,770
How come only you guys are here? 
How about Jung Yi? Where is she?

477
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,380
She heard there's a very capable doctor in this village,

478
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,620
so she said she's going to get her teacher's medicine.

479
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,030
Hya!

480
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,870
Was there a lady who came to get 
a medicine effective for cough?

481
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,160
Yes, she said it's for her teacher, 
so be especially careful.

482
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,670
Yes, I'm talking about that lady. Did she leave?

483
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,710
She said she needed to dig up the white clay quickly, 
so she would return to get the medicine later.

484
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,240
Alright.

485
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,670
Jung!

486
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,010
Jung! Where are you?

487
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:50,360
Jung! Jung! Jung!

488
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,910
Jung!

489
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,430
Jung!

490
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,380
Your Highness. It's after the rain, 
so the ground's slippery

491
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,580
and due to the mud slide, 
night search would be dangerous.

492
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,410
It will get dark soon, so as soon as the day breaks,

493
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,890
how about we search then?

494
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,710
In such a dangerous place, the lady is all by herself.

495
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,880
Then, I will send out the office guards,

496
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,930
so please wait here, Your Highness.

497
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,700
I will search the woods until I find her!

498
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,570
Your Highness!

499
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,280
Hold on.

500
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,850
Do you think I wouldn't be able to 
find you if you're disguised?

501
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,940
There's an answer I need to hear from you.

502
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,450
Orabeoni!

503
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,610
Orabeoni. This trade is important to me.

504
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,410
I'm doing this trade with my life on the line.

505
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,580
Please, just one, ignore this.

506
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,740
I don't care about such a thing, so just leave.

507
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,840
All I need is this man.

508
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,020
Depart please.

509
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,190
Who ordered it?

510
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,420
On whose order did you kill Eul Dam ahjussi!

511
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,800
Orabeoni!

512
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,020
Stop it!

513
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,630
Step aside.

514
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,630
I have something to take care of with this man.

515
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,800
Didn't he tell you to follow my order 
until the delivery ends?

516
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,580
If you're not going to kill me,
 withdraw your sword immediately!

517
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,620
Sir Ghenjo is waiting,

518
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,740
so transport the items to the harbor now!

519
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,660
Let's go!

520
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,730
Orabeoni! Orabeoni!

521
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,960
Orabeoni!

522
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,690
Hwa Ryeong, I must catch that guy.

523
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,050
Orabeoni! Orabeoni!

524
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,520
Orabeoni!

525
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,160
Jung! Where are you?

526
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,030
Jung!

527
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,270
Where are you?!

528
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,750



529
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,580
Here!

530
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,400
It's here!

531
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
Here!

532
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,090
Jung!

533
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,360
Your Highness! Your Highness!

534
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,910
Your Highness!
- Jung!

535
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,530
Your Highness!

536
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,440
Jung!

537
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,620
Jung! Are you alright?

538
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,330
Your Highness.

539
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,090
Can you move?

540
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,670
Wait there.

541
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,570
Please be careful. It's slippery.

542
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,750
<i>Your Highness! Are you alright?</i>

543
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,570
Are you okay?

544
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,320
How stupid are you? Only for mere white clay!

545
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,340
I'm sorry.

546
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,840
Your Highness!

547
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,580
Move aside!

548
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,860
Move aside!

549
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,020
Why is he not waking up?

550
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,840
He bled too much.

551
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,210
We'll watch the progress.

552
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,610
Please be careful on your way back.

553
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,020
Orabeoni.

554
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,720
Hwa Ryeong.

555
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,480
Yes, Orabeoni.

556
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,290
I have to find that man.

557
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,840
You can't get up. You have to stay down.

558
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,960
Your Highness. Thank you.

559
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,470
Thanks to Your Highness, I'm still alive.

560
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,480
There is someone I hold dear as my teacher forever.

561
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,700
The porcelain I made with you. I made it for him.

562
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,340
However, I couldn't save him.

563
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,560
I'm supposed to care for all people,
 but I can't even save the one teacher.

564
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,580
That pathetic being, that's me.

565
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,570
However, you say that you survived thanks 
to such me, so I'm the one who's grateful.

566
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,630
Your Majesty, Since things have 
already gotten to this point,

567
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,820
why don't you install Prince Gwang Hae 
as the crown prince?

568
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,250
What made you change your mind again?

569
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,940
Both Prince Shin Seong and I...

570
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,330
are spending each day in fear with a heavy heart.

571
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,520
What are you so scared of?

572
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,480
Think about Prince Gwang Hae.

573
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,740
He's been preparing himself to be the crown prince
 by joining hands with Great Scholar.

574
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,290
And, as soon as you're looking for him, 
he hides himself immediately.

575
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:33,090
When he targets us so persistently, 
how can I not be scared?

576
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,090
I, too, was deceived.

577
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,490
I thought he had abandoned his desire
 to become the crown prince.

578
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,570
That's right.

579
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:48,080
If you were to put Prince Shin Seong on the throne,

580
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,760
what if...

581
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,040
you pass away early, what will
 happen to poor Prince Shin Seong?

582
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,820
He will become like Prince Woo San.

583
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,090
Don't worry about such things.

584
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:05,140
If I install Shin Seong as the crown prince,

585
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,020
wouldn't I also prepare plans for such possibility?

586
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,160
Wouldn't I order all ministers

587
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,250
and guards to safeguard him?

588
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,350
What good would that do?

589
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:23,230
Didn't King Sae Jong and Moon Jong also made such requests over and over again?

590
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,060
There were all those ministers and Kim Jong Seo 
who guarded them as well.

591
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,670
Yet, what happened?

592
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,630
I...

593
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:37,100
see King Sae Jo in Prince Gwang Hae.

594
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,660
King Sae Jo?

595
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

596
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,510
Kneeling down in front of Prince Gwang Hae
 for the rest of our lives,

597
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,640
would be our way of surviving...

598
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,270
This is what I'm thinking.

599
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,350
You see Prince Soo Yang

600
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,410
in Gwang Hae...

601
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,990
Did you sprain it?

602
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,020
It hurts less than earlier.

603
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,630
I think I will be able to walk by tomorrow.

604
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,710
Let me take a look at it.

605
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,690
No.

606
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,850
It doesn't hurt at all anymore.

607
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,750
I think it's completely healed.

608
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,690
You must be so tired. Try to sleep.

609
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,100
When you're sitting beside me,

610
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,540
how can I sleep?

611
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,260
You may go now.

612
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,580
How can I go while leaving you're alone
 in a place like this?

613
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,810
Then...

614
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,550
Are you saying you'll stay in this room with me today?

615
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,300
I'm going to watch over you tonight, 
so don't worry and rest.

616
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,650
I'm going outside after seeing you fall asleep.

617
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:04,090
Didn't I tell you I can't fall asleep
 if you're sitting next to me?

618
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,160
Then,

619
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,640
until you fall asleep, let's talk through the night.

620
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,700
Sitting here like this, I feel so comfortable.

621
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,430
If I hadn't been born a prince,
 if I had been born a common person like you,

622
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,030
then, like the simple father we saw at that time,

623
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,160
with the child on his knee,

624
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,230
I could've enjoyed living feeding 
a spoonful of rice in a child's mouth.

625
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:55,600
Not being able to have such a dream is a
 burden which I, who was born a prince, have.

626
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,070
If I, too,

627
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,460
hadn't promised my father that 
I would become a ceramist.

628
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,520
As a simple woman, while baking small bowls,

629
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,700
I would've been living happily with kids.

630
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:21,380
Not being able to do that is a burden which I, 
who wants to become a ceramist, have.

631
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,950
Did you recall what we did that time, 
Sa Bang Chi Gi?

632
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,460
Yes, Your Highness.

633
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,150
The one where you fell that time?

634
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,560
Yes. That one.

635
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:45,560
After working hard at the farm and 
being happy that my child is fed

636
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,490
and sleeping comfortably.

637
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,040
And, playing with my child

638
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,250
in that game of Sa Bang Chi Gi.

639
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:02,110
If I lived as such a ordinary man, 
then my mind would be at ease.

640
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,050
You don't know what you're talking about.

641
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,380
Do you know how hard it is?

642
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,440
You work the whole day under the scorching sun. But during the day,your possessions are taken away by corrupt officials.

643
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,970
And at night, you're robbed by the thieves.

644
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,990
And you have to offer tributes to the country frequently.

645
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,410
It's not easy at all.

646
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:30,840
Why does a prince whom everyone envies
 keep saying such things?

647
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,120
Do you envy me?

648
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,000
Do you know how tough it is being a prince?

649
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,730
You always compete and fight
 even amongst the brothers,

650
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,330
and may even kill one another.

651
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,490
You may not know this.

652
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:57,030
But there are not that many princes
 who died of natural causes.

653
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,370
Can you sleep yet?

654
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,340
No.

655
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,970
I can never fall asleep when you're next to me.

656
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:22,300
<i>Why do I get to say these things 
whenever I see you?</i>

657
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:31,360
<i> ♫ I wonder how much time must pass until I forget? ♫</i>

658
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:38,790
<i> ♫ How many tears must I shed until they stop? ♫</i>

659
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:46,400
<i> ♫ When you call me indifferently, ♫ </i>

660
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,580
<i> ♫ My heart can't even say it's breaking. ♫
Your Highness, wait a minute!</i>

661
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,500

<i>♫ Even If I try to stop myself from always crying. ♫</i>

662
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,120
<i>What would you have done by yourself if I had ran way?
♫ Even If I try to stop myself from always crying. ♫</i>

663
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,680
<i>I'm your life savior, Sir. 
 ♫ Even if I always try to forget those thoughts♫ </i>

664
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,020

 ♫ Even if I always try to forget those thoughts♫

665
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:17,700
<i>♫ Those hidden words which I couldn't say, ♫ </i>

666
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:26,140
<i> ♫ Because I didn't have courage, because I didn't have the heart for it., ♫ </i>

667
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:36,170
<i> ♫ "I love you" still linger on my lips. ♫</i>

668
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:42,030
<i> ♫ Because it hurts as if my breath were taken away, ♫</i>

669
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,820
<i> ♫ Because the wounds remain, ♫</i>

670
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,700
<i>♫ I think that should be enough. ♫</i>

671
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,500
<i>♫ It must end here. ♫</i>

672
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:02,160
<i> ♫ There will be no use to even try to shout. ♫ </i>

673
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:09,650
<i> ♫ I can't try the same thing twice. ♫ </i>

674
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:17,000
<i> ♫ I don't believe. I can't believe. ♫ </i>

675
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,800
<i> ♫ The hidden words I didn't have the heart to say, ♫ </i>

676
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:37,400
<i> ♫ "I love you", still linger on my lips. ♫ </i>

677
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,900
What happened to Gwang Hae 
who I ordered the arrested?

678
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,930
They'll send in a letter soon, Your Majesty!

679
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,620
Are you saying they haven't found him yet?!

680
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,030
Tell them to catch and bring him in immediately! Quickly!

681
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,670
Are you awake?

682
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,070
How much time has passed?

683
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,400
It doesn't matter. You should rest more.

684
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,970
I need to go protect Jung Yi.

685
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,040
Don't worry about Jung Yi.

686
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,940
I went to Bunwon and saw her today, too. 
She's well with Prince Gwang Hae.

687
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,940
Did you really see that with your own eyes?

688
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,650
I told you so.

689
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,020
That's a relief.

690
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,520
That she stays unharmed.

691
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:26,000
You're misunderstanding to think you're
 the one to protect Jung Yi.

692
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,400
The one who protects Jung Yi would be Prince Gwang Hae.

693
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:36,300
Even now, and in the future as well.

694
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,690
Stay seated.

695
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,030
Why do you look so sad?

696
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:58,600
I have to return to Bunwon, but I'm afraid to do so.

697
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,850
Are you really?

698
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:06,000
But you went through all kinds of troubles
 to become a Bunwon ceramist.

699
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:11,130
I guess the scenery here is too wonderful.

700
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,100
I, too, am like you.

701
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,340
I have to return to palace, but I'm afraid to do so.

702
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,220
Why are you like that?

703
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,460
It's the palace where everyone envies.

704
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,660
In palace, I always lived under a mask.

705
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:41,640
There's a mask I had to use in front of Honored Father, 
and a mask I had to use in front of my brother.

706
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,920
A mask I had to use in front of the ministers.

707
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,560
I left the palace often because I hated that suffocation.

708
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,770
I think I know how that feels.

709
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:02,970
Because I was also wearing a mask to hide my feelings

710
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,040
when I was doubting and hating someone in the palace.

711
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,740
You did?

712
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,480
No.

713
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,230
Will you run away with me?

714
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,610
Pardon?

715
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:40,900
Don't you want to live, really caring for each other, 
without the mask?

716
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:46,260
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

717
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,660
It's not sudden.

718
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:55,360
You, Jung, were my first affection,

719
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,930
and until now, you were the only one
 who made my heart beat.

720
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,870
I have to go dig up the white clay.

721
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,880
Did you really not know?

722
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,140
Your Highness.

723
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:30,910
Since sometime, it was only you.

724
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,190
In a tea cup when I was having tea,

725
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,980
in the book I was reading, in the dream I was having,

726
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,490
when my eyes were open and closed,

727
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,900
it was only you.

728
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,250
Even then, are you saying

729
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,030
you really did not know?

730
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,850
But you're Your Highness.

731
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:12,790
You're the Highness.

732
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,490
Will it work if I wasn't the Highness?

733
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,770
If I abandon my prince status,

734
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,490
will that do?

735
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,490
Jung.

736
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Send the personal guard.

737
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:59,550
The prosecution guards whom His Majesty 
sent have already departed.

738
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:02,760
We must find them first.

739
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,910
Pardon?

740
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,760
Find them, and tell them to hide to 
avoid His Majesty's guards.

741
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,560
Your Highness...

742
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,060
As we do that, His Majesty's anger will only grow.

743
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,480
I have to make sure he loses His Majesty's favor this time.

744
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,990
So that he won't be able to return to palace forever.

745
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,320
Send them right away.

746
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,090
We must find Gwang Hae.

747
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,980
Did they arrest Gwang Hae?

748
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,110
They haven't found him yet.

749
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,700
I have to lessen His Majesty's worry 
by finding him as soon as possible.

750
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,400
But why are you acting so slowly?

751
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,580
Prince Gwang Hae is your younger brother.

752
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,120
Uh Huh!

753
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,450
You really want to die, don't you?

754
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,860
I don't have a brother who schemes treason.

755
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,600
What are you doing, not going out to arrest Gwang Hae?

756
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,150
Are you saying you don't know where Hwa Ryeong is?

757
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:07,120
We haven't had a contact with her for the 
last few days, so we were worried as well.

758
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,130
Shouldn't you search for her rather than just worry?

759
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,330
I'm about to send out someone to her house.

760
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,730
I will go there personally.

761
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,820
Since I've met you, I feel the happiest now.

762
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,400
Because you, whom I was only able to see

763
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,030
over Jung Yi's back and over the shade when I was young,

764
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:53,390
I could see you as much as I wanted, all by myself.

765
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,350
Orabeoni. Hold on.

766
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,720
Sir Royal Ceramist!

767
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,730
Sir Royal Ceramist!

768
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,180
What brings you all the way here?

769
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,030
He's someone who's been like a brother 
to me since I was young.

770
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:48,800
He had a big injury, so I cared for him.

771
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,080
Sir Royal Ceramist.

772
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,420
Please say something.

773
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,760
You said he's a patient. Go to him.

774
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,020
Orabeoni!

775
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,010
Orabeoni!

776
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:50,260
Hyung-nim! Are you injured?

777
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,410
It's nothing.

778
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,210
Where's Jung Yi?
- Don't even say!

779
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,730
We were looking all over for you because of her.

780
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,200
She went to get the white clay on Chief Lee's order, 
but she hasn't been seen for the last several days.

781
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,460
Where did she go?

782
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,890
She said she's going to Bangsan,
 but I don't know what happened.

783
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,490
Don't worry too much.

784
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:10,060
Prince Gwang Hae went to find her.

785
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:16,560
What are you doing?

786
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:18,870
Move aside!

787
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:23,990
Your Highness. We have a royal order to
 bring you to the palace as soon as possible.
