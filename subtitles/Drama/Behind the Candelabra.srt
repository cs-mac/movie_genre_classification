00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:03,943
Hi.

3
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:07,512
Hi.

4
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,650
I'm Bob.

5
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:15,353
Scott.

6
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,061
Okay, there you go.
Good boy.

7
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:25,563
Wait, no, don't lick it off.
Don't. That's good.

8
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,265
Okay.
I mean, look.

9
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,100
Look how Cannibal's
doing it, see?

10
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,534
<i>See there?</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

11
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,302
Good boy.

12
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,037
I need them
on set, Scott.

13
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:36,439
Right away.
Okay, you know your lines?

14
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:38,541
You know your lines?

15
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:46,049
Come on.

16
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:52,221
<i>Lou says we can't do the
growl and the attack in one shot.</i>

17
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:53,655
We can do it,

18
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,024
but we need to do it
in two separate pieces.

19
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:57,193
We need to prep the dogs
separately for the attack.

20
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,228
I just don't understand
why we can't get it in one.

21
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,663
Because he's got the bite
suit on under his clothes,

22
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:05,266
so the dogs see him
as a big old chew toy.

23
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:08,402
I mean, it's fun for
them, they love it.

24
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:10,371
It's a safety issue.

25
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:13,441
Scene 37, take one.

26
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,076
Speed!

27
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,511
A and B camera,
common mark.

28
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,148
Brownie!

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,649
Cannibal!

30
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,852
Bullet!

31
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,920
Right here, boys.

32
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,289
- We set?
- Set.

33
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,757
And action!

34
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:53,845
<i>Scottie.
Your mother called.</i>

35
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,383
<i>What did she want?</i>

36
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,718
To see you.

37
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:05,023
- Do I have to?
- No.

38
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,391
Joe.

39
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:11,195
No, of course not,
but... she's your mother.

40
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,798
She says she's doing
much better.

41
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:17,334
- <i>For how long this time?</i>
- Joe, stop.

42
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,236
I'll think about it.

43
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,372
<i>Humph.</i>

44
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:24,941
Oh, and a man named
Bob Black called.

45
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,410
Oh, okay.

46
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:30,246
Is that one of them
San Francisco fellas?

47
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,316
No. He's from here.
West Hollywood.

48
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,119
Oh.

49
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,327
<i>- Hey, cheeks!</i>
- Shh!

50
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,029
This is
where you live?

51
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:49,097
Yeah. Why?

52
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:52,367
You must have moved in after the
Clampetts left for Beverly Hills.

53
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:55,437
Bye, Rose.
I'll see you tomorrow!

54
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:57,371
- Have a good time!
- Okay.

55
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,307
This is Bob.

56
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,709
- Oh, hi, Bob.
- Hi, Rose.

57
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,485
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

58
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,520
<i>the star of the show...</i>

59
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,757
<i>the man who's famous</i>
<i>throughout the world...</i>

60
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>for his candelabra...</i>

61
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,595
<i>and his piano...</i>

62
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,531
<i>Mr. Showmanship...</i>

63
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,567
<i>Liberace!</i>

64
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:52,790
Hey!

65
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,001
Now, this next part of the
boogie woogie is so strange,

66
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:06,103
it really calls
for an explanation.

67
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:09,206
<i>It's called</i>
<i>a boogie woogie break.</i>

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,409
When I'm playing it
and I stop at a certain point...

69
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:15,712
you're going to think
I've forgotten the music.

70
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:17,713
But I didn't forget
the music.

71
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,815
There's just no music
written for that part.

72
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,118
That's why they call it
a break.

73
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:26,389
Hey!

74
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:36,631
Oh, this is fun.

75
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,133
Let's try something.

76
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,568
Suppose only the ladies
in the audience

77
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:42,270
<i>this time, okay?</i>

78
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:44,572
<i>All the girls together.</i>

79
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:49,176
Hey!

80
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:59,153
Oh, that was
terrific.

81
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:03,157
Okay, fellas.
It's your turn now.

82
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,428
Hey!

83
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:18,704
I love it!
That was terrific!

84
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,473
You see, George?
I told you

85
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,675
<i>men do come</i>
<i>to my concerts.</i>

86
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,478
<i>Well, I really appreciate it.</i>

87
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,280
And I know somebody else
out in the audience

88
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:31,616
who appreciates it, too.
And that's my mom.

89
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,785
<i>Mom, I tell you what.</i>

90
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,988
Let them hear it from you...
and I'll play it just for you.

91
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,990
Okay, Mom?

92
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:46,330
Hey!

93
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:57,740
Oh, Mom, you're in
the groove tonight.

94
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,275
I really
thank you all

95
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,578
for joining me
in this boogie woogie.

96
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:04,347
I'd like to try
a little experiment.

97
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,082
I've been playing
this boogie woogie

98
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:08,517
at eight beats
to the bar.

99
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,452
I'd like to try
playing it now

100
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,054
at 16 beats
to the bar.

101
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,173
Wow!

102
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:35,709
He's incredible!

103
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,835
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,471
- Thank you.
<i>- Bravo.</i>

105
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,239
You know...

106
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:10,809
No, that's all right.
Stare as long as you want.

107
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,678
I mean, you paid for it.

108
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:19,217
You know, I always get asked...
"How do you play the piano

109
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,420
with all those rings
on your fingers?"

110
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:26,457
And I always tell them,
"Very well indeed."

111
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,828
Thank you.

112
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,765
And now I'd like
to introduce

113
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,669
another pair
of piano-playing hands

114
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:41,137
to join me in a duet.

115
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,807
My protégé and friend,

116
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,475
<i>Mr. Billy Leatherwood!</i>

117
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,251
<i>Oh, look!</i>

118
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,754
A matched pair of queens.

119
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,358
Oh.

120
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,261
It's funny that this crowd
would like something this gay.

121
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,831
Oh, they have no idea he's gay.

122
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,683
There's Ray.
See him? In the black.

123
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,752
Come on, come on!

124
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,289
Ray! Ray.

125
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:39,091
Bobby!

126
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:42,128
- I'm so glad you made it!
- We loved it. Thank you so much.

127
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:43,895
This is my friend,
Scott Thorson.

128
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,330
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

129
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,633
That was really something.
Thank you.

130
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,868
- Come on back and say hi to Lee.
- You sure?

131
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:51,870
Yes, he'd love
to see you!

132
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,241
Lee?
Look who's here!

133
00:09:56,276 --> 00:10:00,711
- Hello, Bobby!
- Lee, you were fantastic!

134
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:02,413
This is my friend,
Scott Thorson.

135
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,448
His first time
in Las Vegas.

136
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,884
A lost babe
in the woods, huh?

137
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:10,020
<i>It's like a Disney movie.</i>
<i>Little Bambi.</i>

138
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:12,156
Very nice to meet you.

139
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,291
You were incredible
out there.

140
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:17,126
Oh, I'm just
a piano player.

141
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,596
But everybody did seem to enjoy
themselves, didn't they?

142
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,667
You were great,
too, Billy.

143
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,371
Ray, why don't we fix
everybody a drink?

144
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,406
- All right.
- I'm not going to have one.

145
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,741
I still have
another show to do.

146
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:35,076
What... you're going to
do that all over again?

147
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:36,745
I don't know
how you do that.

148
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,880
Oh, aren't you sweet!

149
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:40,783
It's not bad
for an old bag, huh?

150
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,718
<i>Oh, you look fantastic!</i>

151
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,253
<i>And those bits</i>
<i>with the audience are gold!</i>

152
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:46,688
<i>They work every time.</i>

153
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:49,056
<i>I stage this show</i>
<i>once a year.</i>

154
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,759
<i>It works the same way</i>
<i>every single night.</i>

155
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:54,261
I'll tell you, when I was
working saloons in my youth--

156
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,798
back in Milwaukee,
they called them saloons.

157
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:58,899
That's how old I am.

158
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,835
I'm from Wisconsin, too.

159
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,936
No! You are?

160
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,071
Well, this
must be fate.

161
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,741
<i>One night,</i>
<i>this audience asked me</i>

162
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:11,311
to play this popular hit parade
song called "Three Little Fishes".

163
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:12,879
It barely had a melody,

164
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,181
it wasn't a challenge
at all...

165
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,117
but I played it, you know,
and they were happy.

166
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:21,186
And then, I don't know
where it came from...

167
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,389
<i>but I got this inspiration</i>
<i>to play it</i>

168
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:26,459
<i>as if it was composed</i>
<i>by Strauss.</i>

169
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,327
And they loved it!
They ate it up!

170
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:31,897
You would have thought that I invented the piano.

171
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,432
And I knew
right then

172
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,600
it was all about
giving them a good time.

173
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,569
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>I'm all about.</i>

174
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:41,906
I <i>love</i> to give people
a good time.

175
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,742
<i>Bobby, you boys
staying in town tonight?</i>

176
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:46,110
<i>Oh, yes. It's too
late to drive back to L.A.</i>

177
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:49,381
<i>Lee, why don't we have the
boys over for brunch tomorrow?</i>

178
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:51,815
<i>No, that's
too much for you.</i>

179
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,717
No, no.
That's a great idea!

180
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,051
Of course!
Let's do it.

181
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,920
But after 3:00,
okay?

182
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:59,456
'Cause I need
my beauty sleep.

183
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,349
Welcome, gypsies!

184
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,285
Is this a palace?

185
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:33,655
Lee thinks
he's King Ludwig II.

186
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,792
- Who's he?
- The Liberace of Bavaria.

187
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:38,926
Oh, is he
a piano player, too?

188
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,394
No.

189
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,934
Wow.

190
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:49,169
Almost time
for a dip.

191
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,710
I'm sorry
I'm so informal.

192
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:59,946
So happy you all could come.

193
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,281
Don't these things
belong in an oven?

194
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,983
He's so mean
to my babies.

195
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,118
I mean,
this is my family.

196
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,754
And this is Baby Boy.

197
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,422
Baby Boy,

198
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:13,659
he's very old.
He's deaf, and he's blind.

199
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,327
I'm his
seeing eye person.

200
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,197
I could get something to
help clear up his eyes.

201
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,267
<i>- Scott works with animals.</i>
- Oh.

202
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,636
I worked for a vet
you know, for a while,

203
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,971
and we had a lot of poodles
with eye problems.

204
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,006
Oh, that would be
fabulous!

205
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,442
No one's been able to help
my little Baby Boy.

206
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,411
I hate
to see him suffer.

207
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,313
<i>I think my favorite review</i>

208
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,048
<i>is from San Francisco,</i>

209
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,418
<i>when they said:</i>
<i>"Liberace was no Rubinstein...</i>

210
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,454
<i>but then Rubinstein</i>
<i>is no Liberace."</i>

211
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:48,291
This is my houseboy, Carlucci.

212
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,394
He rules the roost
around here.

213
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,665
<i>Thank you.</i>

214
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,267
Pig.

215
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:01,670
- What?
- <i>Pig in a blanket.</i>

216
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,873
You want a pig
in a blanket?

217
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:10,145
No. Thanks.

218
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:24,425
After lunch, I'll give
you a guided tour.

219
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,962
Great.

220
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,873
<i>I do all my own decorating.</i>

221
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,708
I just love it.

222
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,444
I call this
"palatial kitsch".

223
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:47,279
- Right.
- Don't you just love that?

224
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:49,248
I never saw
so many pianos.

225
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:51,183
Oh, I never touch them.

226
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:54,486
Mama made me play
every day in my childhood.

227
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,388
Didn't have
any friends.

228
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:59,625
So now I never play...
when I play.

229
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,695
These are actual
Roman columns.

230
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:06,064
<i>Ionic.</i>

231
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:14,940
I personally
support

232
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:19,009
the entire Austrian
rhinestone business.

233
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,510
It's too bad
you're so big,

234
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,546
you could try
one of these on.

235
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:26,283
So, Scott, do you have
any family left?

236
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,052
Oh, no, not really.

237
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:33,223
My mom's been
in and out of places,

238
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:35,058
<i>you know,</i>
<i>for my whole life.</i>

239
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:36,659
Oh, really?

240
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,829
And I have two sisters...
and a brother,

241
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:42,665
and then four
half-brothers and sisters...

242
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,166
from two
different fathers.

243
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,335
Most of them live
with their fathers.

244
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:49,138
The rest of us,
like me and Wayne,

245
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,939
we were sent
to state-run homes...

246
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:54,109
<i>and then Mom would come get us and
we'd live with her for a while,</i>

247
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:57,245
<i>then... she'd have her troubles again
and they'd have to put her away</i>

248
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,548
<i>so we'd get split up</i>
<i>and sent to foster homes.</i>

249
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,919
But I was really lucky.
I ended up with Rose and Joe.

250
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:07,688
You know, a really nice
family, on a ranch..

251
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:09,890
<i>You know,</i>
<i>with animals.</i>

252
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,426
Sure, because
it was a ranch!

253
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,061
What a story!

254
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:17,632
You got everything but a
fire in the orphanage.

255
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:21,502
But the ranch is where you
got to like animals, and...

256
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:24,037
I guess.

257
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,840
And I am going to try and get
that medicine for Baby Boy.

258
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:29,308
You remembered
his name.

259
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:32,012
That would be
wonderful.

260
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:35,581
I'm going to give you
my private number.

261
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:37,751
<i>It's unlisted.</i>

262
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:42,454
Now, I'm counting
on you...

263
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:45,223
so don't you forget.

264
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,399
You'd better not walk
onto my stage

265
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,833
with a ketchup stain.

266
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,870
Like anyone
would give a shit.

267
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:04,308
He's so unprofessional.

268
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:08,813
- Hello?
- <i>Hi. This is Scott... Thorson.</i>

269
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,648
- I'm sorry, who?
- <i>Scott. I'm Bob's friend.</i>

270
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:14,584
<i>I was at L-- his house.</i>
<i>I have medicine for his dog.</i>

271
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,652
Hold on.

272
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:17,654
- A Scott somebody.
- Who?

273
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,422
- Friend of Bob's. who was at your house.
- Oh, Scott!

274
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,058
He has medicine?

275
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:23,226
Scott, is that you?

276
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,229
Hi.
Um... Yeah...

277
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:28,898
Mr.--

278
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,433
<i>No, no. Please,</i>
<i>just call me Lee.</i>

279
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,935
Lee. Okay.

280
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,704
I have
the medicine

281
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:37,173
for your poodle.
For his eyes?

282
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,374
Oh, my savior!

283
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,144
I was going to just

284
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,412
tuck it in the mail
tomorrow morning...

285
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,849
and it should be there,
you know, in a few days.

286
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,952
Oh, no, no. I don't want Baby
Boy to have to wait that long.

287
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,655
Why don't you just book a flight
and come up this evening?

288
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,791
At my expense.

289
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,861
It's not that important.

290
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,997
Scott, why don't you let me
decide what's important.

291
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:06,633
You know, you'd be
doing me a great favor

292
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,435
if you'd fly up here
this evening.

293
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:11,638
<i>And I promise you I'll fly
you right back to L.A.</i>

294
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:13,506
<i>after my first show.</i>

295
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,043
- <i>I promise.</i>
- Okay.

296
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:24,050
Alone at last.

297
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,186
Thank you so much for
bringing my baby's medicine.

298
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:31,022
No problem.
He's going to be fine.

299
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:34,492
What would you like to do
with your life, Scott?

300
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,895
What's your dream?

301
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,463
I want to be
a veterinarian.

302
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,633
Oh, don't you
just love animals?

303
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,534
So do I.

304
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:47,537
You know, because they
love you, no matter what.

305
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:51,441
That's what makes them
dumb animals, I guess.

306
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,177
<i>If they really knew</i>
<i>who we were,</i>

307
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:56,280
they'd have nothing
to do with us.

308
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:02,452
Scott, I...

309
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:04,453
I feel like
I can trust you.

310
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:08,158
<i>And I have to talk</i>
<i>to someone.</i>

311
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:13,396
I've got myself
in a terrible mess.

312
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,899
What is it?

313
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:20,035
It's Billy.
My protégé.

314
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:23,405
I've created a monster.
A monster!

315
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,240
I gave him everything.

316
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:28,310
- I put his name in lights-- I made him famous.
- What did he do?

317
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,280
Well, he's out of control!
He's ruining me!

318
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:34,516
He's ruining my image!
I can't stand bad publicity!

319
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,150
My fans, you know?

320
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:39,554
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>they're not dumb animals.</i>

321
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:41,556
He's just... he's done
terrible things!

322
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,191
He's breaking
my heart.

323
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,427
It's just he's drinking heavily,
he's getting into fights.

324
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,929
And I can't
get rid of him!

325
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,832
He's under contract
for six months!

326
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,834
I'm going to be ruined!

327
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:55,837
I just wish his wife
would come and take him away.

328
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,672
His <i>wife?</i>

329
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,075
Hand me a towel, please.

330
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,046
Thank you.

331
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,517
I never know whether
people like me for me,

332
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,486
or what they can get
out of me.

333
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,922
You know,
because I'm Liberace.

334
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:19,524
Walter <i>Liberace,</i>
<i>for God's sakes!</i>

335
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,426
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>can you imagine?</i>

336
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,795
<i>I mean, Walter's fine</i>
<i>for Pidgeon,</i>

337
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,465
but Liberace?

338
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,335
It was the only thing
my father gave me.

339
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,236
He was
a French horn player.

340
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,771
He left us
for an oboist.

341
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,942
So that's why
you're so musical?

342
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,844
No, that man had
nothing to do with it.

343
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:42,914
My talent
comes from God.

344
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:44,715
Everybody wants
a piece of me,

345
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,184
a piece
of the action.

346
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:50,787
My brother George, he
performs in some small club.

347
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,289
You know what
the marquee says?

348
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,892
"Liberace",
in big letters.

349
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,327
I built that name.
It's my name.

350
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:59,496
That's not his.

351
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:03,499
"Gimme, gimme, gimme."

352
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,303
No one I can trust,
no one I can talk to.

353
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:11,007
I hate my life sometimes.
I really do.

354
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,175
- No.
- No, it's true.

355
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,845
No matter how many people are
around, I'm all by myself.

356
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,314
Like, I'm with people--

357
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:21,449
they're not really
my family or my friends.

358
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:24,185
You know what
that feels like?

359
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,389
Yeah. I do.

360
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,026
Yes.

361
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,128
Yes, you do.

362
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:37,731
You've been good
for me, Scott.

363
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,633
When?

364
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,568
Now.
Just now.

365
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,138
- Oh, you mean talking and--
- Yes, you know.

366
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,705
And listening.

367
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,207
You're very good
at listening.

368
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:50,377
People... take...

369
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,712
You know what?

370
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,849
I have a great idea.

371
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,087
Why don't you come
work for me?

372
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,856
As what?

373
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,992
Well, you could be
my secretary.

374
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,361
I don't type.

375
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,164
<i>Hell, Scott, I can</i>
<i>pay people to type.</i>

376
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,732
I need a companion.
A bodyguard.

377
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,269
Someone to keep people
off my back.

378
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,638
Someone I can talk to
the way we talked tonight.

379
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,674
<i>You'd be</i>
<i>my right-hand man.</i>

380
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,677
You can take care
of the animals.

381
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,812
Please.

382
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,016
Say yes, Scott.

383
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,920
Would you close the
drapes on the window, Scott?

384
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,222
Yeah.

385
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,658
It's really pretty
at night.

386
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:44,627
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,563
I didn't mean to
scare you like that.

388
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,699
Yeah, I just...

389
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:54,204
Things
are moving really fast.

390
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,438
Maybe I should just get
a room for tonight.

391
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:57,572
Oh, nonsense.

392
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,575
Look, I completely
understand

393
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,578
and I promise I'll stay
on my side of the bed.

394
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:05,247
I promise.

395
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:45,784
Good morning.

396
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,595
Well, look who's up!

397
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:11,383
<i>You're making a mistake here.
Listen to me.</i>

398
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,979
- <i>I worked for that old fag in his Hollywood house!</i>
<i>- Joe!</i>

399
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:16,746
Oh, I'm not saying it
for that.

400
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:20,451
I'm saying it's not
a fit place for Scott!

401
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,586
You don't know him
like I know him.

402
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,355
<i>Is this the kind of
life you want for yourself?</i>

403
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,124
It's a job, Rose.

404
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,758
And it pays better
than getting two.

405
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:31,260
Yeah, and you know what
they call that kind of job.

406
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,463
That's not what this is.

407
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:34,897
<i>Look, he's old.</i>

408
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,700
He doesn't like me
just for that.

409
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,935
Do you even like
this man?

410
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:44,707
Yeah. I really do.

411
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,775
He's lonely.

412
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,011
I can take care
of him.

413
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,746
And he can
take care of me.

414
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:55,850
My eyes
are open, Rose.

415
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,553
I promise.

416
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,320
Mr. Thorson!

417
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:36,955
Seymour Heller,
Lee's manager.

418
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:38,723
Lee's expecting you.

419
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:47,932
Is it any good?

420
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,001
It's amazing.

421
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,837
I love to cook.

422
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:57,975
We'll be a couple
of fat biddies in no time.

423
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,278
Great,
'cause I love to eat.

424
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,917
Come here, you.

425
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:22,765
She's going to see us.

426
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,235
People only see
what they want to see, Scott.

427
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:35,344
Oh, God! Oh, God!

428
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:36,878
Oh, my God.

429
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,889
We'll go shopping
tomorrow.

430
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:52,893
After cooking and sex,

431
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:56,697
I think shopping's the reason
to get up every day.

432
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,466
And it helps
so many people.

433
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:04,003
Do you mind if I ask you
something?

434
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:07,140
How do you stay hard
for so long? I mean...

435
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:10,076
that was the fourth time
since lunch.

436
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,412
You make me feel
so young.

437
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:17,316
And I've had implants.

438
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,722
I've had quite a drive,
you know, as well

439
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:27,459
and... you know,
I've had problems.

440
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:30,562
And it's a terrible thing
when you have such a desire

441
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,664
and the equipment
doesn't work.

442
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,566
It's like

443
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,068
wanting to sing
and being tone deaf.

444
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,471
And no one knows.

445
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:41,339
You're the only one
I told.

446
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:42,940
You see what
you mean to me?

447
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,075
Lee, I think--
just a minute.

448
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:46,810
I should
just tell you...

449
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,347
I'm bisexual.

450
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,783
I like women, too.

451
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,520
Well, good for you.

452
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:58,489
I love women!

453
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,757
I wish I could be
that flexible.

454
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,760
Make things
so much easier.

455
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:06,396
I am so sick
of getting fan mail

456
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,265
about my engagement
to Sonja Henie.

457
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,100
As if I would marry
an ice skater.

458
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,769
Please--
I mean, those thighs.

459
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:18,540
No, I was a goner
from my first time.

460
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:22,077
He was
a Green Bay Packer.

461
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,113
He came to hear me play
at one of my saloons.

462
00:28:24,147 --> 00:28:25,380
I couldn't miss him--

463
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:28,450
the guy was
the size of the door.

464
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:31,053
That's how I lost
my virginity.

465
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:34,622
Isn't that romantic?

466
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:37,525
You know, I tried
to make myself love women.

467
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,061
I'd stare at women's bosoms
and their backsides,

468
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,797
you know, trying
to feel <i>something.</i>

469
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:46,600
You see, I knew...
from being Catholic

470
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:49,536
what happened
to boys like me.

471
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,104
And I went
to confession.

472
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:55,375
Of course, I couldn't
confess everything.

473
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,878
The problem was,
according to Catholics...

474
00:28:57,912 --> 00:29:01,781
not confessing a sin
is also considered a sin...

475
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:05,684
so, you know, I was damned
if I do, damned if I didn't.

476
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:09,488
I can't believe
you're still Catholic.

477
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:11,157
Devout.

478
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,793
The turning point
for me...

479
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,297
was Kennedy
getting assassinated.

480
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:22,734
<i>I was working non-stop</i>
<i>and I was sick.</i>

481
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,836
<i>I felt terrible.</i>

482
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,371
<i>We found out later...</i>

483
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:30,008
<i>that when those heavy costumes</i>
<i>I wear get dry cleaned...</i>

484
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:32,610
<i>they use this</i>
<i>tetrachloride solution.</i>

485
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:34,913
<i>I would sweat...</i>
<i>and it'd get absorbed</i>

486
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:39,116
<i>into my bloodstream...</i>
<i>and shut down my kidneys.</i>

487
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,385
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

488
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:43,287
<i>But no one knew.</i>

489
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:45,989
<i>So I'm watching</i>
<i>the assassination on TV</i>

490
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:48,358
<i>and I think... at least</i>
<i>I'll have a few days off.</i>

491
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:51,661
<i>I mean, nobody's going to come</i>
<i>see me perform</i> this <i>weekend.</i>

492
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:56,132
<i>But, no.</i>
<i>No, Seymour made me work.</i>

493
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,435
<i>They thought</i>
<i>I was dying.</i>

494
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:01,136
<i>They couldn't figure out</i>
<i>what was wrong.</i>

495
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,772
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>everything's bloated.</i>

496
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:05,240
<i>I'm drowning</i>
<i>in my own fluids.</i>

497
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,877
<i>They put me on dialysis</i>
<i>and I'm thinking...</i>

498
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:11,547
<i>the only thing that's going to
get me through this is prayer.</i>

499
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:14,016
<i>Sometime within these</i>
<i>36 hours of treatment...</i>

500
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,050
<i>I wake up,</i>
<i>and there's this nun</i>

501
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:20,488
<i>in an all-white habit</i>
<i>sitting beside my bed.</i>

502
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,956
<i>I said</i>
<i>I wanted to pray,</i>

503
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,959
<i>and she told me</i>
<i>not to waste my strength.</i>

504
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:28,296
<i>And she assured me</i>
<i>I would live.</i>

505
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,266
<i>Next day, my kidneys</i>
<i>start to work.</i>

506
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:34,468
<i>The doctors were amazed!</i>

507
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,971
<i>They admitted to me</i>
<i>they had given up hope.</i>

508
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,506
<i>So I asked</i>
<i>to see the nun...</i>

509
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,076
<i>to thank her</i>
<i>for giving me strength,</i>

510
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,878
<i>and... they said,</i>
<i>"Oh, no,</i>

511
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:48,949
<i>there's no nun here</i>
<i>that fits that description."</i>

512
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:52,852
<i>"There are no nuns here</i>
<i>that wear all-white habits."</i>

513
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:55,721
And I knew.

514
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:58,624
I knew my life
would not have been spared

515
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:04,229
if being gay was the sin
that the Church said it was.

516
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:08,167
I was saved... because
God looks upon me

517
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,702
with special favor.

518
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:14,940
That nun...
was a messenger.

519
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:18,777
Wow.

520
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,145
Isn't that something?

521
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,016
But, Scott-- men, women--
you know, who cares?

522
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,718
What's important
is to be yourself.

523
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,221
You just be who you
are, baby boy.

524
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,305
Don't eat all of this.

525
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:52,375
You'll be angry that
your panties are tight.

526
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,377
Ah-ooh.

527
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,446
- You want some, Scott?
- Mm-mm.

528
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:02,451
Mm!

529
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:04,987
These are delicious.

530
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:06,889
Here.

531
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:08,890
Have one.

532
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:15,330
Does he
do that every night?

533
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:17,665
Mm-hmm.

534
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:19,590
<i>♪ Have yourself
a merry little Christmas... ♪</i>

535
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:20,891
<i>Be careful, Scott.</i>

536

<i>♪ Let your heart</i>
<i>be light... ♪</i>

537
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,030
Perfect.

538
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:30,733

540
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:35,838
He made you
a pesto panini.

541
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:37,707
Oh.

542
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,146
Did you bring
my Fresca?

543
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,717
What?

544
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:55,056
Here's what's going to happen.
You listening?

545
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:58,026
You think you're so hot
and sexy with your hard ass

546
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,794
and that bisexual
bullshit.

547
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:02,696
You know how many
there have been?

548
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:05,065
Bobby, Hans, Chase.

549
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,800
Oh, and some
country boy stripper

550
00:34:06,835 --> 00:34:09,537
who was so dumb he wore
his G-string backwards.

551
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:11,539
He got rid
of all of them.

552
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:13,073
But I'm still here.

553
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:16,243
And one day,
Lee is going to call Seymour...

554
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:18,878
and he's going to tell him
to get rid of you.

555
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:26,453
Lee?

556
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:30,757
Lee?

557
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:34,760
Oh, excuse me.
I was--

558
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:39,198
Lee?

559
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,401
Right here,
baby boy.

560
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:47,873
<i>You've never seen me</i>
<i>without my hair, have you?</i>

561
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:52,810
Terrible.
Terrible, isn't it?

562
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:56,714
But the pieces,
they're great.

563
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:58,783
You know what
I'm going to do?

564
00:34:58,817 --> 00:35:01,419
I'm going to put you
in charge of my wigs.

565
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:03,954
<i>I only do that</i>
<i>for people I trust.</i>

566
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:07,857
- <i>Would you like that?</i>
- Lee, I'm sorry, but...

567
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:10,026
I think maybe
this was a mistake.

568
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:12,529
What's wrong?
What?

569
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:13,997
<i>I can't do this.</i>

570
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:17,033
I can't live like this,
in this house.

571
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:19,203
I mean, everybody
looks down on me.

572
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:22,004
<i>Carlucci is always on
my ass about something.</i>

573
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,840
<i>He's treating me</i>
<i>like</i> I'm <i>the houseboy.</i>

574
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:27,610
I just, I can't
live like this.

575
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:28,711
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:31,880
I don't want
to see you depressed.

577
00:35:31,915 --> 00:35:35,618
When you have a sad face,
then I feel sad.

578
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:40,222
But it's not sad, it's...
This isn't working.

579
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:43,024
Well, then I've failed.

580
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,193
Because you have
made me so happy...

581
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,929
<i>over these past</i>
<i>few months.</i>

582
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:52,766
And if I haven't
made you happy...

583
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,537
Your happiness means
everything to me, Scott.

584
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:03,544
I just don't know
what to do.

585
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:46,850
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

586
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:50,388
<i>I love you</i>
<i>not only for what you are</i>

587
00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:53,891
<i>But for what I am</i>
<i>when I'm with you</i>

588
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:58,928
<i>I love you not only for what
you have made of yourself</i>

589
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:02,666
<i>But for what</i>
<i>you are making of me.</i>

590
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,469
<i>I love you for ignoring</i>
<i>the possibilities...</i>

591
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:09,673
<i>of the fool in me</i>

592
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:12,874
<i>And for accepting</i>
<i>the possibilities</i>

593
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:15,644
<i>of the good in me.</i>

594
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:26,188
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

595
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:29,290
<i>I love you</i>
<i>for closing your eyes</i>

596
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:32,393
<i>to the discords in me.</i>

597
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:35,697
<i>And for adding</i>
<i>to the music in me</i>

598
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,700
<i>by worshipful listening</i>

599
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:48,375
No, I don't
like it.

600
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:49,909
- It makes it better.
- I don't want it.

601
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:52,879
Oh. Oh!

602
00:37:57,585 --> 00:38:01,387
I've always
wanted children.

603
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:05,924
I regret that--
not having children.

604
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:09,395
I love Christmas.
I think I'd be a good daddy,

605
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:13,966
- don't you think?
- Oh, you're such a loving man.

606
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,034
Mmm.

607
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:18,470
Well, maybe
I'll adopt <i>you.</i>

608
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:24,576
I want you to take the money
that you're earning...

609
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,612
and buy a house
here in Las Vegas.

610
00:38:29,482 --> 00:38:31,315
I'll co-sign.

611
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,949
But it'll be
in your name,

612
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:36,787
so... you'll have
some security.

613
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:39,322
Would you like that?

614
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:43,293
Lee...
are you serious?

615
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:47,431
I want to be everything
to you, Scott.

616
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:50,833
I want to be
father... brother...

617
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:54,871
lover... best friend.

618
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:56,806
Everything.

619
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,111
You know I love you.

620
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:07,849
Does that mean
anything to you?

621
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,951
Maybe all
those years...

622
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:14,155
all those
foster homes...

623
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:17,358
maybe I'm your
real family.

634
00:39:56,463 --> 00:40:00,465
She's got a little bit of a Judy
thing going on, don't you think?

635
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,667
Yeah.

636
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,169
You look hot.

637
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:08,206
I do, don't I?

638

<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

641
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,880

642

<i>to look directly</i>
<i>into the camera.</i>

643
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:23,520
I was the first
matinee idol

644
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,023
in television.

645
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,959
I was the one had the idea
of putting the candelabra

646
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,694
up on the piano,
you know?

647
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,130
I saw an old
Merle Oberon movie

648
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:37,000
when I got the idea.
From, uh... about Chopin.

649
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,203
What was the name of that...?
"A Song to Remember"!

650
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,538
Really? That's like
your trademark!

651
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:45,475
I know.
Who knew?

652
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,943
Wow.

653
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,511
Huh.

654
00:40:49,545 --> 00:40:52,447
So, really, no matter
what you did,

655
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:56,651
you were just...
meant to be famous.

656
00:40:56,685 --> 00:40:58,987
I guess so.

657
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:01,490
Hmm.

658
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:07,594
( Groans

659
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:10,231
Hello.

660
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:13,567
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on.

661
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,102
It's Seymour.

662
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:18,039
I told him not to call
this number.

663
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,774
I told you not to call
this number.

664
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:23,109
Hi, Lee.
I'm sorry,

665
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:24,310
I have to talk to you
about these dates.

666
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:25,945
We've got six months
of bookings.

667
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:28,415
I already told you
the dates I would do.

668
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:30,616
I'm not working after Thanksgiving

669
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:33,920
during the holidays.
Especially now.

670
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:36,221
But you can make double
on holiday shows.

671
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,722
Take a vacation later.

672
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:40,259
Seymour,
I do not want to be

673
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:42,428
the richest piano player
in the grave.

674
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:43,995
- Forget it.
- No, definitely not.

675
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,497
You're already
working too hard.

676
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:49,301
Lee, give the phone to Scott.
I have a question for him.

677
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:53,471
Hey, Seymour.

678
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:54,772
Hey, Scott.

679
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,674
Why don't you stay
out of my fucking business?

680
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,376
Now give me back
to Lee.

681
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:06,617
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

682
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,052
No, you cannot come
for dinner tomorrow night.

683
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:11,455
I'm making pork.

684
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:14,091
Okay.
Bye-bye.

685
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,893
Ay-yi-yi!
Oy!

686
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,696
Doesn't he get insulted when you
don't invite him over for dinner?

687
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,365
He gets 10% of every
dollar I earn.

688
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,468
I don't have to
take him out for dinner.

689
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,337
And I don't want
any company.

690
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:33,709
I want my blond Adonis
all to myself.

691
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,680
Oh, shit!

692
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:40,715
Shit, shit, shit!

693
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:43,551
- Carson!
- Oh, hurry! Hurry!

694
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:46,721
<i>Have we missed</i>
<i>my performance?</i>

695
00:42:48,324 --> 00:42:51,259
Oh. Tsk.

696
00:42:58,899 --> 00:43:02,769
<i>Oh, my Christ!
I look like my father!</i>

697
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:05,439
I look like
my father in drag!

698
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:09,943
I look like my father in
"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"!

699
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,379
I would say
a full face lift...

700
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:15,982
with silicone implants
to prevent the return

701
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,951
of the lines
around the mouth.

702
00:43:17,985 --> 00:43:19,418
My feeling?

703
00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:22,122
Why go through all of the
work and the money...

704
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,257
just to have it all
fall down within a year?

705
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:27,393
You pay good money,
it should last.

706
00:43:27,427 --> 00:43:30,162
Some of these doctors,
they keep you coming back

707
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:32,731
and paying,
time after time.

708
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:35,233
- I don't believe in it.
- No, you're right.

709
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:37,302
You know, I had
all this done a while ago,

710
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:41,473
but I don't think
he was as good as you are.

711
00:43:42,575 --> 00:43:44,276
I'm going to recommend
a deep face peel

712
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,677
after the face lift.

713
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:48,279
You're going
to look fabulous!

714
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:50,347
You'll look as young
as Scott here.

715
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:52,850
Oh, thank you!
I feel so much better.

716
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:54,952
I mean, that Carson show
was like looking

717
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:58,756
at Dorian Gray
wither away in public.

718
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:00,257
But what about
the press?

719
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,793
How do we keep this
a secret?

720
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:05,796
We rent you a fully furnished
apartment under an alias

721
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,731
until the bandages
come off.

722
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,166
No one will know.

723
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,569
After that, you can
recuperate as you like.

724
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,838
Jack, I wish
I'd met you sooner.

725
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:17,173
I would still have
had a movie career!

726
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:20,109
That was my real dream--
to be a movie star.

727
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:23,445
Now, Jack, I want
to talk to you

728
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:25,948
about doing some surgery
on Scott here.

729
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:27,216
What?

730
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,283
Fine.

731
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,619
What would you like me
to do with Scott?

732
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:36,591
I want you to make Scott
look like this.

733
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:39,293
Can you do that?

734
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:43,598
Oh, I see.

735
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:46,267
Yes, I think
I can do what you want.

736
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:49,369
He's going to need
a nose job.

737
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:52,172
And I'm going to have to
restructure his cheekbones

738
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:54,541
and his chin
with silicone implants,

739
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:56,409
<i>but it's not</i>
<i>impossible.</i>

740
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,913
But first we have to
slim him down!

741
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:03,784
I have a terrific diet.
The California Diet.

742
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:07,887
Guaranteed loss of 15 pounds
in four weeks.

743
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,031
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

744
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:22,033
The man wants to spend money to
make you thinner, prettier,

745
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:24,335
and younger and you are
thinking about not doing it.

746
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,904
But I <i>am</i> young.

747
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:29,141
Honey, in gay years,
you're Judy

748
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,743
during the Sid Luft
obese period.

749
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:34,112
Really?

750
00:45:34,147 --> 00:45:36,714
They were talking about me
like I wasn't even there.

751
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:39,750
If Lee doesn't get what
he wants, you won't be.

752
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:44,088
Well, I guess
I should be flattered,

753
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:46,957
him wanting me
to look like him.

754
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:49,193
<i>Imitation's</i>
<i>the highest form.</i>

755
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:52,263
That's what they tell
drag queens when they're born.

756
00:45:53,597 --> 00:45:55,698
Oh, I don't know, man.

757
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,967
I mean, won't it be weird
looking in a mirror

758
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,535
and not recognizing
myself?

759
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:02,272
Should we take the Auburn
or the Camaro?

760
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:15,884
I just don't understand
why I cannot keep my hair on

761
00:46:15,919 --> 00:46:18,153
during the procedure.

762
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:22,157
If I die, I want you
to get in here--

763
00:46:22,192 --> 00:46:24,293
I don't care if you have
to slap it on with Elmer's--

764
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,027
before anybody
sees me.

765
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:28,730
You're not
going to die.

766
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:08,902
Oh, you are doing
so well, Lee!

767
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:11,071
Isn't he doing well?

768
00:47:12,306 --> 00:47:16,075
I guess it's time to get
started on you, huh?

769
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:18,878
First, we're going to do
something about that weight.

770
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:23,582
The California Diet.

771
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:28,854
Those pounds
will just fall off!

772
00:47:55,313 --> 00:47:58,615
You look, easily,
right now...

773
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:01,584
like a man
in his mid-40s.

774
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:07,890
Will I be able
to close my eyes?

775
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:09,558
Not entirely.

776
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:13,129
But this way, you'll always be
able to see people's expressions

777
00:48:13,163 --> 00:48:15,898
when they see
how <i>fabulous</i> you look.

778
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:22,237
Sweetie,
you're snoring.

779
00:48:28,744 --> 00:48:32,013
Lee!

780
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:46,427
Sweetie, you're snoring.

781
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:04,444
Oh, look at you!

782
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:07,779
- My Adonis is coming back.
- Really?

783
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:09,914
Come here.

784
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:25,062
What are these for?

785
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:27,498
Post surgery.

786
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:30,267
Okay, but I stay
on the California Diet?

787
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:31,902
Perfectly safe.

788
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,804
Just keep
taking those.

789
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,240
And one of these
is a prescription

790
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,208
for my own
special diet pill.

791
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:42,112
Uh, I want
a dimple on my chin.

792
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,814
Scott, Lee doesn't have
a dimple on his chin.

793
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,916
I know, but...

794
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,284
You know,
it's my face.

795
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,888
Not too deep,
just a little one.

796
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,625
Okay.

797
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,661
You think
Lee'll be mad?

798
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:10,005
Sleep tight,
my baby boy.

799
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,774
I'll see you
on the other side.

800
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,629
<i>Scott, it's
so good to hear your voice.</i>

801
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:48,396
I'm sorry, Rose.

802
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:50,198
Just with Lee's schedule,
it's been so crazy.

803
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,534
I didn't say it
to make you feel bad.

804
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,168
So talk to me.
How are you?

805
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:55,937
You taking care
of yourself?

806
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:57,105
I'm great.

807
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:59,573
I've lost a whole lot
of weight, actually.

808
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:02,309
<i>What for? You always
had such a nice build.</i>

809
00:52:02,344 --> 00:52:04,078
No, no,
it's a healthy thing.

810
00:52:04,113 --> 00:52:06,080
It's the California Diet.

811
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:07,782
Lee and I
did it together.

812
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:10,851
<i>He's really</i>
<i>into self-improvement.</i>

813
00:52:10,885 --> 00:52:12,853
Oh.

814
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:16,957
How is
Mr. Lee-berace?

815
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:18,659
He's great.

816
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:21,427
Actually,

817
00:52:21,462 --> 00:52:23,997
we're going to see
some lawyers tomorrow...

818
00:52:24,032 --> 00:52:26,999
because, um, he wants
to adopt me.

819
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:30,803
<i>Adopt</i> you?

820
00:52:30,837 --> 00:52:33,005
I don't understand.

821
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,678
<i>Why would a grown man want</i>
<i>to adopt another grown man?</i>

822
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:42,613
So we can be family.

823
00:52:44,216 --> 00:52:46,985
I don't understand.

824
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:49,120
In the state of Nevada,
if you're over 18,

825
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:50,755
you have the right
to be adopted...

826
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,523
whether your parents
are living or deceased.

827
00:52:52,558 --> 00:52:54,258
So it won't be
an issue.

828
00:52:54,293 --> 00:52:56,827
Well, then--
that's great.

829
00:52:56,861 --> 00:53:00,097
Now, John, I want to make
this perfectly clear.

830
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:01,631
I don't want a word
of this out there

831
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,935
until the adoption is complete.
Not a word.

832
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:08,638
As your lawyer, I'm legally
bound <i>not</i> to discuss it.

833
00:53:08,673 --> 00:53:12,542
I know, but, you know,
in casual conversation.

834
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:15,111
No one...

835
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:18,081
I mean, <i>no one</i> has ever
been closer to me

836
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:21,150
than this young man.

837
00:53:21,185 --> 00:53:24,053
I want to make sure
he's taken care of forever...

838
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:28,357
no matter what
happens to me.

839
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:31,593
<i>The coat costs $300,000.</i>

840
00:53:31,627 --> 00:53:35,197
It is made entirely
of virgin white fox.

841
00:53:35,231 --> 00:53:37,065
The train
is 16 feet long--

842
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,633
that is the longest
in the world.

843
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:42,637
It was designed exclusively
for him by Anna Nateece.

844
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:47,875
It has $100,000 worth of
Austrian crystals which line it.

845
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:50,644
And that is why it is the
only coat in the world

846
00:53:50,678 --> 00:53:53,147
with its own
chauffeur and car.

847
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:55,682
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

848
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:57,384
- Would you sign this?
- Sure, yes.

849
00:53:57,418 --> 00:53:59,019
- <i>Please. My name is Sue.</i>
- Sue.

850
00:53:59,054 --> 00:54:00,887
<i>But, dear, you can ask him.</i>

851
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:02,956
Oh, I know.

852
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:09,595
There you are.

853
00:54:10,564 --> 00:54:13,199
- $3.
- Thank you.

854
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,338
<i>You're Liberace's
son, aren't you?</i>

855
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,577
<i>So, how you doing, Ma?</i>

856
00:54:25,611 --> 00:54:28,013
You happy?

857
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:30,115
It is what it is.

858
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:34,451
Well, is the nurse
working out for you?

859
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:36,353
Yeah, I think so.

860
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:38,622
I mean,
they're fine.

861
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:43,627
So, is there
anything that you need?

862
00:54:43,662 --> 00:54:45,196
No.

863
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,732
No, I'm just lonely,
that's all.

864
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:53,270
You can't do anything
for loneliness.

865
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:58,541
Well, you've got
George and Dora, right?

866
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:01,311
They're a few minutes away. Don't
they come down for a visit?

867
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:04,781
Same faces.

868
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:07,883
Every day,
same faces.

869
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:15,124
So, do you want me
to bring Angie from L.A.?

870
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:17,059
- Bring her down?
- Oh, no!

871
00:55:17,093 --> 00:55:18,727
No, don't need that.

872
00:55:18,761 --> 00:55:21,362
Please, I don't
need that. No.

873
00:55:21,396 --> 00:55:24,866
No. All I need
is to be near <i>you.</i>

874
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,103
But you know out here,
all alone, I don't know...

875
00:55:29,138 --> 00:55:31,572
it's every day the same.
You know,

876
00:55:31,606 --> 00:55:33,308
but you, you have--
it's too much.

877
00:55:33,342 --> 00:55:36,410
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

878
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,015
But I know...
it's too much.

879
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,951
You always going
to give everything,

880
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:44,985
you're so busy--

881
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:46,753
<i>it's too much!</i>
<i>I understand.</i>

882
00:55:46,787 --> 00:55:50,390
Give my son some more
iced tea, please.

883
00:55:50,424 --> 00:55:52,592
This will be good
for you, not <i>this.</i>

884
00:55:52,626 --> 00:55:54,060
Mm-mm.

885
00:56:01,301 --> 00:56:03,402
Thank you.

886
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:06,005
Oh, thank you so much.

887
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:07,673
Oh.

888
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:10,075
You're all
just so wonderful.

889
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:12,878
I feel so close
to you all.

890
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,046
I feel like I can
tell you something

891
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:17,715
that I haven't told
anyone at all.

892
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,919
But you have to promise
it stays in this room.

893
00:56:20,953 --> 00:56:23,755
In my early days...

894
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:26,357
before sound
was invented...

895
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:31,428
Well, I look pretty good
for 35, don't I?

896
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,504
Well, anyway,

897
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:43,339
back then,
classical piano players

898
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:45,574
always wore
black tuxedos.

899
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:48,778
Plain old
black tuxedos.

900
00:56:48,812 --> 00:56:52,348
My mother, she wanted me
to be classical...

901
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:54,784
but I just couldn't stay
out of the saloons.

902
00:56:56,387 --> 00:57:00,088
But I did have a concert
at the Hollywood Bowl...

903
00:57:00,123 --> 00:57:02,490
and I was excited.

904
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:04,092
If you've never
been there,

905
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:06,528
it's open air--
it's tremendous!

906
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:09,464
It's got 10,000 people!

907
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:12,700
I show up
for the rehearsal,

908
00:57:12,735 --> 00:57:15,970
and I look at this vast...
this beautiful,

909
00:57:16,004 --> 00:57:19,540
enormous
open-air theater.

910
00:57:19,574 --> 00:57:23,877
And I look
at the black piano.

911
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:26,247
I think,
"Hmm."

912
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:30,450
"Black piano,
black tuxedo."

913
00:57:30,484 --> 00:57:34,454
"Who is going to see me
in this giant clam shell?"

914
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:39,859
Well, I ask you...
can you see me now?

915
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:25,768
<i>All I'm saying is..

916
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:27,137
why can't we have fun?

917
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,272
- Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch!
- See people, you know?

918
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:33,142
Go to a party
every once in a while.

919
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,877
- All I do is give, give, give!
- Maybe see somebody.

920
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,979
And no matter how much I buy
you, it's never enough!

921
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:40,082
I'm not asking you
to buy me anything, Lee.

922
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:43,185
I'm just-- I'm crawling the
walls a little, that's all.

923
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,154
Why can't we
see people?

924
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,855
What are you
talking about?

925
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,190
I took you to the Jim Nabors-
Dom DeLuise concert.

926
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:52,927
That was...
that was one time.

927
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:55,230
Scott, I'm tired.
I work all night.

928
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,132
- This is not an inexpensive life.
- I know,

929
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,234
but you don't even
let me go out by myself!

930
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:01,136
- Why?
- I don't know!

931
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,539
Just to go out
and see people

932
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:07,741
and talk to them.
Just for a break!

933
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:09,309
A break from me?

934
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:10,777
Why do you need
a break from me?

935
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:11,912
I don't need
a break from--

936
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:13,013
I mean for you
to come with me!

937
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:14,448
I can't say
anything right.

938
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:16,283
Please don't
be unhappy.

939
00:59:16,317 --> 00:59:18,685
I can't stand it when you
have a face like that.

940
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:20,354
Especially after
the money I paid for it.

941
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:22,255
Oh, you
want it back?

942
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:24,190
You want me to invite Charo
for brunch again?

943
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:26,859
- You liked her.
- Yeah, I like her fine, but--

944
00:59:26,893 --> 00:59:30,196
But what?! What is it with you?
It's never enough!

945
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,731
What more can I give?

946
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:34,467
I'm not--

947
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:39,104
I'm happy, okay?
I am.

948
00:59:39,138 --> 00:59:42,474
It's just... you have
to try to understand...

949
00:59:42,508 --> 00:59:44,342
being somebody's
boyfriend?

950
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:46,343
This is not
exactly the life

951
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:49,246
that I had planned
for myself, you know?

952
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:52,583
I mean, I was going to be
a veterinarian.

953
00:59:52,617 --> 00:59:54,885
You want to help
animals?

954
00:59:54,919 --> 00:59:58,089
Pick up the dog shit.

955
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,424
And you listen
to me.

956
01:00:00,459 --> 01:00:02,492
You stop taking
those pills, okay?

957
01:00:02,526 --> 01:00:04,427
Jack gives you
too much.

958
01:00:04,462 --> 01:00:07,063
He's got some people
addicted, I hear.

959
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:09,499
You're getting too thin,
you're always in a mood.

960
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:12,235
- People are noticing.
- Oh, who? Seymour?

961
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:13,936
Seymour hates me.

962
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:15,438
- They all hate me.
- See, this is what I mean.

963
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:17,639
It's that shit
talking!

964
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:29,518
Hey, you know what a woman said
to me in the casino today?

965
01:00:29,552 --> 01:00:32,887
She asked me
if I was Liberace's son.

966
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,426
- Really?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

967
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,562
Oh.

968
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:44,098
- Come here.
- No.

969
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:45,566
Come here.
Come here.

970
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:48,836
You don't get anything.
You get nothing.

971
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,938
I get it all.

972
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:54,073
- Yes, I do. Please.
- Can I ask you a question?

973
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,775
- Yes.
- Can we go out?

974
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:58,044
Oh...

975
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,117
<i>Walter was a twin.</i>

976
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:05,851
Really?
He never told me.

977
01:01:05,885 --> 01:01:08,920
Yeah, but the twin
was born dead.

978
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:12,291
But Walter...

979
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:16,262
Walter,
he weighed 13 pounds.

980
01:01:18,665 --> 01:01:21,566
Even in the womb, he wanted
more than anyone else!

981
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:25,970
What's a mother to do?

982
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:28,473
She loves
the child <i>more.</i>

983
01:01:28,507 --> 01:01:31,042
Now the <i>world</i> must
give him what he needs.

984
01:01:31,076 --> 01:01:32,777
Mm-hmm.

985
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:37,048
God. God gives us
the power.

986
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,117
It's not luck.

987
01:01:41,152 --> 01:01:43,654
It's who you are.

988
01:01:46,591 --> 01:01:47,924
- Oh!
- Whoa!

989
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,660
I win, I win!

990
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:52,796
I win, I win.
Look, look, look, I wi--

991
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,565
<i>Lee?</i>

992
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,433
Lee.

993
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,268
- Lee.
- What? What is it?

994
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:01,304
She won, but there's
no money in the machine.

995
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:04,840
Oh, for chrissakes.

996
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:06,742
I don't have any change.

997
01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:09,111
She won big.

998
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:11,145
Do you have
anything?

999
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,847
Gladys, do you have
any cash on you?

1000
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:14,583
<i>So, Ma, this is all we have.</i>

1001
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:16,685
But look
how much I won.

1002
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:19,020
No, I know, but we don't
have any more cash.

1003
01:02:19,054 --> 01:02:21,022
But...

1004
01:02:21,056 --> 01:02:24,292
Okay. Okay.

1005
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:27,394
So I'll take
a check.

1006
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:36,203
Are you
proposing to me?

1007
01:02:36,238 --> 01:02:40,841
I just don't have a lot of
ready cash available, so...

1008
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:43,710
I can't go to Lee, 'cause he
doesn't want me taking it anymore.

1009
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:45,245
Well, that's silly.

1010
01:02:45,279 --> 01:02:47,614
He wants you to stay
skinny, doesn't he?

1011
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,849
Silly.

1012
01:02:49,883 --> 01:02:52,184
<i>I mean, I'd like to
wean myself off it...</i>

1013
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:54,120
<i>eventually,</i>
<i>but, uh...</i>

1014
01:02:54,154 --> 01:02:55,921
I have it under
manageable control now.

1015
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:57,856
I don't even think
I'm going to take them

1016
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,591
<i>on the European tour.</i>

1017
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:01,426
Totally up to you.

1018
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:03,328
The body flushes it out.

1019
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,697
There are no studies
that show it's addicting.

1020
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:07,766
It's perfectly fine.

1021
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,735
You look terrific,
by the way.

1022
01:03:13,305 --> 01:03:15,139
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1023
01:03:15,173 --> 01:03:16,741
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1024
01:03:16,775 --> 01:03:18,976
<i>How does he get that
whole thing down his throat?</i>

1025
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,512
<i>It's bigger than his head!</i>

1026
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:23,514
<i>It's a freak show!</i>

1027
01:03:23,548 --> 01:03:26,651
<i>I don't know how you
can be gay and be such a prude.</i>

1028
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:29,486
<i>I'm</i> bisexual.

1029
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:32,289
Well, which half
likes women?

1030
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:34,791
I haven't met
that half yet.

1031
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,526
You know, you're such
a booper.

1032
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:41,364
Such a party
pooper-booper.

1033
01:03:41,398 --> 01:03:44,400
I don't even know
why you need that.

1034
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:46,301
I don't <i>need</i> it.

1035
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:49,405
I enjoy it.
It enhances it.

1036
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:53,208
Sexuality is
something beautiful.

1037
01:03:53,243 --> 01:03:54,509
Right.
So how can you watch

1038
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:57,144
those disgusting things
being done?

1039
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:00,448
Disgusting is in the eyes
of the disgusting.

1040
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:03,451
There's nothing wrong with
any part of the human body.

1041
01:04:03,486 --> 01:04:05,253
It's all
God's creation.

1042
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:08,923
Well, God didn't make certain
parts for certain things.

1043
01:04:08,957 --> 01:04:10,524
It's variety, Scott.

1044
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:12,426
It's what keeps
a relationship fresh.

1045
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,161
You know, you are
such a prude!

1046
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:16,563
I am not.

1047
01:04:16,598 --> 01:04:19,165
Then why won't you let
me fuck <i>you</i> sometime?

1048
01:04:23,104 --> 01:04:24,938
- Forget it.
- Why not?

1049
01:04:24,972 --> 01:04:27,072
- Because I don't like it.
- Why?

1050
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:29,609
Because it's
kind of repugnant.

1051
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:32,912
<i>I'm</i> repugnant?

1052
01:04:32,946 --> 01:04:34,847
No! Not you.

1053
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:36,482
It.

1054
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:39,251
That.
Doing that.

1055
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:42,987
Only when
it's done to <i>you.</i>

1056
01:04:43,022 --> 01:04:44,289
Yes.

1057
01:04:44,323 --> 01:04:45,924
I can't help it.

1058
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:47,893
- Well, you never tried it.
<i>- Oh, God!</i>

1059
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:50,261
Because I know
I wouldn't like it.

1060
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:52,397
If you loved me,
you'd try it.

1061
01:04:52,432 --> 01:04:55,233
If you loved me, you wouldn't
ask me to do something I hate.

1062
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,501
Oh, God!

1063
01:04:56,536 --> 01:04:57,968
All of a sudden
we're sounding like

1064
01:04:58,002 --> 01:05:00,103
a gay Lucy and Ricky.

1065
01:05:00,138 --> 01:05:02,239
"Oh, Ricky, you wouldn't
fuck me up the ass

1066
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,674
<i>if you really loved me."</i>

1067
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,309
Why am I the Lucy?

1068
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:08,245
Because I'm
the bandleader

1069
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,514
with the nightclub act.

1070
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:21,390
Hello.

1071
01:05:23,026 --> 01:05:24,627
Hold on.

1072
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:26,863
It's your sister.

1073
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:32,133
Angie, what?

1074
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:37,072
When?

1075
01:05:38,274 --> 01:05:41,343
Okay.

1076
01:05:41,377 --> 01:05:44,546
Did you call...
what's his name?

1077
01:05:46,381 --> 01:05:49,149
Okay. Okay.

1078
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:52,820
All right, let me
call Seymour on this.

1079
01:05:52,855 --> 01:05:55,490
It'll be first thing
in the morning.

1080
01:05:55,524 --> 01:05:57,257
Yeah.

1081
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:58,759
Okay.

1082
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:07,333
Lee, what?

1083
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:11,204
Mama died.

1084
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:13,573
Oh, no.

1085
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:15,575
Oh, no.

1086
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:18,878
Oh, Lee,
I'm so sorry.

1087
01:06:56,447 --> 01:07:00,551
You have been amazing
these past few days.

1088
01:07:00,585 --> 01:07:02,252
We haven't even had
a chance to talk.

1089
01:07:02,286 --> 01:07:04,287
How are you
feeling?

1090
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,058
I'm free.

1091
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,300
<i>You're going to love this.</i>

1092
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,170
- Mm-mm.
- Come on. Just this one time.

1093
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,571
No, I don't
want to.

1094
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,775
Pooch, pooch, pooch, come on.
Ride my little scooter!

1095
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,610
You can ride my little scooter!

1096
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:31,412
- Don't tickle me.
- Let's see.

1097
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,747
Oh, daddy!

1098
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:12,651
Lee?

1099
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:25,897
Lee?

1100
01:08:30,536 --> 01:08:32,637
Lee?

1101
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:35,640
<i>Someone's in here!
What the fuck?!</i>

1102
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:00,730
What are you doing?

1103
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:30,358
Why was I on
the couch?

1104
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,828
Because I couldn't
bear you last night.

1105
01:09:33,862 --> 01:09:35,329
And if you keep
taking that junk,

1106
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:37,165
you'll be lucky to stay
on the couch.

1107
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:40,334
Well, about last night--
I'm not ready for apologies yet, okay.

1108
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:42,704
Apology?
Fuck you!

1109
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:47,540
You are
a well-known star.

1110
01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:49,542
Are you out
of your mind?

1111
01:09:49,577 --> 01:09:52,079
Going to a place
like that?

1112
01:09:52,113 --> 01:09:54,748
What if somebody
recognized you...

1113
01:09:54,782 --> 01:09:56,183
and called the papers?

1114
01:09:56,217 --> 01:09:57,517
I mean, Jesus!

1115
01:09:57,551 --> 01:09:59,186
When the London papers
said I was gay,

1116
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,922
I took them to court
and won the lawsuit.

1117
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:04,323
They retracted the story
and they paid for it.

1118
01:10:04,357 --> 01:10:05,891
Only because
they didn't have

1119
01:10:05,926 --> 01:10:08,460
a witness of you
in a room of dildos...

1120
01:10:08,494 --> 01:10:10,529
with your dick hanging out
in a glory hole.

1121
01:10:10,563 --> 01:10:13,498
Are you out
of your fucking mind?!

1122
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:16,702
Jesus, if Seymour
found out.

1123
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:19,270
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the millions he spends...</i>

1124
01:10:19,304 --> 01:10:23,942
<i>keeping fans thinking you just
haven't met the right woman?</i>

1125
01:10:23,976 --> 01:10:25,710
Oh, Scott,
you're right.

1126
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:28,479
You're so right--
I got to stop.

1127
01:10:28,513 --> 01:10:31,282
Never again,
I promise, never again.

1128
01:10:31,316 --> 01:10:35,085
I swear to God.

1129
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,987
You're so good for me.

1130
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:38,655
I don't know
what it is.

1131
01:10:38,689 --> 01:10:40,523
I can't stop myself
sometimes.

1132
01:10:40,558 --> 01:10:43,360
It's like a drug...
you know?

1133
01:10:43,394 --> 01:10:46,996
Like when you need
a stronger fix each time?

1134
01:10:48,298 --> 01:10:50,399
You have to help me.

1135
01:10:52,102 --> 01:10:54,937
I'll do
whatever you want...

1136
01:10:54,972 --> 01:10:56,438
you crazy
old queen.

1137
01:10:58,275 --> 01:11:00,275
You know that.

1138
01:11:00,309 --> 01:11:02,878
Just keep loving me.

1139
01:11:05,614 --> 01:11:09,284
But I want you to stop
seeing Dr. Startz.

1140
01:11:09,318 --> 01:11:11,619
<i>I mean it.</i>

1141
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:34,674
- The entrance? Showstopper.
- Thank you.

1142
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,142
Hello!

1143
01:11:36,177 --> 01:11:37,944
Finally, you come
to one of my shows.

1144
01:11:37,978 --> 01:11:40,213
No, I was here last year, remember?

1145
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:42,182
So, this is new,
right?

1146
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:44,083
I have new costumes
every year--

1147
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:46,252
it's in my contract.
You like it?

1148
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:47,720
You did it again.

1149
01:11:47,754 --> 01:11:49,421
It just gets bigger
and bigger, right?

1150
01:11:49,455 --> 01:11:52,324
One day, Lee, I think you're going
to play the piano while you fly.

1151
01:11:52,358 --> 01:11:53,992
Ray's working
on that.

1152
01:11:54,027 --> 01:11:56,295
- Scott, why don't you get him a drink?
- You heard the maestro.

1153
01:11:56,329 --> 01:11:58,330
- Do your thing, Lee.
- <i>Bonjour!</i>

1154
01:11:58,364 --> 01:12:01,300
<i>You guys, how did you</i>
<i>like the pool?</i>

1155
01:12:01,334 --> 01:12:03,101
What would you like?

1156
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:05,803
The money you owe me from last
time and a Jim Beam neat.

1157
01:12:05,838 --> 01:12:07,738
I don't have
any cash right now.

1158
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:10,908
<i>- Did you wear your little Speedos?</i>
- I did.

1159
01:12:10,943 --> 01:12:13,444
I'll accept
whatever's handy, guy.

1160
01:12:13,478 --> 01:12:16,914
<i>Did you notice
the "L" on the front?</i>

1161
01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:19,283
It was missing an "A" on the back.

1162
01:12:19,318 --> 01:12:20,550
You're cute.

1163
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,185
- <i>You are very cute.</i>
- <i>Stop.</i>

1164
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,786
<i>I like that.</i>

1165
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,649
<i>So, how is
the songwriting going?</i>

1166
01:12:55,684 --> 01:12:57,618
Good.

1167
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:00,188
I had some
positive feedback.

1168
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:02,423
When are you going to let me
hear one of your songs?

1169
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:04,926
- I don't know.
- Why?

1170
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,328
'Cause I'm afraid
you wouldn't like it.

1171
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:09,296
But I'm proud
of what you're doing!

1172
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,931
I'm like a proud papa!

1173
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:14,801
I think it's great!

1174
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:16,904
Maybe when I'm done with
this one, you can hear it.

1175
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:19,239
Whenever you want me
to hear.

1176
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:33,653
Scott, we should talk.

1177
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,457
I think
our relationship

1178
01:13:37,491 --> 01:13:39,893
is in a really
good place, don't you?

1179
01:13:39,927 --> 01:13:42,861
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.

1180
01:13:42,896 --> 01:13:45,931
So I think it'd be
a good thing for us...

1181
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:48,700
if we were able to see
other people, too.

1182
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:50,936
I don't mean
like you and me.

1183
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,506
I mean, nothing
will ever be like us.

1184
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:57,942
I just know there are things that
I like to do that you don't...

1185
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:00,645
and things that you like
to do that I don't.

1186
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:03,347
And I just think that
we're in such a good place

1187
01:14:03,381 --> 01:14:07,485
that we can allow each other...
you know, to do that

1188
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:12,156
and still love each other
and stay together.

1189
01:14:13,424 --> 01:14:15,826
What do you think?

1190
01:14:17,428 --> 01:14:20,831
Okay. You know,
if that's what you want.

1191
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,367
I think it'd be
good for us.

1192
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,670
I really do.

1193
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:29,872
Lee, he is
just a friend!

1194
01:14:29,906 --> 01:14:31,574
He is helping me
with my songs!

1195
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:33,141
I told you I had
meetings with him!

1196
01:14:33,176 --> 01:14:34,376
You're just like
the rest of them.

1197
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,645
All I do is give
and give and give.

1198
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,081
All you want is what
you can get out of me.

1199
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:41,016
I bet you can't
wait for me to die

1200
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,384
so you can
get everything!

1201
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:45,219
- <i>Hey, the will was your idea!</i>
- Jekyll and Hyde!

1202
01:14:45,253 --> 01:14:46,554
That's what you are!

1203
01:14:46,589 --> 01:14:48,756
I never know
who's going to show up!

1204
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,158
God knows what you do
when I'm onstage.

1205
01:14:51,193 --> 01:14:53,695
- <i>I don't do anything!</i>
- How many others are there, huh?

1206
01:14:53,729 --> 01:14:56,731
- How many?!
- <i>There aren't any others, Lee, I'm telling you!</i>

1207
01:14:56,765 --> 01:15:00,067
Well, I'm telling <i>you,</i>
you can't have it all.

1208
01:15:00,102 --> 01:15:02,903
It's either me
or nothing.

1209
01:15:02,937 --> 01:15:04,938
Me or him.

1210
01:15:04,973 --> 01:15:07,708
Who?
He's a friend!

1211
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:09,442
He's a fuck buddy!

1212
01:15:09,477 --> 01:15:13,046
If anybody's
fucking around, it's you.

1213
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,082
I know you, Lee. You haven't
wanted it from me in weeks.

1214
01:15:16,117 --> 01:15:17,783
Don't tell me
<i>you've</i> been doing without,

1215
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,719
you old queen.

1216
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:26,926
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

1217
01:15:36,502 --> 01:15:38,703
<i>...people out here, and
it seems a bit out of control.</i>

1218
01:15:38,738 --> 01:15:41,006
Where's Lee?

1219
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,607
Have a couple of guys
come help with security,

1220
01:15:42,642 --> 01:15:45,143
<i>wait on the stairs at night,
just to stop the crowds.</i>

1221
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:48,547
- <i>Otherwise...</i>
- Hey, Jim, how's the house tonight?

1238
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:56,176
to be on the Academy Awards,
and finally I am.

1239
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,677
Isn't that fabulous?

1240
01:16:57,712 --> 01:17:00,046
I'm going to play a medley
of the nominated scores

1241
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:03,083
and then present
the award for Best Score.

1242
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,587
Just to be able to hold one
of those gold statues.

1243
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:09,055
I know exactly
what I'm going to wear.

1244
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,157
Cary, do me a favor.
Can you get me a towel?

1245
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:12,825
Of course,
of course.

1246
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:16,061
I want to hear about that
outfit when I come back.

1247
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:51,061
Who are you
talking to, Mumbles?

1248
01:17:54,732 --> 01:17:56,833
Nobody.

1249
01:18:00,237 --> 01:18:02,338
What's the matter?

1250
01:18:05,276 --> 01:18:08,010
Why is he always
hanging around?

1251
01:18:08,879 --> 01:18:11,648
Who?

1252
01:18:11,682 --> 01:18:14,049
<i>Who?</i>

1253
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:16,518
Who?

1254
01:18:17,853 --> 01:18:19,988
That boy that
you want to fuck

1255
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:22,457
<i>from Young Americans.</i>

1256
01:18:22,492 --> 01:18:24,359
Oh, please.

1257
01:18:24,394 --> 01:18:25,561
Oh, please.

1258
01:18:25,595 --> 01:18:28,463
Why is that little bitch
always in our dressing room?

1259
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:33,067
Cary is my opening act,
Scott.

1260
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:36,237
He can come and go
as he pleases.

1261
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:42,042
Are you fucking him?

1262
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,145
Are you stoned?

1263
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,980
No, I'm upset!

1264
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,416
Can't you tell
the difference?

1265
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,818
No, I can't. But if
you're on that shit--

1266
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,653
- I'm warning you...
- I'm not! I'm <i>upset!</i>

1267
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,689
- I will not put up with this anymore.
- Don't change the subject!

1268
01:18:55,723 --> 01:18:57,424
- Stop that! Stop it!
- <i>I know you, Lee!</i>

1269
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:59,859
<i>I'm exhausted!</i>

1270
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:03,862
I work, you know?

1271
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:06,332
And I have to meet Seymour
very early in the morning

1272
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:09,268
about the Academy Awards
presentation.

1273
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:17,442
I see you
looking at him.

1274
01:19:17,476 --> 01:19:19,410
<i>What?</i>

1275
01:19:19,445 --> 01:19:22,213
That boy.

1276
01:19:22,248 --> 01:19:23,848
I watch you watch him.

1277
01:19:23,882 --> 01:19:26,684
I think he's
very talented.

1278
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,019
I have an eye for new
and refreshing talent.

1279
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:31,155
You have an eye for new
and refreshing dick.

1280
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:33,557
You're disgusting.

1281
01:19:33,591 --> 01:19:36,126
<i>If you're so interested</i>
<i>in talent...</i>

1282
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,730
<i>have you listened</i>
<i>to my songs?</i>

1283
01:19:39,764 --> 01:19:43,533
I haven't had a chance
to give it my full attention.

1284
01:19:44,736 --> 01:19:47,003
<i>Are you</i>
<i>tired of me?</i>

1285
01:19:47,037 --> 01:19:49,205
<i>Am I too old</i>
<i>for you?</i>

1286
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,640
Well, this song
you're singing

1287
01:19:50,674 --> 01:19:53,008
is beginning to get
a little old.

1288
01:19:58,081 --> 01:20:01,116
I don't want him around
after the shows anymore.

1289
01:20:01,151 --> 01:20:03,386
What a little brat
you've become.

1290
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,500
I thought you liked being
around people your own age.

1291
01:20:05,521 --> 01:20:07,889
You're always complaining we're
never with anyone else, you know?

1292
01:20:07,923 --> 01:20:10,224
<i>You said we weren't doing the "seeing
other people" thing anymore!</i>

1293
01:20:10,259 --> 01:20:13,561
- We're not!
- Then how come we haven't been together for so long?

1294
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:16,731
Because you're always stoned
and you can't get it up!

1295
01:20:16,766 --> 01:20:17,965
I can get it up!

1296
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,834
- Oh, Christ, I hit a nerve.
- I can get it up!!!

1297
01:20:19,868 --> 01:20:22,369
- All right, all right!
- I know you!

1298
01:20:22,404 --> 01:20:25,272
You can barely make it through a
performance without wanting to fuck!

1299
01:20:25,307 --> 01:20:27,140
- Where do you get it?
- It's terrible the way you talk to me!

1300
01:20:27,175 --> 01:20:28,275
You're getting it
on the outside!

1301
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:29,710
- Where do you go?
- You're terrible!

1302
01:20:29,744 --> 01:20:31,445
- Do you go to the White House?
- Where my mother died?

1303
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:33,814
- Are you insane?
- Oh, so you do go somewhere.

1304
01:20:33,848 --> 01:20:35,482
Where, huh?

1305
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:37,850
Where, Lee?!

1306
01:20:37,884 --> 01:20:40,152
You're being
paranoid, Scott,

1307
01:20:40,187 --> 01:20:41,854
because of that shit.

1308
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:45,457
Now, I am warning you...
this better stop.

1309
01:20:50,062 --> 01:20:52,331
<i>So who's doing the
arrangements for the medley?</i>

1310
01:20:52,365 --> 01:20:56,201
I'll find out. Probably
Bill or his assistant.

1311
01:20:56,235 --> 01:20:58,704
I bet that Vangelis kid
wins, you know?

1312
01:20:58,738 --> 01:21:00,971
I'm hearing him
all over the radio.

1313
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,887
I'm going to L.A.
for the afternoon.

1314
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:26,329
I'll be back in time
for the show.

1315
01:21:35,605 --> 01:21:39,241
I just want to make sure I
have enough rehearsal time.

1316
01:22:01,864 --> 01:22:04,064
And now he's going to use me,

1317
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:05,699
use me up
and toss me out,

1318
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:08,635
I know he is,
I know he is.

1319
01:22:08,669 --> 01:22:10,103
<i>This one's rigged.</i>

1320
01:22:10,137 --> 01:22:12,839
- I love him, you know?
- <i>That one's not rigged.</i>

1321
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:14,441
I love him.

1322
01:22:14,475 --> 01:22:16,676
I mean...

1323
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:19,546
he's been my whole world.

1324
01:22:20,814 --> 01:22:23,549
He's my,
he's my best friend.

1325
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:26,285
He's been better,
better than a father.

1326
01:22:27,454 --> 01:22:28,721
He was going to adopt me.
You know that?

1327
01:22:28,755 --> 01:22:30,456
<i>Really? You can adopt</i>
<i>someone you're fucking?</i>

1328
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:32,124
<i>That's a great law.</i>

1329
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:33,459
He said he always wanted
to make sure

1330
01:22:33,493 --> 01:22:35,895
- that I was taken care of.
- <i>Right.</i>

1331
01:22:35,929 --> 01:22:38,062
<i>Look, you're practically
married, right?</i>

1332
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:40,765
Nobody ever took care of me
the way he did.

1333
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,803
I have nothing
without him.

1334
01:22:44,837 --> 01:22:46,504
I don't even have
my own fucking face!

1335
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:48,406
My fucking face
is fucking gone

1336
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:49,741
for-fucking-ever, man!!

1337
01:22:49,775 --> 01:22:52,543
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>
Tranquilo, <i>okay?</i>

1338
01:22:52,577 --> 01:22:54,277
<i>Calm down.</i>

1339
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:56,713
<i>Look at me. You're
practically married, right?</i>

1340
01:22:56,748 --> 01:22:58,214
<i>So, he should</i>
<i>take care of you</i>

1341
01:22:58,249 --> 01:23:00,016
<i>in the style to which</i>
<i>you are accustomed.</i>

1342
01:23:00,051 --> 01:23:01,251
<i>That's a law, too.</i>

1343
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:03,019
I'm in the will,
but...

1344
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:05,288
a lot of good
that does me now.

1345
01:23:05,323 --> 01:23:07,458
<i>Being with him's like</i>
<i>a full-time job, correct?</i>

1346
01:23:07,492 --> 01:23:10,893
- 25 hours a day.
- <i>Yeah. So three words:</i>

1347
01:23:10,928 --> 01:23:12,394
<i>Sev-er-ance,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1348
01:23:12,429 --> 01:23:15,164
<i>People who get fired</i>
<i>get compensated.</i>

1349
01:23:22,072 --> 01:23:25,006
He's my whole world.

1350
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:02,408
There you are,

1351
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:06,913
you cocksucking
tenor fuck.

1352
01:24:10,183 --> 01:24:11,985
There's a call
for you.

1353
01:24:12,019 --> 01:24:14,185
Joe Carracappa.

1354
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:23,428
- Joe!
- <i>Hey, Scott.</i>

1355
01:24:23,462 --> 01:24:24,622
Hey, I'm sorry,
I have to run.

1356
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:25,998
I have to make
an entrance.

1357
01:24:26,032 --> 01:24:29,600
Rose... passed away
this morning, Scott.

1358
01:24:31,937 --> 01:24:33,470
What?

1359
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:37,742
- She's been sick.
- <i>For how long?</i>

1360
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:39,276
A while.

1361
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:41,378
She never said
anything to me.

1362
01:24:41,413 --> 01:24:45,081
<i>You know</i>
<i>how she is.</i>

1363
01:24:45,115 --> 01:24:47,751
Was.

1364
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,088
Can you come home, Scott?
It'd be good to see you.

1365
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:55,458
<i>We're having</i>
<i>services.</i>

1366
01:24:58,295 --> 01:25:00,596
Yeah.

1367
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:02,932
Yeah, of course.

1368
01:25:02,966 --> 01:25:04,499
<i>I am so excited.</i>

1369
01:25:04,534 --> 01:25:07,436
The Academy Awards
has been a dream of mine.

1370
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,972
That and Radio City
Music Hall.

1371
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:11,840
One down, one to go.

1372
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:15,310
My mom wants "On Golden
Pond" to win everything.

1373
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:16,811
Yes, wouldn't
that be sweet

1374
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,512
for the old folks
to win?

1375
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:22,850
And I'm so glad that Jane Fonda
stopped all those causes of hers

1376
01:25:22,885 --> 01:25:25,853
and made a nice movie
with her father.

1377
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:29,123
I just don't understand
people like her and Ed Asner,

1378
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:32,893
shouting their opinions
all over the place.

1379
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:36,697
Listen to me, because
you're all on your way.

1380
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,232
When one reaches
star status,

1381
01:25:39,266 --> 01:25:41,935
it is not an invitation
to show everyone

1382
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,904
how to change
the world.

1383
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:47,808
It is not our business
to change the world.

1384
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,509
We are here to
entertain the world...

1385
01:25:50,543 --> 01:25:53,879
and to sell drinks and souvenirs.

1386
01:25:53,914 --> 01:25:56,048
These kids better go
get ready for the next show

1387
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,817
if they're going to
entertain anybody.

1388
01:25:57,851 --> 01:25:59,518
Will you watch us tonight?

1389
01:25:59,552 --> 01:26:00,953
We put a new song in
just for you.

1390
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:04,356
Of course I will! Especially if
you put in a new song for <i>me.</i>

1391
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:06,190
Go on now.

1392
01:26:06,225 --> 01:26:08,459
I'm going to get
my beauty nap.

1393
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:24,608
- Lee.
- Please, do not start an argument.

1394
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:27,611
I have to eat, and take
my nap before the next show.

1395
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:29,880
I have no time.

1396
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:40,556
I got a call today...

1397
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:44,460
from Joe Carracappa.

1398
01:26:45,696 --> 01:26:49,465
The family that I lived
with when I met you.

1399
01:26:51,268 --> 01:26:53,702
And Rose...

1400
01:26:53,736 --> 01:26:56,271
my--

1401
01:26:56,305 --> 01:26:59,340
Joe's wife.

1402
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,209
She died.

1403
01:27:05,514 --> 01:27:08,216
Oh, Scott,
I...

1404
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,051
I'm so sorry,
Scott.

1405
01:27:10,085 --> 01:27:14,521
She was your favorite,
wasn't she?

1406
01:27:14,556 --> 01:27:19,526
There is a funeral
tomorrow... in Los Angeles.

1407
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:21,595
I will be booking
a ticket in the morning.

1408
01:27:21,629 --> 01:27:24,598
- No, no, no, no.
- I don't know what time I'm going to get back.

1409
01:27:24,632 --> 01:27:27,133
I'll call Seymour
in the morning, okay?

1410
01:27:27,168 --> 01:27:31,604
And I'll hire a Learjet
and you can take that.

1411
01:27:31,638 --> 01:27:34,007
And this way
it'll be more private

1412
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:37,610
and you won't have to worry
about reservations.

1413
01:27:37,644 --> 01:27:42,347
You come back any time
that you're ready tomorrow.

1414
01:27:47,987 --> 01:27:50,155
Come on, now.

1415
01:27:54,761 --> 01:27:58,863
It's just been so long since
we've been nice to each other...

1416
01:27:58,897 --> 01:28:02,100
and I was forgetting
what it felt like.

1417
01:28:05,337 --> 01:28:10,007
Well, let's just keep being
nice to each other, hmm?

1418
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:12,009
How about that?

1419
01:28:48,443 --> 01:28:50,444
Hi, Gladys.

1420
01:28:54,049 --> 01:28:56,517
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, kid.</i>

1421
01:28:56,551 --> 01:28:58,019
I didn't know
you were visiting.

1422
01:28:58,053 --> 01:29:00,288
Lee invited me for the day.
I heard about Rose.

1423
01:29:00,322 --> 01:29:01,688
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

1424
01:29:01,722 --> 01:29:03,824
Thanks.

1425
01:29:03,858 --> 01:29:05,926
Where's Lee?

1426
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,929
He has his final fitting
for the Oscars.

1427
01:29:08,963 --> 01:29:12,399
Come out by the pool
when you've settled in.

1428
01:29:13,268 --> 01:29:15,002
Hey, Bob?

1429
01:29:16,204 --> 01:29:18,771
- What's going on?
- What?

1430
01:29:18,806 --> 01:29:21,707
It just
feels weird.

1431
01:29:21,741 --> 01:29:23,976
Is there something
I don't know about?

1432
01:29:27,414 --> 01:29:29,415
Well...

1433
01:29:32,119 --> 01:29:33,985
yeah.

1434
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,922
Yeah.

1435
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:41,259
Last night... you know,
the kid that he... Right?

1436
01:29:44,063 --> 01:29:46,064
Cary, I think his...

1437
01:30:55,897 --> 01:30:58,631
We should move you to the Palm
Springs house this afternoon.

1438
01:31:00,434 --> 01:31:02,667
Let's wait
in the den.

1439
01:31:27,259 --> 01:31:29,994
- I'm not calling him.
- So don't.

1440
01:31:33,031 --> 01:31:34,464
I mean,
he's in the wrong.

1441
01:31:34,498 --> 01:31:36,900
He should call me
and apologize to <i>me.</i>

1442
01:31:36,935 --> 01:31:38,701
<i>He</i> fooled around
on <i>you.</i>

1443
01:31:38,736 --> 01:31:40,437
I mean, who's the injured
party here, guy?

1444
01:31:42,006 --> 01:31:44,174
I'm not calling him.

1445
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:45,842
So if his phone
doesn't ring,

1446
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:47,344
it's probably you.

1447
01:31:47,378 --> 01:31:49,011
It's the only way
men learn.

1448
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,646
Tell me.

1449
01:31:51,915 --> 01:31:55,051
- I am <i>not</i> calling him.
- So don't.

1450
01:31:55,085 --> 01:31:58,321
You scumbag,
piece of shit...

1451
01:31:58,355 --> 01:32:00,722
fairy, fucking queen
cocksucker!

1452
01:32:00,757 --> 01:32:02,758
<i>- That's what I'm talking about!</i>
<i>- How dare you!</i>

1453
01:32:02,792 --> 01:32:05,393
<i>- Fucking A!</i>
<i>- How fucking dare you, Lee! I could kill you!</i>

1454
01:32:05,428 --> 01:32:08,330
- <i>I could fucking kill you!</i>
<i>- Yeah, put that in your pipe and smoke it, baby.</i>

1455
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,834
He hung up.

1456
01:32:12,868 --> 01:32:14,269
Whoo!

1457
01:32:14,303 --> 01:32:16,871
Oh.

1458
01:32:20,509 --> 01:32:22,409
Mr. Schnelker.

1459
01:32:22,444 --> 01:32:24,678
This is Scott Thorson's
brother, Wayne.

1460
01:32:24,712 --> 01:32:26,180
<i>Half-brother.</i>

He's here

01:32:27,915 --> 01:32:29,683
Now as I said
on the phone,

1463
01:32:29,717 --> 01:32:31,718
Lee wants you to inform
Mr. Scott Thorson

1464
01:32:31,752 --> 01:32:33,420
his employment
has been terminated

1465
01:32:33,455 --> 01:32:36,090
and he must vacate
the apartment immediately.

1466
01:32:36,124 --> 01:32:37,890
Also, if possible,

1467
01:32:37,924 --> 01:32:39,892
we'd like you to convince
Scott to admit himself

1468
01:32:39,926 --> 01:32:41,794
to a hospital
for treatment,

1469
01:32:41,828 --> 01:32:43,429

Mr. Heller.
He's on the couch.

1472
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:49,702
Stay by the elevator.
Wayne?

1473
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,406
Scott?

1474
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:57,876
Scott?

1475
01:32:59,879 --> 01:33:02,447
Scott?

1476
01:33:02,482 --> 01:33:04,549
This is Tracy.

1477
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:06,385
A private investigator.

1478
01:33:06,419 --> 01:33:08,987
He's come
to ask you to leave.

1479
01:33:11,523 --> 01:33:13,824
Get out of my house!

1480
01:33:13,858 --> 01:33:15,959
Get out of my house!

1481

<i>- I only came to help.</i>
- I'm going to fucking get you out.

1482
01:33:27,438 --> 01:33:29,572
- He's going to get a gun!
- Has he got a gun?

1483
01:33:29,606 --> 01:33:32,375
- He has two.
- Don't let him get the guns.

1484
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:34,044
Let's go, brother.

1485
01:33:37,214 --> 01:33:38,814
Stay back!

1486
01:33:38,849 --> 01:33:40,517
Stay back,
don't you come in here!

1487

01:33:45,721 --> 01:33:48,057
I wish you would
call the police.

1490
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:50,192
Scott, if you would take
advantage of our assistance,

1491
01:33:50,226 --> 01:33:52,961
I'd be happy to call a
doctor and we can help you.

01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:05,031
<i>Was it your expectation
that you would become</i>

1555
01:38:05,065 --> 01:38:08,302
- <i>the legally adopted son of Liberace?</i>
- Yes.

1556
01:38:08,336 --> 01:38:10,504
<i>And continue in a sexual</i>
<i>relationship with him</i>

1557
01:38:10,538 --> 01:38:13,373
- <i>after the adoption?</i>
- No.

1558
01:38:13,408 --> 01:38:16,108
<i>Is that when you thought</i>
<i>the sex would stop?</i>

1559
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,312
Our relationship
towards later on

1560
01:38:19,346 --> 01:38:22,748
went from a sexual
relationship to...

1561
01:38:22,783 --> 01:38:25,718
Lee always thought of me
as more of a son.

1562
01:38:25,752 --> 01:38:27,687
We had our
sexual relationship

1563
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:29,188
in the beginning
of our relationship

1564
01:38:29,222 --> 01:38:32,290
and it was, more or less,
he thought of me as a--

1565
01:38:32,325 --> 01:38:35,727
He wanted me to think of him
as a, as a father type image.

1566
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:39,698
He thought--
It's just so hard to explain.

1567
01:38:39,732 --> 01:38:41,499
<i>His duties were expanded</i>

1568
01:38:41,534 --> 01:38:44,969

<i>acting as a buffer for me...</i>

1569
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:49,707
you know, for various employees
in various hotels...

1570
01:38:49,741 --> 01:38:53,009
the fans, media,
answering the phone...

1571
01:38:53,044 --> 01:38:56,146
answering knocks
on the door...

1572
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,682
driving me from places
of engagement

1573
01:38:58,717 --> 01:39:01,819
where limousines
were not provided for me.

1574
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:04,320
<i>Did you make a
gift of three bedroom sets</i>

1575
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:07,089

- No.

1576
01:39:07,123 --> 01:39:09,559
<i>Did you make a gift of lamps</i>
<i>to Scott Thorson?</i>

1577
01:39:09,593 --> 01:39:10,860
No.

1578
01:39:10,894 --> 01:39:13,396
<i>Did you make a gift</i>
<i>of a water buffalo head,</i>

1579

- No.

1580
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,734
Did you make a gift
of any furniture

1581
01:39:18,768 --> 01:39:22,537
- to Scott Thorson?
- <i>No.</i>

1582
01:39:22,572 --> 01:39:24,806
What reason do you have
for believing that

1583
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:26,941
the furniture and furnishings
you think of as gifts

1584
01:39:26,976 --> 01:39:28,744
were, in fact,
not gifts?

1585
01:39:28,778 --> 01:39:31,012
Well, this is what I do
with all my homes.

1586
01:39:31,046 --> 01:39:34,182
I furnish all my homes
for people to use.

1587
01:39:34,216 --> 01:39:36,450
But that does not mean
they can take the furniture

1588
01:39:36,485 --> 01:39:38,051
with them
when they leave.

1589
01:39:38,086 --> 01:39:40,721
It's my property.

1590
01:39:40,756 --> 01:39:43,758
Did you make a gift of any
furs to Scott Thorson?

1591
01:39:43,792 --> 01:39:46,260
- <i>Yes.</i>
- What furs?

1592
01:39:46,294 --> 01:39:51,063
<i>Uh, a raccoon,</i>
<i>a black mink trenchcoat,</i>

1593
01:39:51,098 --> 01:39:54,467
<i>a leather</i>
<i>and black mink coat...</i>

1594
01:39:54,502 --> 01:39:57,670
<i>and um, that's it.</i>

1595
01:39:57,705 --> 01:40:01,007
And what other gifts have
you made to Scott Thorson?

1596
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,809
<i>Jewelry.</i>

1597
01:40:03,677 --> 01:40:05,077
<i>What form of jewelry?</i>

1598
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:07,946
A ring with
his initial on it...

1599
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:11,784
and two Krugerrands
made up the ring.

1600
01:40:12,852 --> 01:40:15,253
Gold chains.

1601
01:40:15,288 --> 01:40:19,391
Australian opal ring.

1602
01:40:19,426 --> 01:40:21,660
Bracelets,
things like that.

1603
01:40:21,694 --> 01:40:24,896
<i>Okay, first off, you
have to understand something.</i>

1604
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:26,697
<i>You're not getting</i>
<i>any of your property back.</i>

1605
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:27,965
<i>You're not getting a dime...</i>

1606
01:40:27,999 --> 01:40:29,767
unless you sign
this agreement.

1607
01:40:29,802 --> 01:40:31,436
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1608
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:33,237
All right.

1609
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:35,406
You're going to get
$75,000 in cash,

1610
01:40:35,441 --> 01:40:37,241
three of your cars,
three dogs

1611
01:40:37,275 --> 01:40:38,675
and all
your clothes.

1612
01:40:38,709 --> 01:40:40,477
$75,000?
That's it?

1613
01:40:40,511 --> 01:40:42,345
In return for the
money, the cars,

1614
01:40:42,379 --> 01:40:44,080
the dogs and the
personal property...

1615
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:45,415
you're going to
sign over the title

1616
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:47,349
of your Las Vegas home
on Laramore to Lee.

1617
01:40:47,383 --> 01:40:49,819
And that's estimated value
right now at $200,000.

1618
01:40:49,853 --> 01:40:52,120
You're going to give over
all the <i>contents</i> to Lee,

1619
01:40:52,155 --> 01:40:54,189
estimated at $50,000.

1620
01:40:54,223 --> 01:40:56,291
In addition,
you will be required

1621
01:40:56,326 --> 01:40:59,595
to sign over the titles
of your Chevrolet van,

1622
01:40:59,629 --> 01:41:01,696
the antique Cadillac
and your Auburn

1623
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:03,364
to Mr. Liberace.

1624
01:41:03,398 --> 01:41:04,966
You will also give up
any other claims

1625
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,069
against Mr. Liberace
of any kind in the future.

1626
01:41:08,103 --> 01:41:12,306
So assault, battery,
palimony-- out.

1627
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:15,042
And you're going to sign
a clause prohibiting you

1628
01:41:15,077 --> 01:41:17,478
from revealing the true
nature of your relationship

1629
01:41:17,512 --> 01:41:18,745
to anybody,
public or private.

1630
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,080
This is the best
we could do?

1631
01:41:20,114 --> 01:41:24,585
They're shortchanging
me $250,000.

1632
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:27,153
Well, there's nothing in here
about the jewelry he gave you,

1633
01:41:27,188 --> 01:41:28,889
- so you get to keep that.
- I had to sell the jewelry!

1634
01:41:28,923 --> 01:41:33,026
- For what?
- For legal, uh, fees and other things.

1635
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:37,830
I don't care...
what the judge says,

1636
01:41:37,865 --> 01:41:39,599
we were
fucking married!

1637
01:41:39,633 --> 01:41:42,568
Well, the law says
you weren't.

1638
01:41:42,603 --> 01:41:45,805
And a contract for sex
can't be enforced.

1639
01:41:45,839 --> 01:41:49,375
Scott, listen to me.
You're a drug addict.

1640

<i>This is all</i>
<i>you're getting.</i>

1641
01:41:51,477 --> 01:41:53,344

1642
01:41:55,681 --> 01:41:57,448
You know, I called
Billy Leatherwood.

1643
01:41:57,483 --> 01:41:59,250
He got more.

1644
01:42:09,293 --> 01:42:11,261

01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,951
caused by
cardiac failure.

1706
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:57,987
His body will be
taken to Los Angeles,

1707
01:47:58,021 --> 01:48:00,456
where it will be
prepared for burial.

1708
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:02,658
In an unusual
twist of events...

1709
01:48:02,692 --> 01:48:04,526
the Riverside County
Health Department

1710
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,528
has rejected
the death certificate...

1711
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:09,531
by Liberace's attending
doctor, Ronald Daniels,

1712
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,932
and has ordered
an autopsy.

1713
01:48:10,967 --> 01:48:15,336
This request
is unseemly.

1714
01:48:15,371 --> 01:48:17,805
Mr. Liberace died
of heart failure...

1715
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:21,308
due to an anemia caused
by a watermelon diet.

1716
01:48:21,343 --> 01:48:24,545
The body has already
been embalmed!

1717
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:27,849
With respect to Liberace's
family during this time,

1718
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:31,284
we have asked that the request
for autopsy be rejected.

1719
01:48:31,318 --> 01:48:34,488
Since Mr. Liberace
has already been embalmed,

1720
01:48:34,522 --> 01:48:37,724
it was necessary
to take tissue samples.

1721
01:48:37,759 --> 01:48:39,626
Along with the medical
records of blood tests

1722
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:42,061
during his recent stay at the
Eisenhower Medical Center...

1723
01:48:42,096 --> 01:48:46,032
it is the conclusion of the Riverside
County Health Department...

1724
01:48:46,066 --> 01:48:48,734
that Mr. Liberace
died of complications

1725
01:48:48,769 --> 01:48:50,703
due to the AIDS virus.

1726
01:49:07,052 --> 01:49:08,920
<i>Thank you
all for coming.</i>

1727
01:49:08,954 --> 01:49:10,955
<i>I think that what should be</i>
<i>remembered today</i>

1728
01:49:10,989 --> 01:49:12,457
<i>is that Lee</i>
<i>was a great professional...</i>

1729
01:49:12,491 --> 01:49:14,793
<i>a great showman,</i>
<i>he loved his fans.</i>

1730
01:49:14,827 --> 01:49:17,328
<i>But we should also</i>
<i>look to the future.</i>

1731
01:49:17,362 --> 01:49:19,095
<i>As a result</i>
<i>of the scholarship program</i>

1732
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:21,532
<i>which he's established</i>
<i>through his foundation...</i>

1733
01:49:21,566 --> 01:49:23,700
many young people will have
a musical education

1734
01:49:23,735 --> 01:49:25,836
which they otherwise
could not afford.

1735
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:27,704
Thank you.

1736
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:31,642
<i>My dear
people, let us begin</i>

1737

The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ...

1742
01:49:41,084 --> 01:49:44,386
the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit

1743

be with you always.

1744
01:49:45,823 --> 01:49:47,557
And with your spirit.

1745
01:49:47,591 --> 01:49:49,525
<i>In the waters of baptism,</i>

1746
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,860
<i>Liberace</i>
<i>died with Christ</i>

1747
01:49:51,894 --> 01:49:54,128
<i>and rose within</i>
<i>to a new life.</i>

1748
01:49:54,163 --> 01:49:55,764
<i>May he now share</i>
<i>with Him</i>

1749
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:59,233
in eternal glory.

1750
01:49:59,268 --> 01:50:01,603
Let us pray.

1751
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:05,930
"To dream
the impossible dream

1752
01:51:07,065 --> 01:51:11,235
To be better far
than you are

1753
01:51:13,271 --> 01:51:18,442
<i>To try when your arms</i>
<i>are too weary</i>

1754

<i>To reach</i>
<i>that unreachable star</i>

1755
01:51:24,181 --> 01:51:26,983
This is my quest

1756
01:51:27,018 --> 01:51:30,286
To follow that star

To be willing to die

So that honor and justice
may live

1763

1764
