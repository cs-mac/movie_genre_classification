1
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:44,549
Chicken With Plums

2
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,601
<i>Yeki boud, yeki naboud.</i>

3
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,534
<i>There was someone, there was no one.</i>

4
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:14,074
<i>That is how Persian tales begin.
Yeki boud, yeki naboud.</i>

5
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,171
<i>It was fall 1958.</i>

6
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,985
<i>I was passing through Tehran.</i>

7
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,450
<i>I met a certain Nasser AH,</i>

8
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,919
<i>whose story I will tell you.</i>

9
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,568
<i>- I'll</i> take this one.
- Excellent choice, Meeter.

10
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,981
Iran?

11
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,442
Yes?

12
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,782
You don't remember me?

13
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,121
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,986
To tell the truth, not at all.

15
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,021
- You tried to cheat me again!
-l... I don't understand.

16
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,630
- The sound is lousy!
-But it was perfect for you.

17
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,198
Shut up!

18
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,300
Take this one. It's just come In.
A rare Item. Take It In exchange.

19
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,000
You pathetic crook! Give me back my money.

20
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,337
<i>After taking care of a few things,
I passed by the famous cafe Naderi.</i>

21
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,172
<i>Nasser AH was there with his brother Abdi,</i>

22
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,246
<i>an activist in the Iranian communist party,</i>

23
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,179
<i>who, as usual, was vilifying
the English and Americans.</i>

24
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,877
...and the damn Americans
and English own everything.

25
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,514
- Sir?
-A French coffee, please.

26
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,788
They think they're pumping our oil.

27
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,963
In reality, it's our blood they're sucking.

28
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,755
If I'm boring you, just say so.

29
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,059
<i>“N, no...</i>

30
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,867
- Someone broke my violin.
-Good Lord, who did that?

31
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,270
What difference does it make?

32
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,036
Did you go see Mirza? He has great violins.

33
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,248
That crook?

34
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,479
He tried to con me. All his violins are rotten.

35
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,484
Like father, like son.
They're a family of degenerates.

36
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm done for.

37
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,392
I'll never play again.

38
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,060
Wait... Last month,
I visited an old friend in Rasht.

39
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,495
You'll never guess what he had.

40
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,897
Look at this Stradivarius.

41
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:34,001
It belonged to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!

42
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,619
I'm leaving for Rasht tomorrow.

43
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,858
I'm going to get a violin.

44
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,295
Did you hear what I said?

45
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,791
I'm not deaf,

46
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,262
like your mother.

47
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,531
Leave the dead alone.

48
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,833
Whatever.

49
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,274
You're forgetting that I work all day.

50
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,370
Who'll take care of him?

51
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,177
I don't know. Ask your mother.

52
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,680
You know she's away this week.

53
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,951
You want to go to Rasht?
Well, take him with you.

54
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,416
Impossible. I can't take him with me.

55
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,255
It's not my problem. If you could at least...

56
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,296
If I what? If my husband worked...

57
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,626
I could oily homo and look after my son.
Like a true lady!

58
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,634
Besides, it's your fault.

59
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,825
It always is.

60
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,471
- Of course it's your fault!
-You get on my nerves!

61
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,969
- Bitch!
-Bastard!

62
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,507
I'll go alone, do you hear? Alone!

63
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,542
<i>He': squabbly
They tell me he': a donkey</i>

64
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,376
<i>A: for mo, u for me
I can see that he': a hone</i>

65
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,848
<i>With a mane that shines like gloss</i>

66
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,545
He gaff ops, he gaff ops
<i>On</i> his <i>back</i>

67
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,247
<i>He's sniggery, he's squabbly</i>

68
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,654
<i>They tell me he's a donkey</i>

69
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,027
<i>As for me, as for me
I can see that he's...</i>

70
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,159
<i>On his back</i>

71
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,768
<i>I can't sleep</i>

72
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,938
<i>As for you
As for you</i>

73
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,541
<i>Little horse that I adore</i>

74
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,573
<i>just love you more and more</i>

75
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,179
<i>On your back, Heel great</i>

76
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,111
<i>won't sleep, tho' it be late</i>

77
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,545
Goodbye, friends! Goodbye!

78
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,408
Excuse me, could you tell me
where to find Mr. Houshang?

79
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,707
Yes, carry straight on,

80
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,085
then turn left,

81
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,310
right,

82
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,946
and right again.

83
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,947
Thank you.

84
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,963
Shit!

85
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,171
What are you doing? Come along.

86
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,489
Hello?

87
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,592
Anybody there?

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,326
Mr. Houshang?

89
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,266
Who's asking?

90
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,270
It's Nasser Ali Khan, Abdi's brother.

91
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,008
I've been expecting you!

92
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,673
- Hello, sir.
-No, not 'sir'!

93
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,548
Houshang. Call me Houshang.

94
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,343
Welcome to my modest store.

95
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,154
I adore you, I revere you, I love you!

96
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,717
It's love, it's love...

97
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,384
Are you the one with a Stradivarius for sale?

98
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,186
Among other things-.

99
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,164
- Cigarette?
-No, thank you. Not right now.

100
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,398
I also deal in precious gems.

101
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,306
Take that off!

102
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,041
Look at this.

103
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,750
The biggest diamond in the world.

104
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,687
Fabulous, isn't it?

105
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,986
As you see, I have all sorts
of things in my shop.

106
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:47,931
Saffron,

107
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
opium,

108
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,831
fur coats,

109
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,736
and even

110
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,436
magic wands.

111
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,544
- Another cup of tn, my friend?
-No, thank you.

112
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,923
- Dad, when do we got on the bus?
-We'll take the bus...

113
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,627
I've come a very long way to see this violin.

114
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,554
Dad, I'm thirsty!

115
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,961
Pray do not be offended by my impatience,
but would it be possible to see it?

116
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,364
Of course, my friend.

117
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,893
- Dad, I'm thirsty!
-You'll drink...

118
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,301
But taste this opium first.

119
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,542
Relax.

120
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,736
To relax. God knows I need to.

121
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,415
The child sang non-stop the entire journey.

122
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,978
I have something to calm him down.

123
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,787
In a little milk, this should do the trick.

124
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,486
It': what my grandmother gave me
when I got too excited.

125
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,706
Here is

126
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,779
the marvel of marvels.

127
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,051
I remember the first time I heard you play-.

128
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,686
I had never heard anything so beautiful.
Truly, It was...

129
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,860
Just thinking about it
makes me want to weep.

130
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,832
See these tears flowing? Just there.

131
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,536
Yes, I see you're crying.

132
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,350
I will not sell you this priceless marvel...

133
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,986
I will give it to you!

134
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,544
For 1,000 Toumans.

135
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,249
1,000!

136
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,325
I paid 1,049 for it myself.

137
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,255
That's 49 Toumans out of my own pocket.

138
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,890
And why do I do that?

139
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,333
Because you are my friend.
Because you are you...

140
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,396
I only have 700.

141
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,874
700 Toumans. It's a deal.

142
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,870
That'll do fine.

143
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,639
What would I not do
for the master of masters!

144
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,681
Let us celebrate, my friend.

145
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,401
<i>”My coming brought no prophet to the sky.</i>

146
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,913
<i>”Nor does my going swell its majesty.</i>

147
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,646
<i>'Coming and going put me to a stand.</i>

148
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:56,445
"Ear never <i>heard</i> their wherefore,

149
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,451
<i>"nor their why."</i>

150
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,951
<i>They arrived home the next night.</i>

151
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,394
<i>Nasser Ali had but one desire,
to play his new violin.</i>

152
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,069
<i>But he preferred to wait until morning.</i>

153
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,269
<i>He got up at 7:00 on the dot.</i>

154
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,939
<i>He went to the barber's.</i>

155
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,841
There you go, sir.

156
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,087
<i>Then went back home
and put on his best suit.</i>

157
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,520
Looks like you've got an appointment
with the Prime Minister himself!

158
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,857
<i>When his wife and daughter left,
he had but one more matter to settle.</i>

159
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,767
Hello, Cyrus.

160
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,344
Do you have opium?

161
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,973
<i>Since no violin would ever again
give him the pleasure of playing,</i>

162
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,166
<i>Nasser AH decided to die.</i>

163
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,950
<i>Eight days later, on November 22nd,
he was buried beside his mother.</i>

164
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,018
<i>That day, a}! those
who had loved him Imam present.</i>

165
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,859
THE FIRST DAY

166
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,499
<i>So, Nasser AH had decided to die.</i>

167
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,199
<i>He thought of various my:
to put an and to his days.</i>

168
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,110
<i>First, he considered
a somewhat drastic method.</i>

169
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,717
<i>Then he contemplated a romantic approach.</i>

170
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,332
<i>Why not something more classical?</i>

171
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,250
<i>All in all, these solutions were too painful.</i>

172
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,585
<i>Then he remembered an article
in a scientific journal,</i>

173
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,420
<i>maintaining that the least painful way
of departing this life</i>

174
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,692
<i>was to take barbiturates
then slip a plastic bag over one's head.</i>

175
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,343
<i>But the idea of being found
with an ugly plastic bag on his head</i>

176
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,681
<i>was simply out of the question.</i>

177
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,248
<i>He was Nasser Ali Khan after all,
best violinist of his time.</i>

178
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,789
<i>How would he be remembered?
”The man with the plastic bag”?</i>

179
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,197
<i>No, no, no.</i>

180
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,297
<i>He would die with dignity.</i>

181
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,303
<i>He would wait for death
to come and claim him in his bed.</i>

182
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,881
- Mom, can I go on the swing?
-When you've finished your homework.

183
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,716
Cyrus?

184
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,513
Nasser Ali?

185
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,256
- What are you doing In bed at this hour?
-I've decided to die.

186
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,562
- And where's Cyrus?
-I left him at the neighbor's.

187
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,569
Again! Is it too much to ask
that you take care of your son?

188
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,973
I'm going for your brother.
Do your homework.

189
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,411
Dad?

190
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,558
It's you, my daughter.

191
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,857
What's wrong? Are you sick?

192
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,220
No.

193
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,296
I'm just a little tired.

194
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,772
How was your day?

195
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,533
I got A- for my dictation.

196
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,507
Well done!

197
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,603
Mom isn't happy-

198
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,116
She says it's not good enough.

199
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,118
She says there's a pupil In her class
who always gets A+.

200
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,955
Your mother talks too much.

201
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,055
She says I have to work hard,

202
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,753
that If I want to be a doctor,
I have to got A+, too.

203
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,458
For sure...

204
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,126
Can I go on the swing now?

205
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,299
Yes, go ahead.

206
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,831
Thanks, Dad.

207
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,085
- Who are you?
-What a question!

208
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,363
<i>Nasser Ali wasn't exactly a born father.</i>

209
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,661
<i>Still, he did his best to play his role.</i>

210
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,735
I ate him with my big mouth
and my pointy teeth!

211
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,103
- Why?
-Because that was his destiny.

212
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,744
Dad? Can I have a doll that talks?

213
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,510
- They n'! talk, sweetie.
-Yes, they n.

214
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,016
Come here, I'll show you.

215
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,515
Mr. Ashour, I will eat you, too.

216
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,526
See, they're just rag dolls.

217
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,261
Well, children, what should I do?

218
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,058
Eat him! Eat him!

219
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,039
Would you like to go on the merry-go-round?

220
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,238
No.

221
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,918
Would you like some cotton candy?

222
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,109
No.

223
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,411
Would you like to play on that?

224
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,213
No.

225
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,921
Well, what do you want?

226
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,430
<i>Possessed by en unusual Interest

THE SECOND DAY

250
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,572
Hello.

251
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,140
Faranguisse?

252
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,486
Really? Since when?

253
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,922
Very well, stay where you are.
I'll come to see him.

254
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,285
Yes, okay.

255
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,155
I must go and see my brother.

256
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,595
- What's going on? I: It serious?
-I don't know.

257
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,731
He hasn't left his room for two days.

258
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,598
- What did Faranguisse sly?
-Nothing.

259
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,904
I guess they quarreled as usual
and now he's sulking.

260
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,102
What can I say? The woman's an idiot.

261
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,440
Don't say that.

262
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,176
It can't be easy to live with a man
who puts his music first.

263
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,981
Maybe so, but that doesn't
make her any brighter.

264
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,487
She's an idiot! She's nasty!
She's a rabid dog!

265
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,252
The woman's nerve-racking!

266
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,286
Whose fault is that?

267
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,660
He would never have married her
if your mother hadn't forced him.

268
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,496
Everyone knew he wasn't in love
with poor Faranguisse.

269
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,672
This woman is Genghis Khan!

270
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,939
In any case,

271
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,435
I was against that marriage.

272
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,971
He deserved better.

273

<i>The brothers appreciated each other,
but they'd never had anything in common.</i>

275
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,422
<i>Abdi was conscientious and serious,</i>

276
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,028
<i>Nasser Ali was rebellious and irresponsible.</i>

277
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,895
<i>Abdi was his parents' pride and joy,
Nasser Ali was a source of distress.</i>

278
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,733
Now what have you done?

279
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,238
Nothing, sir.

280
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,271
Look at this fool, this bad seed.

281
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,746
He re-did his year, his marks were so poor.

282
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,283
Unacceptable behavior!

283
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:49,225
Yes! Mr- Nasser Ali's only response
was to break a school window-.

284
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,722
It wasn't me!

285
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,086
Quiet!

286
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,757
Abdi, come here.

287
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,724
Come closer, my child.

288
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,462
Look...

289
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,734
Here is Abdi, his little brother.

290
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,438
Same family, same education.

291
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,243
Except that he is first in all subjects.

292
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,612
See?

293
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,410
Bad seed,

294
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,947
good seed.

295
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,183
Good seed,

296
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,652
bad seed.

297
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,616
I ask you to applaud Abdi.

298
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,421
Come, children!

299
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,788
That's enough!

300
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,922
Now,

301
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,795
you will boo Nasser Ali-.

302
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,135
Louder!

303
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,351
Nasser Ali?

304
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,996
It's me. Abdi.

305
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,694
Can I come in?

306
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,667
I was just passing by and I thought,
'I'll go see my brother.'

307
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,168
Well, you see me now.

308
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,016
What's going on, Nasser Ali?

309
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,576
Nothing.

310
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,715
I've decided to die.

311
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,529
On my way here,

312
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,329
I saw there's a new film on at the Persepolis.

313
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,000
Guess who's in it?

314
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,670
Look.

315
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,275
Well?

316
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,511
Greta Garbo?

317
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:50,935
No!

318
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,521
Sophia Loren?

319
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,625
Remember how beautiful she was
in that film in Naples?

320
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,568
How about we go see the movie together?

321
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,065
No, Abdi. I told you, I want to die.

322
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,871
Your wife called ma.
She's very worried, you know.

323
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,146
I suspected you didn't just come like that.

324
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,444
Whatever.

325
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,278
What difference does it make?

326
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,551
You're not well, so I came. I'm your brother.

327
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:40,493
You can't just Ila In bed waiting to die!
It's ridiculous!

328
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,565
I understand you're depressed
about your violin, but you have a wife

329
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,133
end two children
You're responsible for them.

330
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,629
How can you be so selfish!

331
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,128
Selfish?

332
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,732
You're a fine one to talk.

333
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,104
What about your wife,
your children, your family?

334
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,747
Did you think about them when
you became a revolutionary communist?

335
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,948
Did you think what they went through
while you were in prison?

336
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,817
You were the righter of wrongs,
the one who dared to say "No"!

337
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,320
You wanted to change the world,
and devil take the hindmost!

338
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,426
Someone had to react.
If everyone were like you...

339
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:15,120
So what if they were?
Would things really be worse?

340
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,096
What have you changed?

341
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,428
Are things any better today?

342
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,171
And let me remind you of one thing.
When you were playing the hero,

343
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,470
Mom had to squander the family fortune
to got you out of prison.

344
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,978
So you n fluff your high morals
you know whore!

345
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,054
Forgive me, Abdi.

346
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,518
It's okay.

347
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:46,988
Abdi,

348
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,792
when I die,

349
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,224
promise you'll take care of my children.

350
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,526
Stop it.

351
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,828
Don't talk nonsense.

352
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:05,841
I promise.

353
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,571
<i>At dusk on the second day,</i>

354
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,139
<i>Nasser Ali remembered what pleasure was.</i>

355
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,309
<i>For that one night,
his bitterness disappeared.</i>

356
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,614
<i>He slept peacefully.</i>

357
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,777
THE THIRD DAY

358
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,607
<i>The third day,</i>

359
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,316
<i>Nasser Ali was overwhelmed by boredom.</i>

360
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,689
<i>It is common knowledge that boredom
is the best fertilizer</i>

361
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,383
<i>for absurd thoughts.</i>

362
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,289
<i>Between two cigarettes, he wondered</i>

363
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,660
<i>how he would be remembered,
what his legacy would be, etc, etc...</i>

364
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,734
<i>He thought of Socrates who,
apart from his philosophical genius,</i>

365
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:45,874
<i>had managed to</i> leave <i>this world
with elegance and style.</i>

366
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,045
Socrates!

367
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,744
Why did you drink this poison?

368
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,386
Don't leave us!

369
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,415
It matters not!

370
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,491
For beyond this fleshly coil,

371
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,160
my thought will live on.

372
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,562
By my death, it will become eternal.

373
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:21,403
<i>Nasser Ali decided to summon his children
to impart to them his final thoughts.</i>

374
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,711
Children?

375
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,074
Children!

376
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,607
Children!

377
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,587
Children, I know I have often been absent.

378
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,526
Now my hour has come.

379
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,763
I must depart.

380
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,125
Soon, we will be separated.

381
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,764
It is my duty as a father to bequeath to you

382
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,402
a precious treasure
that will serve you throughout your life

383
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,240
and guide you through
the darkness of existence.

384
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,781
This treasure

385
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,644
is the very essence of creation

386
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,047
for it is through art that we understand life

387
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,648
and it is through life...

388
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,021
<i>It matters not!</i>

389
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,831
For beyond this fleshly coil,

390
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,728
my thought will live on.

391
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,668
By my death...

392
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,014
<i>Nasser Ali thought how insignificant we are
and that Socrates had had a narrow escape.</i>

393
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,912
Give me a hug.

394
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,609
No! You stink.

395
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,752
<i>Anyway, what did he expect
from a son like that?</i>

396
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,159
He was the polar opposite of his father,
noisy, chatty, greedy,

397
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,024
<i>and, horror, when asked what he wanted
to be when he grew up, he answered...</i>

398
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,497
I want to be a grocer!

399
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,431
What will become of him?

400
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,035
<i>No surprises there.</i>

401
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,869
<i>At 22, after his difficult school years,</i>

402
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,477
<i>Cyrus finally entered university
to do business studies.</i>

403
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,942
<i>Suddenly,</i>

404
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,712
<i>the revolution erupted.</i>

405
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,111
<i>A year later, war broke out.</i>

406
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,020
<i>Like man y others,
Cyrus decided to leave for the States.</i>

407
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,152
<i>He managed to enroll
In e mediocre university In Wyoming.</i>

408
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,362
<i>It we: on the university campus
that he met Nancy.</i>

409
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,574
<i>They kissed,</i>

410
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,735
<i>she got pregnant,</i>

411
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,241
<i>and they married.</i>

412
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,442
A baby?

413
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,418
Yes, a baby.

414
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,284
Haw come your niece
didn't realize she was pregnant?

415
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,819
Try to spot a 9-pounds baby
in 400 pounds of meat.

416
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,791
You'll see it's not easy.

417
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,932
What's more, for his middle name,
they chose 'Nasser.'

418
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,527
"Jimmy-Nasser"! Can you believe it!

419
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,499
Luckily my father was long dead,

420
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,200
otherwise he'd have burst a blood vessel...

421
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,007
Or two...

422
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,381
THE FOURTH DAY

423
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:22,476
<i>On the evening of the fourth day,
Faranguisse was in despair.</i>

424
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,408
<i>Hoping for a possible reconciliation,</i>

425
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,640
<i>she decided to prepare e nice dish
oi chicken with plums,</i>

426
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,584
<i>Nasser Ali's favorite.</i>

427
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,483
<i>Naively, she thought she could
get to his heart through his stomach.</i>

428
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,354
<i>The only time she sew her husband happy
wee at mealtimes.</i>

429
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:41,587
<i>He sometimes even had a kind word for her.</i>

430
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,259
That's the beet chicken with plume
I've ever eaten.

431
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:52,465
<i>It must be said that despite appearances,
Faranguisse still loved Nasser Ali.</i>

432
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,907
<i>Few knew it, but she had
secretly loved him since childhood.</i>

433
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,582
<i>When he went away for years,
to the four corners of the world,</i>

434
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,585
<i>she patiently awaited his return.</i>

435
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,525
<i>She put all her energy into her studies</i>

436
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,787
<i>and refused the few marriage
proposals she received.</i>

437
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,697
Nasser All ls back.
Nasser All?

438
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,338
Nasser Ali is back.

439
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,206
<i>She had a long wait,</i>

440
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,774
but before she became <i>an</i> old <i>maid,</i>

441
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,774
<i>Nasser AH returned to Tehran.</i>

442
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,675
Nasser Ali is back.

443
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,543
Faranguisse, Faranguisse...

444
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,614
Nasser Ali is back.

445
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,848
<i>At the time, she was 30,</i>

446
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,525
<i>he was 414.</i>

447
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,330
Hello, Faranguisse.

448
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,744
NasserAli, did you know
that Faranguisse is a math teacher?

449
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:21,723
It's wonderful. In my opinion,
this country needs women like you.

450
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,585
Modern women.

451
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,519
Nasser Ali, have a cake.

452
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,663
Faranguisse brought them.

453
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,425
What delicious cakes!

454
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,695
- Don't they look good?
-Yes, very good.

455
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:40,239
Faranguisse, It seems you graduated
top In your year?

456
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,274
She was first in her class!

457
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,103
No, second.

458
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,440
- Now you're teacher?
-Yes.

459
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,880
That's fantastic.

460
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,918
She's intelligent, serious,
she has character...

461
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,850
Her head's screwed on right.

462
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,614
Very tightly screwed!

463
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,694
I'll prepare some watermelon.

464
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,891
Nasser Ali, would you give me a hand?

465
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,995
But, Mom, that': not the point.
I don't love this girl.

466
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,573
I think this girl, as you say, is very nice.

467
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,435
She's cute, kind, educated.

468
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,311
- And single!
-What are you doing here?

469
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,109
Nothing. I've left the women
to chat among themselves.

470
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,915
Listen, my son.

471
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,917
You're 41, you've been all over the world.

472
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,819
Surely you don't want to end up a bachelor?

473
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,124
Mom, you're not listening. I don't love her.

474
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,095
And for good reason!

475
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,600
It doesn't matter.

476
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,705
Marry first and love will come with time.

477
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,032
<i>And marry they did.</i>

478
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,161
<i>But love never came.</i>

479
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,567
NasserAli,

480
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,370
it's me.

481
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,573
I've made chicken with plums,

482
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,417
your favorite dish.

483
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,855
You must be starving, darling.

484
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,824
You haven't eaten for three days.

485
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,261
- Would you like mo to...
-No, I'm not hungry.

486
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,864
I'll put it here. If you change your mind...

487
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,169
You don't understand.

488
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,840
I've lost the taste,

489
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,679
the joy, the savor.

490
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,078
All by your fault.

491
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,278
I asked you to do one thing,

492
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,080
take your son to the doctor's
and you can't even do it!

493
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,261
Good God! I'm sick of having
to take care of everything.

494
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,455
I wash, I Iron, I cook.
On top of It all, I have to work.

495
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,261
You're tho man.
You should support your family.

496
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:25,306
You're such e pain In the us.
You married e musician, not e laborer.

497
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,933
You knew I was an artist
when you married me.

498
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,768
An artist! Big deal!

499
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,642
You couldn't even hold down
that job at the conservatory.

500
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,808
How small-minded you can be,
you shitty little teacher.

501
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,507
I will never forgive you.

502
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,938
I will never forgive you.

503
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,180
Forgive me, my love.

504
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,347
You know how much I love you.

505
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,588
NasserAli, I beg you,

506
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,584
tell me you love me, too.

507
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,923
Don't let a simple violin destroy our life.

508
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,993
What are you talking about?

509
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,262
I've never loved you, Faranguisse.

510
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,768
Never. Get that into your little head.

511
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,064
Never!

512
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,948
You're a monster.

513
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,475
I hate you.

514
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,651
<i>Let us go back to Nasser Ali's youth.</i>

515
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,552
<i>Since childhood, he excelled
in one discipline, music.</i>

516
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,664
<i>When he was 21, his mother resigned
herself to sending him to Shiraz,</i>

517
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:34,996
<i>to study violin with the greatest
master of the day, Agha Mozaffar.</i>

518
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,441
<i>Sometimes, Nasser Ali
was confused by his master,</i>

519
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,509
<i>who seemed to hold
some awfully obscure views.</i>

520
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,615
I have nothing to sly
about your technique, it I: excellent.

521
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,190
But your music is total shit!

522
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,187
But, Master...

523
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:02,924
Any fool can acquire technique.

524
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,357
It's not about technique.

525
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,224
It's about art.

526
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,903
For it is through art that we understand life.

527
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,944
The instrument is simply there
to make the light burst forth.

528
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,811
Your fingers move.

529
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,817
Sounds come out.

530
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,723
But it is empty.

531
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,247
It is barren.

532
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,154
It is nothing!

533
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,928
Life is a breath,

534
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,930
life is a sigh.

535
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,665
It is this sigh that you must seize.

536
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,258
Dad, I absolutely must have a new dress.

537
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,062
Iran, I gave you one last week.

538
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,696
Dad, this is different.
It's for Malak's birthday.

539
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,899
I must have a real evening dress.
What will people think?

540
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,532
All right... Just this once.

541
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,741
Thank you, Daddy darling!

542
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,376
See you later.

543
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,904
Well done, sir!

544
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,271
Excellent choice.

545
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:08,981
Top quality Swiss.

546
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,551
Solid gold face,
Insanely accurate mechanics,

547
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,781
chimes of crystal purity.

548
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,085
All for the paltry sum of 100 Toumans.

549
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,120
Yes, it's perfect.

550
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,161
Lovely purchase, sir.

551
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,092
I'll wrap it for you.

552
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,829
<i>Nasser Ali's fate was in the balance.</i>

553
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,670
<i>He could no longer live
without seeing again the beautiful...</i>

554
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,828
I have just come to tell you it works perfectly-.

555
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:07,868
Miss!

556
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,093
Iran!

557
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,402
Do we know each other?

558
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,766
Yes.

559
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,100
No.

560
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,840
I saw you In your father's shop.
I wanted to ask you...

561
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,048
You wanted to ask me...

562
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,263
THE FIFTH DAY

563
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,558
<i>At dawn on the fifth day, Nasser Ali
felt that death was drawing close.</i>

564
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,434
<i>He thought he would soon be joining
those who had departed before him.</i>

565
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,901
<i>He remembered his mother</i>

566
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,501
<i>and the days before her death.</i>

567
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,004
Is that you?

568
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,649
Are you all right, Mom?

569
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,012
No!

570
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,850
I'm angry, very angry.

571
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,657
Hush, bad boy!

572
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,456
You think only of yourself.

573
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,197
I'm in terrible pain.

574
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,194
My hour has come, my child.

575
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,497
And what do you do?

576
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,975
You pray and pray.

577
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,345
Your prayers are stopping me from dying.

578
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,610
I know you love me

579
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,819
and you want to keep me by your side.

580
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,782
But I repeat,

581
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,359
living has become unbearable to me.

582
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,299
Stop calling on the good Lord.

583
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:19,796
Right now.

584
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,964
Understood?

585
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,303
Light me a cigarette.

586
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,168
I'm not sure that in your state...

587
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,535
In the state I'm in,

588
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,672
cigarettes are all that can comfort me.

589
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,247
You know,

590
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,684
as I have often said,

591
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,722
smoke is the food of the soul.

592
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,197
In any case, I have seen him...

593
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:29,626
Who?

594
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,466
<i>Hand,</i>

595
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,966
the Angel of Death.

596
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,042
Yes, of course.

597
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,372
NasserAli?

598
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,984
Go into the garden,

599
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,746
play for me.

600
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,318
Your music is so beautiful.

601
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,329
<i>The day of Parvine's funeral,
a strange phenomenon occurred.</i>

602
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,529
<i>Just after she was buried,</i>

603
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:16,176
<i>a thick cloud of smoke
formed above her grave.</i>

604
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,345
<i>Naturally, everyone
had their own explanation.</i>

605
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,047
That's all the cigarettes she's smoked.

606
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,376
Three packs a day! Imagine!

607
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,352
For sure, with all that she took in!

608
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,719
That's not it. I'm a surveyor.

609
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,917
The ground here is calcareous,

610
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,028
which favors condensation.

611
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,362
Yes, of course.

612
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,133
What a bunch of fools!

613
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,940
This smoke simply proves
that the soul exists.

614
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:55,513
Your mother's soul was so thick,

615
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,816
so intense,

616
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,478
that it is materializing before our very eyes.

617
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,452
Of course, that must be it.

618
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,190
You don't believe me.

619
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,658
Well, you should.

620
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,859
You think I'm crazy.

621
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,939
But I know many things about you.

622
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,108
Really?

623
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,277
I know you were born on March 10th, 1908-.

624
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,976
Yes, it's true.

625
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,012
I also know that you lost your father
at the age of 12.

626
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,788
I know that at 21,
you loft to study muslc In Shiraz.

627
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,327
Shiraz...

628
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,656
And that there,

629
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,027
your heart was broken.

630
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,701
You think about her all the time.

631
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:55,901
Don't you?

632
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,114
You see?

633
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,679
You doubt.

634
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,150
You were so shattered
that your heart turned to stone.

635
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,985
You no longer let the breath of life enter you.

636
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:16,488
Mistake!

637
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,824
You have renounced life.

638
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,397
There I: nothing worse then
giving up on life!

639
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,035
Nothing!

640
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,004
You know what Hafez says,

641
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:36,609
"I batter the wheel of heaven
when it rolls not rightly by.

642
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,178
"I am not one of the snivelers

643
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,546
"who fall thereon and die."

644
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,941
You were right to flop preying
for your mother.

645
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:06,806
Her time had come.

646
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,885
<i>Nasser AH had a hunch.</i>

647
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,560
<i>For five days he'd been calling
Death with all his heart,</i>

648
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:22,161
<i>but it seemed to scorn him.</i>

649
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,561
<i>He wondered if someone
was praying for him.</i>

650
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,334
<i>Yes, Nasser AH,</i>

651
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,804
<i>someone is praying for you.</i>

652
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,462
THE SIXTH DAY

653
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,168
<i>In the course of the sixth day,</i>

654
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:44,507
<i>I, Azrael, Angel of Death
finally went to meet Nasser All.</i>

655
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,348
Hello, Nasser Ali. Awake at last.

656
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:19,836
All right!

657
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,344
You win, I surrender.

658
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:26,409
My children, forgive me!
Faranguisse, everyone! Lord!

659
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,586
I ask your forgiveness!

660
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,250
Go on,

661
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,252
let's get it over with! Do what you must.

662
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,524
I am ready.

663
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,698
For Heaven's sake, calm down.

664
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,709
You'll hurt yourself.

665
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,970
Come and sit down, buddy.

666
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,581
Come on!

667
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:01,980
Cigarette?

668
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,725
Is this it?

669
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,304
My time has come?

670
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,329
Not exactly, no.

671
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,875
- Well, not right away.
-What do you mean?

672
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:24,968
Why are you here, then?

673
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,244
I just wanted to meet you.

674
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,747
You've been calling me night and day
for almost a week,

675
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,442
so I came to see you.

676
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,918
I was sure that whoever saw you
dropped dead instantly.

677
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,484
Still here?

678
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:08,317
What you say only holds
for those who die a natural death.

679
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,449
Technically speaking,
things are different for suicides.

680
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,489
That's interesting.

681
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,657
Actually, there ere no herd end feet rules.
There ere exceptions.

682
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,462
As you can Imagine,
I sometimes meat people by chance.

683
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,059
By chance.

684
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,532
I have some time to kill,
so I'll tell you a story.

685
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:49,894
<i>A long time ago, I was ordered
to take the life of a certain Mr. Ashour</i>

686
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,895
<i>at the Taj Mahal, in India.</i>

687
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,025
<i>Well, the day before, I ran into him
by chance in the market in Jerusalem.</i>

688
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,332
- How much are the tomatoes?
-100 dinars.

689
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,772
- Too expensive.
-50 dinars?

690
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:02,899
<i>An.
an.</i>

691
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:03,977
2 dinars-.

692
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,875
Mr. Ashour! What are you doing here?

693
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,675
<i>The fellow was so scared,
he ran away screaming.</i>

694
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:14,343
<i>He rushed into Solomon's palace
and urgently asked to see him.</i>

695
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,445
Solomon!

696
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,256
Solomon, my King!

697
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,454
What can I do for you, Mr. Ashour?

698
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,259
I've just met Azrael, the Angel of Death.

699
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:29,095
He shot me a terrifying look.
He wants to take me!

700
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,764
I'm going to die!

701
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,566
I must leave Jerusalem. Now! Immediately!

702
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,570
But where would you go?

703
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,403
You know that no one escapee
the Angel of Death.

704
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,214
I don't know. As far away as possible.

705
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,752
To India! To India!

706
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,656
If such is your desire.

707
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:58,988
<i>So Solomon asked the wind
to carry Mr. Ashour where he wanted to go,</i>

708
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,134
<i>to the Taj Mahal, in India.</i>

709
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,975
There you are, Mr. Ashour, just in time.

710
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,184
Azrael... Just one question.
Then you can go ahead...

711
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:20,676
I promise!

712
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,753
Very well, Mr. Ashour, I'm listening.

713
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,583
If you were to take my life today,

714
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,351
why did you look at me so angrily yesterday?

715
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,788
You're mistaken, my friend, l wasn’t angry.

716
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,956
Today I must deal the final blow,
here in lndla,

717
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,160
and yesterday, I ran Into you In Jerusalem.
Understand my surprise.

718
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,872
I wondered how you would
travel so far in just one day.

719
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,471
I see.

720
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,213
And he died?

721
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,343
Yes, his hour had come.

722
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,353
And when will mine?

723
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,114
I don't know. I don't make the decisions.

724
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,185
Azrael?

725
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,496
Is it a little late to change my mind?

726
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,460
It is not a little late, dear friend.

727
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,533
It's too late...

728
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,234
"Whoever

729
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,639
"returned of all that went before

730
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,807
"to tell of that long road they travel over.

731
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:26,447
"Leave naught undone
of what you have to do

732
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,314
'for when you go,

733
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,320
"you will return no more."

734
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,353
It's a pity, Nasser Ali.

735
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,057
You only had this life.

736
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,428
He's not well at all.

737
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,433
THE SEVENTH DAY

738
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,235
It'll be fine, Faranguisse.

739
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,201
NasserAli?

740
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,181
He's feverish.

741
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,123
Well?

742
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,530
I've given him a shot, but In his state,
It can only be temporary.

743
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,937
Is there nothing more to be done?

744
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:24,374
You know, sir,
when person decides to die...

745
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,308
Do you think Dad's going to die?

746
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,671
Yes.

747
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,382
All this is my fault.

748
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,494
Forgive me.

749
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,566
Miss!

750
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,903
Iran!

751
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:02,777
Do we know each other?

752
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:06,143
THE EIGHTH DAY

753
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,249
I saw you in your father's shop

754
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,681
and I wanted to ask you...

755
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,625
You wanted to ask me...

756
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,930
May I accompany you?

757
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,632
I mean, may I walk with you?

758
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,432
Iran,

759
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,597
will you marry me?

760
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,007
Of course, my love.

761
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,532
It is my heart's deepest desire.

762
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,108
Tomorrow I will go to see your father.

763
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,941
Nasser Ali, I am so happy!

764
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,818
This is the most beautiful day of my life.

765
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:52,668
Dad!

766
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,441
Iran, please leave us alone.

767
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,671
But, Dad...

768
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,250
Go, please!

769
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:11,394
How dare you ask me
for my daughter's hand?

770
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,594
But, sir...

771
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,360
I wasn't born yesterday. I know passion.

772
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,535
It comes as fast as it goes!

773
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,106
The reality of life is very different.

774
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,040
You're e musician, for goodness' sake.
You have no money.

775
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,909
How will you support my daughter?
Have you thought of that?

776
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,341
I will work. I will earn money.

777
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,843
How? Doing what?

778
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,419
Since when has any musician
earned a decent living, eh?

779
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,182
But, sir, I love her.

780
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,688
So prove it.

781
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,853
Walk out of her life!

782
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,594
Don't ruin her future!

783
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,528
You are still young.

784
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,406
With time you will forget her,

785
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:55,908
and she will forget you.

786
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:04,109
I can promise you one thing, sir,

787
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:07,483
and that is, I will never forget your daughter.

788
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,225
Dad!

789
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,133
How can you do this to me?

790
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,229
I love him!

791
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:50,719
Iran!

792
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,860
You are here. You came.

793
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,295
I came to say goodbye, my love.

794
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,606
I came to see you one last time.

795
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:05,670
Iran...

796
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,872
Don't make it harder than it already is.

797
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,715
I cannot do this to my father.

798
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,052
It would kill him.

799
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,574
Now you are a great musician.

800
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,804
At last,

801
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,444
you have managed to seize the sigh.

802
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,415
Her father doesn't want me to marry her.

803
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,985
I'll never see her again.

804
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,485
What a fool!

805
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:03,989
Come with me.

806
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,611
This violin belonged to my master.

807
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,342
He gave it to me.

808
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,277
Now it is yours.

809
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,589
You see, my child,

810
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:33,919
from now on,

811
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,529
the love you have lost
will be in each note you play.

812
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,631
She will be your breath and your sigh.

813
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,263
This love is precious

814
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,340
because it is eternal.

815
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,007
I know what I'm talking about.

816
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,218
Go forth, now.

817
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,512
I have nothing more to teach you.

818
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:15,529
<i>For Nasser All it Ives the start
of e 20-year journey ell over the world.</i>

819
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:19,035
<i>As his master had predicted,
every time he played,</i>

820
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:20,865
<i>Iran was present</i>

821
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,839
<i>in each note, each chord.</i>

822
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,606
Iran?

823
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,187
You don't remember me?

824
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:45,362
I'm sorry.

825
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:47,325
To tell the truth,

826
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,358
not at all.

827
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,705
Grandma!

828
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,171
Come on, let's go. I'm tired.

829
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:57,809
Yes, we're going, my dear.

830
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:04,849
I beg your pardon. I must be mistaken.

831
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,885
No harm done, sir.

832
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,412
Goodbye.

833
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,290
Nasser Ali!

834
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,029
My love!

835
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,206
Iran...
