1
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,315
Shuttlesworth!
Shuttlesworth!

2
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,745
-What's up, bro?
-Game's over. Warden wants to see you.

3
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,415
The warden?
What's this all about?

4
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,084
Don't know nothin'.
Don't wanna know nothin'.

5
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,045
He tells me to get you,
so I get you.

6
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,106
Thank you, Books.
You may wait outside.

7
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,321
Jake, please sit down.
Sit down.

8
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,410
I was told you were
on the court.

9
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,163
Yes, sir.
I try to stay fit, trim.

10
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,625
You know, everything like that.
Keep my mind occupied.

11
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,545
As you already know, you've picked
the perfect recreation.

12
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,131
Dr. James Naismith
knew what he was doin'.

13
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,927
-It's a great game, isn't it?
-Basketball, yes.

14
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,180
-You played some?
-Uh, yes, sir, when I was younger.

15
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,766
-You know, I put in a little work.
-I coach my son's team.

16
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,851
I ran a neighborhood center.

17
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,395
Let's go. Show me that.
Oh, good!

18
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,565
That's good, but you crossed over.
You still bailed out.

19
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,151
-You coached?
-Nah, nothing like that there.

20
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,696
You know, I see somebody out there,
a little kid who needs some help.

21
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,074
I work with him,
give him a few tips.

22
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,575
-Which hand did you shoot with?
-Right.

23
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,868
-Which hand are you
supposed to be shooting with?
-Left.

24
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,412
But nowadays, uh,
Warden, they--

25
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,415
these kids ain't gonna listen
to nothin' you say, you know.

26
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,417
They think they know it all.

27
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,920
All they wanna do is dunk and--
you know, everything like that.

28
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,006
Their fundamentals is, uh--
is, like, sorely lacking.

29
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,259
That's strange.
I haven't had that problem yet.

30
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,386
Yeah, well, you--


31
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,555
The kids are smart.

32
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,016
They know they don't listen to you,
they end up in here with me.

33
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,270
I never thought about it like that.

34
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,106
Did you vote for Governor Pernell?

35
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,108
Uh, nah, I ain't never voted.

36
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,653
No matter. What does matter
is Governor is a big,

37
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,823
huge, fanatical
basketball fan.

38
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,201
He played himself--
four years, varsity, at Big State.

39
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,329
Good, not great athlete.

40
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,125
He's the biggest supporter
Big State has. Bleeds red and white.

41
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,503
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I saw
something like that about him on TV.

42
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,048
Do you have a son named
Jesus Shuttlesworth?

43
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,216
Yes, sir.

44
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,386
Is your son considered the number one
high school prospect...

45
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,222
in these United States
of America?

46
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,850
Some people rate him
that high, some don't.

47
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,353
-You know, two, three, six.
-Come on, Jake. Come on.

48
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,481
Don't be modest. You oughta be proud.
You oughta be proud as a peacock.

49
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,943
I always been proud of my son even
before he was the number one prospect...

50
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,196
in the whole entire world.

51
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,532
-You aren't modest, after all.
-God is working with me on that, sir.

52
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,912
The governor's made a request
that your son, Jesus Shuttlesworth,

53
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,749
seriously consider enrolling
in his alma mater, Big State.

54
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,293
If you persuade your son
to do this,

55
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,670
the governor's given me
his word...

56
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,340
he'll do everything
in his power to...

57
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,134
cut your time here short,
considerably.

58
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,136
The governor can do that?
He can--

59
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,640
-He can do that.
-I'm lookin' at 15, Warden. I mean--

60
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,642
This is for real, right?

61
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,020
You can make the governor
very happy.

62
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:44,650
He's got a great reputation
for never forgetting anyone
who's done right by him.

63
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,778
He's also never forgiven anyone
who's done him wrong.

64
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,906
Can't do nothin' in here, though.
I mean, behind these--

65
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,326
Behind these bars, you know,
these walls and everything like that,

66
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,288
I mean, something
like this here...

67
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,624
can't be worked out
over the phone or--

68
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,126
We have to get started right away.

69
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,506
The NC two -A deadline for kids
to declare is one week away.

70
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,049
-One week?
-Seven days.

71
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,467
Everything's been arranged.

72
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,178
-It's all been worked out.
-The Bulls ain't got nothin',

73
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,888
especially against
the Knicks.

74
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:18,350
All you ever talk about is
Jordan this, Jordan that.

75
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,105
Guard!

76
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,775
You do your part, you deliver your son,

77
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,610
-Guard!
-Governor Pernell will do his part.

78
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,613
-Guard!
-What the hell's goin' on in there?

79
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,032
You'll have to excuse
the temporary discomfort,

80
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,451
but we can't trust
in your abilities as an actor.

81
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,704
There's little margin
for error.

82
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,956
Let's go, Doc!
Hurry up.

83
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,292
Where you takin' him?

84
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,087
-What's wrong with this inmate?
-I don't know.

85
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,047
-Food poisoning?
-Are you sure?

86
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,425
I don't know.
He just rolled him in.

87
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,428
I want this inmate
quarantined immediately.

88
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,806
-Looks like he ate some
of this fine prison cuisine.
-I can't take a chance.

89
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,809
Last time something like this happened,
half the prison population got sick.

90
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,854
-He's quarantined now. He's contagious.
-God!

91
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,023
One last thing.

92
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,233
Don't try any funny business.

93
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,360
Any shenanigans, the deal is off.

94
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,986
Any shenanigans, the deal is off.

95
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,405
Can't you make him shut up?

96
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,699
-The guy's in pain.
-Then give him something.

97
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:19,161
We got two more hours to go.
Man, I don't wanna hear that shit.

98
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,413
Two parole officers
will be assigned to you.

99
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:24,124
-Spivey, he's a black man.

100
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,251
You should like him.
He should like you.

101
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,587
Your other chaperone is Crudup.

102
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,632
Quiet. But, as my father told me,
it's the quiet one's you have to watch.

103
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,842
Spivey, I'm sick
as a dog, man.

104
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,513
Here. Drink that.

105
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,806
Drink it.

106
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,352
Spivey and Crudup,

107
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,646
two of the best,
handpicked by me.

108
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:50,067
If necessary, these men have
been given a green light to shoot.

109
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,238
We don't give a shit about you,
or you being sick as a dog.

110
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,366
You wanna throw up, let us know.
We'll pull over.

111
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,954
You puke back there,
my main man Crudup will see to it...

112
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,456
that you lick it
all back up,

113
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,292
every single
nasty-ass drop.

114
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,129
You understand,
my brother? Capisce?

115
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,341
Yeah, capisce.
Can you pull over?

116
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,468
Please?

117
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,811
Remember what my main man Spivey said.
Don't get any in the car.

118
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,439
-Not a drop, not a speck.

119
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,485
-Don't move too fast 
-What up?

120
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:37,030
-Let's keep control 
-What's up, bro?

121
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,995
He's always singin'.

122
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,497
-You know, right?
-Yo, I sound good though, man.

123
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,208
Better take this court over, yo.

124
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,836
-We gotta play for real.
-And don't be confused

125
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,464
You just have
to be willing

126
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,634
-Willing to end the--Aw!
-Shit!

127
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:01,138
Check out Rodman here.

128
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,931
Hey, yo, yo, yo!
We got next!

129
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,435
-Gonna kick these motherfuckers' ass.
-For real.

130
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,271
Play ball!

131
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,023
Big man.

132
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,234
-Look at the pants on that kid, man.
-Let's go, baby.

133
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,029
-That's off.
-Break!

134
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,573
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, G!

135
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,911
Hey!

136
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,458
-Bring it on now.
-Move it by yourself. Come on.

137
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,711
-Block it.
-Whoa!

138
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,338
Aw, shit!

139
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,173
-I got it.
-Come on, come on, come on, come on.

140
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,467
Come on! I'm open.

141
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,306
-Ah, that's our ball.
-Nice shot, Johnny!

142
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,683
Whoo-hoo!
Good pass, James!

143
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,980
-Just let me know.
-What's the score?

144
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,608
Let's go, Boog!

145
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,610
I got it.

146
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,758
I got hops, baby! I got hops.

147
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,594
Center court.

148
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,596
You got it. You got it.

149
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:32,062
-Let's go, Boogs.
-Come on, baby. Let's go, baby.

150
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,815
Get ready to help out, Booger,
before we get beat. Just steal.

151
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,275
Show me something, kid.

152
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,695
I got it! All the way!
Fly! Alley-oop!

153
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,031
Show time!

154
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,952
Yeah! We're the Lincoln Railsplitters,
baby! What, what, what, what?

155
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,580
You didn't read the paper
that day, son?

156
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,167
Aw! Railsplitters!
That's right.

157
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,086
So Jesus
has led the Railsplitters...

158
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,797
to the Promised Land despite
being down late the second half.

159
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,758
Coach Cincotta's team
refused to die.

160
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,429
They come back to win it,
and there's bedlam at the Garden.

161
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,598
Number one.

162
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,061
The game brings me
love, peace and happiness.

163
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,733
My name is Sip Rodgers.

164
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,027
I go to Abraham Lincoln High School.

165
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,029
I play the two-spot.

166
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,907
We're the Railsplitters,
and nobody's fuckin' with us.

167
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,912
Basketball is like
poetry in motion.

168
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,915
Just comin' down the court,
you got a defender in your way.

169
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,918
You take him to the left.
You take him back to the right.

170
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,296
And he's fallin' back,
and you just "J" right in his face.

171
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,007
And then you look at him,
and then you say, "What?"

172
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,595
Basketball's the birthplace
of all of my dreams,

173
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,349
of everything that I wanna be, of
everything I wanna accomplish in life.

174
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,188
I feel handsome when I'm on the court.
I feel like I'm somebody.

175
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,040
The way this goes down
is simple

176
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,835
From this day forth
anything dealing with rap stay off

177
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,629
This the play-offs
No payoffs, strictly skills

178
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,090
If your brain's insane
then stick to your deals

179
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,093
In this field it ain't about sellin'
a mil wit' the run of the mill

180
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,013
So just be tellin' it real, it ain't
like a third-time felon's appeal

181
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,516
Till a god schools 'em
and tells 'em the deal

182
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,935
I'll allow you to write
maybe allow you to bite

183
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,521
If you down to fight the power
here's the power to fight

184
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,440
I overpower the mic
Hit the crowd wit' da bomb diggy

185
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,526
Ring the alarm
Now the squad's wit' me

186
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,903
From way back I shown no weakness
when I speak this

187
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,573
Mentally strong to keep this hit
and my speech is given

188
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,950
Now listen from the beginnin'
till I reach the endin'

189
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,244
My short story's winnin'
and keep the beat spinnin'

190
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,581
You know the name, P.E.
You know the game, P.E.

191
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,667
We ain't for the fame
We for the change

192
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,628
Word is Bond, I wake up every day
wit' my game face on

193
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,382
You know the name, P.E.
You know the game, P.E.

194
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,635
We ain't for the fame
We for the change

195
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,805
Word is Bond, I wake up every day
wit' my game face on

196
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,849
We back harder than ever
Follow my lead

197
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,392
Through the fast lane
in the game

198
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,228
This is Mr. Shuttlesworth.
His key?

199
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:21,690
You ain't ready to get it, I don't
know why they keep askin' for it

200
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,067
Is this guy gonna mean
any trouble?

201
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,112
Nah, he's not
gonna mean any trouble.

202
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,157
If you somewhat sure
Hip-hop's like a chess game

203
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,494
Discussing the war, strategize
Move like masterminds

204
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,955
-So where y'all stayin' at?
-Marriott, mid-town Manhattan.

205
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,750
That's what I figured. Why aren't
I stayin' down there with y'all?

206
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,419
Only place
on Coney Island, my man.

207
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,672
Why waste all that valuable time
commuting back and forth...

208
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,342
when you can walk
to see your son right from here?

209
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,802
You also don't have a choice.

210
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:54,223
The way I see it, this is better
than your room at the hoosegow.

211
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,059
-This is the Ritz to you.
-I ain't mad at nobody.

212
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,686
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

213
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,316
Yeah. Yeah, this is
better than the Marriott.

214
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,820
Keep your hands still.
There you go.

215
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,365
-All right. Sit down.
-Huh?

216
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,952
You heard what the fuck I said.
I said sit down!

217
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:19,081
There's a couple of things
I think we better go over.

218
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,416
Number one:
You ain't on vacation.

219
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,460
You're not a free man.

220
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,005
In the eyes of the law,
you are still a convicted felon.

221
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,300
Your ass is ours.
You understand that?

222
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,971
-Do you?
-Yeah, I over-stand it.

223
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,974
-Then answer us when we speak to you.
-I understand it, over-stand it.

224
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,518
The sooner you do
what you gonna do,

225
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,063
the better it will be
for all concerned parties.

226
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,066
Mr. Shuttlesworth,
you are now wired.

227
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:53,574
It's a letter of intent
for your son to sign. Take it.

228
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,243
In here there's some money.
Get some clothing.

229
00:17:56,326 --> 00:18:00,497
Toothpaste, deodorant,
personal effects, whatever have you.

230
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,625
Take a shower. Wash your ass.

231
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,462
Give me your right leg.

232
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:12,342
Just in case you get any smart ideas,
we will track you down.

233
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,095
And when we find you,
we will shoot you dead.

234
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,139
-You have to check in with us daily.

235
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,559
Plus, when we page you, you have to
return our call within ten minutes...

236
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,769
or there's gonna be
hell to pay.

237
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,898
Yeah. So y'all gonna be
following me everywhere I go?

238
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,525
No, we're not gonna
follow you.

239
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,738
We're gonna get you a passport,
plane ticket and a VISA card.

240
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,241
Of course we're gonna be around.
What the fuck you think we're gonna do?

241
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:41,455
-So how long I got exactly?
-You got till midnight Sunday.

242
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,958
-I guess I better get working.
-That would be the best thing to do.

243
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,211
And we will see you tomorrow.

244
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,588
-Yeah, I bet you will.
-How's the tummy?

245
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,591
Great. Everything's lovely.
Nice seein' you gentlemen.

246
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,676
-Just in case.
-Thank you.

247
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,194
It's open.

248
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,990
Shit.

249
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,557
Thank you, Jesus.

250
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,784
Thank you.

251
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,704
If man is the father
the son is the center of the Earth

252
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,747
In the middle
of the universe

253
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,792
Then why is this verse
coming six times rehearsed

254
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,378
Don't freestyle much
but I write 'em like such

255
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,672
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens

256
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,341
What does it all mean
all this shit I'm seein'

257
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,927
Human bein's
screamin' vocal javelins

258
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,305
Sign of a local nigga
unravelin'

259
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,849
My wanderin'
got my ass wonderin'

260
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,310
Where Christ is
in all this crisis

261
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,896
Hating Satan
never knew what nice is

262
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,481
Check the papers
while I bet on ices

263
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,026
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear

264
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,570
-Year by year all sense disappears
-Know y'all did your homework.

265
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,572
-Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear
-What's up?

266
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,741
Beware: two triple-0
is near

267
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,035
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

268
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,162
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

269
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,247
-What's up?
-What is game, who got game

270
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,583
-I saw you running.

271
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,418
Don't even try to play it off.

272
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,795
If you would've been on time,
there would've been no need to run.

273
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,632
-The bus would've come sooner,
I would've been on it.
-I didn't tell you?

274
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,468
The B-36 don't come
until I get here, Lala.

275
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,721
You know I got it like that.

276
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,098
Why you gonna play me
like that?

277
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:08,060
-You played yourself, faded yourself.
-That's crazy.

278
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,354
Oh?

279
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,814
You're lucky the bus is here,
late like you.

280
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,441
People use
Even murders excused

281
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,819
So, uh, have you narrowed down
your choices yet?

282
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,821
Not yet.

283
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,949
You gonna let me in
on your secret?

284
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,160
You know I'll never keep
anything from you, never.

285
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,038
Folks don't even
own themselves

286
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,501
Anyway, there's this guy
that I know that I want you to meet.

287
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,295
Who's the guy?

288
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:39,007
He's a friend of the family.
His name is D'Andre Mackey.

289
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,719
-What does he do?
-D'Andre's an agent.

290
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:47,349
You know I ain't supposed to be talking
to no agent. That shit is illegal.

291
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,602
All he wants to do is talk to you for
five minutes, see where your head is at.

292
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,021
My head is on my shoulders
and gonna stay there.

293
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,566
I'm not fucking
with no agents, Lala.

294
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,609
Who got game
Where's the game in life

295
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,653
Jesus, please?

296
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,655
I got game
She got game

297
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,158
-Please?
-They got game, he got game

298
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,827
Come on. He's a friend
of the family.

299
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,996
-Five minutes of your time.
-So?

300
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,833
It's just five minutes of your time
before you make your decision.

301
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,254
Come on. Please?

302
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,798
I don't know.

303
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,301
Let me think about it.

304
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,345
-I'll see you fourth period, all right?
-Sounds good.

305
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,681
Mmm. Mmm.

306
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:32,186
-I'll be so happy
when this stuff is over with.
-It won't be long now.

307
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,814
What do you got? A Monday morning
10:00 a.m. press conference, right?

308
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,692
-Yeah.
-Have you made a decision yet?

309
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:42,696
You know what?
That's the thing that's bothering me.

310
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,532
And you know what? You're my coach,
right? I mean, I don't mind.

311
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:49,036
Every time I walk down the hallways,
"Where you goin'?

312
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,040
Where you goin'? Have you chosen a
school yet? Are you going to the NBA?"

313
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,042
I'm gonna tell y'all
Monday morning.

314
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,794
-I'm tired of hearing that.
-I can understand that.

315
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,839
Look, maybe it's in your best interest
to take it as a compliment.

316
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,841
People really do care about you.

317
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,219
People don't care about me.

318
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,680
They care about themselves.

319
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,808
They're just tryin' to get over, tryin'
to get a piece of Jesus, that's all.

320
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,810
Not everybody's a scumbag.

321
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,689
Some are--don't get me wrong--
but not everybody. Okay?

322
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,983
When are you gonna make
a decision?

323
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,403
Sometime between now and
Monday morning, 10:00 a.m.

324
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,406
I still have a lot of thinking to do.
I have to weigh my options.

325
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,909
-You got my home phone number, right?
-Yeah, I got it.

326
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,871
You call me anytime.
I don't care how late it gets,
you wanna talk this thing through.

327
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:36,124
Jesus, I always thought of you
as a son. You know that, right?

328
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,168
Yeah, I know that too.

329
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,838
You remember what I told you?
You remember?

330
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:45,425
-I remember. You tell me every day.
-What? What did I say?

331
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,886
I know what you told me, Coach.
I know, I know.

332
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,347
It'll make me feel good
again, all right?

333
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,766
This is gonna be the most
important decision in your life.

334
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,436
-Hi, young man.
-I'm John Thompson
from Georgetown University.

335
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,315
Hello. I'm Dean Smith, the basketball
coach, University of North Carolina.

336

339
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,408

at the University of Arizona.

340
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,870
-And this will be--
-The most important decision--
-In your life.

341
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,206
This will be the most important
decision in your life.

342
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,250
Coach, I understand
the magnitude of this decision.

343
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,669
God bless you, son.
I believe you do.

344
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:23,422
Baby, I love you 
You havin' a good time?

345
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,383
You havin' a good time?
Because you look so good.

346
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,760
Mmm, you look so good.

347
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,222
-I love it!
-You look great!
You look fuckin' wonderful!

348
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:37,811
You know what? You look like
Kim Novak from what movie?

349
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,480
-Vertigo.
-Vertigo, baby, I tell ya.

350
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,816
So what do you wanna do
for your birthday? It's your day.

351
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,235
I wanna go on the Cyclone.
I wanna go on the Turbo-Jet.

352
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,405
-I wanna go on the Wonder Wheel.
-Damn!

353
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,241
Brother?

354
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:54,745
Do you know me?
Do you know my lady?

355
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,747
No, I don't think so.

356
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,584
Well, brother, you lookin' at us with
all that fuckin' familiarity and shit.

357
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,754
Mind your own business, man.

358
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,760
Yeah, you right.

359
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,804
Obviously, I'm wrong, brother.
It's my mistake, uh--

360
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,642
No disrespect.

361
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,853
I don't want no trouble, my man.

362
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:30,239
Bitch, what--
Get your motherfuckin'--

363
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,457
I gotta meet your brother.
Please let me meet your brother.

364
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,961
I have to meet him. We'll talk about
this tomorrow. See you later, Mary.

365
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,755
See you, Sarah.

366
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:51,134
Miss Shuttlesworth.

367
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,805
Boo Boo.

368
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,861
-It's okay.
-Daddy.

369
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,863
How're you doin', baby?

370
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,950
Oh! My little woman.

371
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,369
-Daddy.
-How're you doin', baby?

372
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:21,290
Look at you. You done all grown up
and everything like that.

373
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,418
That's what I keep trying
to tell him.

374
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,005
-How's he doin'? How's your brother?
-Bossy as usual.

375
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,007
He's supposed to be bossy
and everything like that.

376
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,759
He's supposed to be,
taking care of his little sister.

377
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,679
Daddy, when did you get out?

378
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,182
Last night.

379
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,184
Look. Come on.

380
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,686
Let me walk you over to Uncle Bubba
and Aunt Sally's house.

381
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,981
We don't live there anymore.
He moved us out.

382
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:49,067
-Where you all live at?
-O'Dwyer Gardens.

383
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,112
Uncle Bubba
hasn't changed a bit.

384
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,656
So who payin' the rent?

385
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,784
-My brother.
-Your brother?

386
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,495
-He workin'?
-Naw.

387
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:02,915
-How long y'all been livin' around here?
-About a year.

388
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,000
-A year?
-Yeah.

389
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,003
That's good. How're you doin'
in school? You doin' all right?

390
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,048
-I got an "A" in Science.
-In Science, yeah? What you studyin'?

391
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,009
-Oh, cells or somethin'.
-Cells?

392
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,303
Yeah, me too.

393
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,349
-So, this is our building.
-Right here?

394
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:21,892
Yeah.

395
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,186
It's all right.
This is pretty nice, actually.

396
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,148
So--

397
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,403
You ain't gonna
invite me upstairs?

398
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,825
I don't know if I should.
I could get in trouble.

399
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,868
-With who?
-You know who.

400
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,037
All right.
Tell you what.

401
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,123
I'll leave before he come,
all right?

402
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,336
All right, Boo?

403
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,338
Okay.

404
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:55,092
What's in the bag?

405
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:59,346
Toothbrush, toothpaste. An afro pick?

406
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:04,810
Underwear?
Skittles, Daddy!

407
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,896
Ha-ha!
You figured I forgot, huh?

408
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:13,151
-You went shopping?
-Yeah, a little bit. Who this, baby?

409
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:16,405
That's Lala.
Lala Bonilla, Jesus's lady.

410
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,282
Lala Bonilla.

411
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:22,744
Daddy, how'd you get out? I thought you
were gonna be away a long, long time.

412
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:25,080
Can Daddy's little Boo Boo
keep a secret?

413
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,207
Yeah.

414
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:32,296
I'm out on a--what you call like a...
work release program, baby,

415
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,423
where's if l--

416
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,676
-Well, I got a week to do a job.
-Meaning?

417
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,138
Meaning if I do a good job,
I can get out sooner than expected.

418
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:45,058
-What kind of job do you have to do?
-I can't tell you that yet.

419
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,979
Because I'm too young.
I cannot wait until I'm 18.

420
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,899
I am tired of people telling me
that I'm not old enough.

421
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,318
"Can't do this. No, no, honey,
can't do this. You're too young--"

422
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,778
Hold on, hold on.
Sit down.

423
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:02,951
Look. Number one, you ain't too young.
You're a young woman.

424
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,621
It's just that I could...
get in trouble.

425
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,999
-Now, you don't want your daddy
to get in trouble, do you?
-No.

426
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,961
I don't want you getting into any more
trouble. I know it wasn't your fault.

427
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,672
I know you didn't mean it.

428
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:21,094
You don't know what
that means to your daddy.

429
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,764
Now, let's hit them Skittles.

430
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,808
Your brother, he's doin'
all right, huh?

431
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:28,810
-He is so good.
-Yeah?

432
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,230
He is better than good, Daddy.
You should see him play.

433
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,398
He's a zillion times better
than when you last saw him.

434
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:36,693
-Remember when he used to be
so weak on his left hand?
-Yeah.

435
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,112
Naw, now he can handle it
with both.

436
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,573
-And he can shake so good.
-Can he?

437
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,867
I bet he can finally beat you.

438
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,328
You think so?

439
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,084
-Yeah, he probably can.

440
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:58,173
You've reached Mary and Jesus.
We're not at home.

441
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:01,301
-Leave a message at the beep.

442
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,554
It's me, baby. It's Lala.

443
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,396
Hello, son.

444
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,898
Mary, what did I tell you
about letting strangers in the house?

445
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:18,443
-He's not a stranger. He's our father.
-I don't have a father.

446
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,112
-Hey, wait a minute--
-Daddy, he's trippin'.

447
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,198
Trippin'? We'll see who's trippin'
later on tonight.

448
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:26,618
-What did I tell you about
talking to strangers anyway?
-"Don't do it."

449
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,204
-And why?
-Because it may cause us harm.

450
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:32,124
So why did you let
this stranger in our house?

451
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,625
Mary, do you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

452
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:33,876
Mary, do you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

453
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm not standing here for
my health, and you ain't deaf.

454
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:40,215
-Don't talk to your sister like that.
-Am I talkin' to you?

455
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:44,678
Matter of fact, I don't
even know why you're here.

456
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,805
Mary, answer me right now.

457
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,099
I won't do it again,
I promise!

458
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,977
It's time for you
to get to steppin'.

459
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,606
And I'd appreciate it if you don't
ever walk through that door ever again.

460
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:58,442
All right.
Look, I need to talk to you.

461
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,987
-Why?
-I just need to. When can we talk?

462
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,406
I don't know.
I'm usually around.

463
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,576
-Where you gonna be at?
'Cause this is kinda urgent.
-I'm usually at the Garden.

464
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,578
-All right.
-All right.

465
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:13,248
-I'll see you down there.
-Yeah, you can see me there.

466
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,964
Enjoy the Skittles, baby.

467
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,842
Now you enjoy walkin'
out that front door.

468
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,805
-Where you think you're goin'?
-Help!

469
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,974
Get in there!

470
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,438
Open the door!

471
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,483
-Who's tryin' to break the door down?
-Booger!

472
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,488
What's up?

473
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,699
Hey, how y'all doin'?

474
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:51,119
-Not good.
-What's wrong, dear?

475
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,747
-Guess who showed at the apartment?
-Who?

476
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:56,250
-Daddy.
-Lord have mercy!

477
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,127
-Booger, take your cousin in your room.
-Go in the room.

478
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,296
Come on, Mary. Um--

479
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,757
You can play with
my Sony Playstation.

480
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,969
-Good, 'cause I can always beat you.
-I'm gettin' good at--

481
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,221
Sit down, son.

482
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,891
When did all this happen?

483
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,689
-About half an hour ago.
-What did he say? What does he want?

484
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,941
He says he wants to speak to me.
He says it's urgent.

485
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,862
-It don't make no sense.
-It makes perfect sense.
He smells the money.

486
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:29,324
What I'd like to know, how does a
convicted murderer get out so quick?

487
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:32,995
How can this happen?
He's not even eligible for parole yet.

488
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,455
He told Mary that he was out
on a work release program or something.

489
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,208
The man escaped
just like Shawshank.

490
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,336
Clint Eastwood in Escape From Alcatraz.
The Fugitive.

491
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,506
-He wasn't acting like no fugitive.
-We should call the cops.

492
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,885
-Yeah.
-We ain't gonna do no such a thing.

493
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,053
I think you need to go
and talk to your father.

494
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,055
He ain't my father,
all right?

495
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,059
I know how you feel, son,
but the fact remains he is your daddy.

496
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:59,813
But as your legal guardians as appointed
by the court in the state of New York,

497
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,566
I feel you need to involve us
more in your life.

498
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,735
Jesus, we're family.

499
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,987
Your mother--Martha,

500
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,075
my sister--I loved her.

501
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,870
We feel responsible
for the both of you.

502
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:18,707
I made a promise to your mother
that if anything ever happened to her,

503
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,419
that we would be there
for the both of you.

504
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,088
You hear me, Jesus?

505
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,842
Like I said, son, you need to talk
to your daddy, see what he has to say.

506
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:31,512
I told him I'd be here
at the Garden.

507
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:35,974
Before you go now, I want you to use
some of my John the Conqueror root.

508
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,769
This is what my daddy brought
up here from Mississippi.

509
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:42,814
Now, you rub some of this here between
your wrist and your elbow, see,

510
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,858
just like this here.

511
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,861
-Now, this'll fix you up real good.
-Oh, Bubba.

512
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:51,198
Don't nobody care nothin'
about your country, backward old root.

513
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:54,368
-This mojo works! It worked on your ass!
-Hmph!

514
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,538
-No, thanks, Uncle Bubba.
-Suit yourself.

515
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:01,583
-You make a decision yet?
-No, not yet.

516
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:05,587
Your Aunt Sally feels bad
that we aren't being included
in such an important decision.

517
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:09,758
He does not speak for me!
You do what you feel is right.

518
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:13,762
-Thank you, Aunt Sally.
-Will you be quiet, please?

519
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:16,557
What they offerin' you, boy?
What they gon' give you?

520
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,269
-Full athletic scholarship.
-Whoo! That's wonderful!

521
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,688
Full athletic scholarship,
that's all?

522
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:25,566
No money, no cars,
no job for your family?

523
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,652
-No school say nothin' like that.
-See, I don't believe that.

524
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,779
You're tryin'
to hold out on us.

525
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,948
-Holdin' out?
-You're tryin' to cut us out the deal.

526
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:36,702
-What deal?
-The deal is about to go down!
I hear things.

527
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,745
No, you ain't hear that.

528
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,206
Think of your Uncle Bubba,
your Aunt Sally.

529
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,209
I think it's only right that we
be compensated for sacrifices...

530
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,295
we made when we
took y'all in.

531
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:50,382
Bubba! I don't want
any part of this.

532
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,055
I'm goin' into the bedroom.

533
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,642
Good. Take your big ass
on in the bedroom, then.

534
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,645
Why you gotta talk to Aunt Sally
like that? I thought we were family.

535
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:07,107
-We are family. Blood, thick as thieves.
-I don't even know why l--

536
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,611
My controls ain't workin'.
It's stickin' or something.

537
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,405
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.
Say it. I'm the bomb.

538
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:17,367
Mm-hmm, yo, I'm the bomb.
You know I'm the bomb, right?

539
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:20,287
Now, we put out
a lot of money for y'all.

540
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,332
All I'm asking is that you
let me wet my beak a little bit.

541
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,125
-Wet your beak?
-Wet my beak, son.

542
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:29,296
You didn't see The Godfather II?
The man was called The Black Hand.

543
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,757
-I suspect you already
got a deal in place.
-What kind of deal?

544
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,092
The kind of deal that would enable you
to get your own apartment,

545
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,887
pay rent, pay Ma Bell,

546
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,933
pay Con Ed, buy clothes, furniture
with no visible means of income.

547
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:44,311
You ain't got no job, son!
No J-O-B!

548
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:48,607
Don't try to play me for no fool now.

549
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,735
-Am I making this clear?
-Yeah, you're making it very clear!

550
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:54,947
When I really get paid, I ain't gonna
lose track of you and Aunt Sally!

551
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,700
I'm gonna take care of you,
with interest if you want!

552
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,787
I ain't too old to have dreams.
Is that what you think?

553
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,624
I still got dreams.
I got plans too. Big plans.

554
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:09,670
-Now, why should me and
your Aunt Sally get cut off?
-Anything else, Uncle Bubba?

555
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,299
-Yo.
-Yeah!

556
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:17,636
-Check 'em.
-Ahh!

557
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,638
These are the new Jordans.

558
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:23,392
That's it, huh? Yeah.
How much these cost, man?

559
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:27,896
-139, 150 with tax.
-One-fi'ty? Where the holes at?

560
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,690
They're on the inside.
You gotta lace 'em up that way.

561
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,234
-Do that for me, man, all right?
-Yeah, no problem, man.

562
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,319
Let's get rid of this first.

563
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,488
139!

564
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,327
It's arthritis.

565
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:45,414
You know, I got that, uh...
arthritis thing happening.

566
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:48,333
Yeah? My brother's got
the same arthritic condition.

567
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,169
-Really?
-Only it's his left ankle.

568
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,256
-It's going around here in Coney Island.
-Yeah, yeah. It's contagious.

569
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,550
-Like the plague.
-Yeah.

570
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,520
Damn, what's he doin' here?

571
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,779
Hello, Mr. Shuttlesworth.

572
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:21,492
Since when do you start
calling your uncle Mister?

573
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,494
Hello, Uncle Jake.

574
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:25,204
-Huh?
-Hello, Uncle Jake.

575
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,164
-How you doin'? You all right?
-Okay.

576
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,541
-How's your game?
-Okay.

577
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,960
-That left hand comin'?
-Okay.

578
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,087
-Schoolwork?
-Okay.

579
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,173
All right.

580
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:39,801
So it look like you, uh--
look like you grew a little bit.

581
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:44,389
-You think so?
-Oh, no doubt.

582
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,186
-You ain't clownin' me, are you?
-I wouldn't clown you, son.

583
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,813
I know you grew--
What, a couple, three inches?

584
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,358
-Yo, for reals?
-It's the truth.

585
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,318
I'm--

586
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,824
That's the best news
I've heard in weeks.

587
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,077
All right. Well, cool.

588
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,206
I'm gonna let you two talk,
you know, get reacquainted.

589
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,965
Hey, you eatin'
them vegetables, boy?

590
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,842
-Always, man. Hey, welcome back.
-All right.

591
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,262
-All right.
-So you got new Jordans, I see.

592
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:27,140
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, a little somethin', son, you know.

593
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:30,644
So you ready?
One-on-one?

594
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:33,188
Still can't beat your pops?

595
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,900
No, thank you.

596
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,486
-You ain't no competition.
-I ain't no competition?

597
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,739
-Naw.
-Son, l--

598
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,038
-If your mother could see--

599
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,208
Hey, all right. I'm sorry, all right?
Hey, wait a minute.

600
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,294
That's the wrong way to start
a conversation with me.

601
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,296
All right. Hold up, hold up.

602
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,923
Look, you get
any of them letters?

603
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,136
Yeah, I got
your stupid letters.

604
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:07,097
I tore 'em up too.

605
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,766
-What about Mary's?
-I tore those up too.

606
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:15,105
All right. Since you too scared
to play me, can we talk for a moment?

607
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,566
-Talk about what?
-A lot of things.

608
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:21,320
I gotta ask you a few questions,
you know, catch up on things.

609
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:24,323
Look, I don't have a lot of time,
so make it quick.

610
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:27,326
I got even less time,
so I'm gonna make it real quick.

611
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:31,497
I read all about you,
everything like that, and, uh--

612
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,875
Game really developed.
All the hard work done paid off.

613
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,544
I'm proud of you, son.
I mean that.

614
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:40,756
I know these are
tough times for you now.

615
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,051
So I figure, hey, you know,
you might need some fatherly advice.

616
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,594
-From who?
-From me.

617
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:49,515
-About what?
-About, number one,
where you gonna go to school.

618
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,017
-Have you made a decision?
-Aw, damn! You too?

619
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,186
I already know
what you're about to say.

620
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,522
"This is about to be the most
important decision in your life."

621
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,649
That ain't what I was about to say.
I'm gonna ask you--

622
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,818
I'm just hopin' that you
ain't compromisin' yourself, son.

623
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:04,029
I know what's going on. I know people
are offering you all kinds of things.

624
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:08,951
I just don't wanna see you beholden
to somebody for something you done took.

625
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,203
-Something I took?
-Yeah.

626
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:14,706
What do you expect? I gotta
take care of Mary, nobody else but me.

627
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,167
I refuse to let Mary grow up
in the same apartment with Uncle Bubba.

628
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:22,172
Look. All I'm sayin' is--
I would like to know where you're goin'.

629
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:25,259
-What difference does it
make where I'm goin'?
-I would like to know.

630
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:28,470
I don't know yet.
I have to weigh my options.

631
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:31,890
-You got any idea?
-Like I told the rest of
the world, I don't know yet.

632
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:36,270
I pray that you understand...

633
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,814
why I pushed you so hard.

634
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,358
It was only to get you
to that next level, son.

635
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,111
You's the first Shuttlesworth that's
even gonna make it out these projects.

636
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:47,906
I was the one who put the ball in
your hand. I put the ball in your crib.

637
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,075
-I ain't no baby no more.
-All right.

638
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:53,745
Why the hell did you name me Jesus
anyway? What type of name is that?

639
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,832
-It's a biblical name.
-No kiddin'.

640
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,418
-You don't like that name?
-I never liked my name.

641
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,462
-You ain't never told me.
-I used to tell Mommy a lot of things.

642
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:05,799
-Why you ain't never tell me?
-You haven't been around lately.

643
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:09,761
I used to hate for Mom
to call me in to come in for dinner.

644
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:12,306
Jesus! Jesus!

645
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,267
You're lucky my dribble's got--

646
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,228
-Dusted in for the N.B.A.
-Shut up! You look like--

647
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,731
-You look like a cockroach.
-Cockroach?

648
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,150
Cockroach this then.
Cockroach this.

649
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:26,403
That way. That way.

650
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,366
You just can't shoot
the darn fool.

651
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,328
-Ooh, shoot it? Shoot it?
-Yeah, shoot it.

652
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:38,207
Jesus!

653
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,626
-Jesus! Jesus!
-Jesus!

654
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,546
Jesus, time to come in and eat.
Bring your cousin Booger with you.

655
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,882
Could I just finish
one more shot, please?

656
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:50,260
-No! I said now, and I mean it!
-Come on.

657
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:53,722
People used to think she was
some type of religious freak,
catchin' the Holy Ghost.

658
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,807
Save me, Jesus!
Save me, Jesus!

659
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,810
-Just stop, Booger! That ain't funny!
-Well, it's funny to me.

660
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:02,439
Funny to me, just like you pickin'
and eatin' your boogers all the time.

661
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:05,275
-I don't eat my boogers!
-Yes, you do!

662
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,820
Man, you never seen me
eat my boogers.

663
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,364
How many you see me eat?
One, two or three?

664
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,367
I came to this court by myself.
Why you gotta follow me?

665
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,870
-Maybe I wanted to play with Jesus.
-Jesus!

666
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,956
Jesus! Jesus!

667
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,375
-Jesus!
-Look at that.

668
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,211
Moses parted the Red Sea,
not Jesus.

669
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,421
-Moses, Jesus, whatever.
-Whatever?

670
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:27,923
Whatever.

671
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:31,260
Everybody and their mama's running
around sayin' they're born again.

672
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:34,805
Especially all
these athletes and entertainers.

673
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:38,809
They get caught smokin' crack
in the hotel with ten whores.

674
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:43,146
All of a sudden they have a religious
experience? They find Jesus, all right.

675
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:46,775
What's wrong with finding Jesus, huh?
What's wrong with that?

676
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:51,238
How come you never hear Jesus being
praised in the losers' locker room then?

677
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,032
-They're probably cursin'
that motherfucker out.
-Hey, wait, wait, wait.

678
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,076
-First, number one--
-God ain't shit.

679
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,996
Number one, why you gotta use
all this kinda language?

680
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,498
You some kind of heathen now?
You don't make no mistakes?

681
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,501
You be out here shootin', but you
don't miss no shots ever? Ever?

682
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:08,172
People make mistakes. People veer off
the path. So what? God forgives them.

683
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,674
-Has God forgiven you
for killing my mother?
-I pray that He has.

684
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:14,845
-I believe He has. When will you?
-Never.

685
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,847
All right.
Well, hey, look.

686
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,185
-Hey. Shit.
-"Thou shall not kill."

687
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:23,812
-Isn't that from the Good Book?
-That's in the Good Book. So?

688
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:27,524
So what? Ain't nothin' I can do, son,
that can bring your mother back.

689
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,944
What you want me to do, huh?

690
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:33,030
Did you even love my mother?

691
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,657
Yes, I loved her!

692
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,577
I loved her more than life itself.

693
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,747
You sure did have
a hell of a way of showin' it.

694
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:46,460
When you goin' back anyway?

695
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,671
Yo, I got next.
I got next game, bro.

696
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,686
I wanna go eat.

697
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,648
Jesus, you off
the phone yet?

698
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:11,068
Hey.

699
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:14,655
You been on the phone
all night.

700
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,658
All these schools callin', we need
to just get another unlisted number.

701
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:21,245
-It still gets out.
-I'll be so glad when
all this stuff is over.

702
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,789
-I know you will.
-How long's it gonna be?

703
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:28,210
-Monday morning.
-Praise the Lord, and thank you, Jesus.

704
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,921
You think that's funny, don't you?

705
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,215
-I like teasing you.
-I know you do.

706
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:36,260
Everybody says I'm gonna be rich,
won't have to worry about a thing.

707
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:40,681
-Did your father tell you that?
-No, but everybody else in the world.

708
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,392
Everybody else
in the world don't know.

709
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:46,562
Everybody says you're gonna play pro
ball and have your own Nike sneakers...

710
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:49,273
and star in commercials
and make mad loot.

711
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,900
So much money that we won't be
in Coney Island no more.

712
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,944
What did I tell you about listening
to what people say?

713
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:57,739
I hear what you say, but if
everybody's sayin' the same
thing, it's gotta be true.

714
00:44:57,823 --> 00:45:02,119
Uncle Bubba even said you were
gonna buy him and Aunt Sally
some new house in Long Island.

715
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,788
He asked me if I want
to go house shopping with him.

716
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,125
Looking for a big old house, too,
with, like, a green lawn and grass...

717
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:11,044
and lots of trees
and even a swimming pool in the back.

718
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:13,255
-Uncle Bubba told you that?
-Mm-hmm.

719
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:15,090
-I'm gonna have to talk
to that uncle of yours.
-All the kids in school say,

720
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,592
-I'm gonna have to talk
to that uncle of yours.
-All the kids in school say,

721
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,595
since I'm gonna be
so rich and famous, that...

722
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,181
I'm not gonna need to go
to school anymore...

723
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,308
'cause I already know how to count
and I'm just wasting my time.

724
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,144
If I hear you talkin' like that again,
I'll kill you myself!

725
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:28,604
Dang! Let go of me!

726
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:31,148
All those kids don't mean shit!
I'm raising you, nobody else!

727
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,150
-Get off of me!
-We're not rich.

728
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,152
We don't have no money.
We don't have shit.

729
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:38,947
If those were really
your friends, they wouldn't be
filling your head with bullshit.

730
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,993
I didn't say I believed it. I just said
that that's what people are saying.

731
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,454
-Can't believe you listen
to that bullshit.
-Fine! I'm sorry, all right?

732
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,873
Goodness!

733
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,836
You never tell me nothin'.
You never even have time for me no more.

734
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,756
Well, it's gonna be over
Monday morning, okay?

735
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:08,310
I'm really trippin'.

736
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:16,902
I'm sorry. I apologize
for putting my hands on you, okay?

737
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,571
I'm just--I'm afraid.

738
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,158
Me too.

739
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:26,245
I mean, I just want
the best for both of us.

740
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:29,873
And, you know, Mommy,
she wanted you to go to college.

741
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:32,501
All these people around here, half
these people aren't going to college.

742
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:35,087
Mommy wants you
to get your degree.

743
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,590
Why is Daddy here?
Why did he come back?

744
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,676
He's not gonna be here
much longer.

745
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,262
But, Jesus,
I miss him so, so much.

746
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,269
-Go to sleep.
-Good night.

747
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,944
Hello, everyone. I'm Robin Roberts.
Welcome to Sports Center.

748
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,697
Tonight, our feature is
about a biblical player--

749
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,533
the Chosen One, the second coming,
the resurrection,

750
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,577
the salvation.

751
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:09,872
ESPN gets religion as we follow a day
in the life of Abraham Lincoln senior...

752
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:14,543
Jesus Shuttlesworth, the number one
basketball prospect in the country.

753
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,962
Jesus of Coney Island.

754
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,465
Jesus is the best thing to happen to the
game since the tennis shoe was invented.

755
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:22,593
Jim Faen from Mount
Saint Mary's used to say,

756
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,429
"He gives me a tingle,"
and I think that's what Jesus does.

757
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,639
He makes you excited
to watch him.

758
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,808
Whew! Jesus Shuttlesworth.

759
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:32,811
He's the next phenom!
He's awesome, baby, with a capital "A"!

760
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:35,981
The guy's unbelievable!
He's a P.T.P., a prime time player!

761
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:39,234
He's the 3-S man!
Super, scintillating, sensational!

762
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:40,944
He's a high riser!

763
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,030
His game has got
everything you need.

764
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:45,908
He can defend.
He can run. He can finish.

765
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,577
He likes to play in a crowd,
and he can pass the basketball.

766
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,787
He makes people better.
He's the real thing.

767
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,999
He's able to do some of the things
that most coaches talk about,

768
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,877
and that is being able
to be a triple threat.

769
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,131
If that's something that we
as coaches have used for many
years--dribble, pass and shoot.

770
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:05,552
Pure shooter, fearsome defender,
a great player.

771
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:08,472
He was coming down for a fast break,
and the defender went for the ball.

772
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:12,142
He brought it behind his back
and switched it over to his right hand.

773
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,769
It went through his legs.

774
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:16,730
Defender came up and kind of
stutter-stepped a little bit,

775
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:20,108
pulled back and rang the three.

776
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:22,110
This kid might be ready
for the big leagues.

777
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,239
He plays to win, and a lot
of people play to play.

778
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,658
This guy plays to win.

779
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:30,494
He understands that if he
performs better, they are going to win.

780
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:33,413
But he knows how to pass.
He plays with his teammates.

781
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:36,750
He has all the attributes
that go into being a winner.

782
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,836
When I watched
Kenny Anderson's stuff,

783
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:42,381
-I'd never thought I would see
anybody better than those guys.
-Shit.

784
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,466
But along came Jesus.

785
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:48,220
There are very few players
that give you 40 minutes of everything.

786
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:52,182
Michael Jordan'll give you 35.
But 40 minutes of everything he's got...

787
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,101
because of what he's overcome
in his life.

788
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,562
In terms of dealing
with his sister,

789
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:01,441
and all of the pitfalls that come
with being in a deprived situation.

790
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:05,946
And in a situation that's void of any
kind of leadership other than his own,

791
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:08,866
he's had to be
very, very self-reliant.

792
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:12,870
Now, with kids as good as he is, he's
probably receiving a lot of pressure...

793
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,956
to go into the N.B.A.
because so many kids are doing it.

794
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,459
When you see a kid with this kind
of talent, it's almost normal for him...

795
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:22,713
to take that into consideration with the
kind of money that they're getting now.

796
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,799
But I would tell him that he needs to go
to college and get an education...

797
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:28,343
so that he'll be able to save
the money that he has.

798
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:31,513
My mother, she always
told me that, that...

799
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:36,143
it was great to be a superstar athlete
and to be able to make it to the N.B.A.

800
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:40,939
But... I mean, you're nothing
without your education.

801
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:44,234
And, you know, ever since day one,
she wouldn't let me play basketball.

802
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:48,405
She wouldn't let me play in the garden,
from day one, unless I did my homework.

803
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,407
That's right.

804
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:53,827
I think when April 11th comes,
I just wanna let my hair down,

805
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:55,829
kick my feet up
and have a good time.

806
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,248
Just go hang out with my boys
back in high school:

807
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,958
-Sip, Booger, Lonnie, Mance.
-Lincoln! Linc--Linc--Lincoln!

808
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,169
-Man, those are my partners.
-My name is Sip!

809
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:04,171
Whether east or west!

810
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,006
-Yeah!
-I rock this joint!

811
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,634
-Yeah!
-With the most finesse. Roll call!

812
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:11,637
Lincoln! Linc--Linc--Linc--
Lincoln! Roll call!

813
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,472
-My name is Jesus.
-Yeah!

814
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:15,265
-I am the man.
-Yeah!

815
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,767
-What's up with these questions...
-Yeah!

816
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,018
about my plan?

817
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:21,355
I think it would just be
a sin that...

818
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,691
you know, come...
two months from now,

819
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:27,444
when I graduate,

820
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:30,113
my mother, she won't be able
to attend my graduation...

821
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:32,491
because, of course, she passed.

822
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:35,869
What most impresses me
about Jesus Shuttlesworth...

823
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:38,205
is the foresight
of his parents...

824
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:42,251
to name him appropriately
as the world's greatest.

825
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,169
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Jesus.

826
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,713
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Oh, Jesus!

827
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:48,549
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Jesus.

828
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,509
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Jesus.

829
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:52,886
-Jesus.
-Hallelujah, Jesus! Hallelujah!

830
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,429
He got game.

831
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,891
Who brought you this Victoria's Secret
bra-and-panties shit?

832
00:50:57,975 --> 00:51:00,936
Bitch, where do you get
this shit from? You crazy?

833
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:03,939
-Bitch, are you outta your fuckin' mind?

834
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,941
-Dakota.
-I'm sorry.

835
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:07,985
Damn!

836
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,654
I'm sorry, baby.

837
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:13,490
The director is God.

838
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:17,286
You have no vision from nobody.

839
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,580
You tryin'
to antebellum my ass.

840
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,958
You tryin' to fuckin'
plantationalize on me, ain't ya?

841
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,253
Bitch, this ain't Gone With The Wind.

842
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:29,882
You ain't Scarlett O'Hara!
I ain't Rhett Butler!

843
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:32,050
Bitch, I'll kick your ass.

844
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:34,428
Take that goddamn shit off.

845
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,513
Fuckin' with me.

846
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,932
Who the fuck
you think you are?

847
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:42,311
I'm sorry.

848
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,567
Bitch must be crazy.

849
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:51,320
Chillin' me with some goddamn shit
from some other motherfucker.

850
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:54,198
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

851
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:58,160
I can't believe that bitch
did me like this.

852
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:14,760
Hello?

853
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,887
You all right? I heard
a lot of noise next door.

854
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,556
I thought maybe you need some help,
or something like that.

855
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,397
Here, let me help you up.

856
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,399
-What the hell do you want?
-It's all right. Come here.

857
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,443
I won't hurt you.
Come here.

858
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:35,072
You can walk? You all right?

859
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:39,576
Yeah. I need... some help!

860
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,205
You weren't knocking on that door
while I was getting my ass beat.

861
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,749
-Yeah, well, I didn't want to get
all up in your business--
-Smart, huh?

862
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:49,795
-My God, it's funny, isn't it?
-Y'all got some ice around here?

863
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:54,758
Oh, the sink doesn't work. There's
some cold water in the bathroom tub.

864
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,556
Oh, God.

865
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:09,690
At least I still got my teeth.

866
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,157
-Put this right here.
-Thanks.

867
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,159
Yeah. Right there.

868
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,417
I seen you around, you know.

869
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,711
-I noticed you right away.
-Yeah?

870
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,839
-You don't belong here.
-Oh, yeah? How can you tell that?

871
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:37,217
You don't seem like
the type of guy that would be here...

872
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:39,636
in this house of ill repute.

873
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,436
My name's Dakota.

874
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:51,064
You ever been there?

875
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,525
-Where?
-Dakota.

876
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:57,362
Oh, no, no, no.
I ain't never been nowhere.

877
00:53:57,446 --> 00:54:00,491
I'm from upstate New York.

878
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:03,118
-I'm, uh, Jake. Jake--
-Please, no last names.

879
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:06,497
In my line of work,
last names aren't needed.

880
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,959
You're actually better off
without them.

881
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:14,379
-Why he beat you like that?
-Because he can.

882
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:16,381
And why you let him though?

883
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,675
Look. Are you trying to get
inside my head or something?

884
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,886
-You trying to see how I think?
-Naw.

885
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:23,013
You think you're
real slick, huh?

886
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:28,018
Naw, I just, you know--

887
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:30,312
I just want to get
to know you or something.

888
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,023
Look, I'm not a crack 'ho, okay?
I don't do drugs.

889
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:35,150
-I ain't accusing you of nothing, baby--
-Good.

890
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:37,694
I just want you to know--
I don't do drugs. I'm clean.

891
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,196
Right.

892
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,865
You still didn't answer
my question though.

893
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:46,286
Why you allow this, this,
this... pimp, you know, to just--

894
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,581
-His name is Sweetness.
-Is what?

895
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:51,625
-His name is Sweetness.
-All right.

896
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,669
All right.
Why you allow Sweetness...

897
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:57,130
to, you know, more or less,
just beat you down?

898
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:59,049
A lot of reasons.

899
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,009
-Mm.
-Take your pick.

900
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:03,053
Shoot.

901
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,138
I love him. He loves me.

902
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,392
I'm his number one money-maker.
I'm his bottom bitch.

903
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,436
Uh, low self-esteem.
I was abused as a child.

904
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,274
And, you know, I deserved it.
It keeps me in line.

905
00:55:15,357 --> 00:55:17,651
And he always says he's sorry.

906
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:20,404
You know,
we're going to get married...

907
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:23,157
once he saves up enough money
to get out of this...

908
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,159
sh-shit-hole.

909
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:27,703
Here, let me freshen
that up for you.

910
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:31,498
So what about you?

911
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,542
I mean, look.

912
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,961
That's one of my problems,
or one of my many problems.

913
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:41,675
I tell people my whole life history and
I don't even know a thing about them.

914
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:45,512
Ah. Well, I told you
my first name was Jake,

915
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:47,890
and, uh, I got two children.

916
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,434
Got a son.
His name is Jesus,

917
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:53,687
and, uh, got a daughter
named Mary.

918
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,898
Are you, like,
religious or something?

919
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:59,651
Oh, most definitely. Most defin--
Well, more so like, uh--

920
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:01,737
Well, spirituality too.

921
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:08,785
You really think
you're slick, huh?

922
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:11,788
I'm not talking anymore
about me until you...

923
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:13,999
start talking some more
about you.

924
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:18,003
All right. Well, um...

925
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:22,674
I like you, you know, uh,
fa--uh, Dakota.

926
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:26,803
And, uh...

927
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:29,556
I think that, uh...
I can help you.

928
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,478
You know, trying
to fuck me isn't going to help me.

929
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,981
-Okay?
-I ain't talking about
nothing like that.

930
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:41,318
Why do you all men think...
dick is the cure-all?

931
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,695
I don't know about all men,
but I don't even think like that.

932
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,656
-Oh, no?
-No.

933
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,658
-You got a dick, don't you?
-Without a doubt.

934
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:49,660
-You got balls, don't you?
-Both of them. Both of them.

935
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,995
You really
think you're slick, huh?

936
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,665
No. I don't think
nothing like that.

937
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:57,501
So you want to know
something about me, or not?

938
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,965
I'm sorry.

939
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:05,342
I talk too much.
That's what Sweetness always says.

940
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,472
Where's my wig?

941
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,474
Damn!

942
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:14,351
-You lost your wig?
-Where's my wig?

943
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,938
Oh, man.

944
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:19,940
Look under the bed.

945
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:23,986
Bingo. There it is.

946
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:27,156
-Thanks.
 -All right.

947
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,783
Anyway, uh, l, uh...

948
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:32,619
have a wife--
had a wife named Martha...

949
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:35,998
and, uh...
I love her very much.

950
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,208
Uh, I took her life.

951
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,836
I murdered her, and, uh...

952
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,088
I'm serving time
for that right now.

953
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:46,133
I still got a ways
to go, and, uh...

954
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:50,846
I guess it's like God is paying--
making me pay for my sins.

955
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,848
Fuck you.

956
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,768
Okay? You killed your wife?
I don't believe you.

957
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:59,563
Well, it don't matter, but,
you know, it's true, uh...

958
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:02,941
I'm on a kind of a...
work release program.

959
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:11,116
Well, here we are, huh?

960
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,243
Both fucked-up people.

961
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:22,294
...kept his mouth shut before the game.

962
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,338
Let's go to the Garden.

963
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,757
First quarter, Knicks up one.
Jordan for three?

964
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,468
Boo-yeah!
M.J. got much game.

965
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:32,137
Beaucoup game
in the first quarter alone.

966
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,765
-Jesus.
-I don't know yet.

967
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:38,352
-No, it's me, baby. It's Lala.
-What time is it anyway?

968
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:40,354
It's like 1:00 a.m.
I'm really sorry it's so late,

969
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:42,481
but I really have
to speak to you.

970
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:46,026
-Honey, I really need you to meet with
that guy I was telling you about.
-Who?

971
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,862
-He still wants just
five minutes of your time.
-What's his name again?

972
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:53,367
D'Andre Mackey.
He's a good brother also.

973
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,327
-He's a good brother?
-Yeah.

974
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,329
I don't know.
I was dreaming.

975
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,292
I don't know, Lala.

976
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,294
I'll get in trouble
for this.

977
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:06,588
Look, I told you he's a really
good friend of the family,

978
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:10,884
and... it would mean
a lot to me.

979
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:12,886
So, please?

980
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,597
All right, all right. Just let
me go back to sleep, okay?

981
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,976
-Okay. I'll arrange everything.
-I'll see you tomorrow at school.

982
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,936
Good night.

983
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,605
-Jesus?
-What?

984
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:26,942
-I love you.
-I love you too.

985
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:30,112
So, what did he say?

986
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:32,156
He's down whenever
you want to meet.

987
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:36,076
Let's go, Shuttlesworth!

988
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:39,496
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

989
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,957
-Morning, Jake.
-Hey, what's happening?

990
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:47,546
What time is it?

991
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:50,966
Time for you to get
your ass out of bed.

992
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:54,052
You see, if I was you, I wouldn't
spend too much time sleeping.

993
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,389
-Well, you ain't me, is you?
-That's right. I haven't killed anybody.

994
00:59:57,472 --> 01:00:00,434
-Yet.
-Why you got to take it there, Spivey?

995
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:03,228
Come on, everybody, let's be friends.

996
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:06,356
You know, it's
Tuesday morning, and time is flying.

997
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,067
You trying to make me feel better?
I know what day it is.

998
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:12,279
I don't want you to lose track of time.
You see, we're on a tight schedule.

999
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,573
We can all go back early,
if you just...

1000
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,617
decide to give it up.

1001
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,619
Throw in the towel.

1002
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,413
You know, you haven't had
too much success with your son yet.

1003
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:23,999
-Have you?
-Come on now. Leave the man alone.

1004
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,752
It's not over till it's over,
till the fat lady sings.

1005
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:29,046
That's right. That's right.
So since I'm on the clock,

1006
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,632
if you two gentlemen don't mind,
can I get on with my day?

1007
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:34,801
We're leaving.

1008
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:38,805
-Just doing our job, baby.
-We all happy in our work, ain't we?

1009
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:42,059
Y'all want some breakfast?

1010
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:45,229
Naw, naw, naw. We had the continental
over at the Marriott.

1011
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,565
-Yeah? Ain't as good as this though.

1012
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,945
Give me one at a time,
one at a time.

1013
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:54,947
-Can I have your autograph?
-Back up.

1014
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,242
Hey, yo, back up! Hey, back up,
back up! Let the man breathe.

1015
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:01,161
Give him some air.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.

1016
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,498
You want his autograph now, 'cause it's
going to be worth big money real soon.

1017
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,375
Now go on.
Hey, man, back up!

1018
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,377
Here you go.
Here you go, partner.

1019
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,755
Take it easy, Booger.
It's gonna be all right.

1020
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,757
I'll take care of you,
all right? See?

1021
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:16,385
I wonder where the hell
this bus is. Damn!

1022
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:18,470
-For whom the final bell tolls 
-Whoo!

1023
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:21,640
-Big Time, what's up, baby?

1024
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:23,433
-What up, J-man?
-You got it.

1025
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:26,728
You not rolling public transportation
with all these knuckleheads.

1026
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:29,064
Big Time Willie, that's what I've been
trying to tell him but he won't listen.

1027
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:31,859
-I like to ride the bus.
These are my people.
-Hey, what's up with Jake?

1028
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,153
-These are my peeps right here.
-Yo, man, it's your pops.

1029
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:37,322
How are you doing, son?
Can I talk to you for a second?

1030
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:40,075
-One-on-one--
-Naw. Boog, get in the fucking car.

1031
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,744
We late for school.
Get in the fucking car, now.

1032
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:44,872
-Son--
-Hey, don't push me, man.

1033
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:48,917
-Can I talk to you, son?
-I don't know. You'll see me around.

1034
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,170
-Just off the back--
-Bye, Uncle Jake.

1035
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,881
Go ahead. Take off.

1036
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:56,383
-Smack me if I'm wrong--
-Big Time!

1037
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:02,055
So you want me to talk
to your pops, man?

1038
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,057
He's stressing you out, I see.

1039
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,852
I'll talk to him, man. I'll handle him.
Just give me the word.

1040
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,854
I can handle my own
business, all right?

1041
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,690
Yeah? You can handle it?
All right, J-man, handle it.

1042
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:13,901
You know, your pops,
bugged out as he is right now,

1043
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,487
back in the day,
he could play some ball, yeah.

1044
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,073
Did you know that? Huh?
Did you know that?

1045
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:24,703
-He knows.
-Yeah. Let's slide off to A.C., J-man.

1046
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:27,206
-What's up, Jesus!
-Atlantic City, my treat.

1047
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,583
-We got school.
-J-man.

1048
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:31,585
-A.C.--
-Like my cousin said, we got school.

1049
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,587
Right. My bad, my bad.

1050
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:36,340
Hey, can't be fucking with
y'all's education, right? Yeah.

1051
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:39,092
-So where you going to school, man?
You made up your mind?
-Not yet.

1052
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:41,303
Look, you pygmy motherfucker--

1053
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:43,680
-I'm not a pygmy.
-You want to walk to school?

1054
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:45,390
Big Time, it's cool.

1055
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,935
I'll kick your ass
out to the curb right now.

1056
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:49,770
I mean, my bad and all, my bad,

1057
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,523
but don't make me get violent
early in the morning.

1058
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:54,983
-Really. I ain't had my coffee.
-Be cool, all right?

1059
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:58,111
You know it's no coincidence
motherfuckers don't be fucking
with you, right?

1060
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:01,114
Starting beefs with you,
starting shit with you.

1061
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:03,367
You know.

1062
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:05,953
-As jealous as niggers is
around here, like that nigger.
-Jesus!

1063
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,372
Look, the reason
why nobody...

1064
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:11,208
fucks with you is 'cause Big Time Willie
put the word out, all right?

1065
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,545
-Oh, you did?
-Big Time Willie told motherfuckers...

1066
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,088
they be fucking with the J,

1067
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,799
they're gonna wake up dead
in the Atlantic Ocean.

1068
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:22,386
Look, I hate to break it
down to you this way,

1069
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:25,806
but it's not 'cause
they love you, man.

1070
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:31,145
Huh? The bigger a nigger get up in this
motherfucker, the more they hate you.

1071
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,647
All right? I mean,
you can play ball and all that,

1072
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:37,234
but, shit, that don't mean shit
to these niggers 'round here;
put a cap in your ass.

1073
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:41,113
Just on G.P. That's on the strength.
So you gotta watch your back.

1074
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:43,991
-Oh, so I should thank you then, huh?
-I don't give a fuck.

1075
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:46,451
I just want you to know
what the tick-tock is.

1076
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,453
He knows.

1077
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:51,456
Yeah.

1078
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,002
You know, a lot of great ballplayers
came out of Coney Island,

1079
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,504
but most of them
didn't amount to shit.

1080
01:03:57,546 --> 01:04:00,090
-What about Stephon Marbury?
He made it.
-Oh, true that, true that.

1081
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:04,469
-Yeah, but he's one of the few.
-If he can make it out here, so can l.

1082
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:07,472
-Yeah? You're gonna make it?
-Yeah, I'm gonna make it.

1083
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:11,101
You're gonna make it out like the rest
of these niggers out here, in a casket.

1084
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:14,980
First thing that's gonna take you out
is these drugs they got for you.

1085
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:18,734
And you got the cocaine,
heroin, crack cocaine.

1086
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:23,322
You got the uppers, the downers,
the chiva, crystal meth.

1087
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:26,533
Acid.
We got the nicotine for you.

1088
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:28,744
Huh? You don't want
none of that?

1089
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:31,747
And don't forget about
the alcohol, baby.

1090
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:35,709
Yeah, we got that malt liquor,
a.k.a. "liquid crack."

1091
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,754
Get that motherfucker.

1092
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,299
Just for you, black man.

1093
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:45,427
You see that shit be advertised
up and down Park Avenue?

1094
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:48,597
Fuck, no!

1095
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,642
Why do you fuck with me,
you fucking bitches?

1096
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:55,521
I keep telling y'all,
stop fucking with me.

1097
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:57,606
Oh, and they got the other
thing for you, man.

1098
01:04:57,648 --> 01:04:59,858
Yeah, I almost forgot.


1099
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,860
They got that pussy.

1100
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:03,946
-Give it to me, James.
-Take it.

1101
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,031
I know you know how to
spell that, don't you?

1102
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:08,033
-I do.
-How you spell it?

1103
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:09,868
-P-U-S--
-H.I.V.

1104
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:12,120
-Oh, baby, fuck me hard.
-Look at 'em come.

1105
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:17,000
He think 'cause he got that ball skill,
he goin' up in the N.B.A., he immune.

1106
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:20,879
How you gonna be immune to pussy?
Pussy be talking to you, Jesus.

1107
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:22,881
Pussy be saying,
pussy be saying,

1108
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,883
"Come on in, Jesus.
Just a little taste."

1109
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:26,593
How you gonna be immune
to that shit?

1110
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:29,429
-Feel so good.
-All that titty up in your face.

1111
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:32,975
All that good ass.
How you gonna be immune to that thigh?

1112
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:36,520
All those lips, all those hips?
All those honey dips?

1113
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:39,982
Come on, man. Be real.

1114
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:42,442
That shit will fuck
a nigger up quick.

1115
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:45,362
Deadly combination.
You know what I'm saying?

1116
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:48,282
And I didn't even mention
the bloodsucking leeches.

1117
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,325
Oh, yeah.

1118
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,661
The newfound family.

1119
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:56,623
Pygmy buzzards be hovering over you
trying to get that loose change.

1120
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:58,917
You know what I'm saying?
Huh?

1121
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:01,670
They talking about "l love you."
"Oh, I love you."

1122
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:04,756
-I love you.
-Oh, I love you, Jesus. Oh, I love you.

1123
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,091
-You know I love you.
-I love you.

1124
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:09,720
Te amo. Jess, te amo.

01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,723

-Good block, baby.

1142
01:06:54,765 --> 01:06:56,475
-Ball out, man.
-What?

1143
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,393
-What you mean, what?
You fouled the fuck out of me.
-That was our ball!

1144
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,395
You fouled me. It's the only way
you're gonna block my shot anyway.

1145
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,397
You fouled me, you fouled me.
Boo-hoo!

1146
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:05,234
-Always crying.
-You the crybaby, you little
church-going motherfucker.

1147
01:07:05,317 --> 01:07:07,069
That's why I don't like
playing with your ass, son.

1148
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:09,822
You swear you Jordan up in this piece.
You foul motherfuckers too.

1149
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:12,616
-Man, shut your--
-Fuck the call.

1150
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:15,118
-Give me the damn ball!
-Here, you want the ball?

1151
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,329
Go get it!

1152
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:19,331
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit.

1153
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:21,583
-Yo, I made that shit.
-That's a million-dollar shot, baby.

1154
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:24,253
-Goddamn!
-Jesus!

1155
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:26,588
-Coach is back.
-I need to see you in my office now.

1156
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:29,967
-So what's up, Coach?
-You know, I don't want
to keep busting your balls,

1157
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:32,261
but you got any idea where you're
going to go with this thing?

1158
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,471
I mean, kid,
an inkling, anything?

1159
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,974
-Naw, I don't know yet.
-You're not holding out on me, are you?

1160
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:39,935
No, Coach, you know I wouldn't do that
to you. I just don't know yet.

1161
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:43,272
I'll know on Monday morning.
I still have to weigh my options.

1162
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:45,816
Do me a favor.
Go lock the door.

1163
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:47,818
Lock the door.

1164
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:05,043
-Sit down.
-What's that?

1165
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:07,421
Sit down, Jesus.
Sit down.

1166
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:11,341
It's, uh--it's a little
package to help you...

1167
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:14,887
-maybe make your decision before Monday.
-I don't need that.

1168
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,389
Buddy, you know what this is?

1169
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:19,641
-What?
-That's $10,000.

1170
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:23,103
Huh? Take it.
10,000 "braziuls."

1171
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:26,190
Hey, hey, you know how much
Hilfiger this buys?

1172
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:29,651
Come on.

1173
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,653
It's yours. Don't be
afraid of it. Take it.

1174
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:33,947
-I can't take that.
-What do you mean? You been taking it.

1175
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:36,241
-I can't take it.
-You've been taking, kid.

1176
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:39,828
You told me before that it was
just a loan, didn't you?

1177
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:41,747
You're talking semantics here.

1178
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:46,251
Jesus, the fact remains, you took
the do-re-mi, pal. Think back with me.

1179
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:48,795
You remember that little problem
you had with Calculus?

1180
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:51,173
You remember the grade
you couldn't get?

1181
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,092
Coach bumped that up a bit for you.
You passed the course, didn't you?

1182
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:57,888
-Yeah.
-Your "dusanikbats" uncle.
You had to get out of his house.

1183
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,558
Within one week, a truck came and
moved you and your kid sister out.

1184
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,894
I ever bring that up?

1185
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:06,063
Never a word out of me.
Always there for you.

1186
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:08,065
Am I lying? Come on, kid.

1187
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,067
Come on, please, will you?

1188
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:12,402
I'm not asking you to commit a homicide
here. I'm asking you to just give me...

1189
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:14,446
a little bit of information.
I need something--anything.

1190
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,448
I ain't got nothing
to say, Coach.

1191
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,909
When I was a kid, my mother used to
go, "Arthur, you're a capo tost."

1192
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:21,161
-You know what a "capo tost" is?
-Naw.

1193
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:23,163
It means you got a head
like concrete.

1194
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:26,375
I think me and you, we suffer from
the same affliction. I swear to God.

1195
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,669
Kid, on the court, you're the most
coachable kid I ever had.

1196
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,671
I never had a boy
that could respond like you.

1197
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:32,923
Off the court,
I can't tell you a damn thing.

1198
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:35,175
This is your money.
Hey, this is yours.

1199
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:37,636
-I don't need that money, Coach.
-Tell me something.

1200
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,638
I got Calculus.

1201
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:42,766
You forgot something.

1202
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:22,764
Yeah.

1203
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,101
Mm, right there.

1204
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,612
Oh, yeah.

1205
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:00,302
-Mr. Shuttlesworth, how are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

1206
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:02,888
-Dom Pagnotti. Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1207
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,890
-Hello, Lala.
-Hello.

1208
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:07,100
-D'Andre, what's up?
-How you doing?

1209
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:09,978
-Why don't we go inside?
I'll show you my house.
-We'd love to.

1210
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:13,649
-Wow. This a phat crib.
-Ain't it?

1211
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:17,027
-What do you think?
-You have a really nice home.

1212
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:19,530
Thank you. I just did it.
Built it from scratch.

1213
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:21,532
-It's gorgeous.
-Thank you.

1214
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:24,827
Why don't you and Lala make
yourself at home and let me
and Jesus discuss some business.

1215
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:30,165
This right here
is a 355 Ferrari Spider, $130,000.

1216
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:34,169
You're looking at
a 12-cylinder Mercedes, 600 SL--

1217
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:36,171
$135,000.

1218
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:39,758
Now, if you want the best,
Jesus, you come right this way.

1219
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,928
A quarter-million-dollar
Lamborghini Diablo.

1220
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:44,930
-Take a look inside, Jesus.
-You can get a house
with a quarter million dollars.

1221
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,932
Not the house
I'm going to get you.

1222
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,934
-You like music?
-I love music.

1223
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:52,646
-Has a $30,000 stereo system.
State of the art.
-$30,000?

1224
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:55,774
30,000. That's a small trailer home
in North Carolina...

1225
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,943
you got playing music
for you right there.

1226
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,945
Now, Jesus,
I know you like Lala.

1227
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:02,656
Whatever may be may be.
But you can look like Buddy Hackett...

1228
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:05,534
and drive down a street with this
and have 40 girls chasing you.

1229
01:12:05,576 --> 01:12:07,578
I want to show you my court.

1230
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,080
Oh, so you just got the court
built inside the house, huh?

1231
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:12,207
-Of course.
-Let's go one-on-one.

1232
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:14,251
-Let's see what you got.
-What I got?

1233
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,253
-Let's see what you got.
-I got--

1234
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,967
So you in the Mafia.
Down with Gotti, huh?

1235
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,052
Mafia? Gotti?

1236
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:28,015
Just because I'm an Italian American
doesn't mean I'm involved with the mob.

1237
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:30,726
I'm the best at what I do.
I'm a sports agent.

1238
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:32,769
Now, I don't know
if you realize this,

1239
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:35,898
but several NBA teams
are interested in you right now.

1240
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,900
At this point in time,
I can't tell you who,

1241
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:39,943
but I will tell you
they are contenders.

1242
01:12:39,985 --> 01:12:42,696
Now, I know you've considered
jumping straight to the pros.

1243
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,198
The money is there.

1244
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:47,910
I have the contacts.
So apply for the NBA draft now.

1245
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,704
Right here, Jesus,
is a contract.

1246
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:52,706
This makes me your agent.

1247
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:54,708
This allows me
to represent you.

1248
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,418
I will take you to the top.

1249
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,962
I can't do that right now.
I have to weigh my options.

1250
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:02,341
-How much does your watch cost?
-89.95.

1251
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:05,135
89.95. Right here...

1252
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:07,846
is a platinum
and diamond Rolex.

1253
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,599
The best you can buy.

1254
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:14,019
Gold? Forget about it.
Silver? Forget about it.

1255
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:18,857
You have platinum and diamonds. That's
like having speed and power in the NBA.

1256
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:22,361
And, Jesus, that watch is a gift
from Dom Pagnotti to you.

1257
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:24,822
-Keep it.
-Oh, I bet there's strings
attached, too, huh?

1258
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:28,033
There's no strings, no rubber bands.
There's nothing attached at all.

1259
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:32,663
That's a $36,000 watch. That's like
having a Corvette on your wrist.

1260
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:35,499
-You keep that.
-I can't take this.

1261
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:36,792
-Why not?
-It's illegal. I can't take it.

1262
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,169
I don't see anyone here.
Just me and you.

1263
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:41,588
-There's nobody here,
but it's still illegal.
-You know what, Jesus?

1264
01:13:41,672 --> 01:13:44,132
I'll keep it. The money
you and I gonna make together,

1265
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:46,677
you could buy 20 of them
if you want.

1266
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:52,057
Yeah, that's all good
and everything, but when I'm ready,

1267
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:54,977
-I'm thinking about hiring
a brother to represent me.
-Yeah? Why's that?

1268
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,979
I just feel comfortable
with a brother.

1269
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,605
All right, Jesus,
let me ask you a question.

1270
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:00,941
-What color is this?
-It's green.

1271
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,986
You're black, I'm white,
this is green.

1272
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:09,491
When making a business decision,
the only color that matters is green.

1273
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,578
Now, do you consider yourself
a man or a boy?

1274
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:14,663
-Of course I consider myself a man.
-Okay.

1275
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:17,332
Because men make decisions
with their mind.

1276
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:20,002
Boys make decisions
with their heart, Jesus.

1277
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:23,130
-My partner D'Andre, he's black.
-No!

1278
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,132
So it really doesn't matter.

1279
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:27,843
You have the best
of both worlds.

1280
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,096
You need to sign with me,
and you need to sign with me now.

1281
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,684
-You talk a great game.
-Jesus, this isn't a game. This is life.

1282
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,978
I can bring you
to the Promised Land,

1283
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,898
but what you need to do, Jesus,
is give me the opportunity...

1284
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,983
to show you how good I am.

1285
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:56,413
Dear Jesus,
your daddy and I hope you're fine.

1286
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:58,415
"l thought it might be
a little hard for you...

1287
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:01,335
"being away from home for--
for the first time.

1288
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:03,337
I had no idea that--"

1289
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,381
I didn't even know
they had basketball camps.

1290
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:10,427
Thank God I got you out of Coney Island
for at least a week this summer.

1291
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:13,347
"You're really serious
about this basketball,

1292
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,349
and that's good."

1293
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:18,018
However, I do wonder sometimes...

1294
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,813
whether it's you or your father
that wants to pursue this.

1295
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:23,065
I know he drives you
too hard.

1296
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:25,108
That's right. Come on,
come on. Work, baby.

1297
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,110
You got to work harder
than the next man, right?

1298
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:29,822
It's the will of the man;
it ain't the skill of the man.

1299
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:32,157
He can't play you.
He can't do nothing with you!

1300
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:34,952
We the only two people up. Me, you and
Michael Jordan. That's the only people.

1301
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,954
Everybody else in the world is asleep.

1302
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:40,249
What you think Jordan doing right now?
He lifting weights right now.

1303
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,793
We out the projects, baby.
We out the projects.

1304
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:46,547
Where we gonna live at, son? Where
we living at, yo? Where we living at?

1305
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:48,924
Huh? We living on East Side.
Where we at?

1306
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:52,344
We're up on the Upper West Side?
Central Park West somewhere?

1307
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:55,889
-Where we gonna be at, huh?
What you gonna buy Mama, son?
-House.

1308
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:57,891
Come on.
A big house, right?

1309
01:15:57,975 --> 01:15:59,935
How many bedrooms?
How many bedrooms?

1310
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:01,979
-How many she want?
-As many as she wants.

1311
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,273
Don't never let them see you weak.
Let me tell you something.

1312
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:06,650
-Don't never let them see you weak.
-This is for everything.

1313
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,986
You miss, you know
you givin' me ten pushups, right?

1314
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,822
You know if you miss, you
give me ten pushups, right?

1315
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,824
-All right, show me what you got.

1316
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:16,618
Concentrate.

1317
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,496
Four... three... two--

1318
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,835
That's what I'm talking about. That's
what I'm talking about. Are you tired?

1319
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:27,337
Jesus Shuttlesworth, he got game.
He don't get tired.

1320
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:30,799
-Are you tired? You tired?
-Uh-huh.

1321
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:33,218
"But, son, your father
does love you dearly."

1322
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,304
-You should have seen your boy today.
-What did he do?

1323
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:38,307
-What'd you get them for, son?
-About 34 points.

1324
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:40,309
-Thirty-four.
-Thirty-four points?

1325
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:43,020
You got 34, but one time
he went up, I was like, "Oh, my boy."

1326
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:45,355
-I thought he was gonna dunk.
He just kept going.
-Really?

1327
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,984
He kept going. He's almost getting the
rim now, or the net, anyway--the net.

1328
01:16:49,026 --> 01:16:52,112
-That's my baby.
-That's right. My boy.

1329
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:55,157
"Have fun at the camp,
and remember--"

1330
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,035
Use basketball as a tool.

1331
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:00,162
"Love, Mommy."

1332
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:04,374
"P.S.--Your sister
misses you badly."

1333
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:08,337
And when you get home,
please be nice to her.

1334
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,923
Big brothers have to protect
their little sisters.

1335
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:07,146
Come on, baby.

1336
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:10,149
-Don't hold back, baby.
-Oh, oh, yeah, oh.

1337
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:13,986
No, baby, come on. Don't hold back.

1338
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:16,155
Come on, baby.

1339
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,157
Oh, yeah, baby.
Fuck me now.

1340
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,117
Fuck me. Oh, yeah.

1341
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,495
Yeah. Come on, baby.

1342
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:29,209
Come on, baby, come on.
Fuck me, baby.

1343
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:34,381
Where them elbows at?
Give me the elbows. Make me pay for it.

1344
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:37,426
Make me pay if I get too close.
Make me pay!

1345
01:18:37,468 --> 01:18:39,678
Yes. All right,
good shoot! Oh!

1346
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:41,680
-All right.
-All right, that's two.

1347
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:43,724
-Two-zip.
-Two-zip.

1348
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:46,643
I'll give you ten.

1349
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:49,396
He's cheating, Jesus.

1350
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,859
Come on now. Play ball.

1351
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:56,945
Just 'cause a man bigger than you,
don't mean he better than you.

1352
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:58,864
Whoo-hoo!

1353
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:06,538
Play some "D" now.

1354
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,540
Get up on him, Jesus.

1355
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:10,459
Money.
What's that, baby?

1356
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:14,338
-Ask Goose.
-What was that, ten-one?

1357
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:17,633
-Ten-two? Butter.
-Luck.

1358
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,635
You ain't ready for me.

1359
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:22,679
Come on, Jesus.
Get up on him, Jesus.

1360
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:24,973
-Check it out.
-Check 'em.

1361
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:27,601
-Don't push me.
-So what I push you? So what?

1362
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,645
You're gonna get mad
when you get pushed?

1363
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:31,814
What, you wanna quit
when you get pushed?

1364
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,857
-Oh!
-Take your shot.

1365
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,151
I could take you out
your game that easy, huh?

1366
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:38,237
So somebody gets up on you.
So what?

1367
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,280
-Stop pushing him, man.
-You got to deal with that, son.

1368
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:43,617
You mad? That's all the players got
to do to you, is make you mad, huh?

1369
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:47,162
All they gotta do is make you mad
and you'll give up, won't you?

1370
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:49,206
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't play.

1371
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:51,291
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't make a shot.

1372
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:55,337
Come get it now.
I ain't taking it easy on you.

1373
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,632
I told you I ain't taking it easy
on you. Where you at, boy?

1374
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:00,801
J-J, come on,
give the guy a break, man.

1375
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:03,262
Come on,
go strong, Jesus.

1376
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:05,264
-Why you cheating, man?
-How did I cheat?

1377
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,808
-Don't tell me how to raise my son.
-Stop pushing me.

1378
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:10,644
So I'm pushing you. So what?
Show me what you got.

1379
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,146
Stop pushing me.

1380
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:14,148
-Take it! Take it!
-Go strong, baby.

1381
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:16,316
-Like nobody's better than you!
-I'm supposed to be scared?

1382
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,485
Yes. That's what
I'm talking about.

1383
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,196
No matter what I say to you, I ain't
got nothing to do with your game.

1384
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:23,198
It's between you
and the rim.

1385
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,200
Don't be afraid of nobody.
That's right.

1386
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:27,536
Elbow me if--
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1387
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:29,830
-Go strong.
-Get out of here.

1388
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:32,916
Go get it, the ball.
Go get it.

1389
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:38,714
-Whoa, whoa.
-Get up.

1390
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:41,675
-Foul, man!
-All right, you got foul. No harm.

1391
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:45,512
Respect my call. Besides, that wasn't
a foul. That was attempted murder!

1392
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:47,848
What you mean, respect your call?
Ain't nobody even hardly touch you.

1393
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:51,643
-What you trying to prove?
-Just get up, boy, and stop
crying. Give me the ball.

1394
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:53,896
-Give me the ball, man.
-What you doing?

1395
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:55,439
-Check it out--
-Hey, respect my call.

1396
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:59,026
-Besides, that wasn't a foul--
-Don't start yelling at me, boy.

1397
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:01,487
No harm. No foul.
Are you hurt? You bleeding?

1398
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,198
What you think? I want to see
you get pushed like that. Ow!

1399
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:06,283
-You gonna cry now or something?
-Why you got to push--Whoa!

1400
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:08,911
-Take the ball out. Huh?
-Man, I quit, man.

1401
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:13,540
-Man, I quit!
-You quit?

1402
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:16,502
-What?
-I quit. I'm out of here.

1403
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:18,837
Oh, you out of here now. You're
gonna quit like a little bitch, huh?

1404
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:21,298
Big bitch!

1405
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,509
You better go
and get my ball!

1406
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,469
-I ain't getting a damn thing!
-Jesus!

1407
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:28,597
-Daddy, leave me alone!
-Jake, that's some wrong shit, man.

1408
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,766
I'm out of here, man.

1409
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,310
Fuck, that's why
he ain't gonna make it.

1410
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,148
That's why he
ain't gonna make it.

1411
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:48,325
Damn, I can't believe he threw
that shit over the fence.

1412
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:10,180
What's the matter, baby?
You don't like the food.

1413
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:12,599
The food is fine.
Just not hungry.

1414
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:16,186
-Where's your daddy?
-I don't know, and I don't care.

1415
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:19,106
Uncle Jake must have beat him
in basketball again. Ow!

1416
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:22,359
-Stop hitting on him.
-Tell him to stop then. He
always getting on my nerves.

1417
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,361
No, I'm not going
to tell him to shut up,

1418
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:27,781
and these basketball wars between
you and your father have got to stop.

1419
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,619
I just asked your son
where you were.

1420
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:36,874
Don't they feed you
at home, Booger?

1421
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:38,876
How you doing, baby?

1422
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:48,051
Your food was getting cold,
so I put it in the oven.

1423
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:55,893
You know, when you threw that ball
over the fence, it got lost.

1424
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:58,020
You know that, right?

1425
01:22:58,061 --> 01:23:00,522
Paid my hard-earned money for that
basketball. You know that, don't you?

1426
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:02,608
We can always buy
a new basketball.

1427
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:05,027
Yeah, we don't need
a new ball, okay?

1428
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:07,029
We had a ball already.

1429
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,198
Besides, you need to learn how
to respect other people's property.

1430
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:12,659
Ball belonged to me,
not to him.

1431
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:24,254
-Mommy, can I be excused?
-No, you cannot. Sit your ass down.

1432
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:26,715
-I'm finished!
-Yeah, well, you ain't excused though.

1433
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:29,384
-He's done, Jake.
-I ain't done. Sit your black ass down.

1434
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:32,304
And it's time for you to go.
And put the bread back down.

1435
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:34,014
-Trying to sneak bread all the time.
-Bye, Jesus!

1436
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:37,100
I said sit down. I'm your daddy
and you're gonna do what I tell you.

1437
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,102
Don't raise your voice.

1438
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:41,647
Do what I tell you to do,
and I'm telling you to sit down.

1439
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:43,816
-So? I'm finished.
-What?

1440
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:45,776
-You hear what I say to you, huh?
-Jake!

1441
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:48,403
-Boy, when I tell you to sit down--
-Get off me!

1442
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,948
-When I tell you to sit down--
-Jake, get off him!

1443
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,659
-Get up off me!
-Get off him! What's wrong with you?

1444
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,620
Are you out of your mind?

1445
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:58,956
Stop it! Please!

1446
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:09,258
Baby?

1447
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:14,721
-Mommy? Mommy?
-Baby?

1448
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:18,642
-Get up. Get up.
-Wake up, baby.

1449
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:21,353
Baby, wake up.
Call 9-1-1, son.

1450
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:26,108
Call 9-1-1. Go ahead.
Call 9-1-1. Go, go.

1451
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:08,150
Come on, let's walk.

1452
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:16,658
I knew you was going to come though.
I appreciate it, though, son.

1453
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:20,204
Yeah, I appreciate you for coming
to meet me and everything like that.

1454
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:27,377
I got this for Mary here. You know,
I thought she might like these here.

1455
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:35,385
My all-time favorite ballplayer
was Earl Monroe.

1456
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:38,889
Earl the Pearl.

1457
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,767
Yeah, he was nice. See, everybody
remember him from the Knicks,

1458
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,977
you know, when he helped win
that second championship.

1459
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:47,189
I'm talking about when he was with the
Bullets down at Winston-Salem Stadium...

1460
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,942
before that game, with 42 points
a game the whole season.

1461
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:51,985
41.6...

1462
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,823
the whole season.

1463
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:58,700
But the Knicks, they put the shackles on
him, man, you know, on his whole game.

1464
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:02,079
They locked him up,
like in a straitjacket or something.

1465
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:07,584
When he was in the streets of Philly,
the playgrounds,

1466
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:10,921
he was like--

1467
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,758
-You know what they called him?
-What?

1468
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:19,763
Jesus. That's what they called him--
Jesus. 'Cause he was the truth.

1469
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:24,768
Then the white media got a hold of it.
Then they got to call him Black Jesus.

1470
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:27,271
He can't just be Jesus.
He got to be Black Jesus.

1471
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:31,233
You know, but still...
he was the truth.

1472
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:38,282
So that's the real reason
why you got your name.

1473
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:41,285
You named me Jesus after Earl Monroe,
and not Jesus in the Bible?

1474
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:44,246
Not Jesus of the Bible,
Jesus of North Philadelphia.

1475
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:48,792
Jesus of the playgrounds.
That's the truth, son.

1476
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:51,128
The way he dished, the way
he, you know, he spinned.

1477
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:54,423
You know how you do,
coming off and all that. Taw!

1478
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:08,604
I want you to go
to Big State, son.

1479
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:11,607
That's the real reason
why I'm out here.

1480
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:14,443
That's the reason
they let me out.

1481
01:27:14,485 --> 01:27:17,946
You find it in your heart to go
to Big State, and, uh...

1482
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,950
they may let me out
on an early parole.

1483
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:23,952
-So that's what this is all about, huh?
-That's a part of it.

1484
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:26,288
-Jake, you just like everybody else.
-I ain't like everybody else.

1485
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,790
I ain't like everybody else.
Everybody else ain't your father.

1486
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:30,792
Everybody else ain't
bring you in this world.

1487
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:33,295
Everybody else don't care
about you, son.

1488
01:27:33,337 --> 01:27:35,964
Like that girl you running with.
You know her, Lay--Layla?

1489
01:27:36,006 --> 01:27:37,966
-Lala!
-Lala. You know her?

1490
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:41,637
-Yeah, I know her.
-Yeah, she know you like a book too.

1491
01:27:41,678 --> 01:27:45,474
Many a great man, son,
their downfall was 'cause of a woman.

1492
01:27:45,516 --> 01:27:47,643
-You talking about Samson and Delilah.
-Yeah, that's right.

1493
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:51,313
Him too. Him too.
You see I don't cut my hair, right?

1494
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,983
So you do know
your Bible, huh?

1495
01:27:55,025 --> 01:28:00,656
Look, son, just be careful.
That's all I'm saying to you, all right?

1496
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:02,825
All right?

1497
01:28:06,537 --> 01:28:09,248
Do you know if you're
gonna go to Big State?

1498
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:12,084
I mean, is that like a finalist,
or the final four for you?

1499
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,753
-They are in my top ten.
-In your top ten?

1500
01:28:14,837 --> 01:28:18,298
All right. That's good.
One out of ten, that's--

1501
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:21,593
I can live with them odds.

1502
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:24,304
-What's up, Booger?
-Hi, Uncle Jake.

1503
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:26,306
All right, I'm, uh--

1504
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:41,780
Just give that to Mary.

1505
01:28:48,537 --> 01:28:50,706
-What's up, Booger?
-What's up?

1506
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,293
She knows it's only a treat.

1507
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:57,129
She doesn't get it all the time.
Just once in a while.

1508
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:59,047
Aww.

1509
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:02,092
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1510
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:04,386
-Man, thank God it's Friday.
-Friday?

1511
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:06,054
You better thank God
you're here, man.

1512
01:29:06,138 --> 01:29:08,223
I'm just glad you was able
to make it, man.

1513
01:29:08,307 --> 01:29:10,392
Sorry it was
so last-minute though.

1514
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:13,812
Man, don't be crazy, man.
I know all the schools sweating you.

1515
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:16,273
-How many you visit?
-Four.

1516
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:18,775
You gonna take the extra
ten they gave you?

1517
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:21,278
-You know I don't need no ten visits.
-Yeah, right.

1518
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,530
Hi, Chick.

1519
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:25,532
-That was my last one.
-Yeah?

1520
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:27,743
Who was that?
She was sweating you.

1521
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:29,953
You like this?
You like this, don't you?

1522
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:32,080
-Yeah, it's really nice.
-Yeah, I could tell.

1523
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:36,668
This ain't the projects, man. We got
like grass and trees, and fresh air.

1524
01:29:36,752 --> 01:29:38,670
This is Morgan.
This is Monty.

1525
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:40,672
-How you doing?
-How you doing, Jesus?

1526
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:42,925
-We'll check you later.
-Later on. Them boys can play, man.

1527
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:44,968
What's up, Chick? Hey, Chick.

1528
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,970
Hey, girls, how you doing?

1529
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:48,972
-Hey.
-Oh, man.

1530
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:50,974
Mm!

1531
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:53,101
Goodness. I know the both
of y'all know Jesus Shuttlesworth.

1532
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:55,270
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

1533
01:29:55,354 --> 01:29:57,356
That's not right, Chick.
That's not right, Chick.

1534
01:29:57,439 --> 01:29:59,399
Hey, how about Sunday?
Take y'all out of church?

1535
01:29:59,483 --> 01:30:03,070
-Wait. You're Jesus of Coney Island?
-Yeah, that's me.

1536
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:05,239
Look, you've got to come
to this school.

1537
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:07,866
With you and Chick, we'll
definitely go to the Final Four.

1538
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,910
-Go? We'll win the whole thing.
-That's you, dog.

1539
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:12,079
-You are going to go here, aren't you?
-Well, we hope so.

1540
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:14,081
It's my job to convince him.

1541
01:30:14,164 --> 01:30:16,250
And this is his last
visit to any schools.

1542
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:19,461
-Jesus, Tech-U is a really cool place.
You will love it here.
-Really?

1543
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:23,090
-I mean, we really know how to party.
-Oh, you do?

1544
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,259
-Uh-oh.
-It's, uh, really cool.

1545
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:28,178
-I hope I see you around.
-All right.

1546
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:32,599
-Bye.
-Bye.

1547
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:35,269
-Bye, Chick.
-Bye, Chick.

1548
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,189
Come on. Let's go meet
Coach Billy Sunday, man.

1549
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:41,859
-Forget Billy Sunday.
We need to follow them.
-Man, he's a cool white boy.

1550
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:45,529
Now this is what I'm
talking about. Tech dome, baby!

1551
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:48,532
-Wow!
-Thousands of seats. Crowded, yo.

1552
01:30:48,574 --> 01:30:50,951
When they get in here,
they tear the roof off, yo.

1553
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:54,663
See those seats
down there, man?

1554
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,665
-Yeah?
-The ones in the front.

1555
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:59,084
That's where all the alumni sit,
with all the money, man.

1556
01:30:59,168 --> 01:31:03,005
-Where? Right here?
-Yeah, man. I even got
my favorite seat, right here.

1557
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:06,675
Wait. You can sit on mine.
I'm gonna warm this one up.

1558
01:31:06,758 --> 01:31:08,844
Feel that?
Feel the difference?

1559
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:13,223
Now, introducing--Number 34!

1560
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:19,396
From Coney Island,
Brooklyn, New York--

1561
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:24,276
Jee-suuus Shuttlesworth!

1562
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:04,942
Hello, son.
This is for you.

1563
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:06,443
Coach Sunday.

1564
01:32:06,527 --> 01:32:08,946
I hope that Chick here
has been a gracious host.

1565
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:11,156
Oh, Chick has been great.

1566
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,117
Good. 'Cause we really know how
to treat our student athletes right.

1567
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:16,745
-Isn't that right, Chick?
-Yeah, oh, yeah.

1568
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:18,789
Coach is telling
the truth, man.

1569
01:32:18,831 --> 01:32:22,918
I hope you don't think we're too forward
or aggressive with the highlight film...

1570
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:24,962
-or the jersey.
-No way.

1571
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:28,882
-That's the way we are here
at Tech U. We show love.
-Much love. Much love.

1572
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:30,384
Why beat around the bush?

1573
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:33,011
We scouted you since you were
in junior high school.

1574
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:35,806
We know all about you.
We love you.

1575
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,561
You're a great kid. Not only a
great ballplayer, a great student,

1576
01:32:40,644 --> 01:32:42,896
but a beautiful human being.

1577
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:46,900
When I read about how you've been
raising your sister all by yourself,

1578
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:49,278
it made me want to cry.

1579
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:52,823
I said to myself,
"That's the kind of young man...

1580
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:55,450
"that will be the backbone
of this great country,

1581
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:58,120
-not just the Tech University
basketball team."
-Tell it.

1582
01:32:58,203 --> 01:33:00,372
-You understand what I'm trying to say?
-Yes, sir.

1583
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:03,458
When I heard...
that you were coming to visit,

1584
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:12,301
I got down...
on my hands and knees...

1585
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:16,638
and I prayed to God.

1586
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:24,480
-Chick.
-Right here.

1587
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:27,816
-Dear Lord, please...
-Please.

1588
01:33:27,858 --> 01:33:29,902
deliver Jesus to us.

1589
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:34,990
I got down on my knees,
and I asked God...

1590
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:41,538
to let Tech University
be the throne of Jesus.

1591
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,625
As you already know, this will be
the most important decision...

1592
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:46,919
of your life
that you'll ever make.

1593
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:48,462
Yeah.

1594
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:52,090
Son... don't blow it.

1595
01:33:52,174 --> 01:33:54,343
-Hi, Chick. How you doing?
-Hey, what's up, Molly?

1596
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:55,719
-Hey, Chick.
-What's up, Liz?

1597
01:33:55,803 --> 01:33:59,056
-This is Jesus Shuttlesworth.
-Hi, Jesus.

1598
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:03,185
-We're glad you're here.
-We're having a little talk.

1599
01:34:03,227 --> 01:34:07,022
Let us finish, and then we can
get up with y'all later. All right?

1600
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:09,608
Okay. All right.
Nice meeting you.

1601
01:34:09,691 --> 01:34:11,610
-Bye.
-Nice seeing y'all.

1602
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:16,114
Mm!

1603
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:18,617
Lovely, huh?
Travel in packs too.

1604
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,370
Mm!

1605
01:34:22,871 --> 01:34:25,749
You hit those?

1606
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:27,709
-About 50% from the field.
-You lying.

1607
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:30,129
You can have the rest.
I swear. Look, man.

1608
01:34:30,212 --> 01:34:32,881
We got some serious freaks
up here in this piece, man.

1609
01:34:32,965 --> 01:34:35,217
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, Jesus.

1610
01:34:36,635 --> 01:34:38,637
I was into my black bag
also, man.

1611
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,306
Yo, I was keeping beautiful,
fine dark sisters.

1612
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:45,811
Nubian sisters. Africa.
The whole nine. I'm telling you, man.

1613
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:49,314
Well, you know,
I got a lady back in Brooklyn.

1614
01:34:49,398 --> 01:34:53,986
-Her name is Lala. We in love.
-I got a lady too.

1615
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:55,988
She at home,
and she ain't here.

1616
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:58,157
And I ain't talking about no love.
I'm talking about...

1617
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,325
these white freaks
here at Tech U, man.

1618
01:35:00,409 --> 01:35:02,411
They love some ball-playing
brothers, man.

1619
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:04,955
-Let you get your swerve on, man.
-I hear all that, but--

1620
01:35:04,997 --> 01:35:07,249
-What about the sisters?
-What about them?

1621
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:10,294
I love them, but they
make you work too hard, man.

1622
01:35:10,335 --> 01:35:13,088
Them white girls over there, man,
they do your dirty drawers.

1623
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:15,132
Wash 'em.
Cook for you.

1624
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:17,134
-Give you money, man.
-Nuh-uh!

1625
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,428
-Let you drive the Benz
their daddy bought.
-Oh, hell, no!

1626
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:21,180
-They go the extra mile, man.
-You lying.

1627
01:35:21,263 --> 01:35:23,265
You see Molly
over there, man?

1628
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:25,100
You can call her up at 4:00
in the morning, man.

1629
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,269
"Bitch, get over here.
Let me spank you."

1630
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:30,105
Man, before you hang the phone up,
she beating on the door.

1631
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:33,025
-You don't even got
to kick your own bed out.
-Man, you lying.

1632
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:35,777
-Buck!
-What's up, Buck?

1633
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:38,322
-Peace, bro! Peace.
-What's up, man?

1634
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,991
-We need to stay out in the hallway.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1635
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:43,744
-Everybody in the hallway.
-This is a party. It's a long hallway.

1636
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:46,914
You're good. Hey, where
the hell you at last night?

1637
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:50,125
Always messin' around.
That's why I can't mess with y'all, man.

1638
01:35:50,209 --> 01:35:52,294
-We need to be out here.
-Don't worry about that.

1639
01:35:52,377 --> 01:35:54,463
I want you meeting
the assistant coaches.

1640
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:58,509
-What are the assistant coaches
doing in the hallway?
-Yeah. Right here, man.

1641
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,636
Lines and choruses
Days full of Doris's

1642
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,389
Jesus, say hello
to Buffy and Suzie.

1643
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:07,309
-Don't worry about the names.
-What's up?

1644
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:11,104
Boy. I know you'll
take care of business.

1645
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:13,524
Brooklyn is in the house.

1646
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:16,610
Boy, keep it real.
Keep it real. It's up to you.

1647
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:19,279
-Do what a black man gotta do.
-Where you goin'?

1648
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:21,448
-Be right out here.
-You leavin'?

1649
01:36:21,532 --> 01:36:24,284
Holler if you need me, man.

1650
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:25,702
Hey there.

1651
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:27,871
-Sit down. Relax.
-Hi.

1652
01:36:27,955 --> 01:36:31,041
-Yeah. Sit down right here.
-Don't be nervous.

1653
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:34,461
Beats in the game of rap, put my soul
in it, care less about the gold in it

1654
01:36:34,545 --> 01:36:37,381
Boom the shottie
Got the motherfuckin' paparazzi

1655
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:39,883
-How're you doin'?
-I'm doin' fine.

1656
01:36:39,925 --> 01:36:41,885
-Yeah?
-Yeah. How are you?

1657
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:45,222
-Good. How do you like your stay so far?
-It's been wonderful.

1658
01:36:45,305 --> 01:36:46,974
He's so nervous.


1659
01:36:47,057 --> 01:36:49,351
He's so tense. Very sexy.

1660
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:54,690
I know. Just can't wait till next
season when you're going to school here.

1661
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:57,651
-Can you?
-I can't wait.

1662
01:36:57,734 --> 01:37:01,029
-I know. Hmm.
-I can't wait.

1663
01:37:01,113 --> 01:37:03,073
Oh, Jesus!

1664
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:05,993
Yes!

1665
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:11,707
Yes, Jesus! Oh!

1666
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,041
Eat it!

1667
01:37:33,312 --> 01:37:35,898
This guy, he's leaving me now.
He's right there.

1668
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:39,109
And I'm just gonna...
you know, do whatever.

1669
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:43,030
I'll call you later. I'll call
you later. All right. See you. Bye.

1670
01:37:43,113 --> 01:37:47,868
Hey, how you doin'? I'm Jake
Shuttlesworth. I'm Jesus's father.

1671
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:51,413
Yeah, how are you?

1672
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:56,585
-May I ask you a question,
talk to you about something?
-About what?

1673
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:59,755
Well, number one, my son, he loves you
very much. You know that, right?

1674
01:37:59,797 --> 01:38:04,301
-Yeah. I feel the same way.
-Do you? That's good. That's lovely.

1675
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:07,971
You haven't talked to him today?
Seen him, nothin' like that?

1676
01:38:08,055 --> 01:38:11,266
I was talkin' to him last night. He told
me that he was heading outta town today.

1677
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:14,019
I don't remember where he was sayin'
he was goin' 'cause I was half-asleep.

1678
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:15,979
-Nah, I haven't seen him.
-You sure?

1679
01:38:16,063 --> 01:38:18,065
-I haven't seen him.
-Okay.

1680
01:38:18,148 --> 01:38:20,567
Okay. He's waitin' for you?

1681
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:25,948
-He's my big brother.
-He's your big brother?

1682
01:38:27,241 --> 01:38:31,453
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I can see the resemblance.

1683
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:34,081
-What are y'all? Dominican? Cuban?
-No.

1684
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:36,542
-Borinquen, baby, thank you.
-Borinquen. Yeah, whatever.

1685
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,293
-So, like, listen, Layla--
-Lala.

1686
01:38:38,377 --> 01:38:39,837
-Whatever.
-That's my name.

1687
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,840
Whatever they payin' you,
I can do better than that.

1688
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:45,676
Pay whom what? You ain't got
no real money anyway anyhow.

1689
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:48,137
You ain't got to say that to me.
School's out. You know what I'm sayin'?

1690
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:51,181
Here's what I'm sayin'.
We can help each other, all right?

1691
01:38:51,223 --> 01:38:54,810
You ain't got to play games with me.
Just listen to me for a second.

1692
01:38:54,852 --> 01:38:56,812
We can help each other.

1693
01:38:56,854 --> 01:39:00,524
If we work together, we can both get
what we want. You know what I'm sayin'?

1694
01:39:00,607 --> 01:39:03,527
Look, I don't know who you
been talking to or who you think I am,

1695
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:06,530
but I'm the only one here who really,
really cares about Jesus.

1696
01:39:06,613 --> 01:39:08,198
-Is that right?
-Yes.

1697
01:39:08,282 --> 01:39:10,200
-Why don't you help me then,
since you really care about him?
-No.

1698
01:39:10,284 --> 01:39:12,953
What you need to do is let go of my arm.
Let go of my arm!

1699
01:39:13,036 --> 01:39:14,997
-No disrespect. No disrespect.
-Thank you.

1700
01:39:15,038 --> 01:39:18,333
I think you heard
what she's saying.

1701
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,919
Look, son, why don't you--
What you got there, a Range Rover?

1702
01:39:21,003 --> 01:39:23,088
-"Son"?
-Why don't you get in your Range Rover.

1703
01:39:23,172 --> 01:39:25,424
-You ain't my pops.
-Don't be trying to blow up the spot!

1704
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:27,468
I'm not trying
to disrespect you--

1705
01:39:27,551 --> 01:39:31,597
Huh? I didn't hear what you said.

1706
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,932
-What you say?
-D'Andre!

1707
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,935
-You can't talk now, huh?

1708
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:39,605
Are you okay?

1709
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:43,358
D'And--D'Andre?

1710
01:39:43,442 --> 01:39:45,402
What do you want, what do you need
What will you find

1711
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:47,529
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep
Open your mind

1712
01:39:47,613 --> 01:39:50,949
I hope this rhyme gets you in time
in space, come to a different place

1713
01:39:51,033 --> 01:39:53,243
Will you hear spiritual lyrical
knowledge in your face to face

1714
01:39:53,327 --> 01:39:56,038
Like welfare In these rappers' lyrics
they need health care

1715
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:59,291
Does KRS represent heaven
Hell, yeah

1716
01:39:59,374 --> 01:40:02,586
Let me take you elsewhere where
you stand is a curse there for sure

1717
01:40:02,669 --> 01:40:04,463
Unless you're mature, grow up

1718
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:06,965
If you're immature
then you live in sinister

1719
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:09,218
-Booger. Booger, what's happenin'?
-Hey, hey.

1720
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:11,261
-How you doin', man? You all right?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1721
01:40:11,303 --> 01:40:13,263
-Everything's good?
-Ah, you know, it's all right.

1722
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:15,766
-Yeah. Seen my son?
-No, I ain't seen him.

1723
01:40:15,808 --> 01:40:17,392
-You ain't seen him?
-I ain't seen him.

1724
01:40:17,476 --> 01:40:19,561
Lyin' motherfucker.
You've seen him. Where he at?

1725
01:40:19,645 --> 01:40:22,689
-You're lyin', nigger. Where's he at?
-I'm not lyin', Uncle Jake.

1726
01:40:22,773 --> 01:40:25,692
Yeah, all the times you ever been

1727
01:40:25,776 --> 01:40:27,694
-Where is he at?
-I talked to him yesterday.

1728
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:29,988
-Where'd he say he was goin'?
-Yo, yo! Balloons. Two for a dollar.

1729
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:32,658
-Get the fuck outta here.
-Let go. You're hurting my--

1730
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:35,327
All right. I'm sorry.
You want some of this here?

1731
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:38,872
My bad. It's my bad.
You all right? You straight?

1732
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:41,375
-You got some money?
-No. No.

1733
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,877
Public Enemy on the disk
Unstoppable

1734
01:40:43,961 --> 01:40:46,213
Runnin' the game Chuck and Kris

1735
01:40:46,296 --> 01:40:49,383
-These are good!
-Mm-hmm.

1736
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:52,553
-I can eat 20 of these.
-Unstoppable Public Enemy on the disk

1737
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,055
Unstoppable
You don't wanna take the risk

1738
01:40:55,139 --> 01:40:57,057
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.

1739
01:40:57,141 --> 01:40:59,101
-How's it goin', my man?
-Oh, good, good.

1740
01:40:59,143 --> 01:41:01,145
That's good.
You want a hot dog?

1741
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:05,065
Uh, naw, naw. Yo, uh, Borinquen,

-Okay, you got it.
-Yeah, it's, uh--

1743
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:11,905
Not as fast as I expected, but it's
all gonna work out; I feel that.

1744
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:14,366
When's your son
comin' back into town?

1745
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:16,368
Y'all heard about that?

01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:19,746
Oh, yeah,

01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:22,249
-Look, I need some money.
-Mm-hmm.

1748
01:41:22,332 --> 01:41:25,252
You know, an advance or something
like that? I'm broke.

1749
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:28,255
I hope you're not lookin' to buy no
plane, train or bus ticket outta here.

1750
01:41:28,338 --> 01:41:30,757
-Naw, nothin' like that.
-You're tryin' to pull a fast one on us?

1751
01:41:30,841 --> 01:41:32,885
-It's just I met a friend.
-Female friend?

1752
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:36,513
A female friend, and I'd like to take
her someplace other than Nathan's.

1753
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:40,350
Invite her up for one of them grilled
cheese sandwiches and orange soda.

1754
01:41:40,434 --> 01:41:42,394
Now, I know you haven't fell...

1755
01:41:42,478 --> 01:41:44,521
for that broken-down 'ho
you been messin' around with.

1756
01:41:44,605 --> 01:41:47,149
-What is a "'ho"?
Is that like a gardening tool?
-'Ho, man. Whore.

1757
01:41:47,232 --> 01:41:49,193
Bitch that sells pussy.
Right, Jake?

1758
01:41:49,234 --> 01:41:54,698
She ain't no bitch and she ain't no 'ho.
The lady's name is Dakota. Dakota.

1759
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:57,242
All right, Jake.
You don't have to get defensive.

1760
01:41:57,326 --> 01:42:00,537
We know you've been locked up
five and a half years. Pussy is pussy.

1761
01:42:00,621 --> 01:42:03,207
That's some
hard shit, my man, you know?

1762
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:05,793
No poontang
in five and a half years.

1763
01:42:05,876 --> 01:42:08,212
I know you ain't been out
messin' around with them little boys.

1764
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:10,547
-I ain't messin' with no little boys.
-Nobody tossed your salad?

1765
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:12,716
Ain't nobody did
a motherfuckin' thing.

1766
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,511
-I read in prison...
-I didn't engage in no
homosexual activities.

1767
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:17,554
-that the guy who's doin' it--
-Y'all gonna give me the money?

1768
01:42:17,596 --> 01:42:20,390
Not the guy who's gettin' it up the
old kazoo, but the guy who's doin' it,

1769
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:23,018
he doesn't consider himself
to be a faggot.

1770
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:25,229
-Crudup.
-You think that's true?

1771
01:42:25,312 --> 01:42:27,815
Crudup. Just make sure
she's clean, my man.

1772
01:42:27,898 --> 01:42:31,860
That could be some dirty-ass pussy.
Go and knock yourself out.

1773
01:42:31,944 --> 01:42:33,904
Thank you.

1774
01:42:34,071 --> 01:42:36,990
It's all the film thing,
baby. It's all the film thing.

1775
01:42:37,074 --> 01:42:39,660
You see what I'm sayin'?
Lights, camera, action!

1776
01:42:39,743 --> 01:42:41,662
All right, Sweetness.
Here we go, baby.

1777
01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:44,706
-I'm makin' you some money tonight.
-Hey, baby.

1778
01:42:44,748 --> 01:42:47,209
How much for a blow job?
You wanna go for a ride?

1779
01:42:47,251 --> 01:42:49,211
You wanna have some fun?

1780
01:42:49,253 --> 01:42:52,464
-I wanna get my swerve on.
-Wanna go out?

1781
01:42:56,093 --> 01:43:00,389
Hey, baby,
you wanna party with me tonight?

1782
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:02,391
This is my last 20 bucks.

1783
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:04,726
You take that $20
back to your wife, honey.

1784
01:43:04,768 --> 01:43:06,478
This is your mama you're talkin' to.
Come here, baby.

1785
01:43:06,562 --> 01:43:08,897
-Dakota.
-What about you?

1786
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:11,066
-What?
-Let's get outta here.

1787
01:43:11,108 --> 01:43:13,402
-Will you beat it. Damn!
-Let's get outta here.

1788
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:17,239
-You are bad for business, okay?
-I got money, all right?

1789
01:43:17,322 --> 01:43:19,575
Let's get outta here.

1790
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:22,452
Hey! What's
in the bag, all right?

1791
01:43:22,536 --> 01:43:24,454
Man!

1792
01:43:26,874 --> 01:43:29,460
Take a seat right there.

1793
01:43:29,543 --> 01:43:32,796
Yeah, huh?
Come on. Sit down.

1794
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,882
Thanks.

1795
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:42,431
Some of this right there.

1796
01:43:43,724 --> 01:43:45,642
For the lady...

1797
01:43:47,478 --> 01:43:49,605
and for the man.

1798
01:43:49,646 --> 01:43:52,608
-Mm, thanks.
-And for the boys upstate.

1799
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:55,819
-Hey, don't waste it.
-Shit, they need it.

1800
01:43:58,405 --> 01:44:00,616
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1801
01:44:05,787 --> 01:44:09,208
So, um...

1802
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:13,462
I like talking to you and all,
but don't let that fool you, you know.

1803
01:44:13,545 --> 01:44:16,215
There's no free pussy
around here, no freebies.

1804
01:44:16,298 --> 01:44:19,134
Sweetness will have my ass.

1805
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,428
How much?

1806
01:44:21,512 --> 01:44:23,680
How much you wanna spend?

1807
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:35,317
The whole shot.

1808
01:44:41,573 --> 01:44:44,493
How long have you
been locked up?

1809
01:44:46,328 --> 01:44:48,664
2,213 days.

1810
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:52,835
That's six years,
23 days...

1811
01:44:52,876 --> 01:44:55,170
in the State.

1812
01:44:55,212 --> 01:44:57,214
Wow.

1813
01:44:57,256 --> 01:45:00,217
How many tricks you turn
in that time?

1814
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,721
-All I count is the money.
-Yeah?

1815
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:10,561
Why don't you
just pretend like--

1816
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:13,522
like you mean it
or something?

1817
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:16,525
-I'm a good actress. 
-Are you?

1818
01:45:16,567 --> 01:45:18,694
Yeah.

1819
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:21,363
Why don't you
take that wig off...

1820
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:26,869
and be real for a minute.

1821
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:32,958
I guess that's a requirement
of the job, huh? Right?

1822
01:45:35,252 --> 01:45:37,504
To be a good actress?

1823
01:45:39,923 --> 01:45:41,967
Act like it
means something?

1824
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,219
Hmm?

1825
01:45:45,804 --> 01:45:48,223
Stand up.

1826
01:45:48,307 --> 01:45:50,767
Naw, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1827
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:57,065
Mmm.

1828
01:45:59,943 --> 01:46:02,029
Go slow.

1829
01:46:03,113 --> 01:46:05,741
It's a long time,
you know?

1830
01:46:05,782 --> 01:46:07,910
Mmm.

1831
01:46:09,495 --> 01:46:11,580
Two thousand.

1832
01:46:14,374 --> 01:46:16,668
Oh, damn.

1833
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:23,759
Hey, look, why don't we
take this on over there.

1834
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,244
Oh!

1835
01:47:50,387 --> 01:47:52,806
It's okay.

1836
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:55,142
-It's okay.
-Sorry, l--

1837
01:47:55,225 --> 01:47:58,145
No. Nothin'
to be sorry about.

1838
01:48:00,105 --> 01:48:02,316
It's been a long time.

1839
01:48:05,235 --> 01:48:08,238
Anyway, we got all night.

1840
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,532
I'm turning the meter off.

1841
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:34,181
How was your trip, son?

1842
01:48:34,264 --> 01:48:37,434
Good.
Whose car is this?

1843
01:48:37,518 --> 01:48:40,229
-What, this brand-new Lexus?
-Yeah.

1844
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:42,231
Well, technically,
it's mine.

1845
01:48:42,272 --> 01:48:45,108
It's registered in my name,
but it's for you.

1846
01:48:45,192 --> 01:48:47,277
-For me?
-How you like it?

1847
01:48:47,444 --> 01:48:49,404
LS400.

1848
01:48:49,446 --> 01:48:52,074
Look at that.
Power moon roof.

1849
01:48:52,115 --> 01:48:55,410
Got that, uh,
vehicle theft deterrent.

1850
01:48:55,452 --> 01:48:58,831
That's to deter them Coney Island
Puerto Ricans from stealing your shit.

1851
01:48:58,914 --> 01:49:01,416
I never asked for a car.
Did I ever ask for a car?

1852
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:04,962
-I asked for you.
-You must be outta your mojo mind.

1853
01:49:05,045 --> 01:49:07,840
If anybody sees me in this car,
that's my ass.

1854
01:49:07,923 --> 01:49:12,261
The way it was explained to me, as long
as it's in my name, it's all good.

1855
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:14,596
This shit
is all fucked up.

1856
01:49:14,638 --> 01:49:16,932
You gotta take it back,
give it back, do what you gotta do.

1857
01:49:16,974 --> 01:49:18,684
I don't even wanna know
who you got it from either.

1858
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:22,312
You don't like the color?
What you want? Blue, black, white?

1859
01:49:22,396 --> 01:49:25,774
-You take it back.
-Sh--

1860
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:52,861
-Mm, so how was your trip?
-My trip? Oh, I had a great trip.

1861
01:50:52,945 --> 01:50:55,864
Best one, so far?
You think?

1862
01:50:55,948 --> 01:50:58,867
I don't know. I mean,
they're all the same,

1863
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:01,870
but you just have a good time
with all of them.

1864
01:51:01,954 --> 01:51:05,707
We all do the same things--go partyin',
meet all the guys, go to classes.

1865
01:51:05,749 --> 01:51:08,710
I mean, it was just--
It's off the hook.

1866
01:51:08,752 --> 01:51:11,713
-Did you miss me, Jesus?
-Of course I missed you.

1867
01:51:11,755 --> 01:51:14,216
That's all I did
was talk about Lala.

1868
01:51:16,385 --> 01:51:20,347
Did you meet any women at the parties,
in the dorms and stuff like that?

1869
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:22,516
Did I meet any women?

1870
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:25,227
There were women at this college.
There are women all over the place.

1871
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:28,897
I mean, there's women on the floor,
in the dorms, women in the classroom.

1872
01:51:28,981 --> 01:51:32,151
There's a women's basketball team,
track team. Women all over the place.

1873
01:51:32,234 --> 01:51:34,570
Of course I met women.
I got introduced to everybody.

1874
01:51:34,653 --> 01:51:36,613
I said hello. That's about it.

1875
01:51:36,655 --> 01:51:40,325
-So did you fuck anybody
while you were out there?
-Hell, no!

1876
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:47,624
Don't think I haven't heard stories
about these white college bitches.

1877
01:51:47,708 --> 01:51:49,626
Me with a white bitch?

1878
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:52,004
They got 'em all lined up,
waitin' to suck your dick.

1879
01:51:52,087 --> 01:51:55,132
If my mother ever saw me with
a white bitch, she'd spin in her grave.

1880
01:51:55,215 --> 01:51:58,135
Then she's spinning.
She's turnin' over and over and over.

1881
01:51:58,218 --> 01:52:01,597
Don't be talking about my mother,
all right? Please.

1882
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,183
All right.

1883
01:52:04,266 --> 01:52:07,811
D'Andre and Dom need to know something.

1884
01:52:07,895 --> 01:52:10,606
Goddamn.
I should've known.

1885
01:52:10,689 --> 01:52:13,609
-What?
-This whole world is bugged.

1886
01:52:15,194 --> 01:52:18,363
And you're in it with 'em.
You're in cahoots with D'Andre and Dom.

1887
01:52:18,447 --> 01:52:20,699
Don't even lie.
Tell me the truth.

1888
01:52:20,782 --> 01:52:22,701
I knew that ever since
I left that house.

1889
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,287
Ever since I walked in the house,
as a matter of fact.

1890
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:29,041
And why shouldn't
I get paid, huh?

1891
01:52:29,124 --> 01:52:32,169
Why shouldn't Lala get something
outta this? Everybody else is.

1892
01:52:32,252 --> 01:52:34,922
I can't believe this.
I really can't.

1893
01:52:35,005 --> 01:52:37,966
Well, you believe it.
I believed you when you said...

1894
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:40,677
that you would never
leave me, Jesus.

1895
01:52:40,761 --> 01:52:43,472
And I believed you when you asked me
to get that abortion.

1896
01:52:43,514 --> 01:52:45,808
When you begged me
to get that abortion, I believed you.

1897
01:52:45,849 --> 01:52:48,769
-We both agreed on that.
-I wanted that child.

1898
01:52:48,852 --> 01:52:51,939
-I wanted to know
what you think because it's--
-What I think?

1899
01:52:52,022 --> 01:52:55,526
A baby's gonna hurt
my chance of going to college.

1900
01:52:55,609 --> 01:53:00,155
I mean, the top schools,
they're gonna be scared away. Damn!

1901
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:04,701
I'm too young. You're too young.
We ain't ready for nothin' like this.

1902
01:53:04,743 --> 01:53:06,954
How did we get pregnant anyway?
Let's talk about that.

1903
01:53:07,037 --> 01:53:09,331
Are you sure?

1904
01:53:09,414 --> 01:53:12,209
I'm not getting pregnant
now, papi.

1905
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:15,504
I just wanna
feel you inside of me...

1906
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:20,134
without a jimmy.

1907
01:53:23,053 --> 01:53:25,430
"l can't get pregnant, papi.

1908
01:53:25,514 --> 01:53:27,641
I wanna feel you
inside of me, papi."

1909
01:53:27,724 --> 01:53:31,395
-Isn't that what you said?
-Lala has to look out for herself.

1910
01:53:31,478 --> 01:53:34,439
Lala played herself,
that's what she did.

1911
01:53:34,523 --> 01:53:38,193
And don't think I don't know about
that D'Andre kid either.

1912
01:53:38,235 --> 01:53:40,654
-Did you fuck him?
-So what?

1913
01:53:40,737 --> 01:53:42,990
At least I can admit it.

1914
01:53:43,073 --> 01:53:46,118
-Oh, so it makes it all right
that you admit it--
-I'm not saying it's all right.

1915
01:53:46,201 --> 01:53:48,787
I'm just saying that there's a reason
and I can at least admit it.

1916
01:53:48,871 --> 01:53:50,914
-That don't mean shit.
-That don't mean shit?

1917
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:52,916
-Go fuck all of Coney Island.
-Well, you know what?

1918
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,918
If it don't matter,
then why are you stressing?

1919
01:53:55,002 --> 01:53:57,629
-You're gonna wake up a whole
bunch of angry black folk.
-I don't give a fuck!

1920
01:53:57,713 --> 01:53:59,631
You know
you're gonna leave me.

1921
01:53:59,715 --> 01:54:02,551
This is gonna last while you're off
to college for a year?

1922
01:54:02,593 --> 01:54:05,220
You want me to live in Lala-land?
Is that what it is?

1923
01:54:05,262 --> 01:54:07,890
How do you know?
Tell me how you know.

1924
01:54:07,931 --> 01:54:11,560
-I know 'cause I ain't stupid.
-You went to a fortune teller?

1925
01:54:11,643 --> 01:54:13,854
You don't know shit.
You don't know what's gonna happen.

1926
01:54:13,937 --> 01:54:16,356
Jesus, I have read
all about...

1927
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:19,902
those high school sweethearts
who get left behind.

1928
01:54:19,985 --> 01:54:23,447
I have seen that movie
many a time.

1929
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:27,743
I told 'em nobody can tell Jesus
what to do, but they fucking insisted.

1930
01:54:27,784 --> 01:54:30,579
If they were stupid enough
to give me money...

1931
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:34,291
to use some kind of influence
over you that I never possessed,

1932
01:54:34,374 --> 01:54:36,460
so be it.

1933
01:54:36,543 --> 01:54:40,839
They put the money in my hand
with the promise of more to come.

1934
01:54:42,174 --> 01:54:44,218
Just like
everybody else.

1935
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:46,428
Jesus, you have
no problems.

1936
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:49,681
Your life is set.
You got no worries.

1937
01:54:49,765 --> 01:54:52,059
-I have nothing.
-Yeah, right.

1938
01:54:52,142 --> 01:54:55,103
You're gonna honestly lie
dead to my face and tell me...

1939
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:57,689
that it was gonna be forever
and you were gonna take care of me...

1940
01:54:57,773 --> 01:54:59,983
and that I had no problems
or no worries?

1941
01:55:00,067 --> 01:55:03,070
-That wasn't hard for me.
-Oh, my God.

1942
01:55:06,824 --> 01:55:10,119
Come here.
That's it. Come here!

1943
01:55:17,167 --> 01:55:19,336
Good riddance.

1944
01:55:25,801 --> 01:55:27,719
What's up, son?

1945
01:55:30,347 --> 01:55:33,350
So, this is it, yo?
Judgment day?

1946
01:55:34,476 --> 01:55:37,896
Father and son?
Jake and Jesus?

1947
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:41,525
So you ain't gonna
say nothin' to me. Okay.

1948
01:55:41,608 --> 01:55:46,155
I ain't got no more time to be tryin'
to beg your forgiveness or nothin',

1949
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:47,656
so I'll make this
real simple.

1950
01:55:47,739 --> 01:55:50,659
This right here,
it's a letter of intent...

1951
01:55:50,742 --> 01:55:53,662
for you to sign
to go to Big State.

1952
01:55:53,745 --> 01:55:55,664
Right?

1953
01:55:55,747 --> 01:55:57,666
Right there.

1954
01:55:57,749 --> 01:56:02,337
I'll play you,
one-on-one, to 11.

1955
01:56:02,421 --> 01:56:04,673
I win, you sign.

1956
01:56:04,756 --> 01:56:07,676
You win, you do what you wanna do.
Tear it up, whatever.

1957
01:56:07,759 --> 01:56:10,679
I go back to Attica, 'cause I know
that's what you really want. Right?

1958
01:56:10,762 --> 01:56:12,681
-You wanna play me one-on-one?
-One-on-one.

1959
01:56:12,764 --> 01:56:15,350
-lf I win, you get the hell outta here?
-I ain't stuttered, son.

1960
01:56:15,434 --> 01:56:19,229
-The hell outta my life?
-Forever.

1961
01:56:19,396 --> 01:56:22,524
-I'll take the bet. You're on.
-Bet.

1962
01:56:26,195 --> 01:56:28,405
You wanna take them shines off,
that gold?

1963
01:56:28,489 --> 01:56:31,158
You gonna take
that LoJack off?

1964
01:56:31,241 --> 01:56:33,076
It don't come off, son.

1965
01:56:36,622 --> 01:56:38,540
Check.

1966
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:49,760
Aah!

1967
01:56:49,843 --> 01:56:51,762
That's one.

1968
01:56:51,845 --> 01:56:54,848
-That's the only basket
you gettin' all game.
-Check.

1969
01:57:02,314 --> 01:57:04,566
One.

1970
01:57:04,608 --> 01:57:06,568
I can count.
That's one.

1971
01:57:10,906 --> 01:57:12,950
Two.

1972
01:57:13,033 --> 01:57:14,952
Two-one. That's somethin'
you taught me.

1973
01:57:15,035 --> 01:57:17,121
That's right.
I taught you well, son.

1974
01:57:17,204 --> 01:57:20,457
A lot of things you learned from me.
This your ball?

1975
01:57:20,541 --> 01:57:23,460
-What you stallin' for?
-Everything you got you got from me.

1976
01:57:23,544 --> 01:57:25,462
Everything you got.

1977
01:57:25,546 --> 01:57:28,966
-Let me show you what you taught me.
-Yeah, show me. Show me!

1978
01:57:30,134 --> 01:57:32,094
Show me!

1979
01:57:33,929 --> 01:57:36,473
I didn't teach you that,
though, did l?

1980
01:57:36,557 --> 01:57:38,475
That's somethin'
I didn't teach you.

1981
01:57:38,559 --> 01:57:40,644
-That was luck.
-That's somethin' you gotta
learn on your own.

1982
01:57:40,727 --> 01:57:42,813
Give it up. Give it up.

1983
01:57:44,398 --> 01:57:46,316
Oh, why you do--

1984
01:57:47,484 --> 01:57:49,444
Oh, yeah!

1985
01:57:49,486 --> 01:57:51,947
Who taught you that one?

1986
01:57:51,989 --> 01:57:53,991
I think I'll go around again.

1987
01:57:54,074 --> 01:57:57,619
-Yeah!
-It's your ball.

1988
01:58:05,419 --> 01:58:08,338
Mmm, I feel refreshed.

1989
01:58:15,929 --> 01:58:19,933
You better shoot it. That's a brick.

1990
01:58:19,975 --> 01:58:22,769
All right, we gon' cut out
all that lucky shit.

1991
01:58:27,107 --> 01:58:29,026
-What's that?
-That's three.

1992
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:31,487
-You gon' play me?
-Yeah. I'm just warmin' up, baby.

1993
01:58:32,529 --> 01:58:33,697
I give you that.

1994
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,949
-You better play some defense.
-I give you that.

1995
01:58:35,991 --> 01:58:37,534
Don't give me too many.

1996
01:58:40,287 --> 01:58:43,207
Yeah. Where you at, baby?
That's my rock.

1997
01:58:48,212 --> 01:58:50,172
Yeah, that was luck, anyway.

1998
01:58:52,216 --> 01:58:54,718
That's luck too, baby.

1999
01:58:54,802 --> 01:58:56,720
-Just call me the leprechaun.
-That's your last basket.

2000
01:58:56,804 --> 01:58:58,514
Yeah. I'm a lucky Negro.

2001
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,683
You ready?

2002
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:16,740
All right.

2003
01:59:16,824 --> 01:59:18,534
Oh, I forgot.

2004
01:59:23,205 --> 01:59:25,499
Payback is a bitch, huh?

2005
01:59:27,584 --> 01:59:29,503
Yeah.

2006
01:59:34,049 --> 01:59:37,010
Oh, don't get mad. You're the one
that taught me to be a good sportsman.

2007
01:59:37,052 --> 01:59:38,887
Ball up.

2008
01:59:40,097 --> 01:59:42,057
What you want,
the jump shot dunk?

2009
01:59:46,603 --> 01:59:48,522
What?

2010
01:59:48,605 --> 01:59:50,691
Huh?

2011
01:59:50,774 --> 01:59:52,693
-Bottoms.
-What's that?

2012
01:59:52,776 --> 01:59:55,279
-Seven to a lucky five.
-Seven to a lucky five.

2013
02:00:01,785 --> 02:00:03,745
-Eight-five.
-Eight-five.

2014
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:06,248
I'm about to send you
down there with them.

2015
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:10,586
-Nine-five.
-You quittin'?

2016
02:00:10,669 --> 02:00:12,588
-I can take a loss.
-You just gon' give up, huh?

2017
02:00:12,671 --> 02:00:14,590
-I ain't givin' up.
-You just gon' give up.

2018
02:00:14,673 --> 02:00:18,427
I'm teachin', brother. I'm teachin',
son, like I always taught you.

2019
02:00:21,847 --> 02:00:23,765
Oh, you tired?

2020
02:00:28,854 --> 02:00:30,772
Get that outta here.

2021
02:00:30,856 --> 02:00:32,774
You're earnin' these two.

2022
02:00:34,985 --> 02:00:36,987
Ohh!

2023
02:00:42,367 --> 02:00:45,788
I thought you lifted weights
in Attica, in the joint. Huh?

2024
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:48,123
Point game.
Just play the game.

2025
02:00:48,165 --> 02:00:50,125
Just play the game?

2026
02:00:51,251 --> 02:00:53,170
I learned that from you.

2027
02:00:56,256 --> 02:00:58,175
You better "D" up, Jake.

2028
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:01,929
Point game.

2029
02:01:02,012 --> 02:01:04,264
This is your last chance.

2030
02:01:06,183 --> 02:01:08,143
Come on, move away.

2031
02:01:14,858 --> 02:01:17,152
Ohh!

2032
02:01:17,194 --> 02:01:19,154
Ohh!

2033
02:01:19,196 --> 02:01:20,989
Aah!

2034
02:01:21,031 --> 02:01:22,616
Game time.

2035
02:01:28,247 --> 02:01:30,165
What you lookin' around for?

2036
02:01:30,249 --> 02:01:32,167
That's game--11-5.

2037
02:01:33,293 --> 02:01:35,212
Jake.

2038
02:01:37,506 --> 02:01:39,466
Somebody call a stretcher.

2039
02:01:39,508 --> 02:01:41,802
Stick a fork in 'im.
He's done.

2040
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:46,640
Take your old ass
back to Attica.

2041
02:01:59,444 --> 02:02:01,363
All right.

2042
02:02:01,446 --> 02:02:03,365
What?

2043
02:02:04,741 --> 02:02:08,162
Make you feel like a man now?
Huh?

2044
02:02:09,746 --> 02:02:11,665
Maybe you could stop hatin' me.

2045
02:02:11,748 --> 02:02:14,168
Is that gonna bring
your mother back?

2046
02:02:14,209 --> 02:02:17,671
-Maybe we could start bein'
father and son again.
-You ain't my father.

2047
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:27,181
Let me tell you somethin'.

2048
02:02:27,222 --> 02:02:30,184
You look out for yourself.
You look out for your sister.

2049
02:02:30,225 --> 02:02:32,728
You ain't got to worry
about me no more.

2050
02:02:32,769 --> 02:02:36,231
But you get that hatred
out your heart, boy,

2051
02:02:36,273 --> 02:02:39,651
or you gon' end up
just another nigger,

2052
02:02:39,735 --> 02:02:41,653
like your father.

2053
02:02:46,325 --> 02:02:48,243
It's your ball.

2054
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:00,631
Well, Jake, I think it's time
for all of us to go back home.

2055
02:03:00,714 --> 02:03:02,966
-Okay.
-No. No, Jake.

2056
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:04,968
Turn around.

2057
02:03:20,067 --> 02:03:21,485
Let's go.

2058
02:03:21,568 --> 02:03:24,488
Let him go. Huh?

2059
02:03:27,157 --> 02:03:29,159
Jesus.

2060
02:03:29,243 --> 02:03:31,954
Jesus!

2061
02:03:50,848 --> 02:03:53,809
I'm gonna read a, uh,
prepared statement from Jesus.

2062
02:03:53,851 --> 02:03:56,937
"I'm sorry for not bein'
with you this morning,

2063
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:00,023
"but under the circumstances my family
and I have chosen to be alone.

a very difficult week for me.

2065
02:04:03,735 --> 02:04:07,322
"I've done a lot of praying
and have asked for guidance from above.

2066
02:04:09,533 --> 02:04:12,995
"And I do believe that God
has shown me the way.

2067
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:15,831
"My sister Mary
will be coming with me.

2068
02:04:15,873 --> 02:04:18,834
"She will attend seventh grade
at a neighboring junior high school.

2069
02:04:18,876 --> 02:04:24,006
"This September I will
be enrolled at Big State University...

-on a full athletic scholarship."

2071
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:29,303
-Yes!
-Bullshit!

2072
02:04:29,386 --> 02:04:33,307
Later!

2073
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:35,893
This shit is bogus.
The boy did not go for the bucks.

2074
02:04:40,772 --> 02:04:43,817
Hold on.
"This is the right place for me.

2075
02:04:43,901 --> 02:04:49,490
"In closing, my family and I send
our prayers out to my father.

2076
02:04:49,573 --> 02:04:51,492
"May God bless him.

2077
02:04:51,575 --> 02:04:54,578
Yours, truly,
Jesus Shuttlesworth."

2078
02:04:56,246 --> 02:04:59,082
"Jake Shuttlesworth...

-convicted mur... der..."
-Murderer.

2081
02:05:04,922 --> 02:05:07,716
Gimme the paper, man.
You're irking me with that shit.

2082
02:05:07,758 --> 02:05:10,260
About to graduate,
you can't even read, dumb ass.

2083
02:05:10,302 --> 02:05:12,513
Can too read. Miss Janus says
I got problems readin' out loud.

2084
02:05:12,596 --> 02:05:15,432
-He's just nervous.
-Man, fuck that, Sip. Finish readin'.

2085
02:05:15,516 --> 02:05:18,435
Gladly.

2086

"The father of the number-one basketball
prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth...

2087
02:05:22,356 --> 02:05:26,109
"was captured last night in the Coney
Island section of Brooklyn, New York...

-"after a week-long manhunt.
-What?

2089

Attica State Penitentiary...

No official word yet
on how he escaped."

2092
02:05:35,828 --> 02:05:39,039
How could Uncle Jake have escaped when
they let him walk out the front gate?

2093
02:05:39,123 --> 02:05:41,959
There's gotta be some truth
to it if it's in the papers.

2094
02:05:42,042 --> 02:05:43,961
Oh, come on, man!

2095
02:05:46,797 --> 02:05:48,757
Yo, Shuttlesworth.

2096
02:05:51,218 --> 02:05:54,012
Warden wants to see you now.

2097
02:05:54,096 --> 02:05:56,515
He say what this is about?

2098
02:06:00,686 --> 02:06:03,647
Things didn't work out
exactly as we planned,

2099
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:05,649
but the governor got
what he wanted.

2100
02:06:05,732 --> 02:06:09,236
I'm happy for him.
Why do you think my son did it?

2101
02:06:09,319 --> 02:06:12,614
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting
your son as yet. I can't speculate.

2102
02:06:12,698 --> 02:06:15,325
-Maybe someday you'll get
to ask him that in person.
-Someday.

2103
02:06:15,409 --> 02:06:17,327
And when will that be,
Warden?

2104
02:06:17,411 --> 02:06:19,830
The governor
has yet to inform me.

2105
02:06:21,331 --> 02:06:23,333
For your information,
technically...

2106
02:06:23,417 --> 02:06:27,004
you did not get your son
to sign the letter of intent.

2107
02:06:27,087 --> 02:06:30,007
Hopefully that's not gonna
make a difference.

2108
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:33,093
-We need some time.
-Well, I got that, huh?

2109
02:06:34,928 --> 02:06:38,849
Dear Jesus, ever since you was born
I been pushin' you,

2110
02:06:41,018 --> 02:06:45,147
tryin' to make you the best ball player
that you could possibly be,

2111
02:06:45,230 --> 02:06:47,983
tryin' to make you the ball player
that I never was.

2112
02:06:49,026 --> 02:06:50,861
I finally came
to the realization...

2113
02:06:50,944 --> 02:06:54,364
that I was pushin' you
further and further away from me also.

2114
02:06:57,075 --> 02:07:00,537
I believe that things
gon' work out for the best for you,

2115
02:07:00,621 --> 02:07:02,372
-Jesus was a name.
-for Mary.

2116
02:07:02,456 --> 02:07:04,166
You got the game.

2117
02:07:04,249 --> 02:07:06,293
Sip, sip, sip on this.

2118
02:07:06,376 --> 02:07:09,296
Your great-grandfather always used to
tell me that you keep tryin' on shoes,

2119
02:07:09,379 --> 02:07:11,840
sooner or later you gon'
find a pair that fit you.

2120
02:07:11,882 --> 02:07:13,509
The... farmhouse...

2121
02:07:13,592 --> 02:07:16,512
Well, I'm here to testify
that I found a pair.

2122
02:07:16,595 --> 02:07:18,847
House. O-U-sss...

2123
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:20,849
They hurt like hell, son.

2124
02:07:23,101 --> 02:07:25,687
-I love you.
-"l love you, son."

2125
02:07:25,729 --> 02:07:29,483
Your father,
Jake Shuttlesworth.

2126
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:19,783
Five, four, three, two, one.

2127
02:08:20,868 --> 02:08:22,870
And the crowd goes wild.

2128
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:29,543
Uh-oh. He's heatin' up.

2129
02:08:29,626 --> 02:08:32,963
You can't stop him.
You can only hope to contain him.

2130
02:08:44,516 --> 02:08:46,435
Jake, stop!

2131
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:49,938
Stop right there!

2132
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:54,109
Turn around!
Do it now, or you're a dead man!

2133
02:09:08,415 --> 02:09:11,001
Turn around and back up!

2134
02:11:04,948 --> 02:11:07,242
Yeah, that's right,
this cut goes out to all y'all...

2135
02:11:07,284 --> 02:11:08,952
that's been missin' us for mad years.

2136
02:11:09,036 --> 02:11:12,247
One love, yo. Hey, that's right.
He's got game.

2137
02:11:12,289 --> 02:11:14,041
P.E., 1998.

2138
02:11:14,124 --> 02:11:17,211
If man is the father
the son is the center of the earth

2139
02:11:17,294 --> 02:11:18,879
In the middle
of the universe

2140
02:11:18,962 --> 02:11:21,757
Then why is this verse
comin' six times rehearsed

2141
02:11:21,799 --> 02:11:24,593
Don't freestyle much
but I write 'em like such

2142
02:11:24,635 --> 02:11:26,970
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens

2143
02:11:27,054 --> 02:11:29,640
What does it all mean
All this shit I'm seein'

2144
02:11:29,723 --> 02:11:32,017
Human bein's
screamin' vocal javelins

2145
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:33,936
Sign of a local nigga
unravelin'

2146
02:11:34,019 --> 02:11:37,189
-Uh-huh 
-My wanderin' got my ass wonderin'

2147
02:11:37,272 --> 02:11:39,650
Where Christ is
in all this crisis

2148
02:11:39,733 --> 02:11:42,069
Hatin' Satan
never knew what nice is

2149
02:11:42,152 --> 02:11:44,696
Check the papers
Well, I bet on ices

2150
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:47,074
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear

2151
02:11:47,157 --> 02:11:49,618
Year by year
all the sense disappears

2152
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:51,912
Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear

2153
02:11:51,995 --> 02:11:54,623
-Beware Two-triple 0 is near 
-It might feel good

2154
02:11:54,706 --> 02:11:56,250
It might sound
a little somethin'

2155
02:11:56,333 --> 02:11:58,752
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

2156
02:11:58,794 --> 02:12:01,922
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life

2157
02:12:02,005 --> 02:12:03,632
Behind
the game behind the game

2158
02:12:03,715 --> 02:12:08,095
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

2159
02:12:08,178 --> 02:12:10,889
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

2160
02:12:10,973 --> 02:12:14,309
-But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin' 
-Damn

2161
02:12:14,393 --> 02:12:15,936
Was it somethin' I said

2162
02:12:16,019 --> 02:12:18,564
Pretend you don't see
so you turn your head

2163
02:12:18,647 --> 02:12:20,816
Race scared of his shadow
Does it matter

2164
02:12:20,899 --> 02:12:24,445
The thought of reparation's got him
playin' with the population

2165
02:12:24,528 --> 02:12:26,238
Nothin' to lose
Everything approved

2166
02:12:26,321 --> 02:12:28,407
People use
Even murders excused

2167
02:12:28,490 --> 02:12:30,659
White men in suits
don't have to jump

2168
02:12:30,701 --> 02:12:33,454
Still 1,001 ways
to lose with the shoes

2169
02:12:33,537 --> 02:12:36,165
God takes care
of old folks and fools

2170
02:12:36,248 --> 02:12:38,667
While the devil takes care
of makin' all the rules

2171
02:12:38,709 --> 02:12:40,210
Folks don't even
own themselves

2172
02:12:40,294 --> 02:12:42,671
Payin' mental rent
to corporate presidents

2173
02:12:42,754 --> 02:12:45,507
-My man, my man 
-One out of one million residents

2174
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:48,427
Be a dissident
who ain't kissin' it

2175
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:50,637
The politics
of chains and whips

2176
02:12:50,679 --> 02:12:53,098
Got the six missing chips
and all the championships

2177
02:12:53,182 --> 02:12:55,517
What's love got to do
with what you got

2178
02:12:55,559 --> 02:12:58,103
Don't let a win get to your head
or a loss to your heart

2179
02:12:58,187 --> 02:13:00,439
-Word 
-Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear

2180
02:13:00,522 --> 02:13:02,858
Beware
Two-triple 0 is near

2181
02:13:02,941 --> 02:13:05,486
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

2182
02:13:05,569 --> 02:13:07,362
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

2183
02:13:07,446 --> 02:13:10,282
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life

2185
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:17,080
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

2186
02:13:17,164 --> 02:13:19,792
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

2187
02:13:19,875 --> 02:13:23,128
But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'

2188
02:13:23,212 --> 02:13:24,713
Yeah, that's right.
Everybody got game.

2189
02:13:24,797 --> 02:13:28,675
But we just here to let you all know
that P.E. is in full effect...

2190
02:13:28,717 --> 02:13:31,011
from right now
till the year 2000.

2191
02:13:31,094 --> 02:13:32,763
Hey, yo, my man, sing it.

2192
02:13:32,846 --> 02:13:35,057
There's something happening here

2193
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:37,768
-Yeah, yeah.
-What it is

2194
02:13:37,851 --> 02:13:40,020
Ain't exactly clear

2195
02:13:41,271 --> 02:13:43,023
There's a man

2196
02:13:43,106 --> 02:13:45,984
-With a gun over there 
-Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha!

2197
02:13:46,068 --> 02:13:51,031
Tellin' me
I got to beware

2198
02:13:51,115 --> 02:13:54,701
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound

2199
02:13:54,743 --> 02:13:58,163
Everybody look
what's goin' down

2200
02:13:58,247 --> 02:14:00,833
Hey, yo, I don't think
they heard you, Stephen.
Kick it to 'em again one more time.

2201
02:14:00,916 --> 02:14:04,211
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound

2202
02:14:04,294 --> 02:14:08,715
Everybody look
what's goin' down

2203
02:14:11,301 --> 02:14:13,804
Thought of that millennium
just be killin' 'em

2204
02:14:13,887 --> 02:14:17,266
And that's scary
Like lies buried in a library

2205
02:14:17,349 --> 02:14:18,725
I ain't even gotta ask it

2206
02:14:18,767 --> 02:14:22,020
And who's underpaid that
got fouled at the basket

2207
02:14:22,104 --> 02:14:24,857
I can't blame the M.V. who be
gettin' all the Benjies

2208
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:26,775
And takin' them grants
for granted

2209
02:14:26,859 --> 02:14:29,862
Last I checked pyramids
wasn't built like projects

2210
02:14:29,945 --> 02:14:31,780
Or on them
government checks, uhh

2211
02:14:31,822 --> 02:14:33,991
Modern-day thugs
ain't got no guts

2212
02:14:34,074 --> 02:14:36,493
Pardon the expression
And the governor nuts

2213
02:14:36,577 --> 02:14:38,787
Last time in a church
be the last time in a church

2214
02:14:38,829 --> 02:14:41,832
Dead pledge allegiance
to CDs and movies

2215
02:14:41,915 --> 02:14:44,293
Leavin' reality
Believe in fantasy

2216
02:14:44,334 --> 02:14:46,795
Bleedin' fatalities
Too many formalities

2217
02:14:46,837 --> 02:14:48,130
Prayers laced with fear
Beware

2218
02:14:48,172 --> 02:14:50,632
Two-triple 0 is here

2219
02:14:50,716 --> 02:14:53,427
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

2220
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:55,971
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

2221
02:14:56,013 --> 02:14:59,433
What is game, who got game
Where is the game in life

2222
02:14:59,516 --> 02:15:01,143
Behind
the game behind the game

2223
02:15:01,185 --> 02:15:05,481
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

2224
02:15:05,564 --> 02:15:07,608
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

2225
02:15:07,691 --> 02:15:11,111
But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'

2226
02:15:11,195 --> 02:15:15,866
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2227
02:15:15,949 --> 02:15:17,659
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2228
02:15:17,743 --> 02:15:20,162
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2229
02:15:20,204 --> 02:15:25,083
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2230
02:15:25,167 --> 02:15:27,503
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2231
02:15:27,544 --> 02:15:30,005
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2232
02:15:30,047 --> 02:15:34,968
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2233
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:37,221
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2234
02:15:37,304 --> 02:15:39,640
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2235
02:15:39,723 --> 02:15:45,062
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2236
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:47,022
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2237
02:15:47,105 --> 02:15:50,192
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2238
02:15:50,275 --> 02:15:55,072
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2239
02:15:55,155 --> 02:16:00,035
Everybody knows
what's going down

2240
02:16:00,077 --> 02:16:04,957
Ahh, ohh
What's that sound

2241
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:09,795
Everybody knows
what's going down
