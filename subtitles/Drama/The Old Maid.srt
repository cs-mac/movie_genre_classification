1
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,378
Here I am, miss.

2
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,880
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

3
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:50,116
That's all right, Dora. It was an accident.

4
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:53,562
- You don't seem a bit nervous, Miss Delia.
- Nervous?

5
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,095
No, I don't think I am.

6
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,496
Oh, I wish I wasn't.
I wouldn't be so clumsy and slow.

7
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:01,501
You'd think it was me getting married,
my hands shake so.

8
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:05,903
- Take your time, Dora.
- There. That's it. There now.

9
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:09,101
Well. Well, you was always one
to take things calm.

10
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,576
If it was me, now...

11
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:17,645
You're not superstitious either,
are you, miss?

12
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:20,719
Superstitious? Oh, not very. Why?

13
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,289
Oh, but all the same, you'd ought to have
something borrowed and something blue.

14
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:27,220
That's true.

15
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,298
Something old and something new.

16
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:34,129
Well, my lace is old
and everything else is new...

17
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,068
...but I've nothing borrowed
and I've nothing blue.

18
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,633
Oh, Dora, what can we find?

19
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,300
Well, I'd feel better in my mind, miss,
if you had...

20
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,241
Then you'll have to lend me something.

21
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,382
But what have I got,
miss, that you'd wear?

22
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,915
- It's something no one will see.
- Lend me a garter.

23
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,279
- A gar...?
- A garter.

24
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,115
Oh, very well, miss,
but please look the other way, then.

25
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,951
Oh, I don't see you, Dora.

26
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:07,894
- Delia, what a lovely day for a wedding.
- Something borrowed.

27
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,068
Let me, miss.

28
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,170
I'm so excited that I wanna laugh and cry
at the same time.

29
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:16,176
I've felt the same way, Miss Charlotte,
all morning.

30
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:19,907
- I wish it were me.
- Oh, it will be one day.

31
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:25,885
I don't feel like laughing or crying.
I just feel, well, beautifully happy.

32
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,251
Charlotte.

33
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,723
Charlotte. Charlotte!

34
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,856
It's beautiful, isn't it?

35
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,992
Charlotte!
Yes, Granny.

36
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,167
I'm coming.

37
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,737
Charlotte.
- Coming. Coming.

38
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,903
- Oh, Charles, what's that? A telegram?
- Yes, for Miss Delia.

39
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,338
- Oh, yes.
Charlotte.

40
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:51,139
- Yes, Granny?
Walk like a lady.

41
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:54,481
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,119
- Good morning, Dr. Lanskell.
- Good morning, Charlotte.

43
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:58,618
Granny.

44
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,882
- Oh, Granny.
- He says I have no strength.

45
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:03,753
I'll show you all.

46
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:07,158
Oh, you're naughty, Granny.
Isn't she, Dr. Lanskell?

47
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,561
No, she's not. She wants to go
to the wedding and why shouldn't she?

48
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,928
Want to go? I am going.

49
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:17,163
I took my financial life in my hands
to dress these girls. Look at them.

50
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,504
Now, here it is, a lovely June morning,
my little Delia getting married...

51
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,745
...and this cursed old doctor
says I can't go.

52
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,404
Oh, can't she go, Dr. Lanskell?

53
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,447
- Of course she can if...
- If what?

54
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:32,349
- Lf you want to take your life in your hands.
- I'll take you in my hands.

55
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,389
Now, Granny, darling. No tantrums.

56
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,550
Her pulse is up. What would it be
if she went to the wedding?

57
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:39,990
Oh, stuff and nonsense.

58
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,859
I'll come back
and tell you all about it, all the details.

59
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,259
I'll sing the "Wedding March" for you.

60
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,031
I'm not a child.

61
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,537
And I'll tell you just how the bride sounded
when she said, "I will. "

62
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,838
- And I'Il...
- Now, stop that. Get up.

63
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,804
Let me look at you.

64
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:02,547
Very pretty. Very, very pretty.

65
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,516
Thank you, doctor.

66
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:09,683
When a girl goes to her wedding,
she should look her best, shouldn't she?

67
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,486
She should indeed.

68
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,289
The young men look at her.
They used to.

69
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:18,828
The music plays,
thoughts of marriage are in the air.

70
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,165
Am I clear, Charlotte?

71
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,438
Oh, sweet Granny.

72
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,009
Are you scheming again?

73
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:30,611
Of course I am.

74
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,116
Of course, Joe Ralston,
the bridegroom's brother, will be there.

75
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,047
Naturally.

76
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,385
And though you are my granddaughter,
you're a quaint little thing. Isn't she?

77
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,556
I'm talking to you, you old humbug.

78
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,424
Yes, Henrietta, she is.

79
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:53,324
- Charlotte. Charlotte.
- Excuse me, Granny. There's Delia.

80
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,736
Tell her to hurry or the wedding
will be over before she gets there.

81
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,534
I will.

82
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,437
Did you ever see such girls?

83
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,402
Read it.

84
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:11,118
Oh, Dora, excuse us a minute, please,
and shut the door.

85
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,192
"Darling, arriving on 10:30 train.

86
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,853
Coming directly to you. Cannot wait.

87
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,158
Love you. Clem Spender. "

88
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,858
- Clem?
- Yes.

89
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:31,066
- And he doesn't know?
- Of course not. How could he?

90
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,334
What time is it?

91
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,704
I couldn't see him, could I?

92
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,140
Oh, I can't.

93
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,645
Well, someone must see him.

94
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,249
- Poor Clem.
- How can you say "poor Clem" like that?

95
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,412
- I waited two years.
- Now, Delia, we have no time to lose.

96
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,889
We'll have to send a messenger
to the station. We'll write a note.

97
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,188
My hands are so shaky.
You'll have to write it for me.

98
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,887
No.

99
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,565
No, I'm not going to write a note.

100
00:06:58,734 --> 00:06:59,860
I'm going.

101
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,162
- To the station?
- Yes.

102
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,363
- But, Charlotte, you can't.
- But I am going.

103
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,239
You can't go like that.

104
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,104
Downtown. The station.

105
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,974
Clem. He might be intoxicated
when you get there.

106
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,139
You don't know what he might do.

107
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:17,514
Oh, Charlotte, you know Clem Spender.

108
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,315
Yes, I do know him.
That's why I'm going.

109
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,514
But, Charlotte.

110
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,088
- Who is it?
Dr. Lanskell is waiting.

111
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,796
Tell him I'll be right down.

112
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,202
Delia.

113
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:46,979
Delia, go along quickly. I must hurry.

114
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,818
How will you explain to Clem?
What can you say?

115
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,147
What is there to say?
I'll think of something.

116
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,653
- Thank you, Charlotte. Charlotte.
- Yes?

117
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,190
Ask him, for my sake,
to behave like a gentleman.

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,692
He will. I know. Go on.

119
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:05,560
Forward march.

120
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:08,397
Company...

121
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,402
...halt.

122
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,167
Right face.

123
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,343
Left, turn.

124
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,403
Halt.

125
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,102
Delia.

126
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:54,182
Delia.

127
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,215
Delia.

128
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,213
Delia.

129
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:05,155
- Oh, I thought it was Delia. It's Charlotte.
- Yes.

130
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,957
Yes, it's Charlotte. It must be the cape.
It's Delia's cape.

131
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,996
- Where's Delia?
- She, uh...

132
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,067
- Isn't she here?
- No.

133
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:16,899
- Why? Has something happened?
- Yes, she, uh...

134
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,541
- What? What?
- She, uh...

135
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,767
She what?

136
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,137
She's being married.

137
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,380
- Why, you're joking.
- I'm not joking.

138
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:31,509
She's being married to Jim Ralston today
in less than an hour.

139
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,451
Delia? Jim Ralston?

140
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:35,716
Oh, I don't believe it.

141
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,754
She asked me to come and meet you
and see you and tell you.

142
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,987
She didn't want you to hear
from anyone else.

143
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,395
She said... She said, "Explain to Clem
and ask him, for my sake...

144
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,092
...to behave like a gentleman. "

145
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,295
And you will, won't you?

146
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,573
I am sorry, Clem.

147
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,644
I know how you feel.
Really, I do. I know.

148
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:01,442
My little Delia, Jim Ralston.

149
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:03,107
Married. Today.

150
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,085
She asked me to behave like a gentleman.

151
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,587
She waited two years.
It's a woman's duty to marry.

152
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:12,125
To marry the man she promised
and she did promise me.

153
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,895
Oh, Charlotte,
I wouldn't have come back and...

154
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,464
What church? Where?
Where are they gonna be married?

155
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,932
No, that's what Delia's afraid of.
You're crazy and impulsive, you are.

156
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:22,627
- You'll get into trouble.
- I know.

157
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:26,400
You can't leave whenever you please
and expect Delia to wait on your doorstep.

158
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,634
A gentleman?
I'll behave like a gentleman.

159
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,301
- I'll break her neck.
- Clem.

160
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,312
Marrying Ralston.
I'll break my toe in the seat of his pants.

161
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:34,813
- No.
- I will. I'm gonna jam...

162
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:38,351
...that wedding cake down his stiff neck.
- Clem.

163
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,396
Oh, the bridegroom.
Jim Ralston, congratulations.

164
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,129
- Thank you, bishop. Glad to see you.
Is that champagne?

165
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,932
- Isn't that refreshing?
- Good idea.

166
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,338
You know, I'm gonna suggest...
You lads are still just boys to me.

167
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,877
- Champagne, Laughton.
- I'm going to propose a toast.

168
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:09,345
Jim Ralston, Joe Ralston, a toast.

169
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,349
- Shall we drink to the bride?
- To Delia.

170
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,746
And to you,
the bridegroom and the bride.

171
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,413
Thank you, Joe.

172
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,389
Hello, Charlotte.
- Hello.

173
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,256
Oh, Charlotte, wait a minute.

174
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,458
- I must see Delia.
- I know. You look lovely.

175
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,466
- Thank you.
- Wait. I wanna talk to you.

176
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,800
I can't. I must see Delia, Joe.
Excuse me.

177
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,970
Thank you, Dora. Delia.

178
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,369
- Did you see him?
- Yes.

179
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,241
What did he say?

180
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,883
He's downstairs at the side door.
He wants to see you.

181
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,144
Oh, but I can't. You know I can't.

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,379
He's very hurt, Delia.

183
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,147
I haven't wanted to hurt him.

184
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:51,225
I don't see how anyone could hurt
poor Clem.

185
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:52,691
Don't.

186
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:55,657
- I didn't know you cared that much.
- You knew I loved him.

187
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,958
I knew you told him so.

188
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:02,433
I have to go downstairs in a few minutes.
I mustn't cry.

189
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:05,773
You won't cry if you keep saying
over and over to yourself:

190
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,034
"I'm marrying a Ralston.
Marrying a Ralston. "

191
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,371
Yes, I'm marrying a Ralston and I'm glad.

192
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,346
- I don't envy you.
- I don't want you to envy me.

193
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,711
Don't hold my marriage to Jim
against me either.

194
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:19,252
I'm fond of Jim and it seemed hopeless
to wait for Clem.

195
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,151
A woman can't wait forever.

196
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,655
I wanted children and a home.

197
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,254
I couldn't bear to be an old maid.

198
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,358
I can't imagine not waiting forever.

199
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,662
You think that but you don't know.

200
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,359
Miss Delia.

201
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,129
- Miss Delia.
- What is it, Dora?

202
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,705
It's Mr. Spender.
He came in through the back door.

203
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:42,002
- He's outside. He wants to speak to you.
- But I can't. You go.

204
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,011
He insists. He'll talk to you
if he has to talk at the altar.

205
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,910
May I come in?

206
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,513
I beg your pardon.

207
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:53,244
- I'm looking for someone I used to know.
- Clem, you shouldn't be here.

208
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,287
- Did anyone see you?
- Oh, no.

209
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,522
I disguised myself
as a friend of the family.

210
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,390
And as an added precaution,
I sneaked up the back stairs.

211
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,423
- You'll leave us alone.
- Of course.

212
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:06,363
No, don't.
- Well, how things have changed.

213
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,130
We used to strive to get rid of Charlotte
so that we could be alone, remember?

214
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,570
- There are things I must do.
- Of course there are.

215
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,141
Delia isn't afraid to be alone with me.

216
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,409
Or are you afraid
to be alone with me, Delia?

217
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:25,245
I didn't want you to regret later
not having seen me.

218
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,851
- Delia...
- Charlotte saw you.

219
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,046
- She told you.
- Yes.

220
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,488
It would have been considerate
if you hadn't come.

221
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:33,890
I was curious. I wanted to see
if you were as beautiful as the girl...

222
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,123
...I've been carrying in my imagination
these last two years.

223
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,961
Well, you're not. Not that it's your fault.

224
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:43,935
No one this side of heaven could be
that beautiful or faithful or steadfast.

225
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,006
- I didn't go away. You did.
- That's right.

226
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:49,110
We were to be married.
My family, even my friends had been told.

227
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,178
You must have known
it would humiliate me.

228
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:53,941
You knew I wanted to make
a success of myself for you.

229
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,016
I meant to keep that promise,
settle down.

230
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:58,085
- Have you kept it, Clem?
- No.

231
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,779
Just the same as I always was
and always will be.

232
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,446
I didn't plan to hurt you, Clem.

233
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,093
You haven't,
any more than you've hurt yourself.

234
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,494
That's the pity.

235
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:11,922
Poor Delia, condemned to a life
of elegant boredom.

236
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,432
I'm not. I love Jim.

237
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,797
Oh, yes, I can imagine that.

238
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,804
Then I can imagine a person
developing a consuming passion...

239
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:20,464
...for the First National Bank.

240
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,642
It isn't the money. Don't dare think that.

241
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:27,612
I believe you. The trouble with you, Delia,
is you're too conventional.

242
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,774
You only want what it's nice to want.

243
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,250
I only want
what it's every woman's right to have:

244
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,981
A home and a family,
a decent amount of faithfulness...

245
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,624
...and security from my husband.

246
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,190
What else is there for a woman?

247
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,423
Can you ask me that?

248
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,356
Don't you know what there could be
for you and me?

249
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:50,335
A little happy poverty perhaps,
but excitement, adventure and us.

250
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,301
All our lives we'll want each other.

251
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,908
Uselessly, cruelly.

252
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,836
I'm gonna pick you up,
take you down the back stairs...

253
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,914
It's too late. I've made my decision.
I'm marrying Jim Ralston.

254
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,347
That's all I'm going to say.

255
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,046
Go, please.

256
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,148
All right.

257
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,321
Marry your nice Mr. Ralston.

258
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,296
Some day when you're bored,
perhaps you have nothing better to do...

259
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,702
...you'll think about the things
you've made us miss.

260
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,601
I have come to take you down.
Hello, Spender.

261
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,177
- How do you do?
- Clem came to wish me happiness.

262
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,282
- Yes, of course.
- By the way, I almost forgot.

263
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,347
I brought this for you.

264
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,052
Funny.

265
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:42,246
When I bought it, I thought
it was going to be an engagement present.

266
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:47,995
- Goodbye, Delia. Lots of happiness.
- Thank you.

267
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,427
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

268
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:06,405
Oh, Dr. Lanskell, it's something blue.

269
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:09,579
Come, my dear.

270
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:02,797
Clem.

271
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,197
Clem.

272
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,288
Oh, I was worried for you,
Miss Charlotte.

273
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,789
Your grandma's awakened twice,
asked if you was in.

274
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,052
And I told a lie. I said you was.

275
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,525
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

276
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,596
You go to bed, Dora, and I'll be up.

277
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,630
Oh, Miss Charlotte.

278
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,367
Goodbye, Charlotte.

279
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,205
What's the matter?

280
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,240
Oh, little Charlotte.

281
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:50,583
Oh, I should be the one to weep
but I don't.

282
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,220
Supposing you had come home
expecting to find everything...

283
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:58,519
...and there was nothing.
Nothing even to live for?

284
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:03,621
- That's why I'm so worried for you, Clem.
- Oh, please don't worry about me.

285
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,096
I'm all right.

286
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,792
I'll be leaving immediately.

287
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:12,037
- To this war?
- Well, what other war is there?

288
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,973
War makes you forget,
sometimes rather quickly.

289
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:19,239
- Lf I could do anything...
- You have.

290
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,439
You've been sweet.

291
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,049
Sweet little Charlotte.

292
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,213
Pretty little Charlotte.

293
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,986
Don't you know what happens to you
means more to me than anything?

294
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,066
You mustn't say that.

295
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,764
You mustn't.

296
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,362
But I have said it.

297
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,701
But I'm not worth it, Charlotte.

298
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,972
Yes, you are. I think you are.

299
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,407
Don't laugh at me.

300
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:13,633
How could I laugh
at anyone so sincere, so kind?

301
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,115
Charlotte.

302
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,724
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

303
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,224
Clem, he's leaving.

304
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:13,552
Clem?

305
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,560
Yes, in a few minutes.

306
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,699
I can't find him.

307
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,696
There he is.

308
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,037
Time to load, general.

309
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,302
- Clem.
- Charlotte. Oh, you brought Delia with you.

310
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,604
- Hello, Clem.
- Hello.

311
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,339
- It's nice to see you before I leave.
- The best of luck.

312
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,143
And the same to you always, Delia.
Thank you.

313
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,809
Ralston has turned his factories
into munitions.

314
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,478
See that he sends plenty along to us.
We'll need it.

315
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,749
I will, lieutenant.

316
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,483
I'll use all I can.

317
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,754
And I'll remember that every shot
will make you richer.

318
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:50,857
- Thank you, Clem.
- Goodbye, Delia.

319
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,223
Goodbye.

320
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,529
Step, company.

321
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,036
Step lively, men. Step up there.

322
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,116
Clem, come back?

323
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,621
I'll try.

324
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,384
I'll try, really.

325
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,790
- Please, Clem.
All aboard.

326
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,021
The train's moving.

327
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,188
There's so much left unsaid. Goodbye.

328
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,458
Goodbye.

329
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,369
I think we can
feed him up a bit, though, don't you?

330
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,596
Oh, isn't she sweet?

331
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,508
Dora, you know, I am worried about Tina.

332
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:43,940
Oh, she's been playing hard
and she's warm and tired.

333
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,104
- Tell me, what are the first symptoms?
- Sometimes they turn blue.

334
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,944
- Oh, Dora, don't say things like that.
Well?

335
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,449
There's the doctor now.

336
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,481
There they are. Ha-ha.

337
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:58,091
- Hello, everybody.
You did come.

338
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,626
Well, well, you worry, worry, worry.

339
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,499
Tina's not as strong as the others.
I thought she might have it.

340
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,725
Well, where is the invalid, you alarmist?

341
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,836
I've kept her away from the others.

342
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:12,303
- I thought she might have a little fever.
- Well, well, well.

343
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,998
Hello, sweetheart.

344
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,643
Hello.

345
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,737
How does she look?

346
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:19,210
Pretty as a picture.

347
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,817
Oh, you know what I mean.
- Open your mouth, darling. Say "ah. " Ah.

348
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,714
Now, open your mouth wide. That's it.

349
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,855
Well, how many children
have you got here now?

350
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,924
Oh, about 22.

351
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,661
- They keep coming?
- Yes. Two more today.

352
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,889
I can't refuse them.
You've been such a help.

353
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:38,896
Well, you're doing a splendid job here.

354
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:43,060
If I had more isolation spots like this,
we could keep this thing under control.

355
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,672
Never mind that.
Is there anything wrong with her?

356
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,641
Well, I think I shall prescribe...

357
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:52,505
...one licorice candy.

358
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,047
It's the best thing in the world
for a sore throat.

359
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,775
Is that all?

360
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:59,277
- There you are.
- There you are, Tina.

361
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,854
Let's see if we can find
some real troubles.

362
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,287
- Run along. Play with your dolls, Tina.
- Come on.

363
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,984
Tina's as sound as a pumpkin,
so don't fret.

364
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:08,857
I'm so relieved.

365
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,396
Well, look who's here.

366
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,194
Oh, it's Delia.

367
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,402
Oh, hello, Delia.
- Hello, Charlotte, dear.

368
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:22,702
Children, children, children, you mustn't.

369
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,675
Let them play.
- Horses will kick them.

370
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:27,212
- You watch them, will you?
- Yes, ma'am.

371
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:28,915
Come in.

372
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,085
My, what you've done with this place.

373
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:34,245
- How are you, Dr. Lanskell?
- Very well, thank you.

374
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:35,946
Vincent, Vincent.

375
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:38,592
Isn't this a rather remarkable occasion?

376
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,285
- That I've come to see my cousin?
- Here?

377
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:44,557
- I think it's your first visit.
- Jim hasn't wanted me to come.

378
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,827
You know how afraid he is
that our children will catch something.

379
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:50,801
- It doesn't mean I haven't been interested.
- Yes, Delia.

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:54,934
While you two girls have it out,
I think I'll go and look at those rascals...

381
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,637
...and see if I can discover some germs
doctors are beginning to talk about.

382
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:01,782
If I find any, Delia,
I'll let you take them home to Jim.

383
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:08,122
Charlotte, I've come to talk to you.

384
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,451
I rather supposed you hadn't.

385
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,385
All right, let's go in there.

386
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:24,896
I can't believe it.

387
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,074
Charlotte, what you've done
with this place.

388
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:32,713
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

389
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,616
Sit down, Delia.

390
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:38,643
Charlotte.

391
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,950
Tuesday's getting nearer and I'm worried.

392
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,821
Joe spoke to you again, didn't he?

393
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:49,020
- About the children?
- Yes.

394
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,290
- About giving them up after you're married?
- Yes.

395
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,130
You know, Charlotte, you've changed.

396
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,829
Ever since you went out West that time
for your health.

397
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,804
Ever since you've come back.

398
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,967
Haven't you noticed it yourself?

399
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,668
Changed?

400
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,211
I don't understand you.

401
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:09,043
Take, for instance,
this passion for mothering stray waifs.

402
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,412
- There's disease...
- The children need isolation.

403
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:14,851
They had no other place to go.
I had the stables. I had nothing to do.

404
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,923
But you will have when you're married.

405
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:19,917
How do you mean I've changed?

406
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:24,088
Well, you've...
You've become morose and distant.

407
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:28,058
You seem to be living
inside yourself somehow.

408
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:31,861
Charlotte, Joe and Jim
were discussing you last night at dinner...

409
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,905
...and I couldn't help feeling that...

410
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:39,274
Well, although Joe loves you deeply
and I think he always has, he's hurt.

411
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:42,507
And he's a little annoyed
at your disregard for his wishes.

412
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,380
After all, Charlotte,
he will be your husband.

413
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:47,043
I've heard all this before.

414
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,087
I'm not giving up the nursery.

415
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,951
Joe's coming to see you this afternoon.

416
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,595
I just slipped over to ask you.

417
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:58,699
Charlotte, to beg you if necessary.

418
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,231
Will you let me handle this
in my own way, Delia?

419
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:04,463
But you don't know the Ralstons as I do.
They don't say much but...

420
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,199
I believe Joe is different.
That's why I'm marrying him.

421
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,969
Well, I can't...
I won't argue or quarrel with you.

422
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,579
But I would be so much happier...
We all would be if...

423
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,374
If what?

424
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,780
Your marriage means so much
to Jim and me.

425
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,419
You know it does, don't you?

426
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:21,713
Yes.

427
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:28,052
Come on.
Have a cup of tea, Mrs. Serious.

428
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:31,121
You have two very sweet children
of your own to mother.

429
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,767
Why not let me mother myself?

430
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,435
You know, Delia, you'd like
to run the world, wouldn't you?

431
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:40,938
Well, I'd like to run you
until after Tuesday.

432
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:44,442
And if I'm Mrs. Serious,
you're Mrs. Stubborn.

433
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,039
- Why...?
- Oh, look.

434
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,274
Well, where did you spring from?
Who are you?

435
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,118
She's just one of the children.

436
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:53,652
She's usually very shy.

437
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,114
Do you like my chain?

438
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,789
So does my little girl.

439
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,361
I have a little girl at home.
She's about your size.

440
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,894
And I have a little boy too.

441
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,164
- What's your name?
- It's Tina.

442
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,197
- What's your other name?
- Clementina.

443
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,998
Clementina.

444
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,074
- But what's your other name, dear?
- She doesn't understand.

445
00:28:15,243 --> 00:28:17,074
But don't you know your parents' name?

446
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,872
- No, she hasn't any.
- Oh.

447
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,607
Come along, darling.
Go play with the other children.

448
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,683
You mustn't come bursting in like that.

449
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:26,082
- There's a good girl.
- Now, just a moment.

450
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,949
Is this the girl I'm looking for?

451
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,750
Did you steal my hat?

452
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,085
- Did you steal my hat?
- Here it is.

453
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,661
Oh, well, then, darling, you're not guilty.
All right, run along.

454
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,731
- Really a foundling?
- Yes.

455
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:43,101
Oh, Charlotte, you must put a strip
of carpet on those stairs.

456
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,035
Stebbins has a bump on his head.
Johnny has a bruised elbow.

457
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:49,699
- Oh, but they slide down the banisters.
- Well, put nails in the banisters.

458
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,641
- I've tried that and they cut themselves.
- Well, then take the banister away.

459
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,079
- Oh, but they'd fall off.
- Well, put up a sign.

460
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,650
But they can't read.

461
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,879
Then shoot the whole bunch of them
and be done with it and goodbye.

462
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:02,488
- Goodbye.
Goodbye. I'm going.

463
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,386
Why don't you come and have potluck?

464
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,186
I'm just waiting for you to ask me.

465
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,921
- Think over what I've said, dear.
- I have, Delia.

466
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,462
Goodbye.

467
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,896
- Goodbye, doctor.
Goodbye, dear.

468
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,453
Well, well, here you are, Granny.

469
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,797
- Shut up, you old quack.
- Your prayers have been answered.

470
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,024
You're getting rid of your last little girl.

471
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,364
- Yes, this is my last wedding.
- Don't be too sure. I'm still single.

472
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,629
Yeah.

473
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:54,969
You've always been too easy.
The man must be the master.

474
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:58,237
I was just telling Joe, here,
when I was a little wife...

475
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:01,109
...my husband's slightest wish
was my command.

476
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,113
So be firm, Joe.

477
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:04,808
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, Grandma.

478
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,251
Now, why don't you let me slip down
and tell Joe that his little bride will obey?

479
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:12,552
She'll heed the word of her lord, master
and save herself for him...

480
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,423
...and his home and his children?

481
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:20,364
Delia, I'm so tired of this argument.
Will it go on and on after, do you think?

482
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,366
To quote my own dear lord and master:

483
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,631
"The Ralston fortunes
were founded on tenacity to a fixed idea.

484
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,033
They do not change their minds
or allow others to change it for them. "

485
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:35,513
Darling, give up that stable full of noisy,
charming little brats and all will be peace.

486
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,482
The gesture alone
will mean so much to Joe.

487
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,326
- Oh, you look lovely.
- Do I?

488
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:52,427
What's the matter?

489
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,631
Charlotte, what's the matter?

490
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,962
I will not give up my own baby.

491
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,336
- What?
- My own baby.

492
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,643
Which of them do you call your baby?

493
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:08,679
I call my own baby...

494
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,509
...my baby.

495
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,521
Charlotte.

496
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:21,692
Oh, my poor dear Charlotte.

497
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:24,559
Don't pity me. I couldn't stand that.
I don't want pity.

498
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:26,859
I wanna know what to do.
I want you to help me.

499
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:29,469
But I will. My poor Charlotte, I will.

500
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,663
Every minute, all the time.
Pounding at me. "Give them up. "

501
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,808
You, Joe, Jim, Granny. Everybody.

502
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,412
"Give them up. You're so stubborn.
You'll lose Joe. Give them up. "

503
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,343
And I won't. I can't. Could you?

504
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,543
Could you?

505
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:47,052
No. Not if I had a child of my own
hidden among them.

506
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,519
No, I don't think I could do...

507
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:53,024
I had to hide her. What else could I do?

508
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,694
- A girl?
- A little girl, yes.

509
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:59,822
- The foundling?
- The foundling. Tina. Yes.

510
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,060
Oh, Delia.
Delia, please go and talk to them.

511
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:05,672
Tell them that you see my point.
Tell them that you agree.

512
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:09,710
How could I? What reason could I give?

513
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,243
Then I must tell Joe the truth.

514
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:15,707
And lose him?

515
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:19,617
But, Delia, he's human. He loves me.

516
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:22,551
A Ralston in love is something more
than just human.

517
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:25,420
He'd never forgive you. You know it.

518
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,458
If it comes to that,
what decent man do we know who would?

519
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,393
Well, Delia, what can I do?

520
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:36,099
The time is getting so near.
We must think quickly.

521
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,864
Darling, don't look like that.

522
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:41,500
You loved someone?

523
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,644
I did. Ever since I was a little girl.

524
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:47,269
- Then, if he was in love with you, why...?
- You see, he loved someone else.

525
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,110
- You knew that?
- Yes, I knew it.

526
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:55,221
- I tried to think differently but I knew it.
- Charlotte, how could you?

527
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,385
I loved him.

528
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,423
I'm not pretending it wasn't a sin.

529
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,688
He was lonely and unhappy
before he went away.

530
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:04,126
- He went away?
- Yes.

531
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:06,528
- Knowing?
- No, he never knew.

532
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,726
You see, he never came back.

533
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,199
He never will.

534
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,165
Why won't he come back?

535
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:19,174
Where did he go?

536
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,948
Why won't you tell me who it was?

537
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:23,981
How can I help you
if you don't trust me?

538
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,416
Oh, Delia, I've told you
all you need to know.

539
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,145
Where did he go?

540
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,287
He went to war?

541
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,689
He was killed at Vicksburg.

542
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:38,864
Tina. The child said Clementina.

543
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,626
Clem Spender.

544
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,101
You and Clem.

545
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,172
But how could that hurt you?
You threw Clem away.

546
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:50,401
Clem Spender. You and Clem.

547
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,380
Delia.

548
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,175
You still love him.

549
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:56,543
You hypocrite.

550
00:33:56,718 --> 00:34:00,176
Our little Charlotte with her good deeds.
Her haven for destitute children.

551
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,981
Twenty children to hide one child.

552
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:04,147
Yes, his child.

553
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:05,758
That's what hurt you.

554
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:09,192
I should never let you know.
I might have known you can't forgive that.

555
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:13,729
How dare you imply such a thing?
I won't even discuss it.

556
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:21,273
We must...
We must think of something to do.

557
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,970
You said your first instinct
was to tell Joe the truth.

558
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,637
- You were right. You must tell him.
- Tell him?

559
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,943
What you've told me.
I can't connive a lie, not to Jim's brother.

560
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,556
But you just said yourself, he's a Ralston.
He'd never forgive me. That I'd lose him.

561
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:38,157
Better lose him than deceive a man
into a marriage.

562
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,022
- A man you don't even love.
- Oh, Delia, listen to me.

563
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,890
I do love Joe.

564
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,498
Not in the way I loved Clem
but differently.

565
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,858
In the way that you love Jim differently.

566
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:50,936
I'll be a good wife to him.
He'll never be sorry he married me.

567
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:53,331
- Are you going to tell him?
- But I can't.

568
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,476
- Then I will.
- Delia.

569
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:18,189
Oh, pardon me. Will you come with me?
We must find Joe.

570
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,334
- Pardon me.
- Sure.

571
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,193
I read it. I don't know how much truth
there was in it.

572
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,465
- They write all sorts of things.
Oh, excuse me.

573
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:28,768
I must speak with you immediately.
That'll be all.

574
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:30,376
Excuse me.
Shut the door.

575
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,570
Do you mind?
Not at all.

576
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,215
- What is it, Jim?
- I don't know.

577
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:39,916
What is it, Delia?

578
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:42,681
I must tell you about Charlotte
before it's too late.

579
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,188
- What?
- Yes?

580
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:47,225
Charlotte isn't entering
into this marriage honorably.

581
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,727
- Not honorably?
- Will you explain, Delia?

582
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,726
Yes, I...

583
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,891
Is it about those children?

584
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,197
In a way, yes. She won't give them up.
She just told me.

585
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,636
- She's becoming very attached to them.
Naturally.

586
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:03,072
Naturally. Especially one of them,
a little girl.

587
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,077
You may have seen her there, a foundling.
Her name is Tina.

588
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,648
I've told Charlotte I'll give her
anything she needs for their support.

589
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,843
- That's very generous but it's not enough.
- No?

590
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,046
No, she's going to give them
her personal care every day herself.

591
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,658
Yes, she told me.
It's a very tender, charming wish.

592
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:19,850
And I'd let her do it.

593
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:22,018
I'd put up with the inconvenience...

594
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:25,563
...but there's a far more serious reason
for opposing her.

595
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,732
- What?
Her health.

596
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,130
Her health?

597
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:31,362
You mean because she went out West
that time.

598
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:34,235
Yes. I can speak frankly to you.

599
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,069
You're my brother's wife.

600
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:38,439
The apprehension
that our relatives have had...

601
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,706
...on the grounds of health.

602
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:43,210
Charlotte...

603
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,010
- You mean...?
Yes.

604
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:49,588
Her father was a very young man
when he died of lung fever.

605
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:52,487
Am I being unreasonable
in asking Charlotte not to go on...

606
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,221
...taking these unnecessary risks?
No, of course you're not.

607
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:58,855
She won't give them up.

608
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,059
Then I must be the one to give in.

609
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:04,035
She can do exactly as she wishes
in the matter?

610
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:06,901
Yes, I'm tired of the argument.
I'm going to tell her.

611
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,042
It's no use, Joe. There's something else.

612
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,979
Delia, what did you come down
into this room to tell me?

613
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,509
Was it about those children?

614
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,181
You said when you came in here that
Charlotte was not marrying me honorably.

615
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:25,222
- What did you mean?
- She can't marry you.

616
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:29,227
- She can't marry anyone now.
- Why? Why can't she?

617
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,398
You were talking about her health.
You were right. She is ill.

618
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,761
She's ill now upstairs. She just told me.

619
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:36,301
Told you what?

620
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,439
She's been coughing again.
That sickness has come back on her.

621
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,168
That's why she can't ever marry anyone.
She's frightened.

622
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:47,371
She asked me to tell you.
She couldn't bear to tell you herself.

623
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:52,210
Why wasn't I told at once?

624
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:56,779
Because you can't tell
those things easily.

625
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:00,883
I'm not going to give her up, Jim. I can't.

626
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:02,652
We must take care of her.

627
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,197
Yes, but you can't marry her.
It wouldn't be a marriage.

628
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:10,066
You'd both be miserable
and you wouldn't dare to have children.

629
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,663
Better face it, Joe.

630
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:16,405
- Yes.
She's in my room.

631
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,307
Joe?

632
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,112
You'll consider her feelings.

633
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:24,148
You won't discuss it with her.

634
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:27,116
Just tell her that she's free
and that you understand.

635
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,806
When Charlotte went West five years ago,
it was because of lung trouble, wasn't it?

636
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:47,998
Yes.

637
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:51,008
It was expected she might die
as her father did, wasn't it?

638
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:54,272
Yes, I thought everyone knew that.
You did, didn't you?

639
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,743
It's in her family, isn't it?

640
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,442
I thought everybody knew that too.

641
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:04,419
If she were not cured,
what if it should come back?

642
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:07,927
Isn't Charlotte perfectly well?
Why do you ask me this?

643
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,928
Because I wanna know
whether she should marry or not.

644
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:15,057
If she began coughing again,
what would you say to that?

645
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,762
It's a very bad sign.

646
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,133
Thank you, doctor.

647
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:44,258
Will you excuse
Charlotte and me, please?

648
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,059
- Thank you.
My goodness.

649
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:49,566
Miss Charlotte, it's unlucky
to see the bridegroom before the wedding.

650
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:52,297
- Dora, go, please.
- Yes, miss.

651
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,405
Charlotte, Delia has told me.

652
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,506
Has she?

653
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,148
My poor Charlotte.

654
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,820
I don't know what to say.

655
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,791
There isn't anything to say.

656
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,096
If there is anything I can do
now or any time...

657
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,163
Charlotte, I release you.

658
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:52,529
Everything that can be done
is being done.

659
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:54,963
All we can do is to wait.

660
00:40:57,504 --> 00:40:59,870
Oh, it's Charlotte.

661
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,947
Good evening, Miss Charlotte.

662
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:10,007
You're a very welcome stranger.

663
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:11,741
Thank you. How's Jim?

664
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:13,852
Well, we're at the crisis now.

665
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,956
Concussion, skull fracture. It's bad.

666
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,354
You'd hardly believe
that a big man like Jim...

667
00:41:19,526 --> 00:41:22,290
- His horse stumbles and he's...
- Poor Delia.

668
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:25,295
Yes, it's very kind of you to come.

669
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:26,557
She needs someone now.

670
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,997
Naturally, I would come
at a time like this.

671
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:31,831
- I'll tell Delia you're here.
- Thank you.

672
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,903
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Charlotte.

673
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:37,102
How are you?

674
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:40,041
Well, right now, of course,
with Jim upstairs...

675
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:43,341
Yes, you and Jim have always been near
to each other, haven't you?

676
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:44,916
Yes.

677
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:46,517
He's strong as an ox.

678
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:48,017
You can't kill a Ralston.

679
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:49,815
He'll come through, we hope.

680
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,685
Oh, I hope so.

681
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:58,790
You've been away, haven't you, Joe?

682
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,532
Yes, I wanted a change.

683
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:04,169
I took over the bank in Boston.

684
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:12,940
I read the news
about your being married.

685
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:14,340
My congratulations.

686
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:19,451
Thank you, Charlotte.

687
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,052
I hope you'll be happy.

688
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,121
I think we will be.

689
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:31,828
What about you, Charlotte?

690
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:33,898
- How are you?
- Very well.

691
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:38,026
I've been living on in the same old place
since Granny died.

692
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:40,362
I got your flowers.

693
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,475
I'd like to have come down to see you
but I couldn't get away.

694
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:45,907
Well, there wouldn't have been
any point.

695
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:48,608
You see, I...

696
00:42:48,915 --> 00:42:51,076
I did give up the nursery, after all.

697
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:55,414
Yes, naturally, under the circumstances.

698
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:58,151
Yes.

699
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:04,530
I can't understand it, really.

700
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:06,393
What, Joe?

701
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,327
You look so well, Charlotte.

702
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,370
- Your health has improved?
- My health?

703
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,373
Yes, you're feeling better?
You've never looked better.

704
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:18,010
Feeling better than when, Joe?

705
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,238
Well, better than when I...

706
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:23,509
I...

707
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:34,389
Better than when you...

708
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:41,763
Mr. And Mrs. Alfred Brooks are here, sir.

709
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:45,029
Look here, Charlotte, I'm sorry.
I'm dreadfully sorry.

710
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,106
Delia asked me not to talk to you about it
when you were ill.

711
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:49,401
Too ill.

712
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:52,136
Will you forgive an indelicate idiot?

713
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,009
Delia said that...

714
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,240
- Delia told...
- I'm terribly sorry, Charlotte.

715
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,544
I should have known
it would be painful to you. I see it is.

716
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,519
I didn't come to see you, because I could
understand your wish to be let alone.

717
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,488
Now the first time I do meet you,
I've blundered.

718
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,184
I've hurt you.

719
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:10,893
I'm so sorry.

720
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,630
Please excuse me.

721
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,099
Charlotte.

722
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:27,644
Charlotte, dear. It's been so long.

723
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:30,141
Thank you so much for coming now.

724
00:44:30,317 --> 00:44:31,944
It's sweet of you to...

725
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:36,621
Charlotte.

726
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,315
I've just found out from Joe about Tina.

727
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:40,857
- What?
- About Tina.

728
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:45,864
When you found out about Clem,
you hated me, didn't you?

729
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:48,159
I could have gone to Joe myself
and told him.

730
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:49,393
He loved me.

731
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:51,161
He might have let me keep Tina.

732
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,705
But you lied to make sure
I wouldn't have a chance, didn't you?

733
00:44:55,075 --> 00:44:58,374
He wanted to see me but I refused
because I was so ashamed.

734
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:00,445
It was wicked of you.

735
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,050
Delia, you must be brave.

736
00:45:16,763 --> 00:45:19,561
He's gone? Jim?

737
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:23,464
Suddenly. He just went to sleep.

738
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,441
There are more things out in the sleigh.

739
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:09,208
Well, here we are.

740
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:10,815
- You know Miss Force?
- Yes.

741
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:12,212
Good evening.

742
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:14,717
Just take those out there, Kirby.

743
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:17,288
- Is Dora here?
- Yes, Dora and the child are here.

744
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:20,017
Oh, I can't wait.
Are they hanging up their stockings?

745
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:21,387
Yes, Mrs. Ralston.

746
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:23,358
Come along, Charlotte.

747
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,522
- Is Tina behaving?
- As well as can be expected.

748
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,363
Of course she is.
If she's any worse than my two brats.

749
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:34,265
- Charlotte.
- Yes?

750
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:38,434
Charlotte, why don't you live here,
you and Tina?

751
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:39,669
Live here?

752
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:41,837
Yes, let's be practical.

753
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,575
Let's stand in the spirit
of Christmas and be cousins.

754
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:45,775
Charlotte and Delia.

755
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:48,147
We're both alone now
except for our children.

756
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:50,050
Jim's gone and Granny's gone.

757
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:52,919
You're living in that empty place
and I'm living here in...

758
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:54,492
Well, look at it.

759
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:56,788
Why, really, we should all be together.

760
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,029
No, Delia.

761
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,032
It's just for Christmas and Santa Claus.

762
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:04,561
Oh, I see it has its advantages.

763
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:09,266
You're very kind
but I do want to take care of Tina myself.

764
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:10,739
We're very happy together.

765
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:14,370
Tina and you live together happily now,
naturally, she's a child.

766
00:47:14,547 --> 00:47:16,879
But a day is coming
when you'll have to tell her.

767
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,883
She'll have to be told something.
It'll be in your hands.

768
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:21,782
You lie to her or tell her the truth.

769
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:26,016
Either way will be horrible for you
and possibly worse for Tina later.

770
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:27,989
I know all that, Delia.

771
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:31,896
Why should you, because you're
guilty of a child's existence...

772
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:34,090
...allow your remorse to color her life?

773
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:40,331
It's your duty to put her into a normal life
with toys and games and companions.

774
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,702
You'll do your best.
Here she'd have everything.

775
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:46,107
Yeah, I know all that.
But I want to take care of Tina myself.

776
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:48,713
Whatever you do
will be of your own free will...

777
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:52,283
...but it isn't fair to bring up
that child alone and you know it.

778
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:55,416
Let's not decide now. It's Christmas.

779
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:58,284
Get that look off your face. Come on.

780
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:02,590
My, it's warm and quiet in here, isn't it?

781
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:03,922
Yes, I suppose it is.

782
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:07,555
Do you suppose it's too late for Tina
to look at little Miss Dee's dolls?

783
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:10,794
I'm afraid all the dolls and toys
have been put away for the night.

784
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,235
Look, Tina, the nice lady
is going to warm your bed.

785
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:16,898
Well, we're not so very strict with Tina.

786
00:48:17,076 --> 00:48:20,534
Children who are not handled
are apt to become precocious.

787
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:23,147
Precocious?
Is that something to do with her insides?

788
00:48:23,316 --> 00:48:24,840
Can they catch it?

789
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:27,145
- Are you joking?
- No, ma'am.

790
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,381
Personally, I think it's a great mistake
mixing classes, even with children.

791
00:48:31,558 --> 00:48:32,582
Oh, now, go on.

792
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:35,523
We was children ourselves once
and it's only over Christmas.

793
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:37,560
You'll take to Tina. Everyone does.

794
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,220
- She's a little tartar...
Hello.

795
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:41,560
Well, here's Tina.

796
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:42,962
- Are you happy?
Yes.

797
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:44,398
Isn't she sweet?

798
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:45,799
How's my darling?

799
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:47,837
Well.

800
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,871
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

801
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:57,439
- Has she been a good girl?
- Of course, miss.

802
00:48:57,617 --> 00:49:00,051
- Did you bring her stocking?
- I brought one for her.

803
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,121
Oh, good, Dora.
Come on, darling. Come on.

804
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:06,281
We're gonna hang up your stocking
and then...

805
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,685
Miss Force, did you hang
a Christmas stocking for Tina?

806
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,091
I was just going to.

807
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:13,255
Santa will come down and fill it for you.

808
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:14,661
Santa Claus in the morning.

809
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:17,860
Now, prayers and then bed.
Come along, Jimmy, down.

810
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:20,028
Do you say prayers too, Tina?

811
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:23,642
- Of course she does. Three different ones.
- Oh, come along, then.

812
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,045
Come on. Down.

813
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:31,683
Close your eyes.
Mm-hm.

814
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:35,412
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep</i>

815
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:38,921
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep</i>

816
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:40,719
<i>My soul to keep</i>

817
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:45,092
<i>It...
It I shall die betore I wake</i>

818
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:48,701
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to take</i>

819
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:49,926
Amen.
Amen.

820
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:51,161
Amen.
Amen.

821
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:52,736
That's right.

822
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:56,638
What are you doing?

823
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,740
- Tina, darling. Say amen.
- Amen.

824
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,347
That's a good girl. I'll tuck her in.

825
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:04,449
That's it. Remove your robe.

826
00:50:04,617 --> 00:50:06,084
That's my boy.

827
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:07,879
Here we are.

828
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:09,316
Let's take your shoes off.

829
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:10,956
That's it.

830
00:50:11,124 --> 00:50:13,024
There.
- Oh, gentle.

831
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:15,854
See how good they are, Tina.

832
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:17,719
Good night, Mommy.

833
00:50:17,897 --> 00:50:19,296
Good night, angel.

834
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:22,526
- Say good night to Aunt Charlotte.
- Good night.

835
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:23,960
Good night, Jimmy.

836
00:50:24,137 --> 00:50:26,332
Come on. Here we go, off to bed.

837
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,997
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, precious.

838
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:32,338
- Say good night to Aunt Charlotte.
- Good night, Aunt Charlotte.

839
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:35,106
Good night, Dee.
Come on, Tina. Here we go.

840
00:50:35,281 --> 00:50:39,149
Right to bed and wake up
in the morning. Whoops.

841
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:44,916
Here. We'll put our feet way down
and we'll grow to be a big, tall girl.

842
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:46,115
That's right.

843
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:48,624
That's right. Yes.

844
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,127
You mustn't have a pillow.
That's bad for girls.

845
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,458
There we are. Now go to sleep quickly.

846
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,033
Santa will come in the morning.
That's right.

847
00:50:56,202 --> 00:50:59,194
Tina, how would you like to cuddle this?

848
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:02,333
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mommy.

849
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:10,947
Good night, Aunt Charlotte.

850
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:16,754
Aunt Charlotte.

851
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,093
What else can she ever call me...

852
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:31,664
...but Aunt Charlotte?

853
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:20,719
"... shine upon you
and be gracious unto you.

854
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:24,084
The Lord lift up his countenance upon you
and give you peace...

855
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:28,626
...both now and in the life everlasting.
Amen. "

856
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:40,471
Dora, why are you standing
there mooning?

857
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,665
Well, I thought
you was downstairs, miss.

858
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:46,403
There's a great deal to be done.
Somebody must see that it gets done.

859
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,638
They mustn't miss their train.

860
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:53,879
Dora, bring Miss Dee's clothes
in by the fire.

861
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:56,112
- Yes, miss.
- Hurry.

862
00:52:59,058 --> 00:53:01,083
I see no reason for tears.

863
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,091
Well, I can't help it, Miss Charlotte.

864
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,991
I'm that unstrung.

865
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:06,995
You know me and weddings.

866
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:12,297
I can't help remembering that 20 years ago,
20 years come this June, in this very room...

867
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:15,532
...Miss Delia had her near tragedy
and I was here.

868
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:19,144
- I remember without being reminded.
- I can't help it, Miss Charlotte.

869
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,610
I can't help remembering
that five years later...

870
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,681
...right in this room, too, you...

871
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,374
Dora.

872
00:53:36,062 --> 00:53:40,055
And now it's Miss Delia's own daughter,
little Miss Dee.

873
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:42,667
I hope to heaven this wedding
goes through all right.

874
00:53:43,035 --> 00:53:45,128
The orchestra is playing the recessional.

875
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:47,067
I hardly think anything can happen.

876
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,573
Well, just the same,
I'll feel easier in my mind when it's all over.

877
00:53:50,743 --> 00:53:54,440
I must go to Miss Dee's room and see that
her luggage is properly taken care of.

878
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:59,681
Dora, if you can manage to control yourself
long enough to get Miss Dee dressed...

879
00:53:59,852 --> 00:54:01,479
...it would be a great help.

880
00:54:01,654 --> 00:54:04,589
I'll try, miss,
but I can't give no guarantee.

881
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:07,192
You must hurry now.

882
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,555
- Oh, Dee.
- Oh, Mommy, it was so beautiful.

883
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:12,357
Let me look at you. My own daughter.

884
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:13,897
Oh, I can't realize it.

885
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,933
My own daughter grown up and married.

886
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:20,436
Oh, it is beautiful but it's awful too.

887
00:54:20,606 --> 00:54:23,769
Dee. Dee, my dear.
You must hurry and catch your train.

888
00:54:23,943 --> 00:54:26,741
- Dear Aunt Charlotte.
I caught it. I caught it. I caught it.

889
00:54:26,913 --> 00:54:28,380
Tina.

890
00:54:29,382 --> 00:54:30,406
Yes, Aunt Charlotte.

891
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,245
- What are you doing?
- Dee threw her bouquet. I caught it...

892
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:36,479
Is that an example for one lady
of the house to set for the others?

893
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:40,217
Tina, come on.
Go in and help Dee dress, dear. Come along.

894
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:42,759
I must go see if Dee's luggage
is taken care of.

895
00:54:43,129 --> 00:54:45,029
I'm so...

896
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:46,891
...happy.

897
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,933
Oh, good gracious.
I thought something had happened.

898
00:54:50,102 --> 00:54:53,663
I'm so happy. I can't bear it.

899
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,638
Now, go right on crying.
Why, you should.

900
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:58,800
You're the luckiest girl in the world.

901
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:02,345
But you've started out right
with something old and something new.

902
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:04,915
Something borrowed
and something blue.

903
00:55:05,184 --> 00:55:08,381
Your gentleman has lots of money
and your mother has lots of money...

904
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:11,148
...and there's no war now.
You're a very lucky girl.

905
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:12,848
I know it.

906
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:15,118
Here's your blue garter.
May I wear it away?

907
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:16,659
Well, of course.

908
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:19,730
Your mother did
and she's always had good luck.

909
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,335
I suppose before we know it,
we'll be getting Miss Tina married off.

910
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:27,097
I'd better buy another pair of blue garters
just in case.

911
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,675
Dee. Oh, Dee, darling, it was so lovely.

912
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:32,572
Tina, darling, I'm married.

913
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:35,213
Oh, I'm really married, Tina.

914
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:36,575
I wish I were.

915
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:39,684
- We were saying you soon will be.
- Don't you just love weddings?

916
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:43,885
I don't know what there is about them
but there's just something in the air.

917
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:47,992
- Think one wedding can lead to another?
- Oh, I thought Lanning's parents objected.

918
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,493
They're downstairs right now
glowering at me but I don't care.

919
00:55:51,664 --> 00:55:54,155
I just can't take my eyes off him.

920
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,298
Dee, let's always be happy
and let them glower and glower...

921
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,062
You're mad.

922
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,798
I don't know what we'll do tonight
after you've gone.

923
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:04,807
Dear Aunt Charlotte
will probably want to put us all to bed.

924
00:56:04,977 --> 00:56:06,569
Mommy will wanna have a weep and...

925
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:09,647
- Hasn't Mommy been nice?
- Well, of course. She's Mommy.

926
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,410
- She did look lovely, didn't she?
- Didn't she?

927
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,648
Are you going to spend
your honeymoon with your husband...

928
00:56:15,821 --> 00:56:19,382
...or chattering with Miss Tina?
Come on, now.

929
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,053
Hurry up.

930
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,861
- Here comes the bride.
Darling.

931
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:30,935
Darling, you've been years.

932
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:33,264
Aunt Charlotte,
you've managed everything beautifully.

933
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:34,804
We can never thank you enough.

934
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,601
I can't let you go.
- Oh, Dee.

935
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:38,243
Tina, we've said our goodbyes.

936
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:40,345
Yes, but I want you
to tell Lanning goodbye.

937
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:43,738
- Goodbye, Lanning.
- Goodbye, Dee.

938
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:46,009
Dee.
- Oh, my big brother, Jimmy.

939
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:48,619
- Darling. Be good to her, John.
- I will.

940
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:50,619
- You'll miss your train.
- Here she goes.

941
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:54,055
- Now I've only got Tina left.
- Don't worry, Mother, I'm here.

942
00:56:54,226 --> 00:56:55,716
- I know, darling.
Goodbye.

943
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:58,056
Bye.
Goodbye.

944
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,390
Goodbye.

945
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:05,861
There's your boy now, Mr. Halsey.

946
00:57:06,038 --> 00:57:07,130
What are they doing?

947
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:09,672
It looks as though
a little dance is anticipated.

948
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:11,605
But what time is it?

949
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:13,938
My good mother and father
have their eye on us.

950
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:16,377
- They're glowering and glowering.
- No, not really.

951
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:18,016
Won't there be a row about this?

952
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,244
Well, if we can get the rug up
before dear Aunt Charlotte...

953
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,411
Here she is now.

954
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:25,213
Tina?

955
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:26,886
What are you doing?

956
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,584
We're rolling up the rugs.
We're going to have a dance.

957
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:32,595
Wouldn't it be better manners
for a lady to ask permission?

958
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:34,027
But I did.

959
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,861
I asked my feet and my feet told me.

960
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:38,528
There has been enough excitement
here today.

961
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:41,298
Perhaps for you, Aunt Charlotte,
but not enough for me.

962
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:44,204
You don't mind if we dance
even though Aunt Charlotte does?

963
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,004
I don't know. If Charlotte thinks...

964
00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:48,908
Oh, why must we always abide
by what Aunt Charlotte thinks?

965
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:51,242
Because she doesn't dance.
She's never danced.

966
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:52,645
Tina.

967
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:54,683
I apologize.

968
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:57,448
We'll all sit around
and weep for the departed.

969
00:57:57,623 --> 00:57:58,988
Do you suppose there's any harm in it?

970
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:02,954
Personally, I've had one little weep
and I expect to have another later.

971
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:08,299
But right now,
I would like one little waltz with my son.

972
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,432
Miss Lovell...

973
00:58:15,207 --> 00:58:17,368
...will you dance with me?

974
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,305
You heard what Tina said.

975
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:22,741
I don't dance.

976
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:25,515
I never have danced.

977
00:58:28,854 --> 00:58:31,448
We must do something about it.
Just look at them.

978
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:34,457
Don't worry. We'll pack him off to Paris.
That'll stop it.

979
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:37,289
She's nothing at all.
Nobody knows where she came from.

980
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:39,158
A foundling.

981
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:44,834
Good night, Charlotte.
Good night.

982
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:50,540
Doctor, dance?

983
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,804
Oh, Clem.

984
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,744
I shouldn't worry too much
about her, Charlotte.

985
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:08,514
After all, when you and I privately think
of Tina's origin...

986
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:11,588
...it's not too surprising that she has...

987
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:15,158
...shall we say, spirit, freedom?

988
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:17,725
I can see him in every move she makes.

989
01:00:17,897 --> 01:00:19,592
And so can I.

990
01:00:19,765 --> 01:00:21,858
That's why I'm so frightened.

991
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,229
But you've done your best for her.

992
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:27,966
When one thinks how pleasant it is
to live in this house...

993
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:32,076
...you must feel a sense of satisfaction
having found her such a fine home.

994
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:34,542
If Tina's life has been pleasant
in this house...

995
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:36,476
...it's because of Delia, not I.

996
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:42,476
Well, we won't go into the sacrifices
you've made for the child, Charlotte...

997
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:44,316
...but Delia has done her best also.

998
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,849
Best to spoil her.

999
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:49,688
Ever since the first day
we came here to live.

1000
01:00:50,095 --> 01:00:52,359
Now that her child is married,
there's nothing.

1001
01:00:52,531 --> 01:00:56,433
Nothing in the world that Tina won't have,
can't take for the asking.

1002
01:00:57,536 --> 01:01:00,403
Now, now, no more arguments.

1003
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:04,001
You may not believe it but I am ready.

1004
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:05,666
Ready for the dance, huh?

1005
01:01:05,844 --> 01:01:07,903
Aren't you proud of our girl,
Aunt Charlotte?

1006
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,672
Do you like me?

1007
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:11,941
- I think I'll be quite a sensation.
- Oh, Tina.

1008
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:13,584
- Do you like my hair?
- Beautiful.

1009
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:16,016
Do you think people will notice it?
- Tina.

1010
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:19,055
Tina, why must you think people
are interested in you?

1011
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:21,553
Why shouldn't I? Aren't they?

1012
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:24,855
Oh, my dear, what will people think of you
if you say such things?

1013
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:26,691
Exactly what she deserves, probably.

1014
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:29,294
Aunt Charlotte's always finding fault
with me.

1015
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:31,333
You're not perfection, my child.

1016
01:01:31,503 --> 01:01:33,095
I know someone who thinks I am.

1017
01:01:35,574 --> 01:01:38,941
Dear, if you're going, you'd better go.
You're half an hour late already.

1018
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:41,602
It doesn't really matter
if one is late to a ball.

1019
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,613
Being late anywhere
matters more than you think.

1020
01:01:44,783 --> 01:01:46,648
Thank you, doctor.

1021
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:49,714
Notice that people
who have no regard for punctuality...

1022
01:01:49,888 --> 01:01:51,947
...have no regard
for other things as well.

1023
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:54,522
I'm going.

1024
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:57,620
- Thank you.
- The carriage is ready.

1025
01:01:57,796 --> 01:02:00,526
The horses don't like standing
on a cold night like this.

1026
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:02,132
Oh, fiddle the horses.

1027
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:04,231
Speaking of horses, that reminds me.

1028
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:07,395
My own poor, bedraggled beast
has been waiting more than an hour.

1029
01:02:07,573 --> 01:02:09,006
Good night, my dears.

1030
01:02:09,174 --> 01:02:12,473
And, Tina, don't break all their hearts.

1031
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,704
- Good night, Dr. Lanskell.
- Good night, dear.

1032
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,974
You must wear your boots, Tina.
It's snowy outside.

1033
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:20,651
Mommy, must I wear those ugly things?

1034
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,885
Yes, dear, your Aunt Charlotte is right.

1035
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:26,449
I'll appreciate it if you'll come home
when the carriage is ready.

1036
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:27,853
Oh, after all...

1037
01:02:28,027 --> 01:02:31,292
I don't expect you to come late
with the neighbors as you did before.

1038
01:02:31,463 --> 01:02:33,795
Will you tell Aunt Charlotte
to stop finding fault?

1039
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:35,194
Child. Child.

1040
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,927
Somebody must find fault sometimes.

1041
01:02:38,103 --> 01:02:39,730
You see?

1042
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:42,005
You think Mommy spoils me
but she doesn't.

1043
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:45,610
She understands me while you don't.
Mommy knows what it is to be young...

1044
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:49,305
...and have people fond of her.
While you, you've never been young.

1045
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:51,108
Tina.

1046
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:57,812
Tina?

1047
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:01,716
Wait outside, boys.

1048
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:03,418
Come here, Tina.

1049
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:09,592
I want you to promise me, never speak
like that to your Aunt Charlotte again.

1050
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:11,292
You heard how she speaks to me.

1051
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:15,406
- I only said the truth.
- Oh, Tina, dear.

1052
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:19,636
You do understand me, don't you?

1053
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:25,207
And even... Even though
I'm not your very own like Dee...

1054
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,477
...I feel as if I were.

1055
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:32,255
I can never, never thank you enough for
taking me in and treating me as if I were.

1056
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,652
I took you in because your Aunt Charlotte
wouldn't come to live with me...

1057
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:39,730
...unless I took you too.
- Oh, that's all very well to say...

1058
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,423
...but would you have wanted her
without me?

1059
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:44,159
Now, tell the truth, Mommy.

1060
01:03:44,336 --> 01:03:46,304
I wanted you both.
That's beside the point.

1061
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:48,770
Now, run in and make it up
to your Aunt Charlotte.

1062
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:53,275
I will tomorrow. Lanny's waiting for me.
I've got to go. I love you so much.

1063
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:56,804
I've got my key,
please make Aunt Charlotte go to bed.

1064
01:03:56,982 --> 01:04:00,474
If I'm late, she's always pretending she
didn't know whether I could get in.

1065
01:04:00,652 --> 01:04:02,051
You have forgotten your boots.

1066
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:05,213
Oh, well, it's frozen ground.
It's just a step to the carriage.

1067
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:07,723
- Dear, run along.
- Oh, mind the cold.

1068
01:04:07,893 --> 01:04:10,088
I do wish you were coming, Mommy.

1069
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:12,162
Aunt Charlotte doesn't mind
being left alone.

1070
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:14,492
This is a young people's ball, darling.

1071
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,327
You're young.

1072
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:18,293
Good night.

1073
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,662
Will you ring when you want
your hot milk, miss?

1074
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:52,531
Yes, Dora.

1075
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:05,539
Oh, they go out to play
and I don't feel a bit like knitting.

1076
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:08,315
Why do we grow old?

1077
01:05:08,887 --> 01:05:13,290
I suppose you felt you must scold Tina
because of the way she talked to me.

1078
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:16,019
I made her realize it was disrespectful.

1079
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:20,689
She thinks I can't understand.
She considers me an old maid.

1080
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:24,768
- My dear.
- A ridiculous, narrow-minded old maid.

1081
01:05:25,904 --> 01:05:28,236
What else can she ever think of me?

1082
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:29,931
Poor Charlotte.

1083
01:05:30,108 --> 01:05:34,101
Oh, but you needn't pity me,
because she's really mine.

1084
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:39,941
And if she considers me an old maid, it's
because I've made myself one in her eyes.

1085
01:05:40,118 --> 01:05:43,383
I've done it from the beginning.
She wouldn't have the least suspicion.

1086
01:05:43,555 --> 01:05:47,389
I've practiced everything I've ever had
to say to her, if it was important...

1087
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:50,852
...so that I'd sound like
an old-maid aunt talking...

1088
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:53,124
...not her mother.

1089
01:05:53,632 --> 01:05:56,897
After all, darling, there isn't anything
important to say to her now.

1090
01:05:57,069 --> 01:05:59,629
She has every attribute of a modern,
successful woman.

1091
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:04,640
She's healthy, she's young,
she's gay, she's attractive.

1092
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:08,712
I've known for some time the day would
come when we would have to talk this out.

1093
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:12,840
- What?
- Tina's future.

1094
01:06:13,218 --> 01:06:17,177
You've noticed what's been happening
since Lanning's been coming here so often.

1095
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:20,223
He's such a nice young man.
Do you dislike him?

1096
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:23,184
Aren't you jumping
to an optimistic conclusion?

1097
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:28,061
In the first place, we both know
Lanning's parents do not consider...

1098
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:30,963
...a marriage to Tina as desirable.

1099
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:36,097
Unfortunately,
my girl has no position, no name.

1100
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:38,607
But if it's not to be Lanning,
there'll be others.

1101
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:40,904
Good heavens,
the girl's not 20 yet. Wait.

1102
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,277
Wait. Yes. And if she doesn't wait?

1103
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:49,852
- What do you mean?
- Don't forget, Delia, I know Tina.

1104
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:54,482
After all, she's mine. I know her
better than anyone else in the world...

1105
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,629
...every thought, every act,
every temptation.

1106
01:06:58,096 --> 01:07:00,656
And Lanning is in her mind.

1107
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:03,892
- Perhaps, even more...
- You're insinuating that she's...

1108
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:08,267
- I'm remembering myself.
- Oh, surely, you trust your own child.

1109
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:10,206
Granny trusted me.

1110
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:12,036
She's perfect.

1111
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:16,340
Let us say, then, she must pay
for my imperfections.

1112
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:19,507
All I want
is that she shan't pay too heavily.

1113
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,749
Delia, you must be tired.

1114
01:07:23,922 --> 01:07:25,981
You'd better be getting to bed.

1115
01:07:26,692 --> 01:07:29,490
There's no reason
why you should wait up for Tina.

1116
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:31,561
Why should you wait up for her either?

1117
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:35,894
She has the key and the carriage
will bring them all home together.

1118
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:39,265
Go along. I'll turn out the lights.

1119
01:07:39,438 --> 01:07:42,999
- I hope they've kept your fire up.
- I'm sure they have.

1120
01:07:43,175 --> 01:07:46,872
If you can't sleep, take one of those pills
that Dr. Lanskell left.

1121
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:49,513
I will, thank you. Good night.

1122
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:52,148
Good night, Delia.

1123
01:08:09,468 --> 01:08:11,663
Oh, Tina, Tina, Tina.

1124
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:17,503
My darling little girl,
so spoiled, so headstrong.

1125
01:08:17,976 --> 01:08:20,843
You know, you shouldn't have gone out
without your boots.

1126
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:23,773
You'll walk home with Lanning.

1127
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:25,917
I'm so worried.

1128
01:08:34,126 --> 01:08:35,616
Tina.

1129
01:08:36,428 --> 01:08:41,229
You walked home with Lanning
and without your boots too.

1130
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:43,731
You shouldn't do these things.

1131
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:46,835
Do you know how late it is?

1132
01:08:55,347 --> 01:08:56,780
Tina.

1133
01:08:56,948 --> 01:08:58,415
Tina.

1134
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:05,022
Oh, Lanning. Shh. You must go.

1135
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,158
Not yet. They're all asleep.

1136
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:11,052
Lanning, this is very wicked of us.

1137
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,220
Is it? Why?

1138
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:17,357
You're going away. To Europe.
I wish you'd come with me.

1139
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:18,730
I wish you wouldn't go.

1140
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,599
You don't think I wanna go, do you?

1141
01:09:20,772 --> 01:09:23,206
Then why do you go?
What else can I do?

1142
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,605
It's Mother and Dad, of course.

1143
01:09:25,944 --> 01:09:27,912
They don't like me.

1144
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:32,909
It isn't that they don't like you
as a person.

1145
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:37,021
I mean, it's... Well, you know how it is
in a family like mine.

1146
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:39,387
It's just because I'm not anybody.

1147
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:43,119
Tina, if I had any money of my own,
even if I were trained for a job...

1148
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:46,787
...so I could tell them to go to blazes,
then things would be different.

1149
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:50,628
- What sort of things, Lanning?
- With us, dearest.

1150
01:09:55,474 --> 01:09:58,443
- You're cold.
- No.

1151
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:02,241
Yes. I don't know.

1152
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:06,950
Tina. Tina, please don't be angry
with me.

1153
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,882
You know I can't marry anyone yet.

1154
01:10:10,388 --> 01:10:12,117
You're shivering.

1155
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:16,223
- I shouldn't have let you walk home.
- Oh, I loved it.

1156
01:10:16,394 --> 01:10:20,922
I love the snow and the moonlight
and the trees.

1157
01:10:21,299 --> 01:10:23,062
And being with you at last all alone.

1158
01:10:25,036 --> 01:10:26,936
I shall want to die when you've gone.

1159
01:10:27,105 --> 01:10:29,073
Oh, dearest.

1160
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:32,743
<i>Tina.</i>

1161
01:10:37,048 --> 01:10:38,174
That's the first.

1162
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:41,717
And I'll never kiss anyone but you. Ever.

1163
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:48,117
- Tina.
Mommy.

1164
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:51,262
I've not been able to sleep.
I heard you come in. It's late.

1165
01:10:51,429 --> 01:10:53,761
Yes, Mommy, dearest.
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

1166
01:10:53,932 --> 01:10:56,264
- You'd better be leaving now.
- Yes, Mrs. Ralston.

1167
01:10:56,434 --> 01:10:57,560
- Good night.
- Good night.

1168
01:10:57,736 --> 01:10:59,397
- Good night, Tina.
- Good night.

1169
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:03,098
It was ever so nice of you not to
scold me for being here, Mrs. Ralston.

1170
01:11:03,275 --> 01:11:04,367
Don't scold him.

1171
01:11:07,646 --> 01:11:10,080
This is Tina's fault. Not his.

1172
01:11:10,248 --> 01:11:12,773
Any man would've done the same
had she permitted it.

1173
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:16,114
- It isn't her fault.
- It doesn't matter who's to blame this time.

1174
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:18,586
I don't want it to happen again.

1175
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:20,384
I hope you both understand that.

1176
01:11:20,559 --> 01:11:21,651
But, Miss Charlotte.

1177
01:11:21,827 --> 01:11:24,193
Delia, ask him not to come here again.

1178
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:28,395
This is your house
or I would ask him myself.

1179
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:31,597
Make Aunt Charlotte
take that back, Mommy.

1180
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,170
Tell Lanning he's to come
whenever he wants to.

1181
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:35,431
Tell him, Mommy.

1182
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:38,871
- It's your house, not hers.
Shh. Tina. Tina.

1183
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,569
It won't be necessary, Mrs. Ralston.
I'm sailing soon.

1184
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:43,805
Next week.
Doesn't make much difference...

1185
01:11:43,982 --> 01:11:45,882
...if I'm forbidden in this house or not.

1186
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:49,817
I'd only come back
to say goodbye in any case.

1187
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:51,785
- Goodbye?
- Yes.

1188
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,858
That's the only thing I can say
in the circumstances, it seems.

1189
01:11:55,026 --> 01:11:57,756
- Oh, Lanning.
- Good night, Lanning.

1190
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:02,992
I'm sorry if I made you angry,
Miss Charlotte.

1191
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:07,002
But it didn't seem a crime to me
to stay on at the ball.

1192
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:10,141
It didn't seem a crime to come in
for a moment with Tina...

1193
01:12:10,308 --> 01:12:14,210
...but if you think it was a liberty,
I apologize.

1194
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:16,913
As I said before, it can't happen again.

1195
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,811
- Good night.
- Good night.

1196
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:23,378
Good night, Mrs. Ralston.
And goodbye, Tina.

1197
01:12:34,332 --> 01:12:36,232
Aunt Charlotte, wait a minute.

1198
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:39,893
You see what you've done?
You've driven Lanning away.

1199
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:42,232
No, my child,
I have not driven him away.

1200
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:45,672
If he doesn't come here again,
it's because he would find it awkward...

1201
01:12:45,844 --> 01:12:48,404
...marrying a girl who is so free
with her kisses.

1202
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,845
- That's not true. That's not true.
- It is true.

1203
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:55,953
There is nothing I could say to keep
him away if he really cared about you.

1204
01:12:56,721 --> 01:12:59,315
He would have cared
if you had not sent him away.

1205
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:03,825
I'd have made him care and now I can't.

1206
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:08,029
I'll never forgive you. Never.

1207
01:13:10,568 --> 01:13:12,729
Go to your room, Tina.

1208
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:18,039
I'll go...

1209
01:13:18,276 --> 01:13:19,436
...but before I go...

1210
01:13:19,611 --> 01:13:21,943
...you've got to know I'm sick
of your spying...

1211
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:23,774
...fault-finding and meddling.
- No.

1212
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:27,248
You can say what you want to
because you understand me and I love you.

1213
01:13:27,419 --> 01:13:29,478
But she's just a sour old maid
who hates me.

1214
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,178
- Tina.
- I'm young and attractive.

1215
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:34,120
And in love, while she's old
and hideous and dried up...

1216
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:36,817
...and has never known anything
about love.

1217
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,302
I'm sorry, Mommy.
Come up and say good night to me.

1218
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,195
Delia. Delia.

1219
01:13:57,882 --> 01:14:00,214
Delia, why don't you turn up the light?

1220
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:02,483
I wanna talk to you.

1221
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:12,888
There's no fire there.

1222
01:14:14,132 --> 01:14:16,157
I'm taking her away.

1223
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:23,466
- What?
- Yes, I'm taking Tina away.

1224
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:27,200
It's what I should have done from
the beginning, the very beginning...

1225
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,974
...when I asked for your help
and allowed you to interfere.

1226
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:32,582
I see my mistake now.

1227
01:14:33,718 --> 01:14:35,481
Do you realize what you're saying?

1228
01:14:35,653 --> 01:14:38,178
I'm going to take her somewhere
where we're not known.

1229
01:14:38,356 --> 01:14:41,018
Among plain people living plain lives.

1230
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:43,319
Somewhere they won't know
she's a foundling.

1231
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:46,487
Where she can find herself a husband
and make herself a home.

1232
01:14:46,664 --> 01:14:48,655
You'd take Tina away from me now?

1233
01:14:50,602 --> 01:14:51,796
Away from you?

1234
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:55,235
Away from... From the life
you've made such a sacrifice to give her?

1235
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:58,376
Oh, it would be too cruel.
Even more cruel to her than to me.

1236
01:14:58,543 --> 01:15:00,272
What is there ahead for her here?

1237
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:02,436
A girl without a name,
without a penny...

1238
01:15:02,614 --> 01:15:06,175
...living among cautious people
like the Halseys and their kind.

1239
01:15:06,484 --> 01:15:12,912
Delia, you've done a great deal for us
in your way and I'm very grateful.

1240
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:15,184
But you see what it's come to tonight.

1241
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,486
No.

1242
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:20,392
No, I haven't done all I could
but I'm going to now, if you'll let me.

1243
01:15:20,565 --> 01:15:22,965
If you mean using your influence
with the Halseys...

1244
01:15:23,134 --> 01:15:26,865
...thank you, no. I don't wish
a compulsory marriage for my child.

1245
01:15:27,038 --> 01:15:28,505
It isn't that.

1246
01:15:28,673 --> 01:15:31,471
It's something I've thought since
the two of you came here...

1247
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:35,773
...to be with me and Tina began calling me
Mommy because Dee did.

1248
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:38,847
I'll adopt Tina legally.

1249
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:41,549
Adopt?

1250
01:15:41,986 --> 01:15:43,112
You adopt Tina?

1251
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:46,587
If she has my name, the Ralston name
and part of the Ralston fortune...

1252
01:15:46,758 --> 01:15:50,250
- Why haven't you mentioned this plan?
- I wasn't sure of how you'd take it.

1253
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:53,591
If Tina's to be happy,
her position must be made unassailable...

1254
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:56,359
...financially and socially.
- I refuse.

1255
01:15:56,534 --> 01:15:59,298
But, Charlotte,
it won't be like giving her up.

1256
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:02,770
We... We can both go on
loving her together.

1257
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:06,604
No. No, this has gone on
long enough, this... This mistake.

1258
01:16:06,778 --> 01:16:09,906
- I'm going to take her away.
- Then you are going to sacrifice her...

1259
01:16:10,081 --> 01:16:12,777
...when she might have everything
she wants and you want.

1260
01:16:12,951 --> 01:16:15,010
The boy she loves, a home of her own.

1261
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:17,620
Tina said Lanning will love her
if she wants him to.

1262
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:20,724
She can make him love her
if there's no reason why he shouldn't.

1263
01:16:20,892 --> 01:16:23,622
And if she has money of her own
and the Ralston name...

1264
01:16:23,795 --> 01:16:26,992
...why, the Halseys wouldn't dare
find her a bad match for their son.

1265
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:30,793
- Mommy, are you coming up now?
Tina.

1266
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:32,093
I'm sorry.

1267
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:36,840
Delia.

1268
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:40,140
Delia, go on up to her.

1269
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:42,870
And tell her tonight.

1270
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:46,347
She'll be glad to hear it.

1271
01:17:15,847 --> 01:17:17,542
Oh, Tina.

1272
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,476
Hurry up.
Mommy, do turn around and start us.

1273
01:17:48,646 --> 01:17:50,637
Oh, we must stop here.
This is sacrilegious.

1274
01:17:50,815 --> 01:17:54,581
Oh, but we're only rehearsing.
Oh, that thing. It's like me.

1275
01:17:54,752 --> 01:17:56,652
- It's getting old.
- Let it run down, Tina.

1276
01:17:56,821 --> 01:17:59,756
- You've rehearsed a dozen times already.
- Oh, but it's fun.

1277
01:17:59,924 --> 01:18:03,189
- Feel. My heart. Yours too?
- Mm-hm.

1278
01:18:03,361 --> 01:18:06,353
Oh, Mommy, darling, you're so sweet.

1279
01:18:06,931 --> 01:18:09,593
We can rehearse this thing
a hundred times, if necessary.

1280
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:11,667
This is one wedding
that must be perfect.

1281
01:18:11,836 --> 01:18:13,463
- It is perfect.
- Thank you, darling.

1282
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:17,096
- And then the minister will say...
- And then I'll say, "I do. I do. I do. "

1283
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:21,234
- Well, I get to say it first.
- And then... And then...

1284
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:25,549
You know, Delia, she's really too happy.

1285
01:18:26,017 --> 01:18:29,248
When she talks, she laughs.
When she walks, she dances.

1286
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:32,412
She sings and runs about flinging
her happiness into our faces...

1287
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:33,887
...until I'm afraid for her.

1288
01:18:35,026 --> 01:18:38,086
Dora, I told cook to count
on 200 plates of ice cream tomorrow.

1289
01:18:38,263 --> 01:18:40,128
- Yes, miss.
Two hundred?

1290
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:43,267
Charlotte, you've been wonderful.
She's taken over every detail.

1291
01:18:43,434 --> 01:18:46,631
You're so sweet. You've taken
trouble as if it was your own wedding.

1292
01:18:46,804 --> 01:18:50,262
Thank you, Tina. I don't think
there's anything further to be done tonight.

1293
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:52,909
- Except to go to bed.
- The bride is to be sent to bed.

1294
01:18:53,077 --> 01:18:55,045
- Say good night to Lanning.
- Go to bed now.

1295
01:18:55,213 --> 01:18:56,771
Oh, but, Mommy, I'm not sleepy.

1296
01:18:56,948 --> 01:18:58,848
You can rest whether you sleep or not.

1297
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:00,780
You should go up now.
I'll go.

1298
01:19:00,952 --> 01:19:02,886
- Come to the gate with me.
Not tonight.

1299
01:19:03,054 --> 01:19:04,521
It's late. Say good night to her.

1300
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:06,156
All right. Good night. Good night.

1301
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,451
Only at the front door.
You must be tired.

1302
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:09,650
Sit down and rest.

1303
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:13,388
The doilies. I wonder if the new ones
arrived. Maybe they were sent upstairs.

1304
01:19:13,564 --> 01:19:17,000
- The doilies? But haven't we enough?
- Oh, we'll manage perfectly, Delia.

1305
01:19:20,538 --> 01:19:24,474
- Tina. Tina, it's late.
- Yes, Aunt Charlotte.

1306
01:19:24,642 --> 01:19:26,371
Good night, darling.

1307
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:33,948
Well, he's gone.

1308
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:37,686
- I'm going up now.
- Yes, do, darling.

1309
01:19:37,855 --> 01:19:39,516
Will you come up and say good night?

1310
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:40,851
Of course.

1311
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,294
Because tonight...

1312
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:47,830
...it is just like Dr. Lanskell said...

1313
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,663
...I am much too happy.

1314
01:19:51,636 --> 01:19:54,537
And I'm just a little afraid,
though I pretended I wasn't.

1315
01:19:55,873 --> 01:19:57,841
It's been so hectic
since you adopted me...

1316
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:00,637
...and Lanning's parents decided
we might get married.

1317
01:20:00,812 --> 01:20:02,245
They've been very sweet to me.

1318
01:20:03,348 --> 01:20:06,181
If you hadn't cared
to give me your name and the money...

1319
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:08,216
...they wouldn't want Lanning to care.

1320
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,513
Oh, nonsense, darling.

1321
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:12,815
But I know, Mommy.

1322
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,548
I know what I owe you.

1323
01:20:15,426 --> 01:20:17,394
I owe you everything.

1324
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:19,757
Everything and I'm glad.

1325
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:25,064
I used to wonder who I really was
but I don't care now.

1326
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:28,662
I'd rather have my mommy for my mother
than anyone in this world.

1327
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,603
Tina. You mustn't say such things.

1328
01:20:30,775 --> 01:20:33,573
Your Aunt Charlotte's been
as much interested as I've been.

1329
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,078
- And just as generous to you.
Yes, I know.

1330
01:20:37,248 --> 01:20:39,148
She gave me my wedding veil.

1331
01:20:39,317 --> 01:20:42,411
She asked me to wear the wedding dress
she was going to wear too.

1332
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:45,283
But I didn't, I told her I wanted
to wear Mommy's.

1333
01:20:45,456 --> 01:20:47,083
The one Dee wore at her wedding.

1334
01:20:49,093 --> 01:20:51,425
It seems odd anyone ever wanted
to marry Charlotte.

1335
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:53,086
There you are tired, chatterbox.

1336
01:20:53,264 --> 01:20:55,789
I won't sleep until you come in
and tell me good night.

1337
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:58,435
- And I've told you I'll come. Run along.
- All right.

1338
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:00,264
- Good night, Tina.
- Good night.

1339
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:02,929
Mommy, look.

1340
01:21:03,107 --> 01:21:05,905
Mommy gave this to me besides
all her other presents.

1341
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:10,639
She's always worn it. That's the very
first thing I remember in all my life.

1342
01:21:10,815 --> 01:21:14,342
A beautiful lady. Like a princess.

1343
01:21:14,519 --> 01:21:15,884
It's very pretty.

1344
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:17,816
I love it.

1345
01:21:19,857 --> 01:21:22,985
Good night. You were always very kind
to me when I was little.

1346
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:25,961
I remember that too. Good night.

1347
01:21:26,364 --> 01:21:29,265
Don't forget, Mommy,
I'll be waiting. Good night.

1348
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:32,936
Good night, Aunt Charlotte.
Hurry, Mommy.

1349
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:43,944
Well, good night, my dear.

1350
01:21:45,049 --> 01:21:46,778
Dr. Lanskell?

1351
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,616
Come here a moment.

1352
01:21:55,059 --> 01:21:57,755
Do you remember when I stopped Charlotte
from marrying Joe?

1353
01:21:57,929 --> 01:22:02,093
At the time it was a sacrilegious thing
to lay a hand on another person's destiny.

1354
01:22:02,266 --> 01:22:04,166
I thought it was a mistake.

1355
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:06,929
But one never knows what was
a mistake and what was not.

1356
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:10,096
We can't turn back the clock
and play life over again.

1357
01:22:10,274 --> 01:22:14,973
But you see? I've carried through
and I know I've done right.

1358
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:18,343
I think you've paid for your mistake,
if it was a mistake.

1359
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:22,077
Ever since the day Tina went to you
instinctively as to a mother...

1360
01:22:22,253 --> 01:22:25,347
...you've watched Charlotte turn
into a bitter, frustrated woman.

1361
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,150
And you've had to live with her...

1362
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:30,658
...and no woman like that
was ever easy to live with.

1363
01:22:31,128 --> 01:22:32,755
Thank you for realizing that.

1364
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:36,061
And now that Tina's leaving us...

1365
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:40,637
...from tomorrow evening on,
till death comes for one of us...

1366
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:43,432
...we'll be sitting here alone together...

1367
01:22:43,608 --> 01:22:47,908
...beside the same lamp
and an empty house...

1368
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,242
...with heaven knows
what thoughts to keep us company.

1369
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:56,451
Oh, this isn't like me.

1370
01:22:56,621 --> 01:22:58,179
No, it isn't.

1371
01:22:58,356 --> 01:23:02,452
Perhaps it's because memories have a way
of inviting themselves to the family feasts.

1372
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:04,925
Whether they're invited or not.

1373
01:23:05,129 --> 01:23:06,994
Good night, my dear.

1374
01:23:09,934 --> 01:23:12,266
Good night, Dr. Lanskell.

1375
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,743
- Delia.
- Yes?

1376
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:36,519
You're going up now to speak to Tina?

1377
01:23:36,694 --> 01:23:39,663
Well, unless you want to talk to me
about something else.

1378
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:42,159
Before she goes to sleep I ought to.

1379
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,392
Yes, you think you ought to.

1380
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:46,002
What's the matter, Charlotte?

1381
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:49,401
You agree a word ought to be said
to the child before her marriage?

1382
01:23:49,574 --> 01:23:52,509
And tomorrow, with the excitement,
there'll be no opportunity.

1383
01:23:52,677 --> 01:23:53,871
So I told her I'd go up.

1384
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:00,849
I understand. So please understand me
when I ask you not to.

1385
01:24:01,852 --> 01:24:03,945
No, I don't understand you, Charlotte.

1386
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,487
You feel that on the night
before her wedding...

1387
01:24:06,657 --> 01:24:08,318
...a girl have her mother's counsel?

1388
01:24:08,492 --> 01:24:11,984
Yes. That's why I must be
the one to talk to Tina tonight.

1389
01:24:12,163 --> 01:24:13,892
Because just tonight I am her mother.

1390
01:24:14,398 --> 01:24:17,162
You're not going to tell her so? Not now?

1391
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:20,668
Would it be such a tragedy for her
to find out that I am her mother?

1392
01:24:21,105 --> 01:24:22,970
Oh, I won't let you.

1393
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:26,600
- Would you hate me so much if I did?
- Hate?

1394
01:24:26,777 --> 01:24:29,075
What a word between us.

1395
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:35,248
It's the word that has been between us
since the beginning, the very beginning.

1396
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:37,580
The day when you found out
that Clem Spender...

1397
01:24:37,755 --> 01:24:40,485
...hadn't broken his heart.
He wasn't good enough for you.

1398
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:44,719
Since then, you found your revenge and
your triumph in keeping me at your mercy...

1399
01:24:44,895 --> 01:24:46,726
...in taking his child from me.

1400
01:24:46,897 --> 01:24:49,798
You've always believed I've hated you
because you've hated me.

1401
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:51,696
For everything I tried to do for you.

1402
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:55,396
Do for me? Everything you've done,
you've done for him.

1403
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:58,599
You're horrible. I haven't
thought of Clem Spender for years.

1404
01:24:58,776 --> 01:25:03,008
Oh, yes, you have. You have. In thinking
of Tina, you have thought of him.

1405
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:05,410
Of him and nobody else.

1406
01:25:06,217 --> 01:25:09,084
A woman never stops thinking
of the man she loves.

1407
01:25:09,253 --> 01:25:12,450
She thinks of him for years in all sorts
of unconscious ways.

1408
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:19,119
In thinking of all sorts of things, a sunset,
an old song, a cameo on a chain.

1409
01:25:19,563 --> 01:25:22,157
I know because I've thought of him too.

1410
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,561
Suppose that's true?

1411
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:26,937
That's why you took us in,
to give his child a home.

1412
01:25:27,104 --> 01:25:30,972
She is mine. Clem didn't love you.
He loved me. I loved him.

1413
01:25:31,142 --> 01:25:34,475
She should have been ours.
I am her mother.

1414
01:25:36,313 --> 01:25:39,180
We'll see which one of us is her mother.

1415
01:25:42,753 --> 01:25:45,881
You are wicked, Charlotte.
You are wicked.

1416
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:49,091
No.

1417
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,194
I'm not wicked.

1418
01:25:51,362 --> 01:25:54,456
I never could have done to you
what you've done to me.

1419
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,665
You made me an old maid.

1420
01:25:58,102 --> 01:26:00,570
You divided my child from me.

1421
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:05,107
You adopted her.
You even took away my legal right to her.

1422
01:26:05,276 --> 01:26:08,507
You taught her to call you mother.

1423
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,806
Well, tonight...

1424
01:26:11,982 --> 01:26:14,917
...just tonight, she belongs to me.

1425
01:26:15,386 --> 01:26:18,048
That's not too much to ask.

1426
01:26:18,622 --> 01:26:21,887
Tonight I want her to call me mother.

1427
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:39,633
Come in, Mommy.

1428
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:43,438
Oh, it's you, Aunt Charlotte.

1429
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:45,041
I thought it was Mommy.

1430
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:04,231
I came in to say...

1431
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:09,804
You did remember
to brush your hair tonight.

1432
01:27:11,308 --> 01:27:13,868
Such pretty hair.

1433
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:17,406
Why, Aunt Charlotte, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1434
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:22,982
I don't say nice things very nicely, Tina.

1435
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:27,623
You must have had...

1436
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:31,891
I mean, your hair is very pretty too.

1437
01:27:44,308 --> 01:27:46,742
- There is something else.
- Something else nice?

1438
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:49,709
Oh, please don't bother.
I can do this, Aunt Charlotte.

1439
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:53,480
Oh, your hands are cold.
They're trembling.

1440
01:27:54,618 --> 01:27:56,415
You've been working too hard.

1441
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:59,283
Won't you be glad when I'm married,
off your hands at last?

1442
01:28:11,302 --> 01:28:13,600
What's the matter, Aunt Charlotte?

1443
01:28:15,673 --> 01:28:20,007
I just came in to say good night
and to wish you happiness.

1444
01:28:20,177 --> 01:28:22,338
God bless you, my child.

1445
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:25,411
Thank you.

1446
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:32,879
Tina...

1447
01:28:34,825 --> 01:28:37,555
...if I've been severe with you at times...

1448
01:28:37,828 --> 01:28:39,853
...I haven't meant it.

1449
01:28:40,631 --> 01:28:42,223
I love you very much.

1450
01:28:43,634 --> 01:28:45,625
After all the mean things
I've said to you?

1451
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:49,270
You didn't mean them, my child.

1452
01:28:58,983 --> 01:29:02,544
- I really didn't mean them.
- I know.

1453
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,153
Good night, Aunt Charlotte.

1454
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:06,755
Will you please ask Mommy to hurry up?

1455
01:29:07,191 --> 01:29:09,318
Good night, Tina.

1456
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:29,943
- You told her.
- Shh.

1457
01:29:31,882 --> 01:29:33,372
No.

1458
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:36,243
No, I didn't tell her.

1459
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:39,014
She's waiting for you, Delia.

1460
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:44,227
If she never really belonged to me...

1461
01:29:44,728 --> 01:29:48,323
...perhaps it's because her father
never really belonged to me either.

1462
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:50,890
They're both yours.

1463
01:29:51,168 --> 01:29:54,194
He loved you and she loves you too.

1464
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,373
You're the mother she wants.
Go in to her, Delia.

1465
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:04,711
It's not your fault or mine.

1466
01:30:05,049 --> 01:30:07,449
Don't feel sorry for me.

1467
01:30:10,354 --> 01:30:12,584
After all, she was mine...

1468
01:30:15,225 --> 01:30:17,056
...when she was little.

1469
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:24,257
Oh, Charlotte.

1470
01:30:41,552 --> 01:30:43,247
Mommy?

1471
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:52,623
Would you like to do something
that would make me very happy?

1472
01:30:52,796 --> 01:30:54,696
Anything, you darling.

1473
01:30:54,865 --> 01:30:57,060
It's about your Aunt Charlotte.

1474
01:30:57,234 --> 01:30:58,792
What?

1475
01:30:59,803 --> 01:31:02,363
Well, first I want to tell you this:

1476
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:05,975
She didn't marry a man
who loved her very much...

1477
01:31:06,143 --> 01:31:09,306
...and who would have given her
everything she wanted.

1478
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,177
- Why?
- Because she wouldn't give you up.

1479
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:16,242
That's why she's an old maid.

1480
01:31:17,988 --> 01:31:19,853
Why didn't anyone tell me this before?

1481
01:31:20,024 --> 01:31:23,152
Well, darling, sometimes people
don't think.

1482
01:31:23,327 --> 01:31:25,625
Sometimes they're selfish.

1483
01:31:25,796 --> 01:31:31,598
But you remember and try to make her glad
tomorrow of the choice she made...

1484
01:31:31,769 --> 01:31:33,760
...without letting her know I told you so.

1485
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:37,265
I've always been so horrid.

1486
01:31:38,575 --> 01:31:41,043
- And there's one more thing.
- Yes, Mommy?

1487
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:43,202
When you go away tomorrow...

1488
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,678
...at the very last moment...

1489
01:31:45,849 --> 01:31:49,945
...you understand, after you've said
goodbye to me and to everybody else...

1490
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,280
Mm-hm.

1491
01:31:51,455 --> 01:31:54,652
...just as Lanning puts you into
the carriage...

1492
01:31:54,892 --> 01:32:00,990
...lean down and give your last kiss
to Aunt Charlotte, will you?

1493
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:05,927
- Yes.
- Don't forget, the very last.

1494
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:07,661
I won't forget.

1495
01:32:11,408 --> 01:32:14,104
It's late, Miss Charlotte.

1496
01:32:14,812 --> 01:32:17,042
Yes, I know, Dora.

1497
01:32:21,218 --> 01:32:23,652
There's a big day coming tomorrow.

1498
01:32:23,821 --> 01:32:27,154
A beautiful day. A perfect day.

1499
01:32:27,324 --> 01:32:30,851
It ought to make you very happy
and proud.

1500
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:46,669
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

1501
01:32:46,844 --> 01:32:48,471
Goodbye.

1502
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:03,383
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.

1503
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,925
Goodbye.

1504
01:33:08,732 --> 01:33:10,962
Bye-bye.
Bye.

1505
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,065
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1506
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:18,470
- Oh, where's Aunt Charlotte?
Oh, Charlotte.

1507
01:33:18,642 --> 01:33:20,576
Miss Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

1508
01:33:22,646 --> 01:33:24,546
Yes, Tina?

1509
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:32,246
Goodbye, Aunt Charlotte. Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1510
01:33:33,223 --> 01:33:34,622
Bye.
Bye-bye.

1511
01:33:34,791 --> 01:33:36,418
Bye.
Bye-bye.
