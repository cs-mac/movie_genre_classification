1
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,510
<i>He told me I would forget the desert,
and what they had fought for.</i>

2
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,115
<i>But how could I not remember?</i>

3
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,670
<i>It was where my life began.</i>

4
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,277
<i>This land where death is not the end,
but only the beginning.</i>

5
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,075
<i>The story began before I knew
it was a story.</i>

6
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,472
<i>Hearing his voice before I knew
who he was.</i>

7
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,629
The struggle for truth is part
of the struggle for human dignity.

8
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,839
And only to the altar of truth
has he borne his offerings...

9
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,278
...the most genuine product
of American genius and spirit.

10
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,268
Nice to see you, Miss Winslow.
Have classes begun yet?

11
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,909
I'm not sure I'm teaching
this year.

12
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,116
And how is your mother?

13
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,678
Very well, thank you.

14
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,872
I'd like to learn Spanish.
Have you any books?

15
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,871
Spanish? Well, we must have something.
Let me see. Spanish, how interesting.

16
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,476
A paragon of a writer.
I am honoured to present...

17
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,477
...the author of these marvellous
collected works, Ambrose Bierce!

18
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,512
Ladies...

19
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,879
...admiring ladies...

20
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,071
...prudes...

21
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,269
...suffragettes, foolish women
of America...

22
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,516
...and gentlemen.

23
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,912
I address, above all, you
professionals of the written word...

24
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,118
...who are already corrupt.

25
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,911
Or well on your way to selling
the products of your pens...

26
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,272
...to the highest bidder.

27
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,912
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bierce isn't well...

28
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,914
Only my lungs are sick!

29
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,871
Every word I utter comes directly
from my perfectly lucid mind!

30
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,954
There is something in
my editor's words, however, yes.

31
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,915
Yes.

32
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,269
When he spoke of my being faithful
only to the truth. Yes.

33
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,874
Day after day, believing that
every printed word was eternal.

34
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,317
And would, somehow...

35
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,677
...open men's minds.

36
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,672
I...

37
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,356
...sacrificed every day
of my family's life.

38
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,469
Every day of my children's lives.

39
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,275
And for what? I wrote. You read.
He grew richer.

40
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,671
Hearst, the owner of my newspaper.

41
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,878
He acquired more power.

42
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,237
My words did not serve the truth.
They served him.

43
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,114
Now, after this triumphant
presentation...

44
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,674
...of these 14 volumes
of meaningless paper...

45
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
...I bid you farewell.

46
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,869
I look you all straight in the face!

47
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,717
And with an enormous amount
of pleasure...

48
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,280
...I bid you farewell!

49
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,750
I hope never to see you again!

50
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,276
<i>I never saw his face that day.</i>

51
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,269
<i>He had done what
I hadn't dared to do until then...</i>

52
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,914
<i>... say farewell to his world...</i>

53
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,998
<i>... just as my father had done
15 years before.</i>

54
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,868
Harriet, I'm ready!

55
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,312
Harriet!

56
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,518
You're not dressed yet.
We'll be late.

57
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,070
- I'm not going.
- What did you say?

58
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,553
I'm not going with you to Arlington,
to that ceremony.

59
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,149
Not ever again.

60
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,276
It's the 15th anniversary
of the war in Cuba.

61
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,635
Your father's fellow officers
will be there.

62
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,593
What'll they think
if we aren't there?

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,313
What are you doing?

64
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,073
How can you be so disrespectful
of your father's memory?

65
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,270
I'm not being disrespectful.
I'm being honest.

66
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,877
From now on I'm going to be honest
with my father's memory.

67
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,469
I don't know what's gotten into you.

68
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,917
Take a few of those pills
for your nerves.

69
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,472
You haven't been yourself for months.
Breaking your engagement...

70
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,832
That engagement was a lie!
Like it's a lie to collect checks...

71
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,150
...for 15 years...

72
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,869
...as the beloved family...

73
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,874
...of a man who died honourably
on the battlefield.

74
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,512
Harriet, control yourself.

75
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,072
I don't want to control myself.

76
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,110
I don't want pills.

77
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,399
I don't want funeral honours
for a father who's still alive.

78
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,316
Mother, let me say it finally.
Alive! More alive than we are.

79
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,472
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

80
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,030
You're not a widow, Mother.

81
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,113
He didn't come back because
he didn't want to live with you.

82
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,669
Your husband left you.

83
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,953
And now you are planning
to do the same.

84
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,916
You too want to abandon me...

85
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,720
...without saying a word!

86
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,270
This is dated October.
How long have you had this?

87
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,873
How dare you?

88
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,670
How dare you respond to the offer?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

89
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,469
This is the first sensible thing
I've done in my life.

90
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,350
I've been hired!

91
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,720
You can't be serious! You can't be
a servant in some Mexican family!

92
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,270
You're an educated, independent girl.

93
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,073
I'm not a girl, Mother.
I'm a spinster.

94
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,111
I'm not independent. I'm like you.
We live on pensions we don't deserve.

95
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,273
Why don't you try calling things
by their name for once?

96
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,676
You know, Harriet...

97
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,477
...you are too much like your father.

98
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,474
There's one more on top.

99
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,715
- Smashing barrels in the street.

100
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,270
<i>- Buenos días.
- They say Villa will outlaw alcohol.</i>

101
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,592
- I'm Harriet Winslow.
- Yes, your room is ready.

102
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,673
Drinking will be punishable by death.

103
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,114
- I hope you're pleased with your room.
- I'd like to send a telegram.

104
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,509
Yes.

105
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,719
They're moving against
eight important families in Mexico.

106
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,875
Declaring them enemies of the
Revolution and confiscating property.

107
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,359
Is there anything else
we can do for you?

108
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,279
Howard, I can't hear you!

109
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,516
But it's addressed to Miranda.

110
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,672
Could you send that for me right away?

111
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,511
- They're waiting to hear.
- We'll do what we can...

112
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,550
...but sometimes they cut the lines,
sometimes they intercept them.

113
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,275
Miranda has been declared
an enemy of the Revolution.

114
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,671
I just phoned it to my paper.

115
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,476
Excuse me, I couldn't help
but overhear. Professional liability.

116
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,120
What does that mean,
what you just said?

117
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,875
Chihuahua is now
revolutionary territory.

118
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,716
<i>The Miranda hacienda is controlled by
Federales. You're not going there?</i>

119
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,194
Perhaps it would be wiser
for you to return home.

120
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,793
<i>No, gracias.</i>

121
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,079
I'll never buy another newspaper
in my life.

122
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,718
You understand English?

123
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,872
No, of course you don't.

124
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,751
I'm writing my last letter.

125
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,478
There's always a last time
for everything in life.

126
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,710
"If you hear of my being stood
up against a Mexican stone wall...

127
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,512
...and shot to rags, please know
I consider it a good way to depart.

128
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,719
Beats old age, disease,
or falling down the stairs.

129
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,272
To be a gringo in Mexico...

130
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,677
...that is euthanasia!"

131
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,269
<i>Buenas noches. Are you Miss Winslow?</i>

132
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,877
<i>- Buenas noches. Yes, I am.
- My name is Frutos Garcia.</i>

133
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,913
You got a telegram from the Mirandas?

134
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,879
Have they sent you for me?

135
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,391
It's a long trip.
We'll leave before sunrise.

136
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,112
Happy New Year!

137
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,794
She'll give us the luggage.

138
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,158
A gringa wouldn't think
an Indian smart enough to trick her.

139
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,755
What if the Mirandas have left?

140
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,115
But they wired her.

141
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,038
What if they left?

142
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:01,159
I promised General Villa a Miranda
for Christmas, remember?

143
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,599
And then we join with Villa
to capture the city of Ojinaga.

144
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,674
Staring at me for any
particular reason?

145
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,473
I have never seen an old man
drink so much.

146
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,072
Revolutionaries should study
some history. In every war...

147
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,273
...drunken nations have
conquered the sober one.

148
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,270
Drunks always talk better
than they shoot.

149
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,870
- You think I'm drunk.
- Aren't you?

150
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,872
<i>Niño, newspaperman.
Come, help me for a moment.</i>

151
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,155
Maybe mister would like
to join us for dinner.

152
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,076
<i>No, gracias.</i>

153
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,675
- I want to go with you.
- Where?

154
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,270
I am looking for Villa.

155
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,437
What do you want with him?

156
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,470
<i>To fight. In la Revolución.</i>

157
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,552
Frutos!

158
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,390
Here we are, general!

159
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,639
What's happening?

160
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,317
Look at fatso running! Look at him!

161
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,394
Hi! Are you ready for the fight?

162
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,276
Monsalvo, have the train leave!
Wait outside the hacienda.

163
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,751
See you there, Pedrito. Good luck!

164
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,512
Who is that man?

165
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,275
A crazy old gringo on a white horse.

166
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,670
The horse must also be gringo.

167
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,871
Stop! They've seen us!

168
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,314
<i>Los Federales are coming, señorita.</i>

169
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,270
Get out of the car.
It is better that they see you.

170
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,272
Oh, this is beautiful!

171
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,869
<i>Without my realizing it...</i>

172
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>... we had crossed the line between
the revolutionary territory...</i>

173
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,270
<i>... and that held by the Federales.</i>

174
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,875
Casimiro, who's that?

175
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,998
She comes to teach
the Miranda children.

176
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,469
Tell her she's too late!

177
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,030
Hey, teacher,
the Mirandas have already left!

178
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,553
It's a trap!

179
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,075
What is going on?

180
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,599
Where's your army?
Why don't you attack?

181
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,709
They're in a train close by,
awaiting my orders, but we're too few.

182
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,589
We came to take a Miranda.
Now we have no hostage.

183
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,069
You must help us!

184
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,829
Are you Ataulfo?
You will take a message to my people.

185
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,911
Why didn't we leave?

186
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,390
How did they get here?

187
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,949
You said the valley was safe!

188
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,828
She's the governess who wired.

189
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,838
<i>- Señor Miranda?
- I'm his administrator.</i>

190
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,799
- Call him, please.
- He's gone.

191
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,471
No, he sent me a telegram.

192
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,515
We sent the telegram to trick
the bastards who intercept the wires.

193
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,672
<i>Not for you, gringa estúpida!</i>

194
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,277
You never saw something
like this, huh?

195
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,348
Stop! Stop!

196
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,319
Stop! Old fool!

197
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,397
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Can anyone tell me...

198
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,598
...where I might find Pancho Villa?

199
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,949
I am Villa!

200
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,554
Me, I am Villa!

201
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,557
We are all Villa!

202
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,032
We all owe the poor administrator.
All of us!

203
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,351
How much do you owe, Maria?
And you, Ataulfo, Manuel?

204
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,671
Tomas! He must live!

205
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,710
- General Arroyo, we need him alive!
- We're going to repay him!

206
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,674
You!

207
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,630
Listen to me, whoever you are!

208
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,033
General Tomas Arroyo, Third Regiment,
Northern Division.

209
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,760
Tell Frutos I am promoting you.

210
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,512
Thank you, general!

211
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,355
You have to get me out of here.

212
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,910
You have to take me back.
At least to Chihuahua.

213
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
I have more important things to do.

214
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,596
But you brought me here.

215
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,236
You deceived me to get in here.

216
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,713
<i>Sí, señorita. And los Miranda
deceived the both of us.</i>

217
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,319
What do you intend to do with me then?

218
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,831
With you? Nothing.

219
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,870
Give me a horse, and I'll go alone.
I don't need any of you.

220
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,908
The Revolution needs horses,
not governesses.

221
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,639
- Irrefutable logic!
- Just stay out of this.

222
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,710
Now I know why the gringos
come to Mexico.

223
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,919
Because they can't stand each other.

224
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,116
Don't you sleep?

225
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,116
I slept enough when I was young.
You and the general make your peace?

226
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,959
General!

227
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,317
Please. He's no general.

228
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,680
I know something about the military.

229
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,788
My father was a captain
in the war in Cuba.

230
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,709
Shameful war.

231
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,549
That war was invented
by a newspaper...

232
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,758
...and a group of bastards
reaped the rewards.

233
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,231
I'm very proud of my father.
Who are you anyway?

234
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,630
They call me Bitter.

235
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,311
- Why are you here?
- Well, why not?

236
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,514
You intend to stay?

237
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,554
Forever.

238
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,392
I must get out of here.

239
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,556
I must find a way back to Chihuahua.

240
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,318
Someone waiting for you there?

241
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,713
Nobody's waiting for me anywhere.

242
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,114
A very privileged situation, you know.

243
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,833
It hurts!

244
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,032
Am I going to die?

245
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,115
Yes.

246
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,759
Why did you tell him he was dying?

247
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,118
A man deserves the truth.

248
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,951
At least once before he dies.

249
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,558
He didn't need the truth.

250
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,678
He needed comfort.

251
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,515
It must be horrible to die,
frightened and alone.

252
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,354
Very few have the foresight
and opportunity...

253
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,717
...to plan any other kind of death.

254
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,312
You're so eloquent, but you say...

255
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,114
...such appalling things.

256
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,714
That's been the story of my life,
my dear.

257
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,314
Everybody appreciates the form
and is frightened of the content.

258
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,748
<i>When I woke that first morning...</i>

259
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,310
<i>... the men had left to round up
the last Federales.</i>

260
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,714
<i>I found myself alone,
with the women and the children.</i>

261
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,515
<i>I was only trying to change my life.</i>

262
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,315
<i>They were trying to change
their whole world.</i>

263
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,156
What beautiful hair you have.

264
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,710
<i>You know, a güera like you
could ruin my business.</i>

265
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,912
What do you mean?
What is your business?

266
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,351
I'm a whore.

267
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,232
Please forgive me.

268
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,233
<i>Ah, no reason, señorita.
I feel no shame.</i>

269
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,917
Can you imagine this army
without a good whore?

270
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,833
And you? Who are you?

271
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,714
<i>You really come to teach the children
of los Miranda?</i>

272
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,273
That's why the gringas are so white.
They squeeze like that.

273
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,712
- Your blood can't circulate.
- Why do you put it on?

274
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,315
It's my corset.

275
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,869
You know, if I wore it,
everybody would get to see it.

276
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,709
If you would like it...

277
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,474
...l'd be very happy to
give it to you.

278
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,715
Thank you.
Oh, I'm going to make them crazy.

279
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,114
Is it true that your armies go to war
with no women?

280
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,834
Yes, it's true.

281
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,909
And the women, do they stay at home
when the men fight?

282
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,112
- Of course.
- How can they like it that way?

283
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,550
They do like to make wars.

284
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,590
I mean, they go so many different
places to fight, but with no love...

285
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,512
...no children, no cooks,
no nothing...

286
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,314
We are very different.

287
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,030
When I was a girl, my mother
never let me name my legs.

288
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,272
I had to say "what I walk with."
Or my ass.

289
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,155
I had to say, "what I sit with."

290
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,518
I was never naked in front of anybody
before Tomas.

291
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,159
Never.

292
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,712
Then one day the bells in the town rang.
They rang and rang.

293
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,714
<i>This is how we knew
la Revolución had arrived.</i>

294
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,118
And Tomas arrived into town.

295
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,356
And he gave me a name.

296
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,910
<i>He named me La Luna, the moon.</i>

297
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,913
And I followed him. It was simple.

298
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,314
I should have left sooner.

299
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,795
Much sooner.
But no bells rang for me.

300
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,230
Are you not a little old to be
a soldier of fortune?

301
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,314
The gringo is not a soldier
of fortune. He's an observer.

302
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,159
- Observer?
- You know how the gringos are.

303
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,315
While we kill each other,
they like to watch.

304
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,556
That is so true.

305
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,432
You must be a very brave man to be
so happy, under the circumstances.

306
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,036
You mean, because I'm going
to die tomorrow?

307
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,830
Why worry about the future, when
one is no longer there to feel it?

308
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,119
You gringos are too complicated.
Death is just death.

309
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,917
I would advise more humility
regarding such a subject.

310
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,353
You gringos are not the ones
to teach us humility.

311
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,988
You can't bet on how you'll behave...

312
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,357
...when death is staring you
in the face.

313
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,914
I do not think you have something to
teach me, just because you are old.

314
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,514
I wonder if the captain would remain
true to his theory...

315
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,232
...if General Arroyo would put him up
against this wall right now?

316
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,914
Instead of tomorrow.

317
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,720
General! It's a crime to murder
an officer without proper trial.

318
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,556
No one is going to murder you,
captain! We're just going to kill you!

319
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,157
Line the officers against the wall.

320
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,871
You can't kill me like this!

321
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,632
I won't kill you.

322
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,159
You, gringo!

323
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,916
You shoot him.

324
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,879
I'm giving you an order, gringo!

325
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,513
Kill him!

326
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,916
You don't want to do it?

327
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,517
You just want for us to kill him now.

328
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,716
Frutos, you were right.

329
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,713
The gringos are great
for giving ideas...

330
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,997
...but they want others
to kill for them.

331
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,196
Zacarias, come.

332
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,510
We're going to shoot this gringo
as well.

333
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,309
What are you doing, Arroyo?

334
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,318
No! Don't! No, you can't do this!

335
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,028
No, you can't kill him!

336
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,919
Oh, God, no, please!

337
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,557
Are you doing this because he
wouldn't act like a savage?

338
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,914
Oh, no! Oh, my God, no!

339
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,111
<i>We had until tomorrow, viejo!</i>

340
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,873
Please, don't!

341
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,909
Why waste time
playing with these gringos?

342
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,556
Get rid of them! Villa needs us!

343
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,553
Let's go! Stop this foolishness.

344
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,918
Please, let go of me.

345
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,476
We won't kill you, gringo.

346
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,313
Here, we do not kill our friends.

347
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,554
Come.

348
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,509
- Come. Please don't stay here.
- It was a joke.

349
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,231
A joke?

350
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,915
Look at this! Look at this killing!
You call this a joke?

351
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,948
They have a different sense of humour,
and of death.

352
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,430
I don't understand you.

353
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,513
You can't understand me
or anything else.

354
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,317
It's their war, their country,
whether you or I approve of it or not.

355
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,917
I behaved despicably.

356
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,709
Poor captain.

357
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,514
He was only trying to impress us
with his bravery in the face of death...

358
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,554
...proving he could die admirably.

359
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,236
It was almost amusing,
feeling that it couldn't happen to me...

360
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,916
...because I wasn't ready.

361
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,033
But you know...

362
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,156
...it was worth it...

363
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,314
...just to see you.

364
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,715
You were magnificent!

365
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,913
Your passionate interest
in saving my life was...

366
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,914
...deeply flattering!

367
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,719
I'm deeply moved.

368
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,111
You are intolerable!

369
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,316
Tolerate me.

370
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,712
Tolerate me, please, I beg of you.

371
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,516
It's been such a long time
since anyone even tried.

372
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,711
Oh, once, once, the women sighed.

373
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,958
Swelled out their chests...

374
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,919
How beautiful they were!

375
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,710
I thought they'd always be there...

376
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,709
...sighing into my moustache.

377
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,914
Admiring my every glance.

378
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,516
Just waiting for a sign from me.

379
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,716
But they've all gone.
They didn't wait.

380
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,430
I suppose I didn't inspire
enough love...

381
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,716
...in any of them.

382
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,710
What was it?

383
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,315
What? What was what?

384
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,912
What did you do to make them sigh?

385
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,719
I never sighed for a man.

386
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,909
Well, when I was...

387
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,715
...little more than a child,
I dreamt I would...

388
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,952
...do things that would
change the world.

389
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,590
And one night,
when I was about 16...

390
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:07,517
...I promised a girl that I would
do something grand.

391
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,911
Something really grand...

392
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,795
...that would make it impossible
for her not to love me.

393
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,909
And that afterwards,
I would come back for her.

394
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,909
"Well, what is it exactly
that you will do?"

395
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,591
I would write the most beautiful poem
that anybody had ever written.

396
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,954
A poem that would make people
cry with happiness...

397
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,317
...love with desperation.

398
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,909
Make them feel they understand the
meaning of their existence on earth.

399
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,509
"Oh, no...

400
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,316
...you cannot write that poem.
Nobody can."

401
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,511
And I said, "Wait."

402
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,914
"For how long?" she answered.

403
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,315
Since I was a child...

404
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,510
...and every hour seemed filled
with limitless possibilities...

405
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,991
...I told her just for a short while.

406
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,318
I wrote for 50 years.

407
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,836
I wrote every day of my life...

408
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,355
...without exception.
I wrote and wrote.

409
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,159
I wrote during long nights
of insomnia...

410
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,158
...in foreign countries...

411
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,915
...in newsrooms full of enemies.

412
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,115
I wrote while my youth drifted by.

413
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,914
And while love...

414
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,709
...betrayed me.

415
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,556
Many years ago, I forgot her face.

416
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,918
The exact colour of her eyes,
the precise line of her mouth.

417
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,480
But today, with my back
against that wall...

418
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,709
...I saw you.

419
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,119
And I knew that you were she.

420
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,319
And that the only place on earth
I could have written that poem...

421
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,472
...would have been in your arms.

422
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,911
My God...

423
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,118
...how I'm longing to kiss you.

424
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,752
That's what I did, you see.

425
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,352
You just sighed.

426
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,948
May I ask, general,
why the hacienda is burnt down?

427
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,350
There was a battle.

428
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,075
Will the land be distributed,
the owners compensated?

429
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,114
Careful, general. The headlines
will say your answer was:

430
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,114
"Private Property Abolished in Mexico."

431
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,232
Yes, the peasants, the true owners,
will receive reparations.

432
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,518
This is what we are fighting for.

433
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,110
What are you doing with my map?

434
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,157
Excuse me, it's upside down.

435
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,916
You know that the earth is round,
don't you, Mr. Journalist?

436
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,155
That means that sometimes you are
above and sometimes you are below.

437
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,833
Or no?

438
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,915
It's a wonderful statement, colonel,
and a curious idea as well.

439
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,916
One moment. Hold still.

440
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,752
What is keeping you here?

441
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,514
Villa is already marching south.

442
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,952
We leave tomorrow,
with the permission of General Arroyo.

443
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,749
I can take you to the border.

444
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,992
Ever since we met,
you've tried to send me back.

445
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,311
It must be my chivalrous spirit.
Are you coming?

446
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,114
No, I don't think so.

447
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,434
- Don't we know each other, sir?
- Nope.

448
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,559
I try to write an honest report.
It's not easy with Arroyo.

449
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,320
He answers everything
by saying nothing.

450
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,916
A prudent attitude
when dealing with the press.

451
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,832
People need to be informed.

452
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,316
Hearst doesn't want to inform people.
He wants to use them.

453
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,552
You know Hearst?

454
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,191
Of course you do! I know you!

455
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,591
I tried to see your collected works
in Washington.

456
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,069
I hear there was quite a scandal.

457
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,993
Mustn't believe everything you read.

458
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,149
Meeting you here is quite a story.

459
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,558
You will not write a word about me.

460
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,553
Why not?

461
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,753
Because I'm asking you not to.

462
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,675
Anyway...

463
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,959
...who cares how a writer nobody reads
ends his days?

464
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,151
I do!

465
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,955
<i>I could have left with him.</i>

466
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,359
<i>Even the men were prepared to go.</i>

467
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,155
<i>Their mission was accomplished...</i>

468
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,756
<i>... and Villa needed all his people
at the front.</i>

469
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,550
<i>And yet they waited.</i>

470
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,151
<i>All of us waited,
because Arroyo wasn't ready.</i>

471
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,118
What are you doing?

472
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,880
Don't play with their toys.

473
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,158
We mustn't accept anything from them!

474
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,839
No toys...

475
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,716
...no clothes, no ideas, nothing!

476
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,072
He's only a child.
He was just playing.

477
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,954
We cannot play.

478
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,359
Don't you think your patrons
owe you a few things?

479
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,959
Me too. I also owe you
some new clothes.

480
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,760
I think this will fit you very good.

481
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,228
And you don't have to sleep
on the ground. You have a bed.

482
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,517
Why are you doing this?

483
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,913
<i>Las patronas gave their old clothes
to their governesses.</i>

484
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,155
Listen to me...

485
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,632
- You don't call me general.
- I don't think of you as one.

486
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,635
You know only generals who
study in schools and win on maps.

487
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,759
I am of the Revolution.
The battles have made me general!

488
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,912
<i>The land that we fought for,
metro a metro.</i>

489
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,236
And the people you've killed.

490
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,591
<i>Sí, señorita,
the people I have killed.</i>

491
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,717
Starting with the first.

492
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,515
<i>The one who slept in this bed,
el viejo Miranda.</i>

493
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,158
When I was 17, I killed the man who
raped my mother and made me a bastard.

494
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,393
<i>She was an Indian peasant.
E I patrón was my father.</i>

495
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,959
You see?

496
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,509
That horrifies you, no?

497
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,279
Do you want to know how I grew up,
watching the Mirandas?

498
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,799
How I watched them round up
the youngest and weakest of the women...

499
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,192
...as if they were cattle
and rape them in front of everybody?

500
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,635
How they punished with whips...

501
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,714
<i>...and tore them apart
for looking the patrón in the eye?</i>

502
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,277
<i>It was not los Miranda only.
It was the same all over Mexico.</i>

503
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,039
It wasn't just my history.
It was the history of everybody.

504
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,510
When I understood that...

505
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,280
...then Villa made me general.

506
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,917
Get inside! Don't be afraid!
I'll hold you.

507
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,310
The papers are in a wooden box.

508
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,313
Go higher!

509
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:50,353
200 years ago, the Spaniards wrote in
these deeds that this land is ours.

510
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,834
You found them!

511
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,918
We found them!

512
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,112
We got our papers back!

513
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:23,112
They were where the old Indians
told me to hide them years ago.

514
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,919
These papers prove...

515
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,594
...who owns the land.

516
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,512
The Mirandas will have other papers.

517
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,718
Papers don't mean anything.

518
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,918
When gringos like you
weren't even a dream...

519
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,237
...our people were already
rich and wise...

520
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,118
...and powerful!

521
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,913
These papers have existed
long before the gringos...

522
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,073
<i>...or los Miranda or the
grandfathers of their grandfathers!</i>

523
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,596
These papers are sacred!

524
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,194
No paper is sacred, general.

525
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,911
Perhaps it seems so to you
because you don't know how to read.

526
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,197
I do not need to know how to read...

527
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,116
...to know which piece of this
immense earth belongs to me.

528
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,320
I know who I am. Do you?

529
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,115
What are you doing in a country
that does not belong to you?

530
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,719
What will you do in a grave
that no one will visit?

531
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,315
Don't be afraid! Come on in!

532
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,232
Do you see yourselves?

533
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,751
This is you!

534
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,598
Look at me!

535
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,116
It's me that you see waving!

536
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,749
Look at yourself, Ataulfo!
And you, Nicasio!

537
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,519
You're laughing, Ataulfo! I see you!

538
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,229
Look, Leocadio!
It's you, the stubby guy!

539
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,197
And you, Maria.
Look what beautiful hair you have.

540
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,711
This is us!

541
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,588
These people are us!

542
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,715
<i>Look at yourself, gringuita!</i>

543
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,712
Look and see if you can see
what I see.

544
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,315
Look at yourself close.

545
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,433
You see how something in your face
begins to open?

546
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,310
Look at your eyes.

547
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,512
They are more sweet now
than when I knew you in Chihuahua.

548
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,116
And the mouth.

549
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,711
More soft.

550
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,118
Look at how you look at us now.

551
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,912
Now that you look at us without fear.

552
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,309
Now I like to look at you
when you look at me.

553
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,799
Hey, gringo!

554
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,917
- Come with us!
- Where to?

555
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,718
Where to?

556
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,277
It is a short trip, gringo,
but you have to gallop!

557
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,718
A new face is always welcome.

558
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,832
- You still like women?
- I do, and I will after I'm dead...

559
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,550
...but it isn't easy at my age
to bring together...

560
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,234
...opportunity, desire and energy...

561
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,713
...and it would require patience
incompatible with your business.

562
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,078
I like you, gringo.
I've never met an old man like you.

563
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,149
I've had many gringos, but they was
young and their skin was tasteless.

564
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,995
But you, you seem very tasty.

565
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,834
I'd love to have patience with you.

566
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,993
Thank you very much,
but we have another problem.

567
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,437
I have never paid in my life.

568
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,912
- It's about time you started.
- It's a matter of principle.

569
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,239
Principles? When gentlemen start
talking about principles...

570
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,950
...we poor people lose
what we don't even have!

571
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,308
I like a woman
who can make a man laugh.

572
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,113
I bet you even make them laugh in bed.

573
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,429
- So you don't pay?
- No.

574
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,839
What you do when you're not fighting?

575
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,311
- I read.
- You read books?

576
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,000
The priest in my village, he say:

577
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,313
"To read books
can make a man go crazy."

578
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,275
I can't blame the books.
At least not the ones I've read.

579
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,314
Perhaps the ones I've written.

580
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,197
You wrote books?

581
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,715
Yes, a few.

582
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,753
So, why are you sad?

583
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,515
When you are gone,
the people who can read...

584
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,591
...they'll remember you.

585
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,114
Yes!

586
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,719
You give me one of your books...

587
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,717
...I no charge you.

588
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,920
Your work for my work.

589
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,839
That way you stay
with your principles...

590
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,116
...and me with mine.

591
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,918
<i>So you like the clothes
of los Miranda.</i>

592
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,920
Everyone likes what is beautiful.

593
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,639
Man is one of the most
pathetic creatures on earth.

594
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,112
Condemned to a desire that
contradicts the laws of nature...

595
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,717
...to close the gap
between two human beings.

596
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,996
Some call this desire love...

597
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,916
...and it is desperately impossible
to satisfy.

598
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,910
Nevertheless...

599
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,714
...I would like to delude myself
one more time...

600
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,830
...to feel intrigued, hopeful...

601
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,310
...enthusiastic.

602
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,715
And not knowing...

603
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,916
...if this might perhaps be...

604
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,710
...your first time...

605
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,874
...l'd like to request that you
participate with me...

606
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,719
...in what will undoubtedly be...

607
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,711
...my last time.

608
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,713
Please, try to close your mouth.

609
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,509
You don't have to answer me now.

610
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,513
Think about it.

611
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,913
You've seen all the clocks
in this house?

612
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,316
When I was a boy...

613
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,835
<i>...I used to think that time
belonged to los Miranda.</i>

614
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,036
That they were the owners
of the hours.

615
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,155
I used to dream...

616
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,630
...of going inside one of those...

617
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,917
- Pendulum.
- Pendulum, yes.

618
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,911
I stop it...

619
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,511
...and everything stops
because I want.

620
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:33,269
And then when I want,
everything starts again.

621
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,916
But it is different
because then it is...

622
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,113
It is our time, not theirs.

623
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,676
Speak to me more, General Arroyo.

624
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,713
I like to listen to you.

625
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,513
You like it?

626
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,748
And now...

627
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,636
You like when I speak in my language?

628
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,157
You understand me...

629
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,595
...not my words.

630
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,149
<i>I like you, gringuita.</i>

631
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,360
You like me to say it to you?

632
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,349
When Villa told me
to take this hacienda, Mother...

633
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,957
...I was afraid.

634
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,633
Maybe my fate was to come back...

635
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:41,799
...to look at myself in their mirrors,
to dance where I couldn't even walk...

636
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,429
...to sleep in their beds!

637
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,997
We kicked them out!

638
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,038
There's no Miranda left here...

639
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,634
...except me.

640
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,355
- You are listening to me, gringo.
- I'm listening.

641
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,716
Your horse brought me here.

642
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,110
Come, come talk with me.

643
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,112
Talk with my family.

644
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,435
Here they are.

645
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,909
My godfather, Graciano...

646
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,150
...my mother, Dolores Arroyo.

647
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,711
And your father?

648
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,152
Was a Miranda.

649
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,911
And I killed him.

650
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,312
Want to drink with me?

651
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,999
- I thought you didn't drink.
- I don't drink with the living...

652
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,512
...but tonight I come to visit
my dead. To celebrate with them.

653
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,749
You visit your dead ones?

654
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,913
No.

655
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,509
Sometimes they come to visit me.

656
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,308
I had two sons. One killed himself,
the other got himself killed.

657
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,597
I think they were trying
to be like me...

658
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,912
...and they couldn't stand it.

659
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,310
We make a good couple.

660
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,155
Were you ever in love?

661
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,789
- Many times.
- Women are...

662
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,314
<i>... strange animals, no?</i>

663
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,119
<i>Yes.</i>

664
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,232
<i>But you never know...</i>

665
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,313
...what they're thinking.
- Never.

666
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,274
They always know
what a man's thinking.

667
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,674
Not always.

668
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,309
<i>But they think they do.</i>

669
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,759
<i>And you...</i>

670
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,309
<i>... how do you like your women?</i>

671
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,910
Sighing.

672
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,351
I'll give you another name.

673
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,114
- What name?
- I must look for it.

674
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,913
It must be a Mexican name...

675
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,512
...so that you will come
when I call you.

676
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,914
This way, only I can call you that.

677
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,310
I think I love you.

678
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,039
You think?

679
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,910
I've never been in love before.
I have nothing to compare it to.

680
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,672
Isn't it wonderful?

681
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,199
Look at them all.

682
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,473
I was always afraid of the unknown.

683
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,596
Whenever my mother said
someone was different...

684
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,308
...what she meant to say was "worse."

685
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:38,474
Perhaps it's why she and my father
didn't get along. He wasn't like that.

686
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:52,270
I want to tell you something.

687
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,679
My father didn't die in Cuba.

688
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,678
He fell in love with a woman
and stayed to live with her.

689
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,232
I've never told that to anyone before.

690
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,278
I've spent my life
taking care of an empty grave.

691
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,788
I wish I could see him again.

692
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,554
I wish I could embrace my daughter.

693
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,038
It would be wonderful
to have a second chance.

694
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,552
It's unbearable to think
life prints in its final form...

695
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,872
...what is only an awkward
rough draft.

696
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:38,791
Things being as they are,
there's a last time for everything.

697
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,390
And I want to plan that final version.

698
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,149
I like the idea of being
more careful than God.

699
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,995
Of not allowing him
to improvise with me...

700
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,668
...as he is doing with you.

701
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,468
Why not? His improvisations
can be wonderful.

702
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,314
And he ran...

703
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,875
...and he ran, and he ran...

704
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,118
...and he was almost embracing
his wife and children...

705
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,632
...when he felt a stunning blow...

706
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,875
...upon the back of his neck.
And then all...

707
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,838
...was silence...

708
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,470
...and darkness.

709
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,671
And his body with the broken neck...

710
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,316
...swung gently from side to side...

711
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,393
...beneath the timbers...

712
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,870
...of the Owl Creek Bridge.

713
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,673
Look.

714
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,599
Skeletons. Death.

715
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:17,832
<i>I will sing a corrido
The story starts like this</i>

716
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:25,279
<i>Once upon a time an old gringo
Came here to get himself killed</i>

717
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,916
<i>He wanted to fight with Villa
Then he met a blond gringa</i>

718
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:41,712
<i>Who follows Tomas Arroyo
Like a true soldadera</i>

719
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:49,709
<i>Our story stops here
While the war goes on far away</i>

720
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:57,231
<i>Because our General Arroyo
Is looking for himself in the mirrors</i>

721
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:04,593
<i>He sees a ghost that haunted him
From the day he arrived</i>

722
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:11,830
<i>He did what must not be done
Return to the place he was born</i>

723
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,789
<i>His past will not let him
Come to a decision</i>

724
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:29,149
<i>To be a Miranda
Or fight the Revolution</i>

725
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,788
Good afternoon!

726
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,390
Good afternoon, my friends!

727
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,348
Sorry I'm so dirty from the trip.

728
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,118
Well, Zacarias...

729
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,792
...you deserted, you went home
and killed people.

730
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,359
Defend yourself.

731
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,712
I went to visit my family.
But, hell...

732
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,078
...those bastards exploited us.

733
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,037
I just wanted to teach them...

734
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,872
...but I got excited.

735
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,992
We're not here for
your personal revenge.

736
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:41,632
- I know it was wrong, colonel.
- And you stayed.

737
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,234
Of course! I was at home!

738
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,233
We are so many here!

739
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,432
I didn't think you'd miss me.

740
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,994
What would happen to the Revolution...

741
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,996
...if everyone stayed home?

742
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,395
And you? You did the same.

743
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,874
That's all you have to say?

744
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,235
Yes!

745
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,439
I'm sorry. I'll never...

746
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,393
Then I'm sending you
to the firing squad.

747
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,551
To shoot me?

748
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,879
He ordered him to be shot.

749
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,189
Take him!

750
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,831
Forgive me, general! For the love
of God! What happened to you?

751
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,194
Take him away!

752
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:35,029
Why? You could lock him up.
You don't have to kill him.

753
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,758
I give the orders here.

754
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,069
You must leave this place.

755
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,152
Don't stay here, son.

756
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,072
I am not your son!

757
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,078
Someone has to help you
to get out of here.

758
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,876
What are you looking at?

759
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,477
A Miranda.

760
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,273
I had not seen one until now.

761
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,674
That's a good horse.

762
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,075
A beautiful horse.

763
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,679
I'm gonna ride you now, Angel...

764
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,077
...if you'll agree.

765
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,674
I can promise you something.

766
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,078
I will never ride again.

767
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,915
Never.

768
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,159
What are you doing, gringo?
Nobody can ride him.

769
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,352
If the horse doesn't kill you,
Arroyo will.

770
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,114
Yes, perhaps...

771
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,079
...but he needs our help.

772
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,596
Angel knows...

773
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,876
...what I am thinking.

774
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,070
Don't you, Angel?

775
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,475
<i>- You read English?
- Me? I almost no read español.</i>

776
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,871
I went two years to... Oh, that book.

777
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,275
The old gringo gave it to me.

778
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,473
<i>He didn't give it to me,
we made a trueque. A trade.</i>

779
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,075
And he wrote it, you know?

780
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,677
Hey, you want to read it?

781
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:35,955
I've read it.
I've read all his stories.

782
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,873
All this time we've been together,
I didn't know who he was.

783
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,912
He was in Washington.

784
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,472
I never saw his face.
I didn't know it was the same man.

785
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,312
I'm leaving, Tomas.

786
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,557
Won't you say goodbye?

787
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:55,068
We should have left
this damned hacienda long ago.

788
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,632
Villa's expecting us!

789
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:04,679
He's going to take Torreon
and here you are with your papers!

790
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,077
He needs us, Tomas!

791
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,274
Look, Tomas...

792
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,238
...the Revolution will live...

793
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:15,912
...only if we move.

794
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,430
If we stop, it dies!

795
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,955
Nobody moves without my order.

796
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,110
You must shoot me then.

797
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,033
Kill me, Tomas.

798
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,789
Because if you don't,
I'm taking your army with me.

799
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,113
Why?

800
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,870
Why didn't you kill me?

801
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,869
You loved that horse!

802
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,993
This hacienda...

803
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,800
...is driving you crazy!

804
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,470
Why didn't you kill me?

805
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,909
I was beginning
to grow fond of you, general.

806
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,674
You're too much like me.

807
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,869
You're capable of fighting
for words...

808
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:52,475
...written on pieces of paper.

809
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,068
You are capable of killing...

810
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,799
...for pride.

811
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,478
These papers are meaningless!

812
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,279
There.

813
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,159
It's done.

814
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,278
Now you can leave.

815
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,074
These papers are meaningless.

816
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,477
Take your general
away from this place.

817
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,517
These papers...

818
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,274
...mean nothing!

819
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,193
Get him out of this hacienda!

820
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,477
Not yet.

821
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,073
Not yet.

822
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,599
I know who you are.

823
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,956
This is Consul Saunders. He represents
the U.S. Here in Chihuahua.

824
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,077
Have a seat, please.

825
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,480
Now tell me, how may I help you?

826
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,076
I am Harriet Winslow.

827
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:02,076
I've come to report that
a United States citizen has been killed.

828
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,269
Please tell me, ma'am...

829
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,631
...when did this happen?

830
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:13,072
Yesterday.

831
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,669
It happened yesterday.

832
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,271
There was a fight and he was killed.

833
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,269
His whole body quivered.

834
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,909
Could you please give us the name...

835
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,277
...of the person who died
during that fight?

836
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,476
I'll have to raise this matter
with General Villa.

837
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:40,075
And I must have the name.

838
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,871
He said to me:

839
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,753
"I'd like to embrace
my daughter again."

840
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,072
And I said there is...

841
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:15,589
...an empty grave at Arlington
waiting for him.

842
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,594
Waiting for my father.

843
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,589
Your father was fighting here
in Mexico?

844
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:34,995
I want his body. I want to bring
his body where it belongs.

845
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,435
Miss Winslow, we must...

846
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,673
Please, give us the name.

847
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,433
Captain Harrison Winslow.

848
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,398
That was my father's name.

849
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:10,598
It could even give President Wilson
an excuse to intervene...

850
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,839
...if I give him the corpse as is.

851
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,357
You see, Tomas, I can't prepare
to attack the city of Torreon...

852
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:28,356
...with trouble with gringos because
of a corpse full of holes in his back.

853
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,156
Who was he, anyway?

854
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:36,071
A crazy old man looking for death.

855
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,878
But he was brave.

856
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,471
Señorita Winslow...

857
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,276
...I am General Villa.

858
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,875
So you came all the way here
to claim a dead body.

859
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,314
Yes, general.

860
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:01,553
You know, every time a foreign
journalist asks me:

861
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,280
"Why are you fighting
this Revolution?"

862
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:08,917
I answer, "So they don't have
to ask permission from anyone...

863
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,230
...or have an army anymore."

864
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,752
When it is over, we can go home,
and I'll be the first to go.

865
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,516
That'll be the end
of uniforms and battles...

866
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,671
...and all this death.

867
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,072
But what would happen...

868
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,308
...if we all stayed home?

869
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:35,268
You know I love you like a son,
Tomasito, don't you?

870
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:40,509
But you set a bad example when you
should have come running here.

871
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,189
Now we have this body.

872
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,796
And this is the body of...

873
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,555
...Captain Harrison Winslow?

874
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,548
Yes.

875
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:01,709
What?

876
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,995
Let the lady speak.

877
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:16,789
This man fought courageously
for our Revolution...

878
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,431
...alongside General Arroyo.

879
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,878
But he disobeyed orders
as General Arroyo did himself.

880
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:27,556
So he deserved to be shot.

881
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,070
But not in the back.

882
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,477
Your father... You did say
he was your father?

883
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,113
Yes.

884
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,751
We put here...

885
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,276
...that you witnessed...

886
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,670
...both executions.

887
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,194
If you please sign the paper...

888
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,074
...everything will be in order.

889
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,678
Sign it.

890
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,356
Thank you, Miss Winslow.

891
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,271
I am to blame.

892
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,273
No, I have disobeyed orders.

893
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,595
It is as if I had deserted.

894
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,473
You don't have much time, Tomasito.

895
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:53,556
- Why do you say he is your father?
- I lied...

896
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:56,872
...because I had to claim his body.

897
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,471
I couldn't leave him in the desert
with no one to mourn him.

898
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,990
I don't want you to die.

899
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:21,795
I don't want you to see me die.

900
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,876
You will forget.

901
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:36,070
You'll tell your grandchildren
you saw people die in the Revolution...

902
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,279
...but you will forget
why we have fought!

903
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,077
You will tell them
you once ate tortillas...

904
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:48,392
...but you will forget the smell.

905
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,391
You will forget.

906
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,790
I shall never forget you.

907
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,678
Never.

908
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:02,278
You made me believe I could live
a different kind of life.

909
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:05,598
And I will never be the same.

910
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:20,638
We're going to kill the last Miranda.

911
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,474
<i>We make a good couple, viejo.</i>

912
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:25,075
Hey, Miss Winslow!
This is a moving picture!

913
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,670
Is it true you came south
in search of your father?

914
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,590
And would you testify to the Senate
as to the savagery rampant here?

915
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,479
Do you believe they'll
achieve democracy?

916
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,678
Don't you think the U.S.
Should intervene?

917
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:56,597
<i>He told me I would forget.</i>

918
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,792
<i>But how could I not remember?</i>

919
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,792
<i>The young general
who wanted to change the world...</i>

920
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:12,394
<i>... the old writer
who wanted to bid it farewell.</i>

921
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:19,992
<i>I am the one who will live
to remember them both.</i>

922
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,589
