2
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,219
Mum, are you in?

3
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,370
Come in.

4
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,804
Were you dancing?

5
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:39,097
Dancing.

6
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:41,553
Just fooling around.

7
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:48,935
Sorry I'm late.

8
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:51,114
I took the bus here.

9
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,079
The flowers look pretty.

10
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,666
What are these flowers called?

11
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,867
Hydrangeas.

12
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:11,132
They're pretty.

13
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,731
Tell me, why didn't you drive here?

14
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,411
I like taking the bus.

15
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:21,539
What's that look for?

16
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,390
You're too nice to him.

17
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:26,102
What do you mean?

18
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm also important. I'm your mother.

19
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,146
We are family.

20
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,716
Of course you are, Mum.

21
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:37,313
You're the most important.

22
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:42,886
Did you bring the CD?

23
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:46,122
I forgot, I'm sorry.

24
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,767
I've asked you four times.

25
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:50,494
Sorry.

26
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,413
What's wrong?

27
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,522
Would you come for dinner tomorrow?

28
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,323
Yes, absolutely.

29
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:02,948
Could you cook?

30
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:04,349
Sure.

31
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:07,690
Will your friend be there?

32
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,891
No, he'll be out.

33
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,317
I'm so bored here.

34
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,696
It will take a while before
you make any fiends.

35
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,407
Why did you put me in such a place?

36
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:28,073
There's no room at my place
and you don't like Richard.

37
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,533
Why can't he stay with his parents?

38
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,414
He's always asking about you.

39
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:40,789
Do you know how it feels
to be locked up by your own son?

40
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,466
You're not being locked up.

41
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,712
You have friends who can visit you.

42
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:49,326
It suits you.
You can't just discard me whenever it suits you.

43
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:53,059
You put me in here and expect me to get along.

44
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,260
I'm not a pet.

45
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:13,992
I'm sorry.
It's only temporary.

46
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:18,832
You know that.

47
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:28,921
There are these crazy men in here
who keep shouting at me.

48
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,464
What did they say?

49
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,265
I don't understand them.

50
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:38,645
Idiots, can't tell the difference
between Japanese and Chinese.

51
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:40,513
What is the difference?

52
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,341
We have nicer eyes, a lip on our eyelids.

53
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,321
Our eyes are more almond shaped.

54
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,439
I've seen Japanese people with a lip
on their eyelids too.

55
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,319
You're always arguing with me.

56
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,617
How do you know they think
you're Japanese?

57
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,372
See? You're doing it again.

58
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,571
I'm just asking.

59
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:00,749
I do understand some English.

60
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:03,334
Like what?

61
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:07,047
Fuck you very much.

62
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:08,207
Mum!

63
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,508
Who taught you that?

64
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:10,509
taught you that?

65
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,267
I've met someone.

66
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:23,268
You've made a friend?

67
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,439
He's very handsome.

68
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,640
Who?

69
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,906
He's so charming.
He gives me flowers every day.

70
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,112
How old is he?

71
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:39,653
I can say anything and
he doesn't answer back.

72
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,580
I can talk rubbish and he still thinks
I'm an exotic beauty.

73
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,829
How did you meet?

74
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:56,718
Sometimes it feels like we do
understand each other.

75
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,519
How do you... Isn't it difficult?

76
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,978
Kai, I'm over sixty.

77
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:13,965
I'm not looking for a relationship,
it's just for fun.

78
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,165
Fun?

79
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:16,450
Nothing has happened.

80
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,618
How long have you known
each other?

81
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,069
Nearly two weeks.

82
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:25,850
What do you two do together?

83
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:27,851
We talk.

84
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,208
We kiss.

85
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,169
Oh, my God!

86
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,796
Kissing?
Who kissed who first?

87
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:40,709
You're so uptight. Kissing is kissing.

88
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:46,550
Is he English?

89
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,227
You like pale skin.

90
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:57,151
- Dad was half white.
- Your father was Chinese.

91
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,273
Hey, Junn.
- You OK?
- Mm.

92
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:06,745
I'm just gonna change
the light bulb for you.

93
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,372
There we are. See you.

94
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:31,929
Lilting

95
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:12,974
Are you all right? Can I help?

96
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:16,988
Yeah, I'm looking for a Ms Junn Tan.
Do you know how I can find her?

97
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,603
Yeah, she's probably in her room.

98
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:22,064
Oh, no, she isn't. I saw her
outside earlier with Alan.

99
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:28,275
Every day around this
time they meet out there,spend some time
holding hands and snogging.

100
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:31,195
- It kills me.
- That's sweet.

101
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,128
Yeah. How do you know Junn?

102
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,735
I'm a friend of her son's, Kai.

103
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:39,031
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,415
- I'll take you outside to see her.
- OK.

105
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,298
Alan!

106
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,591
Junn, I've got someone to see you.

107
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:00,556
Hello, Junn.

108
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,142
Hello.

109
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,776
How are you?

110
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:18,904
I'm... OK. I'm, um...
plodding along.

111
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,040
- Is this your friend?
- She's not deaf.

112
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,995
Sorry.

113
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,792
It's a nice place.

114
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,092
- How's she been?
- She spends her time in her room.

115
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:50,560
We take them on trips
every few months but she doesn't really participate.

116
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,604
There's Casanova here.

117
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,943
They snuggle up pretty much every day.

118
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,649
- My name's Alan.
- I'm Richard.

119
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,238
How do you know her, then?

120
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,410
I'm a friend.

121
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,614
Does she have any other family?

122
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,577
I used to pull the
birds with this song.

123
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,960
It never failed to turn
their legs to jelly.

124
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,240
Oh, ho! You see what I mean?

125
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:29,942
We came here to give our child
a better life.

126
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:36,656
My husband said you'll love this country.

127
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:42,413
Poeple are so nice,
everything in new and modern.

128
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:46,707
There will be so much freedom
and choices.

129
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:53,514
But we ended up shopping...

130
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:59,388
...in charity shops and jumble sales.

131
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,157
Even though I couldn't grasp
your way of life,

132
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,657
somehow it clings to my skin,
changing the simple things within,

133
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,578
and returning home feels frightening.

134
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:28,334
What other countries can
offer free medical care

135
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,688
and clean drinking water?

136
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:38,264
My husband thought he was in heaven

137
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:43,640
with so many bookies in one high street.

138
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,557
Five years pass and suddenly
we're English people,

139
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,983
But I'm not English.

140
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,662
Kai.

141
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,417
I hate this place.
How did I end up here?

142
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:20,926
- You smell really nice.
- Really?

143
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:26,469
I've taken care of everything.
We can leave now.

144
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:30,002
Really, move in with you?

145
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,901
What about your friend Richard?

146
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,857
He has gone.

147
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,113
Even though he's your friend,
I've never liked him.

148
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:41,733
Don't get angry.

149
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,121
Have you stopped being friends?

150
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,991
Yes.

151
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,728
I'll find new friends.

152
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:54,797
Why have you put me in this awful place?

153
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:57,611
Look at the wallpaper.

154
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:00,796
Everything here is suffocating.

155
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:04,513
I'm sorry, Mum, it's my fault.

156
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:08,348
I shouldn't have put you in here.

157
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,604
We are leaving now.

158
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:16,519
Richard has gone?
I can move in with you?

159
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:21,731
Yes, like you wanted, Mum.

160
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:52,518
- Are you...
- Richard?

161
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,968
- Yes. Are you Vann?
- Hi. Yeah.

162
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,356
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

163
00:15:57,564 --> 00:16:00,222
- Yeah, good, thanks.
- Do you want anything to drink?

164
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:02,310
Yeah, I'd love a coffee, actually.

165
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,625
- Hi. Can I get an Americano, please?
- Sure.

166
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,907
- Um, I'll have the same, please.
- Of course.

167
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,862
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

168
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:15,036
That's OK. I hope I can help.

169
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:18,415
I can't remember whether
I told you on the phone.

170
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,389
Um... she's the mother of a very dear friend of
mine who died recently

171
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:23,924
and I felt that...

172
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:30,375
Well, anyway,
she has met a man, Alan,

173
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:34,178
and the problem is, they don't
have any common language,

174
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,362
so I wanted you to
translate for them.

175
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:40,187
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. I think...

176
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:43,682
It'll be lovely...

177
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,352
- No, I meant...
- I know. I know what you meant.

178
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,905
She speaks the four main dialects.
She speaks Mandarin,

179
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:54,275
Cantonese,
- Hokkien?
- Mm-hm.

180
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,365
And... something else
that I can't remember.

181
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,451
And a bit of Cambodian
and Vietnamese.

182
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,790
- They're Cambodian Chinese.
- Right.

183
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:09,002
Yeah, she speaks six
languages altogether.

184
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,583
- Apart from English.
- Lazy bitch.

185
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:18,013
- So selfish.
- Sounds like my mum.

186
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:21,344
You know, I'm not a professional translator.
I can speak the languages.

187
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,645
Fine. I'm just...
I'm grateful that you can help.

188
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,433
Well, I'll try my best.

189
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,845
I wish there was a Shazam for smell.

190
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,103
Have you been sniffing other people?

191
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,350
No.

192
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:18,728
Sometimes I come across a scent,
I'd like to know what it is.

193
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:24,156
We should have your
mum over for dim sum.

194
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:29,366
I can impress her with
my Chinese cooking.

195
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,245
She won't like your cooking.

196
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:40,000
- Come on, I'm good.
- I know, but she won't admit it.

197
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:46,922
She hates me.

198
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,134
She doesn't.

199
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:51,344
She's jealous.

200
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,646
I'm her only child. No one's
good enough for me in her eyes.

201
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,692
You're not good enough for me.

202
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:05,865
You have to try harder.

203
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,364
Why? Why am I not good enough?

204
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:25,007
You'll have to stay
in the spare room.

205
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:30,219
We'll have to pretend we're friends.

206
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,762
I know.

207
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,589
I think I've put her
in there too soon.

208
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:50,234
I don't think sheltered
accommodation is good for her.

209
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:56,697
You should come out to her.

210
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,498
So she can come here
and live with us instead.

211
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:04,880
Stop doing that.

212
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,577
It's like walking back in time.

213
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,079
That's the idea.

214
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,084
Junn.

215
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,920
Um, Junn, this is Vann.

216
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:09,347
I was just explaining who I was.
I told her I was your friend.

217
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,196
She asked, how are you?

218
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:18,525
I'm... I'm good.
Well, I'm OK.

219
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,444
How's she? How's her health?

220
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,081
She's fine.

221
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:33,374
She's, um... s0-so.

222
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:44,218
Shall we sit down and
I can explain to her?

223
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:06,319
So this is Vann.

224
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,073
Sorry. You've already met. Um...

225
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,919
And she is here to
translate for you and Alan

226
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:18,631
so that you can get to
know each other better.

227
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:28,888
She's surprised you want to help her.

228
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,303
How does she feel about it?

229
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,899
She doesn't mind.

230
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:42,612
Can you say to her that I'm sorry that
I didn't come and visit her sooner

231
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,238
but that there was a lot
to do after Kai's death,

232
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,158
a lot of reorganising and so forth?

233
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,903
And obviously I don't speak Mandarin
and she doesn't speak English.

234
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,866
Shall I say that again?

235
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,075
Um... no, I got it.

236
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,301
Um... there's still
a lot to organise,

237
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:16,434
but if she would like to come
round one day when she's free,

238
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,939
she could look through his stuff
and take away what she likes.

239
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,744
Are you giving her the belongings
you no longer want to keep?

240
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,450
No, they're not his rejects.

241
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:45,208
They're his things.
I'm only keeping what...

242
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,332
You know, they're...
They're Kai's belongings.

243
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:03,011
She's always free.
You just have to make a date.

244
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,048
OK.

245
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:10,148
She asked, why have you come here?

246
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:15,740
Well..., I wanted to see how you are.

247
00:24:18,536 --> 00:24:19,533
I think Kai...

248
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:22,326
I was concerned and I...

249
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:27,315
I wanted to make sure that you're
OK living here without Kai.

250
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:40,338
She wants to know
where Kai's ashes are.

251
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,493
They're at home.

252
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:46,762
- She wants to have his ashes.
- No.

253
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:56,938
- Why not?
- Um, it's just...

254
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,825
You have a house
filled with his things.

255
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:06,703
Why won't you let me have...
her have her son's ashes?

256
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:14,499
Um, I want to scatter them somewhere,
and I think Kai would like that.

257
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,046
- He was my only child.
- He was my life. He was my hap...

258
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:27,642
Don't... Don't translate that.
She doesn't know.

259
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:30,094
She doesn't know that
we were together.

260
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,437
He said Kai was his best friend.

261
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:48,996
- Bad timing?
- No, no, no. Come and join us.

262
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,285
Alan, this is... Vann.

263
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,953
And Vann speaks
Mandarin and Cantonese

264
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:00,541
and she's going to translate
for you and Junn.

265
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,131
You brought someone
to translate for us?

266
00:26:03,343 --> 00:26:05,337
Yeah.

267
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,341
That's, er...
That's very good of you.

268
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:15,684
What shall we chat about?

269
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:18,020
Er... anything you want.

270
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:21,566
Um... What's her name?
Oh, no. I know that already.

271
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,568
Um, actually, I don't,
because we haven't been formally introduced.

272
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,571
Um... how old is she?
Oh, no, that's no good.

273
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,491
Tell her that she looks lovely.

274
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,671
She said, "Thank you".

275
00:26:47,302 --> 00:26:49,295
Did you enjoy Kew Gardens?

276
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,885
No. No, it was a bit boring.

277
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:58,142
I'm gonna go outside.

278
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:14,661
She said it's really sweet that
you give her flowers every day.

279
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:16,946
She appreciates that.

280
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:18,540
Oh, it's my pleasure.

281
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:31,090
- Do you like gambling?
- Gambling? No. No, I never gamble.

282
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:35,169
It's a waste of money. I'd sooner
spend it on wild sex instead.

283
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:37,839
No... no, I'm joking. Don't say that.

284
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:43,887
You didn't say that, did you?

285
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:45,102
No, I didn't.

286
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:48,601
No. No, it's just...
I'm... I'm a bit nervous.

287
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,191
I feel as though I'm on my first date.

288
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,029
You know what I mean?

289
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,991
I understand. Just take your time.

290
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,202
What do you do in your spare time?

291
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,561
So you don't mind continuing?

292
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,553
Of course not.

293
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,764
- It's beautiful.
- Very romantic.

294
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,848
- What will you do?
- What do you mean?

295
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,729
Will you leave her in the home?

296
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:31,316
I'm thinking of asking her to
stay at mine for a trial period.

297
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:33,518
I mean...

298
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:36,855
Actually, I don't know what I mean.

299
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:42,736
Do you think it's a bad idea?

300
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:44,867
I don't know.

301
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:49,093
Would you come over and
translate for us one weekend?

302
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,209
- Obviously I'd pay you.
- Of course I can.

303
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,765
You're really thinking
of living with her?

304
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,873
Do you think I'm mad?

305
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:01,217
It would drive me mad,
living with my mum.

306
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:04,589
Fucking suicidal even.

307
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,592
Sui-fucking-cidal.

308
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,393
What can I do?

309
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:22,104
Leave her in the home.

310
00:29:22,322 --> 00:29:24,668
It's not so bad for
her to be in there.

311
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:26,819
I could learn Mandarin.

312
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:31,113
She could learn English.

313
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:33,324
That's not gonna happen.

314
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:12,785
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

315
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:16,366
Thank you.

316
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:25,706
I've been thinking about putting
my mum in a sheltered home.

317
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,175
I've been reading about this place.
It's really interesting.

318
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:32,423
The decor is made to look
like the '50s and '60s

319
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,350
so the elderly can feel younger.

320
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:38,178
It takes them back to, like,
a younger, happier time.

321
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,437
I doubt they'll have mid-century

322
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:43,681
furniture from Cambodia.

323
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:46,485
Stop being so clever.
Always have to have the last say.

324
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:49,565
- That's not true.
- It's not just the decor.

325
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,524
They actively encourage
them to help themselves.

326
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:58,330
I thought it was because
she needed looking after.

327
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,778
See? You're doing it again.

328
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,996
Slight memory loss is not serious.

329
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,297
Her memory loss is not slight.

330
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:15,963
It's not just the memory loss.
It's not even about her memory.

331
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,883
You know this.

332
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,978
- Are you gunning for a fight?
- No, of course I'm not.

333
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:32,479
You look so conflicted.

334
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,325
Relax your forehead.

335
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:43,200
Here.

336
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,827
Relax it there.

337
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,338
Bring her over to stay with us, then.

338
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:01,591
Are you mad? That would
be sui-fucking-cidal.

339
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,362
What choice do you have?

340
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,599
How long can you keep this up?

341
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,945
- You can't lock her up forever.
- I'm not locking her up.

342
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:18,137
- For fuck's sake, Richard!
- Sorry. I didn't...

343
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:21,197
I didn't mean that.

344
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,790
I just don't know what to say
to you about this anymore.

345
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:35,747
You have my absolute support.

346
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:39,957
And you know you have to tell her.

347
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:49,139
If you think about it,
we're constantly coming out to people,

348
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:51,558
so really you should be good at it.

349
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
If only she liked you.
It would make this a lot easier.

350
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:01,812
But for some reason she
thinks you're a dick.

351
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,859
You love this dick.

352
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:27,259
I can't stay too long today, Alan.

353
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,757
OK, well, we'll just
do the best we can.

354
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:32,089
You have a few hours with me.

355
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:35,595
Then it's back to flirting
and kissing, I'm afraid.

356
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:36,808
Oh. Goody, goody!

357
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:47,945
She'd like you to leave.

358
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:51,180
She feels awkward with so
many people watching her.

359
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,072
OK.

360
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,327
Have fun.

361
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,465
Oh, this is just in case I forget.

362
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:11,298
Er, you know,
they're not that important,

363
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:16,424
but when you leave,I start wondering
whether I've asked them

364
00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:19,394
and then I forget to ask them.

365
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,104
Can I... Can I ask 'em?

366
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:28,069
Ask away.

367
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:31,196
What's her favourite
ice cream flavour?

368
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,782
Chocolate!
That's my favourite too.

369
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:41,913
We've loads in common.

370
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:47,171
What does she prefer, cats or dogs?

371
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:52,759
- Cats.
- Oh, me too. I love cats.

372
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,054
How long has she been
over in this country?

373
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,975
Nearly 29 years.

374
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:08,432
Tell her that she's lovely and
she looks really beautiful

375
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,524
and that she smells...

376
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,728
really nice today.

377
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,117
What was that grin there?

378
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,956
She said thank you and that
you have a nice dimple.

379
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,089
I thought so. She can't
keep her hands off it.

380
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,182
Do you have any children?

381
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,266
Two boys, Brian and John.

382
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,106
When was the last
time they visited you?

383
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:58,439
Not for a while, a long time.

384
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,887
Er... we were never that close.
They were closer to their mother.

385
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,291
Why were you not close?
Did you not love them?

386
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:12,291
Of course I loved them.

387
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:14,495
I wasn't a very good father.

388
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:17,630
They couldn't wait to put me in here.

389
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:34,224
- Do your children not love you?
- I didn't say that. They...

390
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:37,393
They... Well... I'm old and clumsy.

391
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:40,231
It seemed to be the best
solution for everyone.

392
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:42,426
Less guilt for them to deal with.

393
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:45,324
Everybody's happy.
I'm happy, they're happy.

394
00:36:58,294 --> 00:37:00,537
Don't you want to see
your grandchildren?

395
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:04,249
No.

396
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,756
Oh, this isn't going so smoothly.

397
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:11,801
It's fine. It's...
part of the process.

398
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:14,009
Ha! Thank you, Mum.

399
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:20,520
Tell her I'd like to take her
to dinner a week on Saturday.

400
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:27,605
I'm a good cook. It'll be lasagne.

401
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:38,831
What are you smiling about now?

402
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:43,873
Nothing. I told her you'd cook Chinese food
and that you're a really good cook.

403
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:46,496
I said lasagne. I only do lasagne.

404
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:48,709
She hasn't had Chinese
food in a long time.

405
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:53,635
- It will make her feel at home.
- She cooks Chinese food every day.

406
00:37:54,764 --> 00:37:57,517
I'm trying to help you.
Junn doesn't like lasagne.

407
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,134
But I... I don't do Chinese.

408
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:02,014
You can order from a takeaway.

409
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,066
- She's thinking of coming, then?
- Yeah.

410
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:08,525
Well, what do I order?

411
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:12,569
Sweet and sour thingumabobs,
Shanghai duck, springtime rolls?

412
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:16,483
No, don't... don't order those.
I'll get the food for you.

413
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:18,695
You can have the dinner at mine.

414
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,956
Were you dancing?

415
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:29,787
Just fooling around.

416
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:36,293
Sorry I'm late.

417
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:38,549
I took the bus here.

418
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:53,643
The flowers look pretty.

419
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:56,817
What are these flowers called?

420
00:38:57,824 --> 00:38:59,153
Hydrangeas.

421
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:01,818
They're pretty.

422
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:10,241
Tell me, why didn't you drive here?

423
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:14,568
I like taking the bus.

424
00:39:17,008 --> 00:39:18,156
What's that look for?

425
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,356
You're too nice to him.

426
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,428
What do you mean?

427
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:29,473
I'm also important. I'm your mother.

428
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,272
We are family.

429
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:37,695
Of course you are.

430
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:43,907
Mum, you're the most important.

431
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:50,947
Did you bring the CD?

432
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,951
I forgot, I'm sorry.

433
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:56,587
I've asked you four times.

434
00:39:57,756 --> 00:39:58,539
Sorry.

435
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:04,175
What's wrong?

436
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:11,028
Would you like to come for
dinner tomorrow?

437
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,061
Yes, absolutely.

438
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,149
- All right?
- Yeah.

439
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,780
I just bought you some fruit.

440
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:43,706
She said, "Thank you".

441
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:08,856
She asked what you're thinking.

442
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,694
I was just looking at her room.

443
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:20,282
Kai described the room to me.
I was just remembering what he said.

444
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:31,210
Is that Kai?

445
00:41:42,604 --> 00:41:44,597
He was four or five years old.

446
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,911
She thinks he looks really sweet.

447
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:04,532
This is for you.

448
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:08,668
It's Kai's ashes.

449
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:17,047
You should have his ashes.

450
00:42:17,262 --> 00:42:20,928
I'm sorry that I...
fought over them with you.

451
00:42:29,106 --> 00:42:31,480
He was my best friend.

452
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:41,401
She knows. He talked about you.

453
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:44,199
Did he tell you about me?
Don't say that.

454
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:51,790
He loved you very much.

455
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,170
He was always trying to find
ways to make your life better.

456
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:09,846
Why did he put me in here?

457
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:12,102
It was only meant to be temporary.

458
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:19,152
Really he wanted
you to live with him.

459
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:30,116
I know.

460
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,324
Then you got in the way.

461
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:37,494
What does she mean?
Is that what Kai told her?

462
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,012
He wanted us to live together,

463
00:43:49,223 --> 00:43:50,885
but there was no space in your flat.

464
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:57,101
One of the options,
actually, was to... to move to another flat

465
00:43:58,816 --> 00:44:00,810
and have you live with us.

466
00:44:05,656 --> 00:44:07,400
Don't say that.

467
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:10,982
Do you like... living here?

468
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,826
That's a silly question.

469
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:00,036
What's happening?

470
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:02,242
What did you... What did you say?

471
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:06,963
I suggested you could look after her,
that you're practically family

472
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,415
and that you care a great
deal for her well being.

473
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:12,553
She got angry because I said
that you were a good man

474
00:45:12,594 --> 00:45:14,887
and she didn't know what that meant.

475
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:18,621
She doesn't think you two
living together is the answer.

476
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,260
What the fuck? Why did you do that?

477
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:23,387
It was going very well.

478
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:26,309
I'm sorry.
I was trying to help.

479
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,936
Well, good work!

480
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,902
You said you wanted
to give it a trial.

481
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:33,926
Don't you think I should be
part of the conversation?

482
00:45:34,073 --> 00:45:37,074
Of course. It just happened.

483
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:39,277
It got out of control.

484
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:42,655
I'm sorry.

485
00:45:48,419 --> 00:45:50,413
Junn?

486
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,874
Is that your husband?

487
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:56,084
Ask her.

488
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:05,133
Yeah.Is her husband white?

489
00:46:05,352 --> 00:46:08,270
He's half French.
Cambodian-Chinese French.

490
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:12,267
When was it taken?

491
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:20,066
In Phnom Penh, 1962.

492
00:46:21,034 --> 00:46:22,196
Have you never been back?

493
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:26,576
No.

494
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,233
We should go. This isn't gonna work.

495
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:36,505
Can you please say
to her that I'm sorry?

496
00:46:36,715 --> 00:46:38,123
I didn't mean to upset her.

497
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,724
You're... You're doing it...

498
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:58,272
What are you doing?

499
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,357
Stop hounding me.
She thinks we're together.

500
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:03,067
Well, did you tell her that we're not?

501
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:05,524
- I told her you're gay.
- Vann...

502
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:10,154
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

503
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:40,103
Oh, this is what I brought.

504
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:44,758
- I have those.
- Well, I didn't know, did I?

505
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,779
It's actually really hard to, you know,

506
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,984
cook in someone else's kitchen.

507
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,198
Check you out.

508
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:55,278
Listen, when you learn to cook as
good as me, then you'll understand.

509
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,326
So, what's for dinner tonight?

510
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,578
I thought we could start off
with coriander king prawns

511
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,149
scented with Longjing tea.

512
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:05,048
Fancy. Followed by?

513
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:08,708
Ginger pork stir-fry
with a sesame dressing,Richard-style.

514
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,671
Nice. And dessert?

515
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,928
- Crème brûlée.
- From a tub?

516
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:16,737
Organic, fair trade, free range.

517
00:48:16,776 --> 00:48:19,149
Wow. Can't wait.

518
00:48:20,146 --> 00:48:23,231
- They had their first row yesterday.
- What happened?

519
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:27,024
Oh, the usual.Stubbornness.
Men.

520
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:32,115
What did Junn do?

521
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:36,108
Alan pointed out a contradiction
in something Junn had said

522
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:39,164
and then she got all defensive
and started to criticise him,

523
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:41,927
finding inconsistencies in him.

524
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:45,582
That's so petty.
I would never do something like that.

525
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:48,666
I'm not sure how it
escalated so quickly.

526
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:51,592
She said he touches her too much.

527
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:56,259
It's not funny. Alan was
really embarrassed.

528
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,558
And my presence just
made it worse for him.

529
00:48:59,597 --> 00:49:02,433
Come on! You're doing
such a great job.

530
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:13,061
That was really tasty.

531
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:19,526
To us.

532
00:49:24,873 --> 00:49:29,251
- What are we having for mains?
- Pork, stir-fried pork.

533
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:48,762
Thank you.

534
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:56,983
It's so romantic. Nice food.

535
00:49:57,445 --> 00:49:58,360
Thank you.

536
00:49:58,572 --> 00:50:03,448
It don't feel very romantic at the moment.
I feel watched.

537
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:04,713
Do you mind leaving us?

538
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,682
But you need me to translate.

539
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:08,549
No, we can do without.

540
00:50:09,165 --> 00:50:10,329
Can you leave?

541
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:13,858
Having you watch me eat
feels uncomfortable.

542
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:25,587
How are they gonna
understand each other now?

543
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,049
They need me.

544
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:31,261
What are they saying?

545
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:34,768
I think Alan's saying,

546
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:39,397
"Petal,I've got a raging hard-on

547
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:42,019
"and only you, pumpkin,
can sort it out."

548
00:50:43,531 --> 00:50:46,485
"Oh, Alan, can I see it?"

549
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:49,619
"If you behave yourself you
can have it for dessert."

550
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:59,126
You've made a lot of effort tonight.
Thank you.

551
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:04,751
You know...

552
00:51:07,094 --> 00:51:10,381
if I were younger,I'd have ripped your clothes off

553
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:14,015
 and taken you here, right on this table.

554
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:19,477
You look very handsome.

555
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:23,353
Gawd knows how many slipped
discs I'm gonna get.

556
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:28,403
- Shall I clear the table?
- Did... Did you hear all of that?

557
00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:32,694
You shouldn't creep
up on people. It's rude.

558
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:34,988
I didn't hear anything, Alan.

559
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:37,661
Yes, you may clear the table.

560
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:40,897
- Did you have a nice meal?
- Yeah, until you arrived.

561
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:42,245
- Easy, now.
- Have you got it?

562
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:43,873
- Got what?
- You know.

563
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:45,998
What?

564
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:51,962
I can't pass it to you. She'll see.

565
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:54,681
Oh, look.

566
00:51:57,392 --> 00:51:58,184
What is it?

567
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:01,103
My mistake. I thought I saw a bat.

568
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:07,148
- Did you just translate that?
- Yes.

569
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,314
Well, clearly there isn't a bat.

570
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,325
- You shouldn't take that, you know.
- Shush.

571
00:52:15,534 --> 00:52:17,907
Stop whispering.
She can't understand us.

572
00:52:19,122 --> 00:52:21,660
Here, there's only
half a tablet in here.

573
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:24,911
You shouldn't be taking any of it.
It could kill you at your age.

574
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:26,788
Well, it's only in case, you know...

575
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:29,819
In case what?
You can't get a Mount Fuji?

576
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:35,679
She's Cambodian-Chinese.
Now go and get us some coffee.

577
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,598
I'm dead serious.
Maybe take a quarter of it.

578
00:52:39,015 --> 00:52:39,953
What are you two saying?

579
00:52:41,684 --> 00:52:43,345
Do you two need a taxi?

580
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:45,896
Yes, is it time for us to leave?

581
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:48,439
It's getting late.
You should be going home.

582
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,807
Thank Richard.
His cooking was very good.

583
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:57,198
OK, time to go. I need to sleep.
I'm shattered.

584
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,492
Junn said your cooking was fantastic.

585
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:02,162
I'm glad she enjoyed it.

586
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,779
Maybe she'd like to come
over for supper one night.

587
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,267
Your date's here.

588
00:53:32,482 --> 00:53:34,142
Hi, Junn.

589
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:36,352
- Hi.
- Hello.

590
00:53:45,244 --> 00:53:48,111
She said dinner the other
night was really lovely.

591
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:51,242
You helped too, and, er, Richard.

592
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:07,223
She thinks you should get to
know each other's bad habits.

593
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:10,265
Really? OK.

594
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:18,478
She'd like you to stop
pinching her bum.

595
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:22,275
What?
I don't pinch her bum.

596
00:54:29,202 --> 00:54:32,369
- She says you do it all the time.
- Only gentle squeezes.

597
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,373
Anyway, she started it.

598
00:54:34,582 --> 00:54:37,288
I only do it because I...
I thought she liked it.

599
00:54:44,592 --> 00:54:46,052
She doesn't like it anymore.

600
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,511
Her bum isn't some fruit you
can squeeze whenever you want.

601
00:54:57,062 --> 00:54:58,604
- Now it's your turn.
- What?

602
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:05,059
Are there any habits you
don't like about Junn?

603
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:08,944
Yes, her breath smells.
It stinks of garlic.

604
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:17,237
How could it never bothered you before.

605
00:55:17,277 --> 00:55:20,527
It did, but... I had no way of telling her.

606
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:27,377
It's good for the heart.

607
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,299
Well, it may be good for the heart,

608
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,752
but it definitely ain't
good for kissing.

609
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,879
It tastes of rotten cheese.

610
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,174
Actually, it's worse
than rotten cheese.

611
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:49,507
Your whole body smells of urine.

612
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,652
What? Why didn't she
mention it before?

613
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:02,623
She tells you every day.
You just don't listen.

614
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:13,500
What's going on now?

615
00:56:15,261 --> 00:56:16,928
She doesn't want to do this anymore.

616
00:56:17,012 --> 00:56:19,462
She's gonna wash her mouth
and you should take a bath.

617
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:44,946
That was supposed to
encourage more hair to grow.

618
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:48,782
You'd have one hairy nipple.
That'd look very weird.

619
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:53,494
I wanna take my mum out the home.

620
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,793
How did it go yesterday?

621
00:57:01,012 --> 00:57:03,006
I tried telling her.

622
00:57:04,974 --> 00:57:08,095
But I couldn't. I bottled out.

623
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,680
My heart was pounding so fast.

624
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:14,225
But you were gonna tell her.

625
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:17,313
She blamed you for
making me take the bus.

626
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:20,102
Well, it's not like she needs
another excuse, is it?

627
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:26,573
I wanna... I'm gonna bring her
back here and tell her.

628
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:34,784
If she gets mad, she can't storm off.
She'll be stuck with me.

629
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:39,955
It will force us to deal with it.

630
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:42,167
Really?

631
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:45,879
You're really gonna do that?

632
00:57:47,056 --> 00:57:49,049
I've done it already.

633
00:57:52,227 --> 00:57:54,719
She's coming round tomorrow tonight.

634
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:02,186
Can... Can you go out for a walk?

635
00:58:03,738 --> 00:58:05,280
I'll call when it's finished.

636
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:12,152
You want me to walk laps around the block
while you come out to your mum?

637
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,537
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yeah.

638
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,536
It'll be romantic.

639
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:19,911
I am fucking romantic.

640
00:58:27,426 --> 00:58:29,421
What if she's not OK?

641
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:32,757
Then you stay in a hotel.

642
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:35,466
- Fucking hell.
- She has nowhere else to stay.

643
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:40,562
It will be OK, won't it?

644
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:44,939
Of course.

645
00:58:46,278 --> 00:58:48,271
You two are so alike.

646
00:58:54,285 --> 00:58:56,279
Feel this.

647
00:58:58,832 --> 00:59:00,492
I'm shaking.

648
00:59:03,795 --> 00:59:05,788
I might self-combust.

649
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:09,377
Just do it.

650
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:15,047
- Don't think any more about it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. Absolutely.

651
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:31,233
Smell my armpit again.
I miss it when you do that.

652
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,554
Sorry. Hello. Come in, come in.

653
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:06,929
Hi, Junn.

654
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,602
Come through.

655
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,433
I'd completely forgotten about today.

656
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,323
Right, who wants tea?

657
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:21,989
Yeah. she'd love a tea.

658
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,870
Can you come to the kitchen with me?

659
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:25,321
Sure.

660
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,822
Tell her to make herself comfortable.
We'll be back in a moment.

661
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,958
There's some stuff I need
to clear up upstairs.

662
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:43,232
I'm gonna go and do it now.
Can you tidy the kitchen?

663
01:00:43,263 --> 01:00:45,453
You want me to clean your kitchen?

664
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:46,640
Yeah. Can you?

665
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:49,597
- Are you serious?
- I'm deadly serious. I'm sorry.

666
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:52,433
I'll make it up to you.
Please, help me.

667
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:54,641
- You owe me so much.
- Thank you.

668
01:02:03,506 --> 01:02:04,751
Ah, you have tea.

669
01:02:05,549 --> 01:02:07,459
- Would you like some?
- I'd love some.

670
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,889
What do you think of the place?

671
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:21,769
It's nice. She's been here before.

672
01:02:23,733 --> 01:02:27,150
Of course you have. I forgot.

673
01:02:31,156 --> 01:02:34,277
- She'd like to see Kai's room.
- Sure.

674
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,369
This is Kai's room.

675
01:03:06,357 --> 01:03:08,350
I just moved in here recently.

676
01:03:10,986 --> 01:03:14,270
This room's bigger and I
needed a bit more space.

677
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,494
She said you moved in here quick.

678
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:39,380
She'd like some time alone.

679
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:42,723
Absolutely.

680
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:14,222
There's this song that
Junn really adores.

681
01:05:14,936 --> 01:05:17,393
Kai said she never gets
tired of listening to it.

682
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:22,228
He was... He was supposed to take it to her,

683
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:24,436
but he kept forgetting.

684
01:05:25,446 --> 01:05:31,446
Actually, he had it on him when...
when he went to see her.

685
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:38,583
Anyway, I want to...
I want to find that CD.

686
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:42,459
What's the song called?
And who's the singer?

687
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:46,209
And why are you whispering?

688
01:05:46,424 --> 01:05:48,770
I have no idea why I'm whispering.

689
01:05:51,888 --> 01:05:53,928
It's a really famous song.
It's a cover.

690
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:57,018
OK, well, hum it.
I might recognise it.

691
01:05:57,518 --> 01:06:00,390
- I don't hum.
- Go on, there's no one listening.

692
01:06:00,604 --> 01:06:03,096
- No.
- I'll ask Junn about it, then.

693
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:06,898
Don't ask Junn about it.
I want it to be a surprise.

694
01:06:35,053 --> 01:06:37,921
We'll go to a music shop in Chinatown.

695
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,265
I'll recognise it when I see the cover.

696
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:41,551
We can ask for a greatest hits album.

697
01:06:41,768 --> 01:06:45,000
- I'm sure the song will be on it.
- I can't remember her name.

698
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,033
Well, whistle it, then.

699
01:06:54,404 --> 01:06:57,608
- I told you.
- Oh, my God, can't even whistle!

700
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,077
Hey, Junn.

701
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:10,085
I'm just making a bacon sandwich.
Would you like one?

702
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:17,084
No, thanks.

703
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,932
She noticed you're frying
the bacon with chopsticks.

704
01:07:24,183 --> 01:07:25,642
She thinks it's lovely.

705
01:07:26,477 --> 01:07:28,885
Yeah. How else do you fry bacon?

706
01:07:29,104 --> 01:07:32,356
I mean...
Impossible without chopsticks.

707
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:41,084
How did you do it before?

708
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,444
I can't remember.

709
01:07:46,078 --> 01:07:49,531
These... These seem perfect for it.

710
01:08:05,055 --> 01:08:06,964
She said you have a nice home.

711
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,181
Thank you.

712
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,021
Half... well... most of it was Kai...

713
01:08:17,441 --> 01:08:19,850
Most of it was Kai's idea.

714
01:08:33,456 --> 01:08:35,450
She said...

715
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:39,108
She said she can still
smell Kai in your room.

716
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:53,301
Me too.

717
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:56,261
I smell him too.

718
01:09:55,993 --> 01:09:59,160
I think this is the song that
you asked Kai to bring you.

719
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:24,426
She's been waiting for
this CD for so long.

720
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:29,893
Kai kept promising that he'd bring it
and he kept on forgetting.

721
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:33,268
Thank you.

722
01:10:44,455 --> 01:10:46,801
She no longer wants to see Alan.

723
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:48,494
You're joking?

724
01:10:50,419 --> 01:10:52,543
I thought you were
getting along fine.

725
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:07,237
She said they're very
different people.

726
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:09,392
Well, that's no surprise.

727
01:11:12,106 --> 01:11:15,558
The differences they've
encountered are too rooted.

728
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,521
Root... What? Rooted in what?

729
01:11:20,448 --> 01:11:25,785
Ask her, please, to speak to Alan again
and give him a second chance.

730
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:35,829
He is simply who he is.
I am who I am.

731
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:37,543
What does that mean?

732
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:44,336
She can't see herself spending
the rest of her life with him.

733
01:11:44,553 --> 01:11:48,173
She's doing this to punish me.
That's what this is, isn't it?

734
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,964
- Richard.
- Say it.

735
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:58,894
Why are you doing this?

736
01:11:59,109 --> 01:12:00,777
I'm here to help you.

737
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:03,665
Do you want to live the
rest of your life here?

738
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:16,040
You don't need to feel sorry for me,
for her.

739
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,371
- She doesn't need your help.
- You are so damn stubborn.

740
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,129
I'm trying to help you.

741
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:23,984
You're making me feel
like it's my fault.

742
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,218
- What are your true intentions?
- To help you.

743
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:36,467
- Why are you doing this?
- Stop asking that dumb question!

744
01:12:36,506 --> 01:12:37,753
Doing what?

745
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:42,692
You've taken away
my only... her only...

746
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,143
Me, her, my? Which is it?
Come on, Vann!

747
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,570
You can't even separate
between you and her.

748
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:48,687
Whose side are you on?

749
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:55,280
You've taken away her only family
and now she's stuck in this awful place.

750
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:00,286
If you hadn't been
so dependent on Kai,

751
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,732
he would never have put you in here.

752
01:13:03,772 --> 01:13:06,337
What were you doing?
You were piling on pressure.

753
01:13:06,797 --> 01:13:09,170
What fucking differences
can't you work out with Alan?

754
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:34,573
This is your guilt. She doesn't
want to be your therapist.

755
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:41,570
I'm trying to help you.

756
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,018
I'm trying to help you get
out of this awful place.

757
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:51,339
Alan is an old man.
You will break his heart.

758
01:13:57,471 --> 01:14:00,140
If you had adapted to this culture,

759
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:03,476
Kai wouldn't have had to look
after every facet of your life.

760
01:14:03,516 --> 01:14:08,143
Honestly, your medication,
your bank details, everything.

761
01:14:08,523 --> 01:14:10,682
You choked him with guilt.

762
01:14:11,526 --> 01:14:14,480
And who's looking after you now?
Kai? No, it's me.

763
01:14:14,945 --> 01:14:16,321
I wonder why that is?

764
01:14:34,589 --> 01:14:37,709
That's it, run away.
That's the solution, isn't it?

765
01:14:43,222 --> 01:14:44,503
I'm sorry.

766
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:47,298
I just fucked it up.

767
01:14:47,476 --> 01:14:50,597
Her one chance of happiness
and I fucking screwed that up.

768
01:14:51,647 --> 01:14:53,106
Fuck!

769
01:14:53,815 --> 01:14:56,272
I just fucking screwed
everything up again.

770
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:29,883
These are all of Kai's things.

771
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:38,642
I've probably forgotten something but...
if I come across anything, I'll send it on to you.

772
01:15:49,034 --> 01:15:51,027
How are things between her and Alan?

773
01:15:56,499 --> 01:15:57,994
She hasn't seen him.

774
01:16:10,638 --> 01:16:16,551
It never bothered me...
that she couldn't assimilate into this culture.

775
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:25,686
It bothered Kai.

776
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,707
Kai was gay.

777
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,540
I'm his boyfriend.

778
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,532
We'd been together
for over four years.

779
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,157
And he was going to tell you
the last time that you saw him.

780
01:17:12,748 --> 01:17:15,035
But he got so panicked,
he couldn't do it.

781
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:20,076
He was afraid that
you'd love him less.

782
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:23,038
Stupid.

783
01:17:24,705 --> 01:17:28,914
So he invited you over
for dinner the next day

784
01:17:29,122 --> 01:17:34,446
and he told me to walk round the
block while he came out to you.

785
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:42,205
And on his way to get the bus,
he got hit by that fucking cunt of a driver.

786
01:17:56,995 --> 01:18:01,036
It's pathetic for a mother

787
01:18:03,286 --> 01:18:06,238
to fight for her own son's attention.

788
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:12,033
I felt so jealous of you.

789
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:16,233
I can't help but wonder...

790
01:18:17,243 --> 01:18:19,697
what would have happened
if I had driven him.

791
01:18:21,826 --> 01:18:25,406
Cos he...
I offered but he liked to take the bus.

792
01:18:31,951 --> 01:18:34,238
I know you miss him.

793
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:37,567
I don't know what to do.

794
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,691
I miss him tremendously.

795
01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:54,772
I didn't strangle Kai with guilt.

796
01:18:56,157 --> 01:18:59,938
It was always there.

797
01:19:02,448 --> 01:19:07,320
You will feel it as your parents age

798
01:19:08,573 --> 01:19:12,650
and also will your children when you age.

799
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,280
These memories are all I have,
I need to keep them vivid

800
01:19:29,654 --> 01:19:34,988
or they'll fade,
like the face of my husband.

801
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:45,737
Like any mother,
I wanted Kai to be with me.

802
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:55,563
I want to dwell on these memories

803
01:19:56,236 --> 01:19:59,567
and cry over them because they
comfort me.

804
01:20:04,735 --> 01:20:06,691
Let me tell you something.

805
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,559
Through plenty of crying,
I've learnt to be content

806
01:20:12,151 --> 01:20:14,190
that I won't always be happy,

807
01:20:15,317 --> 01:20:21,317
secure in my loneliness,
hopeful that I will be able to cope.

808
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:34,150
Every year on Christmas Day
I get very lonely.

809
01:20:39,316 --> 01:20:42,019
An incredible feeling of solitude.

810
01:20:46,732 --> 01:20:51,853
On this day, everything has stood still,

811
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:58,772
even the trees have stopped rustling,

812
01:21:02,064 --> 01:21:05,644
but I'm still moving, I want to move,

813
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:13,439
but I have nothing to move to,
and nowhere to og.

814
01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:26,352
The scars beneath my skin
suddenly surface and I get scared.

815
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:29,853
Scared of being alone.

816
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:42,143
But you know

817
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:47,550
tomorrow is another day.

818
01:21:50,102 --> 01:21:53,634
I will carry on with my life.

819
01:22:15,225 --> 01:22:16,007
What's wrong?

820
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:23,966
Would you like to come for
dinner tomorrow?

821
01:22:25,267 --> 01:22:26,890
Yes, absolutely.

822
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:30,841
Could you cook?

823
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,340
Sure.

824
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:07,741
