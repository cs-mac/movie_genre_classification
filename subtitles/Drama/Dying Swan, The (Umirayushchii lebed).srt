Black Swan (2010) DVDrip 480p x264 - RebourneD
Sub by Jiboy Kitsune

2
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,536
I had the craziest dream last night.

3
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,686
I was dancing the White Swan.

4
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:24,650
It was different choreography, though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

5
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:30,291
It was the prologue,

6
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:33,113
when Rothbart casts his spell.

7
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,538
Look how pink. So pretty...

8
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:48,337
Pretty!

9
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:52,397
- You're in a good mood.
- He promised to feature me more this season.

10
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,610
Well, he certainly should.

11
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:56,539
You've been there long enough,

12
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:59,424
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

13
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,791
Up.

14
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,660
- What's that?
- What?

15
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:08,859
There.

16
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:13,305
Nothing.

17
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,227
You're sure you don't want me
to come with you?

18
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,418
You're a sweet girl.

19
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:38,673
Did you see Beth today?

20
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,947
I can't believe she's back.

21
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:44,330
- Of course she's back.
- What, she can't take a hint?

22
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:47,568
The company is broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.

23
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:50,255
Oh, nobody actually comes
to see ballet full stop.

24
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,672
That's not true. I heard The Royal
had one of their best seasons yet.

25
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:55,623
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

26
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,325
No, someone new.

27
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:02,496
- Like who?
- Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

28
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:03,964
It's sad.

29
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,631
What's sad?

30
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:11,865
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

31
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,436
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

32
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,979
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties.
- Yeah, we know.

33
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:25,405
Great.

34
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,932
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

35
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,387
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

36
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,686
Beautiful as always, Nina.

37
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,953
Relax.

38
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:33,570
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

39
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:42,094
Stop, John.
One second.

40
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,881
Okay, take position.

41
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,867
And one, and two,
and three, and up.

42
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:02,326
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

43
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,631
Hello, dear.

44
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,305
We all know the story.

45
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,050
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

46
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,720
trapped in the body of a swan.

47
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:34,228
She desires freedom

48
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,201
that only true love can break the spell.

49
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:45,544
Her wish is nearly granted
in the form of a Prince.

50
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,748
But before he can declare his love,

51
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:55,863
The lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him.

52
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:05,742
Devastated,
the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

53
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:10,706
killing herself.
And in death...

54
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,533
finds freedom.

55
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,119
- Good morning, company.
- Good morning.

56
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:26,407
<i>We will open our season
with Swan Lake.</i>

57
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,636
Done to death, I know.

58
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:30,236
But not like this.

59
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:35,134
We strip it down,
make it visceral and real.

60
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:40,025
A new production
needs a new Swan Queen.

61
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,774
A fresh face to present to the world.

62
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,009
But... Which of you
can embody both Swans?

63
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:54,377
The White, and the Black.

64
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:03,399
All the soloists I tapped:

65
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:06,503
Go to your scheduled rehearsals
this afternoon.

66
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,118
And the girls I didn't tap:

67
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,428
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

68
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:16,904
Thank you.

69
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,193
All right.

70
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:24,898
- Let's go. Did we do left side?
- Yes, mistress.

71
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:03,012
Fuck! Fuck!

72
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:09,716
What?

73
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:53,424
If I was only casting the White Swan,
she'd be yours.

74
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:56,446
But I'm not.

75
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:59,222
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

76
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:00,999
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

77
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:27,627
Not so controlled.
Seduce us.

78
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:30,932
Not just the Prince, but the court,
the audience, the entire world.

79
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:34,123
Come on,
like a spider spinning a web.

80
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:36,614
Attack it, attack it!
Come on!

81
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:48,720
Well...

82
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,045
- Good of you to join us.
- Sorry...

83
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,930
Girls, this is Lily.

84
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,539
Straight off the plane from San Francisco.
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

85
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,232
- Hey.
- Get warmed up.

86
00:13:58,267 --> 00:13:59,116
No, it's okay.

87
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,323
I'm good.

88
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:03,685
Should I go again?

89
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:06,604
No, thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

90
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:12,201
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

91
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:17,090
Come on, come on, come on, please.

92
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,016
All right, Maestro.

93
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,750
Two, three...

94
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,005
So how'd it go?

95
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,000
You were late, so I called
Susie in the office.

96
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:37,178
An audition! I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

97
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,386
So?

98
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,213
It was fine.

99
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,195
Just fine?

100
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,837
Oh, sweetheart...

101
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,669
You tell me about it.

102
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,118
Nina, everything all right?

103
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,159
I'm fine.

104
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:02,780
Almost done.

105
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,987
You're working yourself too hard.

106
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:10,592
- We all have off days.
- That girl, um, barged in.

107
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,465
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

108
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,710
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of
your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

109
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:23,219
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
I'm going to tell him I finished it.

110
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:24,680
You don't need to lie.

111
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,450
You won't convince him
one way or the other.

112
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:32,334
Oh, sweetheart.

113
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,032
I know it's disappointing.

114
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,710
When you start getting older,
there's all this

115
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:43,477
ridiculous pressure.
God knows I understand.

116
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:46,594
But it's all right.

117
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,515
No matter what.

118
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,223
You'll probably get to dance
the part of the cat again.

119
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,605
That's such a wonderful part.

120
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,350
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

121
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:04,318
Either way, you'll shine.

122
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:06,988
You know...

123
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:09,803
Everything will be better
in the morning.

124
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:14,097
It always is.

125
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,508
Sweet girl.

126
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:45,468
Yes, Nina?

127
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:46,783
Do you have a minute?

128
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:52,783
- Now's not a good time. I get it.
- Now is perfect.

129
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,715
So...

130
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,714
I just wanted to tell you that

131
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,637
I practiced the coda last night and

132
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:06,520
I finished.

133
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:12,848
I thought you should know.

134
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:16,693
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

135
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:19,679
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday...

136
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:20,849
No.
Anyway...

137
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,297
I've already chosen Veronica.
Sorry.

138
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:26,066
Sorry.

139
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,148
Okay, thank you.

140
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,053
That's it?

141
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,574
You're not going to
try and change my mind?

142
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,976
You must have thought
it was possible.

143
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,270
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

144
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:45,470
I came to ask for the part.

145
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:50,938
Well...

146
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,905
The truth is...

147
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,842
When I look at you,
all I see is the White Swan.

148
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:02,081
Yes, you're beautiful,
fearful, fragile.

149
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:03,899
Ideal casting.

150
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:09,258
But the Black Swan?
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

151
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,952
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

152
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,090
Really?

153
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,181
In four years,
every time you dance,

154
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:21,064
I see obsess getting each and every move
perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

155
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,186
Ever.
All that discipline for what?

156
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,623
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

157
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,439
I want to be perfect.

158
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,591
Perfection is not just about control.

159
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:42,216
It's also about letting go.

160
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:46,881
Surprise yourself so you can
surprise the audience. Transcendence.

161
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,128
And very few have it in them.

162
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:51,744
I think I do have it in me.

163
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:00,582
You bit me?

164
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,684
I can't believe you bit me!

165
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,290
I'm sorry.

166
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,501
Man, that fucking hurt!

167
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:25,115
What?

168
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,324
Why's she always staring at me?

169
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,685
Hey, it's been posted.

170
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,279
Hey, it's up!

171
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,031
Veronica.

172
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,070
Congratulations.

173
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:00,539
Hey!

174
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:02,771
Why would you say that?

175
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:05,976
Your idea of some sick joke?

176
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:07,376
What?

177
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:09,843
Fuck you.

178
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:24,811
Hey, Nina!

179
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:26,279
Congratulations!

180
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,051
Congratulations.

181
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,515
You're so beautiful.

182
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,501
Congratulations.

183
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:57,052
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

184
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:59,030
<i>What is it?
What's wrong?</i>

185
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:00,636
I'm fine.

186
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:04,177
He picked me, Mom.

187
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,510
Do you hear me?

188
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:11,398
<i>- For Swan Lake?
- I'm going to be Swan Queen!</i>

189
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:14,859
Mom!

190
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,326
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

191
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,428
<i>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

192
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:55,292
Mom?

193
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:00,030
Mom, are you in your room?

194
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,661
Nina?

195
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:36,132
Are you home?

196
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:50,424
Nina, when you get out
I'm in the kitchen.

197
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:53,868
Come on, sweetie.

198
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,600
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

199
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:08,575
It's our favorite.
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

200
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,169
Oh, Mom, not too big.

201
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,144
Oh, that's way, way too much.

202
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,266
- It's a celebration. It's just this once.
- Mom...

203
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,766
My stomach's still in knots.

204
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:20,241
Fine.

205
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:22,102
Fine.

206
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:23,385
Then it's garbage!

207
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,637
No, Mom, don't.
I'm sorry.

208
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:37,109
I'm just...
I'm just so proud of you.

209
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,879
It looks so yummy.

210
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,257
Okay, okay.

211
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,762
Thank you.
Thank you.

212
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:56,848
Thank you, Nina.

213
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:58,634
That's very nice.

214
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:00,817
Very nice.

215
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:05,624
But I knew the White Swan
wouldn't be a problem.

216
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,354
The real work will your
metamorphosis into her evil twin.

217
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:13,130
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

218
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,440
So get ready to give me
more of that bite.

219
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:39,762
Excellent.

220
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:45,788
That evil force is pulling you that you
can't escape. That's just out of your control.

221
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:51,444
So you sense it, you get aware of it more:
"It's taking me, it's taking me."

222
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:54,144
A little bit more desperate.

223
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:58,921
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit
and then come down, and then...

224
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,219
That's it.

225
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,569
Watch the way she moves.

226
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:41,909
Imprecise,
but effortless.

227
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,414
She's not faking it.

228
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:54,535
Gorgeous!
Okay, that's beautiful.

229
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,415
Let's start again from the beginning.

230
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:08,333
You'll room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

231
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:09,702
Thanks, Susie.

232
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:12,156
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

233
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:14,136
They're beautiful.

234
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,439
I'll be back in a second.

235
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:37,795
Let me come back to you, please.

236
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:42,144
Let's go.

237
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:49,397
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

238
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:53,058
We need our cash,
so please don't forget to smile.

239
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:57,416
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

240
00:29:59,412 --> 00:29:59,969
Good evening.

241
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,849
Let me make this
very important announcement.

242
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:09,114
You all had had the chance and
the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

243
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,914
and even sometimes devastated,
by the performances

244
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:13,948
of this true artist of our company.

245
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:16,968
She's been a crucial
inspiration to my work.

246
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:20,786
A role model to all dancers,
and even more than that,

247
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:23,808
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

248
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,935
You all know who I am talking about.

249
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,278
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

250
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:35,723
But as we all know,

251
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:38,137
every great career
has to come to an end.

252
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:43,026
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

253
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,363
She will be giving her
farewell performance as Melpomene,

254
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:49,921
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

255
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:53,977
My little princess,

256
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:57,281
we honor you.
You will be greatly missed,

257
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,373
and never forgotten.

258
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:04,470
<i>But as we bid adieu to one star,
we welcome another.</i>

259
00:31:05,502 --> 00:31:08,492
<i>We're opening our season
with my new version of Swan Lake.</i>

260
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:13,500
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,
the exquisite Nina Sayers.

261
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:21,875
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her perform,

262
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:29,369
but right now, let's please raise a glass:
To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

263
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:32,487
To beauty.

264
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:51,324
Just a second.

265
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,525
Just a second!

266
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,675
Come on!
I'm about to burst!

267
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,993
Hey, it's you!

268
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:35,604
I don't think we ever
officially met.

269
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:38,291
- I'm Lily.
- Hi, I'm Nina.

270
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:40,511
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

271
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:42,109
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah, sure.

272
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:47,219
You must be so excited.

273
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,668
Are you freaking out?

274
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:51,740
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

275
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:54,814
Oh, it's okay.

276
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:56,681
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

277
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:58,940
I should get back...

278
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,679
No, no, no, come on, stay.

279
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,505
Keep me company.

280
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,003
Excuse me.

281
00:33:09,595 --> 00:33:10,390
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

282
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,074
Hey. They tried to eat you alive,
but here you are.

283
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:21,386
You did well.

284
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:22,790
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:33:24,077 --> 00:33:24,879
Where are you going?

286
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:27,233
Upper west side.

287
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:29,041
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

288
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:32,838
Thomas, you need to say hello
to Karen Holloway.

289
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,280
A minute more of ass-kissing.
I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

290
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,315
Hello, Karen!

291
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:24,489
Beth!

292
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:28,420
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

293
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,279
What did you do to get this role?

294
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:38,314
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

295
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:42,464
What did you do to make
him change his mind?

296
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:46,623
Did you suck his cock?

297
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,389
Not all of us have to.

298
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:52,567
You fucking whore!

299
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:55,969
You're a fucking little whore!

300
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,415
Whoa, what's going on here?

301
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,580
Hey, I need to talk to you.

302
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,748
- You're drunk. You should go home.
- I need to talk to you.

303
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:06,466
No! Don't you do that!
Don't you dismiss me like that!

304
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:11,648
My little princess, please.
Pull it together.

305
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:15,057
- Come.
- I'm coming by later.

306
00:35:15,092 --> 00:35:19,768
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

307
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,530
- Right.
- You make the most of it, Nina.

308
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,092
Don't worry. It's typical.

309
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:33,893
Please. I thought it'd be good
to talk about the role.

310
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:35,234
Drown this a little.

311
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:37,518
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

312
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,601
- No, me neither.
- Good.

313
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:44,003
So...
You got a boyfriend?

314
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,245
No.

315
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:50,127
Have you had many in the past?

316
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:52,198
A few.

317
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,883
But no one serious.

318
00:35:58,743 --> 00:35:59,744
You're not a virgin are you?

319
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:03,946
No.

320
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:06,193
So there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

321
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,439
And you enjoy making love?

322
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:15,793
Excuse me?

323
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:17,979
Come on, sex.

324
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:19,411
Do you enjoy it?

325
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,268
We need to be able
to talk about this.

326
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,071
I've got a little homework
assignment for you.

327
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:38,563
Go home and touch yourself.

328
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:41,677
Live a little.

329
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:48,539
Well it's late.
Lots of work tomorrow.

330
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:51,470
The doorman will
find a cab for you.

331
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:58,845
Sounds like quite an evening.
I wish I could have been there.

332
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,415
You know I asked.

333
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,221
I know you did.
Susie told me.

334
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:05,130
Guess he wanted you
all to himself.

335
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,286
But why?

336
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:08,710
Don't blame him.

337
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,173
Where'd you get these?

338
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,032
They're fake.

339
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,852
Fooled me.

340
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:25,141
I can do it.

341
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,349
He must have been
by your side all night.

342
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:35,855
Showing you off.

343
00:37:38,107 --> 00:37:39,845
- Oh, Nina...
- It's just a rash.

344
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,043
Rash?
What are you talking about?

345
00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:43,655
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

346
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,818
- You've been scratching yourself again.
- No I haven't.

347
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:47,771
Mom!

348
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:49,247
This disgusting habit...

349
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,697
Jesus Christ, I thought
you were done with this, Nina.

350
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:55,440
Shrugs.
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

351
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,828
Sit down.
You have the white one,

352
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:58,888
and the pink one.
And that'll hide it.

353
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:03,625
And then I'll dig out that expensive
coverup. We still have some.

354
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,099
No one will see it.

355
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:07,741
Mom, please,

356
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:12,007
It's the role, isn't it?
It's all this pressure.

357
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,914
I knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

358
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,686
You're all right.

359
00:38:21,474 --> 00:38:22,056
You'll be all right.

360
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:27,312
Beth's in the hospital.

361
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:30,371
She had an accident.

362
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:32,073
Oh no!

363
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:32,547
Beth?

364
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:41,058
What happened?

365
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:45,397
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

366
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:48,644
You know what?

367
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,395
I'm almost sure
she did it on purpose.

368
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:54,918
How do you know?

369
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:59,937
Because everything Beth does comes
from within, from some dark impulse.

370
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:03,850
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

371
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,472
So dangerous.

372
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:09,904
Even perfect at times.

373
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,222
But also so damned destructive.

374
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:19,356
Was it right after we saw her?

375
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:23,270
Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

376
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:26,416
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

377
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:29,643
This is your moment, Nina.

378
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:32,225
Don't let it go.

379
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:02,858
What are you doing?

380
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:45,335
Nina?

381
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:49,092
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

382
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:02,668
And...
Come on!

383
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:05,197
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

384
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:07,027
Come on.

385
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:13,066
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

386
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:15,363
Let it go.
Let it go.

387
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:17,807
And again.

388
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:20,819
Feels like you have your diaphragm

389
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:23,571
is in a bit of a contraction?

390
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:24,729
I'm okay.

391
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:32,428
Breathe in to this hand.
Breathe in to this hand.

392
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,528
Breathe in, all the way.
Good.

393
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:37,237
And exhale.

394
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,969
<i>Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you plie?</i>

395
00:45:43,004 --> 00:45:44,773
Sometimes, not always.

396
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:49,725
- One more pull, okay?
- Okay.

397
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:56,201
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

398
00:46:16,973 --> 00:46:18,885
David,
can I ask you a question?

399
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,132
Honestly,
would you fuck that girl?

400
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:25,009
No.

401
00:46:25,044 --> 00:46:26,571
No one would.

402
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:28,757
Nina...

403
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:31,978
Your dancing is just as frigid...

404
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:34,396
Fuck!

405
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:41,359
We're still working here, please.
Lights!

406
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:42,808
The lights!

407
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:44,912
Thank you!

408
00:46:44,947 --> 00:46:48,547
Okay, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

409
00:46:50,303 --> 00:46:51,480
No, no, you stay.
You stay.

410
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:55,076
Have fun, you two.

411
00:46:59,010 --> 00:46:59,440
Okay.

412
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:00,750
Come here.

413
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:01,792
Come, come, come, come.

414
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:05,823
I'll be the Prince.

415
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:27,915
Let it go. Let it go.

416
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:50,607
Feel my touch.

417
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:51,782
Respond to it.

418
00:47:51,817 --> 00:47:53,070
Come on.

419
00:48:06,237 --> 00:48:08,562
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open up.

420
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:36,505
That was me seducing you,

421
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,231
when it needs to be
the other way around.

422
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,378
Please...

423
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:05,279
Who is that?

424
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:06,844
Hey.

425
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,302
You okay?

426
00:49:12,755 --> 00:49:13,973
You can't smoke in here.

427
00:49:14,008 --> 00:49:17,593
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

428
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:21,971
So...

429
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:24,841
The big day's getting closer
and closer, huh?

430
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:30,386
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're going to be amazing.

431
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:32,892
Thanks.

432
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,137
So...

433
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:51,779
Do  you want to talk about it?

434
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,586
It's that hard to.

435
00:49:57,972 --> 00:49:59,878
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

436
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,620
Come on, Nina.
He's a prick.

437
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:04,684
He's brilliant.

438
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,103
Sure, but it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

439
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,045
What you don't know is...

440
00:50:14,164 --> 00:50:16,166
Someone's hot for teacher!

441
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,287
Oh, come on, it's okay.
I don't blame you.

442
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:21,710
I should go home.

443
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:24,462
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

444
00:50:24,497 --> 00:50:27,046
Nina!

445
00:51:47,911 --> 00:51:51,175
Sweetie?
What are you doing in there?

446
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:19,951
Again.

447
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,258
Again.

448
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,831
Do you have any corrections?

449
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:14,994
Lily told me that
she saw you crying.

450
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:18,494
That you were very upset

451
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,432
and that I should
take it easy on you.

452
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,985
I didn't tell her that.

453
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,422
Maybe you need a little break.

454
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:27,327
A day or two. Or maybe a month.
What do you think?

455
00:53:27,362 --> 00:53:28,543
She shouldn't have said anything.

456
00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:30,702
No, you shouldn't be
whining in the first place.

457
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:31,486
I didn't.

458
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,333
You could be brilliant.

459
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:38,271
But you're a coward.

460
00:53:38,306 --> 00:53:40,608
Sorry.

461
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:43,105
No, stop saying that!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

462
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,657
Stop being so fucking weak.

463
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:46,087
Again!

464
00:53:59,515 --> 00:53:59,946
Lily...

465
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:03,060
Oh, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

466
00:54:03,095 --> 00:54:04,023
I need to talk to you.

467
00:54:04,058 --> 00:54:04,974
Okay.

468
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,468
Now.

469
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:08,334
Shut up.

470
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:09,585
Come on.

471
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,163
What's up?

472
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:16,810
You told Thomas about last night?

473
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:21,402
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and
he said you guys were having some trouble.

474
00:54:21,437 --> 00:54:22,527
Why would he talk to you?

475
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:25,222
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

476
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:29,112
I just told him you're working your ass off
and I think you'll be great.

477
00:54:29,147 --> 00:54:30,046
Well you shouldn't have.

478
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:34,921
Okay.

479
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,355
Has he tried anything with you?

480
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:15,535
He has a reputation.

481
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:22,704
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.
You've been staying late so many nights.

482
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,863
Rehearsing. I just hope
he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

483
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:28,303
He's not.

484
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,953
Good.

485
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,609
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

486
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:36,735
Thanks.

487
00:55:38,262 --> 00:55:38,942
Not like that.

488
00:55:40,265 --> 00:55:42,305
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

489
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,244
What career?

490
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,957
The one I gave up to have you.

491
00:55:51,272 --> 00:55:52,311
I'm twenty-eight.

492
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:53,737
So?

493
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:55,601
Only that...

494
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,660
Only what?

495
00:55:58,695 --> 00:56:00,324
Nothing.

496
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:01,593
- What?
- Nothing.

497
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:06,321
How is your skin?

498
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:08,434
Fine.

499
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,115
- Are you leaving it alone?
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:56:13,347 --> 00:56:13,907
Let me see.

501
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,405
- Take off your shirt.
- No.

502
00:56:33,732 --> 00:56:34,100
Can I help you?

503
00:56:38,674 --> 00:56:39,460
Who was that?

504
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:41,044
It was no one.

505
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:43,825
It was no one.

506
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,639
Hello?

507
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:55,157
What are you doing here?

508
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:57,145
I just came by to apologize.

509
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,379
You're right. I should have never
spoken to him about you.

510
00:56:59,414 --> 00:57:01,592
- Sweetheart.
- Give me a second.

511
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,287
- Your dinner...
- Mom, please.

512
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:06,851
Oh, she's a trip.

513
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:08,253
How do you know where I live?

514
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:10,783
I have my ways.

515
00:57:12,872 --> 00:57:15,201
Jesus, relax.
I got it from Susie in the office.

516
00:57:16,524 --> 00:57:19,779
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I really want to make it up to you.

517
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:22,057
So how about I take you out to dinner?

518
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:25,586
- I don't think...
- Okay, that's fine.

519
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:27,841
What about drinks?

520
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,516
Sweetie, you need to rest.

521
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:31,752
- Jesus.
- Wait.

522
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:34,429
What are you doing?

523
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:36,602
I'm going out.

524
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:38,176
What?
Nina!

525
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:40,880
You're on the stage tomorrow.

526
00:57:42,615 --> 00:57:44,104
I can't believe he calls her that.

527
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:46,728
- It's so gross.
- I think it's sweet.

528
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,582
Little Princess?

529
00:57:48,617 --> 00:57:51,056
- He probably calls every girl that.
- No way.

530
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,073
That's just for Beth.

531
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:57,719
Well, I bet he'll be calling you
Little Princess any day now.

532
00:57:57,754 --> 00:57:59,269
I don't know about that.

533
00:57:59,304 --> 00:58:02,537
Oh, sure he will.
Just got to let him lick your pussy.

534
00:58:04,198 --> 00:58:06,338
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

535
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:08,180
<i>Mmm, dankeschön.</i>

536
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:11,475
Let me know
if that's juicy enough for you.

537
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:13,318
Oh, I will.

538
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,076
You have enough cheese?

539
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:19,489
No, but you do.

540
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:22,881
Enjoy.

541
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:33,428
All right.

542
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,628
Wanna spruce up?

543
00:58:41,663 --> 00:58:44,771
What, I carry a spare

544
00:58:44,806 --> 00:58:48,035
in case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

545
00:58:52,048 --> 00:58:53,452
So how is he?

546
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:57,226
Thomas.

547
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:00,221
I wouldn't know.

548
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:03,640
- Oh, come on.
- I really don't want to talk about that.

549
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:06,532
Okay.

550
00:59:08,374 --> 00:59:11,290
You really need to relax.

551
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,773
One for you,

552
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:21,770
one for me.

553
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:26,980
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise.
I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

554
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,381
What is it?

555
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,470
Are you kidding?

556
00:59:34,177 --> 00:59:35,705
You've never rolled?

557
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:41,290
Oh, relax. Here.
It'll loosen you up.

558
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:45,286
Wait till you see the night sky.

559
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:50,468
How long does it last?

560
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,990
A couple hours, tops.

561
00:59:57,967 --> 00:59:59,242
It's okay.

562
00:59:59,277 --> 01:00:01,904
Okay.

563
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,383
Nina, hi!

564
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:11,941
I thought we could use some company.
So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

565
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:15,638
- Actually it's Andrew.
- Tom.

566
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:19,336
- I have to go...
- Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

567
01:01:20,547 --> 01:01:21,659
I shouldn't...

568
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,474
We're on the stage tomorrow.

569
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:25,603
So what are you going to do?
Go home to Mommy?

570
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:30,974
Come on, live a little.

571
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:37,034
It's just a couple hours, right?

572
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:39,478
Tops.

573
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:44,418
Cheers.

574
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,005
You haven't told me who you are.

575
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:50,389
I'm a dancer.

576
01:01:50,424 --> 01:01:51,970
No, I mean your name.

577
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:54,986
- Oh. Nina.
- So are you two sisters?

578
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:55,937
- Yes.
- No.

579
01:01:55,954 --> 01:02:00,280
- Blood sisters.
- We dance in the same company.

580
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:04,026
Ah, ballerinas.
No wonder you two look alike.

581
01:02:04,061 --> 01:02:07,018
I see now.
Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

582
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:09,008
- Very funny.
- I like to amuse myself.

583
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:10,494
I've never been to the ballet.

584
01:02:10,529 --> 01:02:13,438
Then you are definitely not gay.

585
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:15,382
I mean, it's kind of boring,
isn't it?

586
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:16,534
- Be honest.
- No it's not.

587
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:19,571
You know what?
It's just not for everyone.

588
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:22,484
You should come sometime.
I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

589
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:23,928
Yeah. Yeah.

590
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,479
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks.
- Okay well...

591
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:28,464
I think it's time for another round.

592
01:02:30,086 --> 01:02:31,961
Bottoms up.

593
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,958
So what are you guys
working on now?

594
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:42,090
Sorry.

595
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,919
<i>Swan Lake.</i>

596
01:02:45,954 --> 01:02:47,216
Yeah?

597
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,903
You know it?

598
01:02:48,922 --> 01:02:50,800
No, not really.

599
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:51,842
Heard of it.

600
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:53,272
What's it about?

601
01:02:54,621 --> 01:02:56,874
It's about a girl who gets
turned into a swan,

602
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:59,480
and she needs love
to break the spell.

603
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:04,167
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

604
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:08,207
and so she kills herself.

605
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:11,444
It's not a happy ending then.

606
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:14,615
It's beautiful, actually.

607
01:03:17,908 --> 01:03:18,862
Like you.

608
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:20,945
Huh?

609
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:23,209
I said you're beautiful.

610
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,029
That's funny?

611
01:03:38,368 --> 01:03:40,342
Looks like someone might be rolling.

612
01:03:40,377 --> 01:03:43,656
All right, come on.
Come on, it's time to go dance.

613
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:07,117
Nina!

614
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,231
Hey, what the fuck?
Where you going?

615
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:09,823
Nina!

616
01:05:11,228 --> 01:05:12,098
Where are you going?

617
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:38,158
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

618
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:40,050
Late?

619
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:44,102
Where have you been?

620
01:06:44,912 --> 01:06:47,084
To the moon and back.

621
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:51,526
- You've been drinking.
- Ding ding ding ding ding!

622
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,264
- What else?
- Hmm?

623
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:55,824
What else have you been doing?

624
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,430
Oh, you want to know their names?

625
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:05,320
- You need to sleep this off.
- There were two. Tom and Jerry.

626
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,762
- Be quiet, Nina.
- And I fucked them both.

627
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:09,851
Shut your mouth!

628
01:07:22,804 --> 01:07:23,982
- Don't come in here.
- What's this?

629
01:07:24,017 --> 01:07:27,387
It's called privacy.
I'm not twelve anymore.

630
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:29,969
- You're not my Nina right now...
- Leave me alone!

631
01:09:27,988 --> 01:09:29,456
Sweat girl.

632
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:27,879
Why didn't you wake me up?

633
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,626
I'm moving out.

634
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:37,118
My music!

635
01:10:54,993 --> 01:10:56,411
Thomas, I am so sorry.

636
01:10:56,446 --> 01:10:58,325
Keep on going.

637
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:00,975
Go get warmed up.

638
01:11:43,655 --> 01:11:44,212
That was good.

639
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:47,701
Actually, really good.

640
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,908
Okay, let's take ten.

641
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:00,498
Look, he just wanted to mark it
and asked me to step up, okay?

642
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,632
I overslept.

643
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:06,333
Oops. But hey, at least
you had a good time, right?

644
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:08,008
You put something in my drink.

645
01:12:08,043 --> 01:12:09,838
Yeah.

646
01:12:09,873 --> 01:12:11,540
And then you just
took off in the morning.

647
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:13,723
In the morning?

648
01:12:13,758 --> 01:12:15,692
Yeah, you slept over.

649
01:12:18,253 --> 01:12:19,115
Um, no.

650
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:23,508
Unless your name's Tom
and you had a dick.

651
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:27,137
What, Nina?

652
01:12:32,863 --> 01:12:36,189
Did you have some sort of
lesbian wet dream about me?

653
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:38,626
- Stop.
- Oh my God!

654
01:12:38,661 --> 01:12:41,969
Oh my God, you did!
You fantasized about me!

655
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:44,416
- Shut up!
- Was I good?

656
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:29,858
The final act.

657
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:31,848
You're trying to dance.

658
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:37,476
You've tasted your dream!
Touched it!

659
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:41,837
Only to have it crushed!

660
01:14:45,187 --> 01:14:46,925
Your heart is broken,

661
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,285
wounded.
Your life force fading.

662
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,004
The blood drips.

663
01:14:56,008 --> 01:15:00,260
The Black Swan stole your love.
There is only one way to end the pain.

664
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,894
You are not fearful,
but filled with acceptance.

665
01:15:08,147 --> 01:15:11,158
And you look down at Rothbart,

666
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:12,278
and then at the Prince,

667
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,394
and then, yes,
at the audience.

668
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:20,519
And then you jump.

669
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:26,174
Go ahead. Jump.
Jump!

670
01:15:37,435 --> 01:15:40,542
Okay, everybody get a drink of water,
then it's notes.

671
01:15:52,746 --> 01:15:53,940
You lost weight.

672
01:15:53,975 --> 01:15:55,582
Take off your shrug, please.

673
01:16:07,324 --> 01:16:08,081
Very good.

674
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:16,336
Face front.
We're almost done.

675
01:16:20,596 --> 01:16:22,618
And that's it.
Okay.

676
01:16:22,653 --> 01:16:24,749
We're done.
Thank you very much.

677
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:30,157
Georgina, I'm Lily.
Thomas sent me...

678
01:16:30,192 --> 01:16:32,997
Yes, we have to get you measured
for the Swan Queen costumes.

679
01:16:33,032 --> 01:16:34,158
What's she doing here?

680
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:37,721
He made me your alternate.

681
01:16:39,839 --> 01:16:40,873
Look, it's just in case.

682
01:16:43,514 --> 01:16:45,992
Thomas.
Thomas.

683
01:16:46,015 --> 01:16:47,123
- Thomas.
- Yes?

684
01:16:47,158 --> 01:16:49,276
It can't be her.

685
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:51,174
It can't be her.

686
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:52,690
Okay, why don't you just go.
I'll catch up later.

687
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:54,474
What's going on?

688
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:57,541
Lily...
You made her my alternate?

689
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,838
There's always an alternate.
Lily is the best choice.

690
01:17:01,873 --> 01:17:03,272
No, she wants my role.

691
01:17:03,307 --> 01:17:05,645
Every dancer in the world
wants your role.

692
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,177
No, this is different.
She is after me.

693
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:11,629
- She is trying to replace me.
- Nobody is after you.

694
01:17:11,664 --> 01:17:14,506
- No, please believe me...

695
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:22,379
I know it's been a struggle.
But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

696
01:17:24,148 --> 01:17:28,780
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance
and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

697
01:17:32,403 --> 01:17:33,412
Now go home and rest.

698
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:49,135
From the vision again.

699
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:07,267
What happened?

700
01:18:09,378 --> 01:18:13,361
I've got a life.don't work too hard.
It's a big day tomorrow.

701
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,445
I'm still working in here.

702
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:11,454
Could you please
turn the lights back on?

703
01:19:17,608 --> 01:19:18,058
Hello?

704
01:21:06,389 --> 01:21:07,473
What are you doing here?

705
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:09,415
I'm so sorry.

706
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,748
I'm so sorry.

707
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:16,361
I know how it feels now.
She's trying to replace me.

708
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:18,979
What do I do?

709
01:21:21,038 --> 01:21:23,415
You stole my things?

710
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,089
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

711
01:21:28,944 --> 01:21:29,684
Perfect?

712
01:21:35,596 --> 01:21:36,827
I'm not perfect.

713
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:40,335
I'm nothing.

714
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,895
Nothing!

715
01:21:54,807 --> 01:21:56,102
Nothing, nothing!

716
01:22:43,161 --> 01:22:44,040
Sweet girl.

717
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:05,947
Mommy?

718
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:12,370
Sweet girl.
Sweet girl.

719
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:18,524
Stop!

720
01:23:27,313 --> 01:23:28,191
What are you doing?

721
01:23:30,983 --> 01:23:31,596
Sweetie?

722
01:23:38,862 --> 01:23:40,072
Nina?

723
01:23:40,107 --> 01:23:41,859
Nina!

724
01:23:41,894 --> 01:23:43,162
Go away!

725
01:23:44,661 --> 01:23:45,613
Open the door!

726
01:23:45,648 --> 01:23:46,845
Go away!

727
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:57,425
Open the door, Nina!

728
01:23:58,165 --> 01:23:59,562
Nina!

729
01:24:12,304 --> 01:24:12,873
Get out!

730
01:24:12,908 --> 01:24:15,150
- What's wrong with you?
- Get out!

731
01:24:15,185 --> 01:24:17,189
- Get out!
- What do you see?

732
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:18,895
Get out!

733
01:24:57,672 --> 01:24:58,806
It's okay.

734
01:25:00,066 --> 01:25:00,910
I'm here.

735
01:25:04,981 --> 01:25:07,396
You were scratching all night.

736
01:25:07,431 --> 01:25:09,697
Where's my clock?

737
01:25:09,732 --> 01:25:12,023
- Don't worry about that.
- What time is it?

738
01:25:13,003 --> 01:25:15,304
- The show is tonight, I have to...
- No, no, no, no.

739
01:25:15,316 --> 01:25:16,601
Don't worry.

740
01:25:16,636 --> 01:25:19,617
I called the theater and I told them
you aren't feeling well.

741
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:20,753
I have to go!

742
01:25:20,788 --> 01:25:22,349
- No. No, you don't.
- Let go of me.

743
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:27,083
You're staying in here
until you feel better.

744
01:25:27,118 --> 01:25:28,602
Where is it?

745
01:25:30,302 --> 01:25:32,019
This role is destroying you.

746
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:35,309
- Move. Move!
- Nina...!

747
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:38,762
- What happened to my sweet girl?
- She's gone!

748
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:41,773
Nina!
Oh, Nina!

749
01:25:42,727 --> 01:25:43,519
No, please!

750
01:25:43,554 --> 01:25:45,686
- You're not well!
- Let go of me!

751
01:25:45,721 --> 01:25:47,390
You can't handle this.

752
01:25:47,425 --> 01:25:49,255
I can't?

753
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:52,335
I'm the Swan Queen.
You're the one who never left the corps.

754
01:25:53,908 --> 01:25:54,666
Nina!

755
01:26:11,138 --> 01:26:11,932
What are you doing here?

756
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:13,198
Nina?

757
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:15,141
She was supposed to be sick.

758
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:16,626
Give us a minute.

759
01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:22,570
Are you okay?

760
01:26:22,805 --> 01:26:24,237
I'm fine.

761
01:26:27,533 --> 01:26:29,516
Nina.

762
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:32,548
Nina.

763
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:33,950
What?

764
01:26:33,985 --> 01:26:36,667
I've already asked Lily.

765
01:26:36,702 --> 01:26:38,646
Have you announced it?

766
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:44,729
After Beth, do you really need
another controversy?

767
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,797
I'm here, Thomas.

768
01:26:50,832 --> 01:26:52,306
I'm doing it.

769
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:00,905
The only person
standing in your way is you.

770
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:05,593
It's time to let it go.
Lose yourself.

771
01:27:20,746 --> 01:27:22,343
White Swan, up in ten.

772
01:28:16,303 --> 01:28:18,026
What are you doing?
You need to be upstage.

773
01:30:19,364 --> 01:30:20,264
You suck.

774
01:30:21,867 --> 01:30:23,284
Okay, Nina.

775
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:03,103
What the fuck?

776
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:50,192
- Are you okay?
- Nina, are you okay?

777
01:31:59,736 --> 01:32:01,035
Can you tell me
what the fuck happened?

778
01:32:04,793 --> 01:32:06,629
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
- This is a fucking disaster.

779
01:32:14,903 --> 01:32:18,414
Rough start, huh?
Must have been pretty humiliating.

780
01:32:20,283 --> 01:32:21,491
Get out of my room.

781
01:32:21,526 --> 01:32:23,944
I'm worried about the next act.

782
01:32:25,842 --> 01:32:27,702
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

783
01:32:27,737 --> 01:32:29,237
Stop.
Please stop.

784
01:32:29,272 --> 01:32:34,524
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

785
01:32:36,811 --> 01:32:39,287
Leave me alone!

786
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:51,889
My turn!

787
01:32:52,853 --> 01:32:53,509
My turn!

788
01:32:53,544 --> 01:32:55,294
My turn!

789
01:33:02,427 --> 01:33:04,103
It's my turn!

790
01:33:23,761 --> 01:33:25,184
Black Swan, places in five.

791
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:29,932
Come on.

792
01:36:57,635 --> 01:36:59,452
Good job.
Fifteen to the last act.

793
01:37:45,284 --> 01:37:48,301
Hey.
You were amazing.

794
01:37:48,336 --> 01:37:52,059
Seriously, I know that things got
a little messed up between us,

795
01:37:52,094 --> 01:37:55,497
but I mean, holy shit,
you completely blew me away!

796
01:37:58,196 --> 01:38:00,134
Okay, well I guess that's it.

797
01:38:00,169 --> 01:38:01,907
So I'll let you finish.
Bye.

798
01:41:26,589 --> 01:41:27,688
Can you hear them?

799
01:41:27,923 --> 01:41:30,628
They love you!

800
01:41:30,663 --> 01:41:34,355
My little princess,
I always knew you had it in you.

801
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,010
Come on.
Let's take you out.

802
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:43,986
Go get some help.

803
01:41:44,021 --> 01:41:44,985
Go get some help!

804
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,452
What did you do?

805
01:41:46,487 --> 01:41:47,608
What did you do?

806
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:51,800
- I felt it.
- What?

807
01:41:51,835 --> 01:41:54,115
I felt perfect.

808
01:41:59,932 --> 01:42:01,130
I was perfect.

809
01:42:12,413 --> 01:42:14,847
Nina! Nina! Nina!

810
01:42:15,868 --> 01:42:55,848
THE END
