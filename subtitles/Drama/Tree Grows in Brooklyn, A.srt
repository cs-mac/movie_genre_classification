with prostate cancer.

484
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:41,777
Course he did.

485
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:44,112
Clean this up. Now.

486
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:47,115
Yes, sir.

487
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,752
<i>What's wrong with you guys?</i>

488
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:53,622
I've lost control
of my squad.

489
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:55,290
<i>(Gina)
Should we turn some lights on?</i>

490
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,059
Trying to save
electricity, Gina.

491
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,760
Your massage chair is on.

492
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,168
Yeah, I'm poor.
I'm not a savage.

493
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:02,670
Man, what am I gonna do?

494
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,633
Well, what if I bought
the apartment?

495
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,101
[Scoffs]
What are you talking about?

496
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,870
And then I could rent it
to you till you find

497
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:08,904
a new place.

498
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:10,038
What?

499
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,206
How could you afford
this place?

500
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,441
Have you been
dealing drugs?

501
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:13,942
No, I'm thrifty.

502
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:16,245
I cut my own hair.
I walk to work.

503
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:17,980
I eat Scully's lunch
every day.

504
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:20,949
I've rented the same
crap box since I was 20

505
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:22,551
'cause it's so cheap.

506
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,019
I've saved up money,

507
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,027
and I'm looking for
a real estate opportunity.

508
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:28,156
Ew. A real estate
opportunity?

509
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,424
Are you being serious?

510
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,093
We were drinking 40's
this morning.

511
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:33,028
I'm saying I could
give you a fair rent

512
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,463
because I would be
your landlady.

513
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,932
Whoa, whoa,
you be my landlady?

514
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,000
<i>You're Gina.</i>

515
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,034
Your lifelong dream

516
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,302
is to be on<i> wife swap.</i>

517
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,803
You call gum "the dentist."

518
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,711
You think Ray J
is a national treasure.

519
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,008
Yeah, so what?
I'm eclectic.

520
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,343
You're not better
than me, okay?

521
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,412
And I'm glad
that I still own this place

522
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,848
because I can happily
invite you to leave.

523
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:55,484
[Laughs]
Grow up, Jake.

524
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:56,985
[Imitating gina]
"Grow up, Jake."

525
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,019
Oh, my goodness.

526
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:00,289
Yeah, thanks for your help.

527
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,090
Old-school styles.

528
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:03,859
I take back the "Z"!

529
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,370
[Sighs]

530
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,371
Whoa, you okay?

531
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:09,472
Yep.

532
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,742
Just checking out
my new bedroom.

533
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:13,876
Oh, good.

534
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:15,211
It feels like scoliosis

535
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,146
and smells like
10 million butts.

536
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,121
<i>I take it your apartment thing
didn't work out.</i>

537
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:21,117
When did everyone decide
to become an adult?

538
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:22,552
I mean, I know you were born
in your fifties,

539
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:23,552
but come on.

540
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:24,554
Thanks?

541
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:25,788
Get this.

542
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,490
Gina just offered
to buy Nana's apartment

543
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:29,158
as a real estate opportunity

544
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,593
and become my "landlady."

545
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:31,995
Jake...
I know.

546
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:33,329
She was just trying
to help,

547
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,497
but we've known each other
since we were kids,

548
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,498
you know?

549
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:36,733
I got her her job.

550
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,801
Which an ice cream cone
could do, by the way.

551
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:41,037
And now I find out she's been
saving all these years?

552
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:42,605
Jake...
I know.

553
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,107
The person that I'm
really mad at is myself

554
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:46,142
for screwing
this whole thing up.

555
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,545
I gotta talk to Gina.
Thanks for your help, Amy.

556
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:49,646
Didn't say anything,
don't want credit

557
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:50,980
in case it goes wrong.

558
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,582
Yeah, that's smart,
given my track record.

559
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,417
Hey, wait.

560
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,619
What would you say Holt
thinks my biggest flaw is?

561
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:57,887
Who care what Holt thinks?

562
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:59,389
What's most important

563
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,257
is what I think
your biggest flaw is.

564
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:02,926
And there are so many
to choose from...

565
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:05,194
Too competitive,
prone to jealousy,

566
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:06,462
bit of a killjoy,

567
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,764
your shame cigarettes.

568
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,034
Oh, my God.
But your biggest flaw is...

569
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,969
You suck at throwing away
your secret lists.

570
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:17,874
Well, that was fun today.

571
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,176
Although I'm pretty sure
I caught some form of face lice

572
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,311
from that bag of hair.

573
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:22,979
Being a cop is dangerous.

574
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,113
Although I knew that
going in.

575
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,449
Yeah, it was fun.
Hey, you wanna grab a drink?

576
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,951
Oh, shoot, I would,
but I'm meeting Vivian

577
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,313
for that romantic
pig colon dinner.

578
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
[Sighs]
Hey, Rosa.

579
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,488
I want to apologize.

580
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,090
I haven't been much fun
to hang out with

581
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:35,191
over the last year or so

582
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,793
on account of all
the asking you out

583
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:37,994
and smelling your hair

584
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,635
and staring at you
from point-blank range.

585
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:41,965
Yeah, you were a real weirdo.
Mm-hmm.

586
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,132
But you're pretty cool

587
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,734
now that you're in love
with someone else.

588
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:45,802
Have a nice dinner.

589
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:47,270
Oh, we will.

590
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:48,905
They make a sorbet
out of the tail.

591
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:51,741
See ya.

592
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:54,911
Excuse me, Captain.

593
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:55,912
What are you doing, sergeant?

594
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,313
I'm going to yell at you,

595
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:59,221
and I don't want Santiago
to read my lips.

596
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,249
Excuse me?

597
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,418
You were completely unfair

598
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,418
to my squad today.

599
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,521
<i>Santiago is one</i>

600
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,289
of your best detectives.

601
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,425
And all you wanted to do was
play mind games with her.

602
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,961
Scully and Hitchcock
only arrested 14 people,

603
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:13,530
but that's 8 more
than last year.

604
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,365
They only arrested
6 people last year?

605
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,066
And I know Peralta
can be childish,

606
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,035
but he leads the precinct
in collars,

607
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,304
and he's grown up a heck
of a lot since you got here.

608
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,039
Okay, sit down, sergeant.

609
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,074
I'm going to do
your evaluation now.

610
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:30,313
Sergeant Jeffords,

611
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,514
you're right.

612
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,683
I have been hard
on the squad.

613
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:34,851
You're a good leader.

614
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:36,553
And just the fact
that you're willing

615
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,721
to stand up for them
is one of the reasons

616
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,156
they respect you so much.

617
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,431
I could learn something
from you.

618
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:45,762
You have every right
to feel like, um,

619
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,564
um, what was it
you said this morning?

620

Proud mama hen, sir.

621
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,900

[Knock at door]

624
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:58,408
What do you want, Jake?

625
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,043
I'm watching Oprah's
legends ball,

626
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:01,911
which is what I do
every time a close friend

627
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,079
hurts my feelings.

628
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:06,616
I came here to apologize.

629
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,551
<i>Look, I was mad at you</i>

630
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:10,553
for being more together than me,
and that's not fair.

631
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:11,955
I felt stupid,
so I acted out.

632
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:12,962
I'm sorry.

633
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,491
Yeah, you were stupid,

634
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,526
and you should be sorry, Jake.

635

But watching Oprah

it's okay to forgive.

638
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:24,601
Great.

639
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,308
Also, you should buy
Nana's place.

640
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:27,403
Not for me.

641
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:28,805
You should live there.

642
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,473
You love that apartment,
and you said so yourself.

643
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:31,480
It's a great investment.

644
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:32,575
Where are you gonna live?

645
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,843
Here.

646
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:35,011
I'll sublet from you.

647
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,318
I actually ran the numbers.

648
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:37,680
I'd keep paying
the same amount of rent,

649
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,215
and you would turn
a small profit.

650
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,950
It's a starter apartment,
and it's my fault

651
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,719
for starting when I'm 33.

652
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:44,554
[Laughs]

653
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,055
You have a deal.
All right.

654
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,329
Shake, shake.

655
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:48,758
Yes!

656
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:49,793
[Knock at door]

657
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:50,833
Hello, Detective.

658
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,061
<i>Is there a reason</i>

659
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,997
you're interrupting me
mid-soup?

660
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:54,997
Yes.

661
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,101
I'm ready for my
self-evaluation.

662
00:20:58,102 --> 00:20:59,202
So I asked Peralta

663
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:00,904
what you thought
my biggest flaw was,

664
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:04,073
and he said, "who cares
what Holt thinks?"

665
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,108
That's not surprising.

666
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,743
He's very disrespectful.

667
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,044
But he's not wrong.

668
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,712
My biggest flaw
is that I care too much

669
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:11,247
what you think of me.

670
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,283
I should be more confident
in my own judgment,

671
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,552
and I am so sure of that,

672
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,120
I don't even care
if you think I'm right.

673
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,155
Evaluation over.

674
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,624
Enjoy your soup.

675
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:27,829
