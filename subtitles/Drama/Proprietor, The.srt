1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,336
(heavy breathing)

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:08,073
(mumbling)

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,708
- It's all my fault.

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,380
It's not fair.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,552
Okay.

6
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,029
Shh.

7
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,399
It's good, you're okay.

8
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,601
Shh, now.

9
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,307
Shh.

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,855
(airplane zooming)

11
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:08,333
(brooding instrumental music)

12
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,965
- What is this place?

13
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,904
- It was, he had a
terrible former associate.

14
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,909
Now it's just a place we use.

15
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,553
- How long is this gonna take?

16
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,289
The whole process.

17
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:14,293
- Well, the first part is done.

18
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,728
You're dead.

19
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,530
- That was quick.

20
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,736
- The second part, the new
creds, the paper trail,

21
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,739
credit history, that's gonna
take...

22
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,943
However long it takes.

23
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,516
I don't know how the
hell you managed to get

24
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,751
that past security.

25
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,459
- You'd be amazed at what
all you can fit in your ass.

26
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,398
- Well I'm gonna need it.

27
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,134
There's no hardware allowed in
here.

28
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,637
It's house rules.

29
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,707
- [Voiceover] Yeah let's have
it.

30
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:02,941
- What's to stop me from
going out and buying one

31
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,778
- [Voiceover] Look I
just work here alright.

32
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,918
- I'd like that back when we're
done.

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,888
- [Voiceover] Yeah we should
be able to get it back to you.

34
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:27,399
- [Voiceover] Yeah we
need to talk about that.

35
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,601
- Talk about what?

36
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,170
- Payment.

37
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,040
what this is going to cost.

38
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,342
- [Voiceover] Something's come
up.

39
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,610
- What's that mean?

40
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,147
and they want to leverage your
services in lewd of payment.

41
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,181
I don't know much about it,

42
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,585
but someone came to town,

43
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,920
lost something very expensive.

44
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,961
- [Voiceover] Sounds
like a real gang fuck.

45
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,432
- Oh it is, it is bad.

46
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:04,303
they'll need something
done, that's all I know.

47
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,306
Your creds will be delivered
promptly there after.

48
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,877
- Well I'm sorry, but this is
how it is.

49
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,213
to be the clean up man for
you half ass consortium.

50
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:20,686
out in the world, but as I
said earlier, you're dead.

51
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:24,222
So good luck getting a mortgage.

52
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,924
- [Voiceover] Just give me what
you got,

53
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,993
point me in the right
direction, I'll take care of it.

54
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,997
- Right, we don't work that
way here in civilization.

55
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,934
You're an American now.

56
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,871
Not in some eastern European
wild west shit hole.

57
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,877
- So just sit in the ice
box for God knows how long.

58
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,379
- Yep.

59
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:55,053
- Keep this charged on your
person.

60
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,955
Computer is over there if you
get bored.

61
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,759
Just try not to get yourself
in any terrorist watch list.

62
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,665
And since you're sitting
on all that cash now,

63
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,669
randevu.xo is a local favorite.

64
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,871
If you're into girls that is.

65
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,390
(soft knocks)

66
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,965
- Bonjour.

67
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,255
- Ah yes sir.

68
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:07,492
Crowley, from the internet.

69
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,271
- It's kind of cold out here.

70
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,694
- Now if I remember correctly,

71
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:20,832
you said something about ropes.

72
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,502
- Yep.

73
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,972
(loud snap)

74
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:37,148
- You are quite trusting of
strangers.

75
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,084
- Not usually.

76
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,786
(loud whip)

77
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,055
You must have the magic touch.

78
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:50,862
- Yes, my magic touch.

79
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,130
(loud whip)

80
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,904
Do you like my magic touch?

81
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,844
(laughs)

82
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,482
I think you do.

83
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,422
Crowley from internet.

84
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,193
Is this what you like?

85
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,395
Yes?

86
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,103
Just like that.

87
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,742
There.

88
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,012
Yes.

89
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,981
Yes.

90
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,551
Shh, it's okay.

91
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,652
It's okay.

92
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,055
Just let go.

93
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,692
Yes, just.

94
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,560
Let.

95
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,629
Go.

96
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:09,007
(heavy breathing)

97
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,337
- Mr. Crowley.

98
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,278
(speaking in foreign language)

99
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,019
- Where's my phone?

100
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,757
(speaking in foreign language)

101
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,059
- How long have I been asleep?

102
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,763
- Why you worried that
your wife has called?

103
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,534
- No.

104
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,106
- Don't burn me with that
please.

105
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,842
- Why you so worried?

106
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,444
You some

107
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,714
big Hollywood producer or
something.

108
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,382
- No.

109
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,151
- Damn.

110
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,121
- I should get out of here.

111
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,390
- Yes, probably you are right

112
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,193
and on fact there's always a
long,

113
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,630
hard line of men waiting
for me outside the block,

114
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:42,734
but you know what we can make
them wait.

115
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,271
(speaks in foreign language)

116
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,909
- Let me ask you something,

117
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,210
How the fuck do you make any
money

118
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,512
running your business like this?

119
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,247
- Like what?

120
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,120
- You always just let guys
fall asleep in here for hours.

121
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:06,057
- Normally they do not fall
asleep.

122
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,560
If you want you can be Dublin.

123
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,263
But you know what,

124
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:17,402
you are very cute when you
sleep.

125
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,005
Just like a child.

126
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,507
- Alright.

127
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,076
- Woohoo.

128
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,312
I'm about to fall.

129
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,414
Uh you know you can be nice.

130
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,816
- I'm not nice.

131
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,788
- Well fuck you too.

132
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,690
- [Voiceover] The current
situation is not good Greer,

133
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,058
we need to talk.

134
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,626
- About what?

135
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,362
- [Voiceover] About next steps.

136
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,564
- It's not next steps time yet.

137
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,533
Not when I still got this thing
going on.

138
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,235
- [Voiceover] You keep
talking about this thing,

139
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,736
but nothing's happening.

140
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,140
We haven't seen anything
from you for a long time.

141
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,243
- I'm telling you, I'm this
close.

142
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,744
And then we're gonna be square.

143
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,146
- [Voiceover] I think
we got different ideas

144
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,580
about what square is.

145
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:06,417
- I mean square, trust me.

146
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,286
You'll be one happy mother
fucker when this little project

147
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,222
comes to finish my friend.

148
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,858
- [Voiceover] Today Greer,
meet me at the spot.

149
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,394
- Yeah we'll be in touch.

150
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,035
- [Voiceover] You ready
to do some work now.

151
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,604
- Yeah why not.

152
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,642
- It's pretty cut and dry.

153
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,644
Territory dispute.

154
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,179
They came in through the fire
escape.

155
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,114
Took out the resident over
there.

156
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:40,018
on domestic when it happened
and they locked it down.

157
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,387
- You should hire professionals.

158
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,788
- Yeah I agree.

159
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,725
- Except for the dead
occupant, the loft is clean.

160
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,260
- Where's Captain?

161
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,929
- The Captain is 20 minutes
away.

162
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,730
The wagon will be here in 10.

163
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,632
- We don't have much time.

164
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,534
- Okay we need the room!

165
00:13:56,536 --> 00:14:00,138
Clear the room people, let's go!

166
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,341
Come on people pick up the pace!

167
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,551
- Okay.

168
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,188
Obviously you guys are in
a serious jackpot here,

169
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,224
but that dead guy in the other
room.

170
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,493
I'd say ya'll are pretty much
fucked.

171
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,430
But one of you has the chance

172
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,999
to walk away today free and
clear.

173
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,201
Like it never happened.

174
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,305
We knew who you guys are
alright.

175
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,842
We know who you are and what you
do

176
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,344
and somewhere out there

177
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,713
is a cash of goods in your
possession.

178
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,883
- What the fuck is a cash of
goods?

179
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,153
- We know you guys got a stash
somewhere.

180
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:53,658
Maybe here, maybe somewhere
nearby.

181
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,126
One of you road scholars is
gonna tells us

182
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,129
exactly where it's hiding.

183
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,266
And for that, you go free.

184
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,668
- Fuck you!

185
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,004
You don't gotta tell anything
man.

186
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,873
- That attitude is not
advisable.

187
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,646
(loud slap)

188
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,085
- [Voiceover] So what do you
plan to do with the new you?

189
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,023
- I don't know, move out west.

190
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,492
Join the human race, do what
people do.

191
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:31,162
- And what is it you think that
people do?

192
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,331
- I don't know, not what I've
been doing.

193
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,897
- Ah Mr. Crowley.

194
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,535
May I help you.

195
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,204
- You gonna make me show my
dick every time I come here?

196
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,174
- Depends, are you
gonna be nice this time?

197
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,781
- You want this money or not?

198
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:27,418
- Oh Mr. Crowley you...

199
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,387
Goodbye.

200
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,360
- Okay.

201
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,895
- Okay what?

202
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,398
- I'll be nice.

203
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,004
(heavy breathing)

204
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,974
- Already?

205
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,677
Okay.

206
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,214
Okay.

207
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,222
So Mr. Crowley,

208
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,794
- Business overseas mostly.

209
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:10,962
- Business overseas?

210
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,631
That's sounds very boring.

211
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:19,871
- Well you know at least you
learned a cool language, no?

212
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,708
- Yeah your french was pretty
good once,

213
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,611
it's rough now.

214
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,646
- Some people like it rough.

215
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,317
- [Crowley] How long have
you been in the States?

216
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,020
- About thirteen years.

217
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,956
- You don't work for someone?

218
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,361
- No I am my own boss.

219
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,197
- Cool me too.

220
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:46,998
- Really?

221
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,633
- Yeah.

222
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,902
- Mysterious Mr. Crowley.

223
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,811
You know I actually used to work
for

224
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,414
an American when I first
arrived.

225
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,484
I thought it was a good thing,

226
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,453
but we had a difference in
opinion

227
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:13,591
and I got rid of him

228
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,496
and now nobody tells me what to
do.

229
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,898
Nobody.

230
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,501
- I'll drink to that.

231
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,341
- Sit.

232
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,178
We are going to be friends.

233
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,413
Sit.

234
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,220
What do you do Crowley from the
internet?

235
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,523
- Well right now I watch
that phone over there.

236
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,791
That's about it.

237
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,759
- Ah yes.

238
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:52,697
Your precious phone.

239
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:53,831
Let me guess,

240
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,703
are you a drug dealer?

241
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:02,907
- I wish I was a drug dealer.

242
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,243
Let's just say my job is very
demanding.

243
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:08,146
- Oh I know.

244
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,984
I know you must be a

245
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,187
phone sex operator.

246
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,224
- Yes I am a phone sex operator.

247
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,792
- I knew it, I don't
know how you guys do it

248
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:26,397
all the moaning and cumming

249
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,366
and fucking.

250
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,534
(loud moaning)

251
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,334
- That's good.

252
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,102
That's very funny.

253
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:31,869
Give me the phone.

254
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,937
- No.

255
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,238
(speaks in foreign language)

256
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,439
(laughs)

257
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,809
- No I don't want.

258
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,645
I'm having too much fun.

259
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,414
(loud moaning)

260
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,449
- Give me the phone.

261
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,719
Give me the phone.

262
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,725
Thank you.

263
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,497
(distant sirens)

264
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,832
- You're no fun.

265
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,335
- I'm sure I am.

266
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,406
(loud slap)

267
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,580
(loud slap)

268
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,889
- I think something moved.

269
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,533
(loud slap)

270
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,928
- Jorge Chavez.

271
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,196
- What about him?

272
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,832
- I got confirmation on my
little theory.

273
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,335
- The one about the
whorehouse in South Brooklyn?

274
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,870
- [Greer] Oh it's more of a
garage band

275
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:16,874
than any legit criminal
enterprise.

276
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,844
- [Voiceover] Misha, Misha?

277
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,779
- Misha Golluv.

278
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,582
Yeah that's his house.

279
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:28,152
My source confirmed that Jorge
the Bagman

280
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,955
was in fact there

281
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,325
at the time of death,

282
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,761
- I'll be damned.

283
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,900
Your little tonk junkie CI came
through.

284
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,568
- She did indeed.

285
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,806
Your parents home little girl?

286
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,241
- Nope.

287
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,078
- Been over there a lot lately.

288
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,881
You gonna fill me on what's been
going on?

289
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,051
- I learned about the man who
died.

290
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,487
- Little Amanda Surben.

291

we talking about here?

319
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:29,166
I need to know where they put
that money.

320
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,235
- I wish I knew.

321
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,180
- They knew it was bad money.

322
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,983
That's why they dumped the bag
down.

323
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,359
- Smart move, setting him up
like that.

324
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,795
Not so smart leaving his
passport on him,

325
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,197
but what'd you gonna do they
were high.

326
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,940
- You gotta get that money
before someone else does,

327
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,208
or they blow it all.

328
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,677

me,

would ya honey?

331
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,126
- Of course not.

332
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,814
- You remember how we met right?

333
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,684
- Yes.

334
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,820
- Remember what I did to your
dad?

335
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,390
- Yes.

336
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,293
- Remember what I told you
right?

337
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,968
About all the terrible
things I can do to you.

338
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,704
- Yes.

339
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:17,274
- Remember what I did to your
father,

340
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,411
just remember.

341
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,314
Just remember.

342
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:35,392
- Listen you don't have
to talk like this to me.

343
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,398
- Sure I do hun.

344
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,767
Sure I do.

345
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:44,561
- You have hands like

346
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:49,533
construction worker.

347
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,769
Am I close?

348
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,041
A fighter?

349
00:27:57,043 --> 00:28:01,245
- Maybe some other guy was
a fighter once, not me.

350
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:15,159
What's your availability on
Saturday?

351
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:18,996
- If you keep coming over so
much,

352
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:23,333
I could give you a
package deal, like a gym.

353
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,939
- That won't be necessary,
I'm leaving town soon.

354
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:32,142
- What?

355
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,610
Where you going?

356
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,849
- I'm going out West
to join the human race.

357
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,787
- That's where the human race
lives.

358
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,556
- I hope so.

359
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,127
- You're so dramatic Crowley.

360
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,233
You know I,

361
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,603
I have a place out west.

362
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,877
It's in farm country.

363
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,513
One day I,

364
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:13,817
I am just going to go out there

365
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,755
and I'l disappear.

366
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,757
Poof.

367
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,526
- What you gonna do out
there, fuck farmers?

368
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:25,662
- Yes why not, I like farmers.

369
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,132
I think they're honest and
they're strong.

370
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,134
Well some of them are honest.

371
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:34,738
- You'd be surprised what
farmers could afford.

372
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,817
(speaks in foreign language)

373
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,819
- Time to go?

374
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,555
- What?

375
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:56,093
Oh no, it's not a job it's...

376
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,131
Actually it's this...

377
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,833
It's this (speaks in foreign
language)

378
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,736
that I know in south Brooklyn.

379
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,009
His name is Misha, he's...

380
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,178
He's a pimp.

381
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,881
Wants me to work for him,

382
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,716
and thinks he owns me

383
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,219
and he won't leave me alone.

384
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:24,922
- Tell him to fuck off.

385
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,623
- Be real.

386
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,899
- [Crowley] He's a Russian guy.

387
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,068
- Yes.

388
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,671
Well he likes to think he is
actually,

389
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,607
I think he's just a piece of
shit American white trash,

390
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:47,444
you know but no offense.

391
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,584
Hey.

392
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:00,457
Maybe you could help me.

393
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,730
You know get rid of him?

394
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,066
I could pay you.

395
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,503
- No.

396
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,510
- Let's talk.

397
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,312
You don't have to repeat his
stuff okay.

398
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,715
It was just, I didn't mean get
rid of him, get rid of him.

399
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,618
I just meant, you know?

400
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,021
He's bad for business and...

401
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,589
- Don't ask me again please.

402
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,791
- Crowley.

403
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,221
- It was the night, I
go out after sunlight.

404
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,527
Can I get two dollars for the
subway?

405
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,801
- Amanda!

406
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,646
Baby he don't want none
of your busted ass.

407
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,282
Do you brotha?

408
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,818
Do you?

409
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,655
Baby you can't go wonder off
like that.

410
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,458
You could've got hit
by a car or something.

411
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,794
- I just wanted some money for
the subway.

412
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,196
- I'll get you a ride home baby.

413
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:57,634
You gotta cost the gentlemen
in public for that shit.

414
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,272
What's up player?

415
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,275
You need something?

416
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,309
- No.

417
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,916
- Alright now.

418
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,903
- Let me ask you something?

419
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,676
Do I look like a joker to you?

420
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,012
Your credit situation is dire my
friend.

421
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,581
Do you understand what I'm
saying to you?

422
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,883
- Look, that hole is probably
worth at least a few grand.

423
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,017
- So what?

424
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,253
- So that's my good deal, that's
what.

425
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,657
- Greer,

426
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,330
this isn't going to work for us.

427
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,465
- It's just a one shot
deal to tie you over.

428
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,803
you can't rob the evidence
locker to pay the man.

429
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,838
It creates risk.

430
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,674
For you, for him, it
brings heat, you know this.

431
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,244
- This isn't evidence.

432
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,847
It's something we found
in an abandoned building.

433
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,982
It belongs to nobody.

434
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,751
- Are you from this planet?

435
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,653
Of course it belongs to
somebody.

436
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,857
- You know what an exclamatory
clause is?

437
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:01,925
- Nope.

438
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,093
- Sure you do.

439
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:04,961
It's a clause in a trust
agreement.

440
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,364
It relieves the trustee from
liability

441
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,599
resulting from any act
performed in good faith

442
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,268
under the trust.

443
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,837
It's like a provision in a
lease.

444
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,008
Where they say they're not
responsible for any damages.

445
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,743
Eddie, baby.

446
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:24,214
Anything that could possibly,
cosmically come from this

447
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:27,117
rolls back on me.

448
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,818
Just take the shit.

449
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,987
It'll buy some time.

450
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,993
- You know what happens after
next week?

451
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,762
Do you know what happens?

452
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,630
- There isn't going to
be a next week, Eddie.

453
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:46,169
- What happens is your
issue gets escalated.

454
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,472
To someone else, someone with
significantly less affection

455
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,975
for you than I have, do you get
me?

456
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:55,145
- Well it doesn't make much
sense dropping me down a hole.

457
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:56,913
Can't make money for the man
down there.

458
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,616
- And you can't go on
robbin' front down there.

459
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:03,220
- Look, I'm here in good faith.

460
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,789
Trying to medicate damages to...

461
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,524
- With stolen evidence.
- [Greer] Not evidence.

462
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,300
- Greer listen,

463
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,103
get the money, all of it.

464
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,139
- Look you tell the man,

465
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:26,443
it's not a good idea
to threaten the police.

466
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:30,547
- You stopped being the
police a long time ago.

467
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:34,551
- Enjoy the tar, check's in the
mail.

468
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,422
- Fucking better be.

469
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,676
- What is this?

470
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:01,077
- What?

471
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,379
- This.

472
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,450
This thing.

473
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,389
- You remember

474
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,458
that guy I told you about
before?

475
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,060
- Yeah you work for him.

476
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:28,438
- I come from the pimps they are
not...

477
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,409
They are more like secretaries
than they are like bosses.

478
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,645
- He was a smoker.

479
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,187
- You got rid of him.

480
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,456
Right?

481
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,193
- It's okay.

482
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:01,438
about the Moroccans we
shook down last week.

483
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,579
You hear what I said?

484
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,582
- Yeah I'll take care of the
Captain.

485
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,089
- You wanna tell me what's
going on with the man?

486
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,357
- It's nothing.

487
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,325
- It's nothing?

488
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,561
- Official police business.

489
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,663
- Well I know that's bullshit.

490
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:29,766
(laughs)

491
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:33,670
- Idea, why don't we just
focus on Jorge the bag man.

492
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:37,340
Okay, can we do that?

493
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:39,075
- We can do that.

494
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:43,380
Just don't get your legs
broken and fuck everything up.

495
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,217
Jorge Chavez,

496
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,854
we know he's plugged into a
major cartel.

497
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,255
What are the odds his major
cartel friends

498
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:53,690
are looking for him too?

499
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,091
- Doesn't matter.

500
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,662
- I'm just thinking about what
happens

501
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,799
if and when they come looking.

502
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,735
- You having second
thoughts about all this?

503
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,506
- I'm just trying to anticipate
any potential problems.

504
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:12,308
You should try it some time.

505
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,811
- What's the fun in that?

506
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,013
- Listen mother fucker,

507
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:23,520
I'll do whatever needs to
be done to see this through.

508
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,555
The only way this doesn't
happen,

509
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,991
is one of us gets clipped.

510
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:31,594
And that sure as fuck isn't
gonna be me.

511
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,498
So put the death wish on
hold and let's finish this.

512
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,637
(laughs)

513
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,104
- Look at this fucking jerk off.

514
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,645
How can I help you?

515
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,015
- Yeah hold up man.

516
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,151
- No man he's alright.

517
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,003
- Look, you see.

518
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,481
- What's up tough guy?

519
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:02,585
Glad to see you changed your
mind.

520
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:03,920
- He's gonna wanna see a girl,

521
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:07,123
we got anybody free?

522
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,492
- Let's find out.

523
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,029
- Say buddy,

524
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,299
you wanna top it off with
something sweet.

525
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,268
- No I'll stick with the coke.

526
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,005
It's a less hooch.

527
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,577
- That ain't no hooch Kemosabe.

528
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:32,715
That there is not
available in this country.

529
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,084
Top shelf shit.

530
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,460
Russians don't drink hooch.

531
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:47,297
Even when we smoke rock.

532
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,402
- My apologies.

533
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:55,371
I didn't realize this
was a Russian household.

534
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,110
I didn't see the fat
lady cooking and cleaning

535
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,680
for all you mother fuckers.

536
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:09,018
(laughs)

537
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:15,391
My compliments to the bartender.

538
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,794
- Yeah.

539
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:21,397
This shit is worth your whole
paycheck.

540
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:40,583
So it looks like you're gonna
have to wait a few my man.

541
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:43,052
Girls are all busy.

542
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:46,255
- It's alright I'll wait.

543
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,609
- Yo Sherman is here man.

544
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,511
You wanna see him?

545
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,713
- Yeah.

546
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,220
Hey,

547
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,826
thanks for waiting.

548
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,862
Busy day.

549
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:28,431
- It's no problem.

550
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,237
- What's your story man?

551
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,305
You in the army or something?

552
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:37,740
- No.

553
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,375
- Sure as shit look like it.

554
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,743
- Yeah,

555
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:41,744
you really Russian?

556
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:45,848
(laughs)

557
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,985
- Full blood.

558
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:52,555
- You sure as shit don't act
like it.

559
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,329
I'm just sayin' you're friendly.

560
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,432
I don't know a lot of Russians

561
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:06,569
with your customer service
ethic.

562
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:09,038
- What can I say?

563
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,341
The customers always right,
right?

564
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:32,528
Hey man, hey.

565
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,132
Why you looking at my girl?

566
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:38,000
- No.

567
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,905
- Hey it's all good brother.

568
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,342
You can look, we don't judge.

569
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:51,047
This here is a safe...

570
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:54,350
Nurturing environment.

571
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:02,091
What'd you say Amanda?

572
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,994
You feel like going to work
today?

573
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,267
No.

574
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,169
Don't be like that girl.

575
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,339
We all gotta work.

576
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,974
Right?

577
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:24,413
Supply and demand and shit like
that.

578
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,918
What'd you say?

579
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,920
- Listen that watery fuck
is still hanging out there,

580
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:33,222
he says he's gotta go.

581
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,557
If you don't see him now, he's
out.

582
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,193
- Alright, alright.

583
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:45,868
Why don't you take GI Joe here
to my room.

584
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,975
You want that thing, I touch
you.

585
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,522
You in business bud.

586
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,396
Hey.

587
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,268
Nothing freaky now alright?

588
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,838
That's my girl

589
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,941
and I'm the only freak up in
here.

590
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,384
- Why'd you take the knife?

591
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,658
Why did you take it?

592
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,593
- It's mine.

593
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:45,728
- No it's not.

594
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,736
- You should leave this place.

595
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:56,005
You deserve better.

596
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:03,679
- Did you think I should leave
here before you fucked me?

597
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:07,016
- You shouldn't hang
around guys like Misha.

598
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,418
And guys like me.

599
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:39,982
(water streaming)

600
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,422
- Yes.

601
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,694
- You alone?

602
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:53,562
- Yeah.

603
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,365
- This is Mr. Jorge Chavez,

604
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,167
cartel bag man that came to town
last week

605
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,702
to do some business.

606
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:00,937
He's the guy that
disappeared along with his

607
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,972
very expensive luggage.

608
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:04,840
And apparently he's a bit of a
fuck up,

609
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:07,810
nepotism, inbred retard, who
gives a shit?

610
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:08,811
Anyway,

611
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:12,982
and everyone wants to know
who's got the bagman's bag.

612
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:14,784
- So who is the target?

613
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,253
- No leads yet, but evidently
there's reason to believe

614
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,955
the material he was handling...

615
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,456
- The money.

616
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,825
- The luggage is still here
somewhere.

617
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,994
The thinking is the personal
persons who did him in

618
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,796
are still sitting on it.

619
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,899
- So that gang shank thing is
fully on.

620
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:32,802
- Yeah internal resources said
he OD.

621
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:36,138
They think he croaked
getting high with someone.

622
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,374
They dressed him up with
rough bowls in the cartel,

623
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,343
make it look like a very nasty
mugging.

624
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:41,711
- So what's the timeline?

625
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:45,748
but I just wanted to give you
some context around the job.

626
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,818
they're going to want you
to go to work yesterday.

627
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,653
- Well in the meanwhile,
would you mind breaking me off

628
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,556
some per diem, I'm burning
through my own money here.

629
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,725
'Cause takeout is getting
expensive.

630
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,326
- Takeout?

631
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,628
Is that what they're calling it
now?

632
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,931
- Yeah.

633
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:03,332
- I'll look into it.

634
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,379
- What's wrong?

635
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,053
- Wah-lah.

636
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,690
- Did Misha do this to you?

637
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,292
- What do you think?

638
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,664
- You know what...

639
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,734
(speaking in foreign language)

640
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,237
Okay.

641
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,040
(speaks in foreign language)

642
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,542
- He's dead.

643
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,778
- What are you going to do?

644
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,783
Are you going to ride in and
save me?

645
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,022
Like I asked before.

646
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,126
No you're full of shit.

647
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:08,531
You're so full of words
and you never do anything.

648
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,900
Big words for a big man.

649
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:13,836
You're so full of shit.

650
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,674
You always talk and you never do
anything.

651
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:20,709
You know why, because
you never fear anything.

652
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,316
What are you gonna do tough guy?

653
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:36,692
- I'm very sorry this happened
to you.

654
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,161
He's gonna be very sorry too.

655
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:42,398
(mumbles)

656
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,403
- Do you care about me at all?

657
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:50,306
At all?

658
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,283
You know maybe we could...

659
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:04,620
We should go away together.

660
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,889
You and me, we...

661
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:10,593
We could, you have money, I
have money, we could just...

662
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:14,563
Go away together and we could
disappear.

663
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,536
A different life.

664
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:24,740
We could be different.

665
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,245
- You are different.

666
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,427
(loud knocks)

667
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,301
- Man, service doesn't start
until 11.

668
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:28,103
Girls aren't even here yet.

669
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:32,741
- I need a fifth of bang.

670
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,977
- Alright, alright.

671
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:39,181
(loud grunting)

672
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,690
- Mother fucker, you.

673
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:52,561
(struggled grunts)

674
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,093
- Drop it.

675
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,763
Drop it.

676
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,269
Turn around.

677
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:45,581
(loud grunts)

678
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:27,589
(brooding instrumental music)

679
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:44,073
- You should burn this place.

680
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:47,576
Or I'll have to come back
and kill them all anyway.

681
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:37,993
- [Voiceover] I'm texting
you dead drop coordinates.

682
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,982
Instructions are as follows,

683
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,583
army with hard known diplomats

684
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,285
in the system in the
acquisition of the goods

685
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,854
and the new target.

686
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,791
- [Crowley] Who's the target?

687
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:13,228
outside the whorehouse
Chavez supposedly died in.

688
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,733
The target murdered the
occupants

689
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:20,836
and likely has a missing
item in his possession.

690
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,941
- Did you see the cados were
murdered?

691
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,843
- [Voiceover] Affirmative.

692
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,817
- Same MO as the bag man.

693
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,721
- [Voiceover] Alright diplomats
will contact you by phone

694
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:42,724
with an RV in the next 12 hours.

695
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,296
They have a lead on a target
already.

696
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,100
- No shit.

697
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:10,452
- [Voiceover] Some people want
to meet with you today Greer.

698
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:13,555
- Yeah where should we meet?

699
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:15,724
- [Voiceover] You won't
be meeting with me Greer.

700
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,726
These are new people.

701
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,460
(gasp)

702
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:05,307
(loud grunts)

703
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:37,306
(phone ringing)

704
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,541
- [Voiceover] Amanda?

705
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,376
- It's done.

706
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,612
I have it, come get me.

707
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,101
- [Voiceover] Where the fuck are
you?

708
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,137
- [Voiceover] Take the
money, I need to see him.

709
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,607
Hide the money where we said.

710
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,408
- [Voiceover] (speaking
in foreign language)

711
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,678
- No matter what, don't let him
get it.

712
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,114
I need to see him suffer.

713
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:22,084
I need to see him in pain.

714
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:34,162
- What the hell do you think
you're doing in here Greer?

715
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,665
- I'm saying hi to my friend
Eddie.

716
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,800
We're friends right?

717
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,603
- You're up on something aren't
you?

718
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,505
Of course you are.

719
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,742
Why the fuck else would
you be in here right now?

720
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:48,677
- That's not necessary.

721
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,946
- Your issue has escalated
Greer.

722
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,948
- Escalated, what's escalated?

723
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,483
What's that mean?

724
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:57,586
- Are all those drugs
making you fucking retarded?

725
01:00:57,588 --> 01:00:59,688
'Cause that's about the
only God damn explanation

726
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,457
I can think of when it comes to
you.

727
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:05,494
This is over Greer.

728
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,062
No more extensions,

729
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,864
no more special treatment,

730
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,866
and no more me.

731
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,567
More than likely,

732
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:15,570
no more you.

733
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:18,840
You fucked up with the man.

734
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,442
Now get the fuck out of my diner

735
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:24,046
and enjoy what's left of
your short little life.

736
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:27,849
- That hurts my feelings.

737
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:32,354
- Get your fucking hands off me,

738
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,356
you God damn monkey.

739
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:38,694
(loud grunting)

740
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:41,663
- I'm gonna miss you.

741
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,809
- [Voiceover] You fucked
up with the man didn't you?

742
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:58,480
I fucking told you not to do
that.

743
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:01,316
- [Greer] You want out go.

744
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,985
This is my problem, it's my
solution.

745
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:07,389
- That's my money too princess.

746
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,524
Do not crash on me.

747
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,259
- I'm not crashing.

748
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,965
- If you got another
play then let's do it.

749
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,200
- I don't crash.

750
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:21,737
- Fine you don't crash.

751
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:24,840
So?

752
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:28,009
What's the play?

753
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:31,513
- We may need to take
some extreme measures.

754
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,551
- Fine.

755
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,246
- Hello, honey you here?

756
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:31,733
Very bad people are doing
very bad things to each other.

757
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,538
You're all caught up in it
aren't you?

758
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,912
You must have seen some
scary stuff in that house.

759
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:48,917
It scared me, so it must have
scared you.

760
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,631
Tell me again what happened
honey.

761
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:04,432
- I told you everything I know.

762
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:08,270
This GI Joe looking guy came
into the house and killed them.

763
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:10,405
- And where were you?

764
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,740
- I was hiding outside.

765
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,341
- Hiding outside.

766
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:14,676
You hid out front?

767
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:18,947
- So GI Joe must have
seen you when he left.

768
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,615
- I don't know.

769
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:23,084
- Seems reasonable that he would
have.

770
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:23,952
- Okay.

771
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,521
- Did you see him?

772
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:33,194
- Did GI Joe say anything
to you as he went home?

773
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:35,730
- I don't think so.

774
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:40,402
- But he saw you and you saw
him.

775
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:42,837
- Yeah.

776
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,946
- That scary looking guy,
looking right at you.

777
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,152
I bet you thought he'd be the
last thing you'd ever see.

778
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,530
Listen honey.

779
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:11,399
I gotta ask you something

780
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:14,669
and I want you to think before
you answer.

781
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:17,906
There's no rush.

782
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:22,310
What happened to all that money?

783
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,815
- I told you I don't know.

784
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:31,152
- I need it honey, counting on
it.

785
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,588
- I know you are,

786
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:38,293
so what are you gonna do about
it.

787
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,401
Who is that?

788
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,603
- That's my partner.

789
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:50,572
Dale.

790
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:06,054
(soft whimpering)

791
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,149
(loud slap)

792
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:12,921
(loud slap)

793
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,692
(struggled grunts)

794
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,462
- I didn't kill those
guys you fucking bitch,

795
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:22,797
but I should kill you.

796
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,468
- No.

797
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,871
(mumbles)

798
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:32,173
(loud scream)

799
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:55,930
- Nobody.

800
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,399
He's perfect.

801
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,847
- He gambles, he has bad debts.

802
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,483
Without his money, he's dead.

803
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:52,620
I want this, his money's already
rich.

804
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,494
- Sophie.

805
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,565
- I want him to suffer.

806
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,608
- And what would you want?

807
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:27,288
(loud gasping)

808
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:29,891
- You know this doesn't
have to be this way.

809
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,460
You can talk to us.

810
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,128
- Such a player.

811
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,531
Please no more, please no!

812
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:44,672
(gasping)

813
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,465
- We know you're the guy
that robbed the house.

814
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,868
Okay.

815
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,871
Your friend over there, she's a
dead duck.

816
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:56,644
You can still save yourself
for a little while.

817
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,447
Just tell us where you put it.

818
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:02,717
- [Sophie] Fuck you, fuck you!

819
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,174
(loud punch)

820
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,405
(gasping)

821
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:38,513
- You guys are going to
kill us no matter what.

822
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:41,482
So why don't you just get
it the fuck over with.

823
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,451
(loud punch)

824
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:48,022
(struggled grunting)

825
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,074
- I'll tell you everything.

826
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,368
- No man.

827
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:37,538
Never been up here, it's pretty
though.

828
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,041
I should take Lana up some time.

829
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:43,010
but you know with the kids and
all,

830
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:46,214
we just never get around to it.

831
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,911
- I hope there's some booze at
this place.

832
01:15:16,913 --> 01:15:18,946
I could sure use a fucking
drink.

833
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:21,849
- That's 'cause you're fucking
alcoholic.

834
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:25,786
- I can quit anytime.

835
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:28,155
You'll need a drink too man.

836
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:29,690
That bump on your skull,

837
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:33,561
you're gonna have one hell of
a hangover tomorrow morning.

838
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:38,799
They told me you work in the
CIA.

839
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:41,936
Is that true?

840
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,971
Man I hope not.

841
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:46,941
'Cause your clandestine
tree craft leaves something

842
01:15:46,943 --> 01:15:48,809
to be desired.

843
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:52,246
And I'm not fucking with
you when I tell you this,

844
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:55,082
it's fucking ridiculous.

845
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,751
- Fuck you.

846
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,414
- Okay, where to?

847
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:31,419
Listen honey,

848
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:34,655
it's time for you to tell us
where that money is buried.

849
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,161
(whispers)

850
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:43,030
- I'm sorry honey, I
didn't quite get that.

851
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,834
- I swear to God, I'm going
to cut this bitch's hands

852
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:47,802
and feet off.

853
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:50,004
- Hey, no.

854
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:51,405
- I am not fucking playing here.

855
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,841
- Let me handle this, okay.

856
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:26,374
I'm sorry honey.

857
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:30,277
I'm sorry I hurt you.

858
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:35,182
You had a tough life.

859
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:39,587
I know you were just trying
to look out for yourself.

860
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:41,288
You saw a chance at a future

861
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:45,459
and you decided to grab it.

862
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:49,030
I can't blame you for that.

863
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:51,632
I can't blame you for doing
something,

864
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:54,935
I've been doing my whole life.

865
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:59,373
I can't blame you.

866
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:03,277
Truth is, you're probably
the closest thing

867
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,748
I had to love in my life.

868
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:12,620
You're the only person I've
been able to open up to.

869
01:18:12,622 --> 01:18:16,257
Ever.

870
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:19,126
That's powerful.

871
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:22,129
Those feelings.

872
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:29,837
Don't you feel the same?

873
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:34,175
I hope you do because...

874
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:39,280
I care about you.

875
01:18:39,282 --> 01:18:42,650
I guess I love you.

876
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,455
- They're gonna kill you.

877
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:51,025
- What's that honey?

878
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:53,761
- They're gonna kill you.

879
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:19,086
- Who the fuck is that?

880
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:23,157
- You guys can't be here,
you need to clear out.

881
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,497
Official police business.

882
01:19:29,499 --> 01:19:32,867
You can't be here.

883
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:37,638
Did you not hear me?

884
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,513
You need to clear out.

885
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:48,315
(speaking in foreign language)

886
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,854
Get the fuck out!

887
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:57,725
(loud gun shots)

888
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,465
(gun shots)

889
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:16,110
(rapid gun shots)

890
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,582
(struggled grunting)

891
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:28,656
(gun shots)

892
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:34,728
- Amanda!

893
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:44,004
(rapid gun fire)

894
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,176
Amanda!

895
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,979
Amanda!

896
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:58,419
(loud punches)

897
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,488
(screaming)

898
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:07,928
(struggled groans)

899
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:30,351
(loud gun shots)

900
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,987
- Amanda stop!

901
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:11,358
(gun shot fires)

902
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,230
Amanda!

903
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:18,632
- Amanda?

904
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:26,140
(speaking in foreign language)

905
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,624
It's all my fault.

906
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,127
It's not fair.

907
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:51,665
Okay.

908
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,634
Okay.

909
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:04,311
Okay, shh.

910
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:07,815
It's good, you're okay.

911
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:10,017
Wish me luck.

912
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:16,924
Shh.

913
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,609
(rapid gun fire)

914
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,274
(gun clicks)

915
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:47,614
(loud gasp)

916
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:25,486
- [Voiceover] You're
in the shit, it's bad.

917
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:29,289
- [Voiceover] Yeah someone
got away with your money.

918
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,794
- [Voiceover] Huh huh.

919
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:36,497
There's no papers without that
money.

920
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:40,534
- [Voiceover] Yeah I
think I'll take my chances

921
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:42,703
out in the world.

922
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:47,307
- You know I think you
have beautiful scars.

923
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:50,244
They're like, how do you say,

924
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:52,546
they're like a map

925
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:54,882
to another country.

926
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:04,191
You know maybe in another life,

927
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:08,428
we could've been different.

928
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:15,369
We could've gone away together.

929
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:23,343
You and me, we could've...

930
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:27,614
Poof, disappeared.

931
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:30,844
(brassy rap music)
