1
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:29,568
("lt Goes Like lt Goes" by Jennifer Warnes)

2
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,831
That's all you're eatin' for lunch - an apple?

3
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,222
I'm dietin'.

4
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:23,909
I gotta keep my strength up.
I put these preserves up myself.

5
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:28,906
Sunday, Roscoe and l put up
over 60 quarts of peaches.

6
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:33,132
What'd you do over the weekend, Norma?

7
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:35,308
I soaked my feet.

8
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:39,142
I saw you in town Sunday.

9
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:42,985
Your friend drives a mighty big car.

10
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:47,749
Well, if you'd looked on the motel register,
you'd have seen my name there too.

11
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,222
It's none of my business.

12
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:57,303
Mama, you haven't opened up your sack yet.

13
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:03,272
Mama, aren't you hungry?

14
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:04,752
Mama?

15
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,701
Mama, you feelin' all right?

16
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,425
Mama?

17
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,708
Mama, can you hear me?

18
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:17,908
Mama?

19
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,425
Mama?

20
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,390
Mama, come on, come on now, Mama, come on.

21
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,269
She didn't hear one word l said.
She doesn't hear you right now!

22
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,344
Now, you know that happens, Norma Rae.

23
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,948
- It happens all the time.
- Well, it doesn't happen to my mama!

24
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:48,345
- It'll pass off. It's just temporary.
- Well, that makes it okay. She's only deaf for one hour.

25
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,311
She's only deaf for two hours.
She's only deaf all day!

26
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,305
- She can get herself another job.
- What other job in this town?

27
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,402
This is the only job!

28
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:00,610
I'll give her a note. They send her home.

29
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:05,084
Come on, Mama.
They don't care anything about you.

30
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:26,065
- You all right out there?
- I'm fine.

31
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:29,343
You're gonna get all bitten up.

32
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:32,027
I'll be in in just a minute.

33
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,105
Well...

34
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,746
I'm gonna let this pot soak.

35
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,631
There's one soakin' from breakfast.

36
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,908
Now it's got company.

37
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:58,368
Hi, kids. Ten more minutes of this junk
and then l want you to do your homework.

38
00:06:58,453 --> 00:06:59,806
I did it.

39
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,372
- You did it?
- Yeah.

40
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:05,810
Unsatisfactory in your letterin', unsatisfactory
in your readin', and your numbers aren't too good.

41
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,329
- You haven't been doin' too much homework.
- Shh! l don't wanna hear.

42
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,608
I'll "shush" you.

43
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:29,891
- What are you gettin' fixed up for?
- I'm goin' into town.

44
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,089
What do you need in town?

45
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:33,686
Things.

46
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:37,766
- OK. I drive you in.
- You got Bonanza on next.

47
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:43,165
Oh, no, l'm gonna miss that.
It's the same thing every week anyhow.

48
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,133
I'm goin' to JC Penney's,
buy myself some panties

49
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,649
and a white cotton brassiere, size 32B.

50
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:55,568
You wanna come along and sit on a little stool outside the
dressin' room and have all the ladies look at you, then come on.

51
00:07:55,653 --> 00:08:00,488
No, ma'am, l don't care to do that.
You comin' straight back?

52
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:03,246
No. After that l'm goin' to the drugstore,

53
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,292
buy myself some Kotex pads
and a Cosmopolitan magazine.

54
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:11,285
Mm-hm. Then you comin' home?

55
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:17,130
Yeah. After that, l'll be so tired out
from all the excitement, l'll be comin' home.

56
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,602
Mm-hm.

57
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:26,312
Hi.

58
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:29,588
Mr Wichard?

59
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:32,187
That's right. Vernon Wichard. Who are you?

60
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:37,472
- My name is Reuben Warshawsky.
- Warshawsky? What kinda name is that?

61
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:41,466
The kind you have to spell for
telephone operators and head waiters.

62
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:46,024
- What do you want?
- I'd like to get me a room with a mill family.

63
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:51,345
What for? We got a hotel with 12 rooms.
We got a motel with 36 rooms.

64
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,382
I wanna get to know
some mill hands close up.

65
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,668
Uh-huh. Why is that?

66
00:08:56,753 --> 00:09:02,132
I'll tell ya, Mr Wichard. I just got into town
about, uh, an hour ago. Hi. How are you?

67
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:06,283
I parked my rented car, I got out, and
before l had a chance to adjust my crotch,

68
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:10,082
the chief of police was on me saying "Who are you?
I don't know you. What the hell you doin' here?"

69
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:15,566
So l told him l was a labor organizer, come
to put a union in the OP Henley textile mill,

70
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:19,646
and he said, "The hell you are, boy." And gave me
a ticket and told me to get my ass elsewhere.

71
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,769
He was dead right, too.

72
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,368
Far as l'm concerned, all of you people
are communists or agitators,

73
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:28,365
or crooks, or Jews,
or all four rolled together.

74
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:33,704
Every time you people come into a town,
the folks get throwed outta their jobs.

75
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:38,787
Excuse me.  Do you mind if l ask you a question?
How much do you make an hour?

76
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:42,346
I make a dollar and 33 cents a frame.

77
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,869
- And when did you have your last cost-of-living raise?
- I haven't had that.

78
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:52,369
With all due respect, Mr Wichard, with today's
inflation, that makes you a bit of a schlemiel.

79
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:55,445
You callin' me some kind of a name?

80
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,206
You're underpaid. You're overworked.

81
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:03,128
They're shaftin' you right up to
your tonsils. You need me, sir.

82
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:09,926
I think maybe, if you run real fast, you gonna get
back to your car before my dog bites you.

83
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:12,827
Whattaya tellin' him that for?
We ain't even got a dog.

84
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,108
You don't need one.

85
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,111
Hey, how ya doin'?
Do you have any vacancies?

86
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:40,263
- Yes.
- Thank you.

87
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:42,387
Hi.

88
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:45,190
Hey.

89
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:48,146
Very friendly little town you got here.

90
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:52,744
So far l've been told to shove off,
get off, and go away.

91
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,764
Oh, it's OK.

92
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,248
Make sure they spray your room for roaches.

93
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:06,024
You got roaches down here?
l'm very familiar with roaches.

94
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:09,348
Do you have a room with a view?

95
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,948
You got the back alley
or the parking lot. Which?

96
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,627
Back alley or parking lot?

97
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:20,343
Give him 31, Alston.
Can't hear the drunks from in there.

98
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:39,221
I'll be back this way
next Wednesday...after dinner.

99
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,743
I'm havin' dinner with my wife's folks.

100
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,745
Tonight was the last time, George.

101
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:50,953
You don't say, Norma Rae.
Well, now, isn't that a surprising turn?

102
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,330
No.

103
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,644
Been comin' on for some time.

104
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:01,853
You know somethin' funny? l didn't notice it.
I mean, didn't you get your steak dinner?

105
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,606
Didn't you get your box of pralines?

106
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:08,572
Didn't you come three times in a row
in that bed over there?

107
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,486
I wasn't countin'.

108
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:15,251
Well, well. How about that?

109
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,372
Looks like l don't know what it takes
to satisfy you these days, doesn't it?

110
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:23,268
Just doesn't sit well
with me anymore, George.

111
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:27,890
I mean, you've got your wife,
got your two kids in high school.

112
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:31,870
There's a lot of gossip. I got my two kids...

113
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,227
I don't know...

114
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:41,411
Just doesn't make me feel good.

115
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:45,445
You're here to make me feel good.

116
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,782
I'm not trottin' down here anymore.

117
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,148
Why, you hick!

118
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,747
You got dirt under your fingernails.

119
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:59,651
You pick your teeth
with a matchbook - I seen ya!

120
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:04,028
Shit, what the hell are you good for, anyway?

121
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,946
You come outta that factory,
you wash under your armpits,

122
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:10,628
you come on down here and spread your legs
for a poke and then you go on home.

123
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:13,352
And you're dumpin' me?

124
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:22,548
- I heard a hell of a thump.
- Yeah?

125
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:28,026
- That was me gettin' throwed across the room.
- Come here. I have some ice for that. Come on.

126
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,664
Sit down, please.

127
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,548
You look all shook up.

128
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,268
Here, put this on.

129
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:52,032
Thought everybody down south
was Ashley Wilkes.

130
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:55,105
You lie down with dogs, you get fleas.

131
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:58,541
Well, hey, what?
Does this look broken to you?

132
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,669
Go like this.

133
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:03,506
No, l don't think so. You want aspirin?

134
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:05,472
No, thanks.

135
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,509
- Band-Aid?
- No.

136
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:10,585
- Valium?
- You're a whole drugstore.

137
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,870
I'm a mild hypochondriac. Keep that on it.

138
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:24,067
Me and men.

139
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:28,662
I oughta learn to say no right from the start.

140
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:33,461
But if it wasn't men,
l don't know what it would be.

141
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,261
- You got a lot of books.
- Oh, yeah.

142
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:46,064
Terrified l'm gonna wake up in a motel room one
morning and have nothin' to read but the phone book.

143
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:49,104
She got big eyes.

144
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,385
Yeah. Got a big brain, too.

145
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:58,749
What's her name?

146
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:01,304
Dorothy Finkelstein.

147
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:05,305
She's a hotshot labor lawyer out of Harvard.

148
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:10,283
Well, she must be your girlfriend if you haul
her picture around with you wherever you go.

149
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:14,812
I don't know. We sleep together on Sunday
mornings, then we read the New York Times...

150
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,090
and l guess that makes her my girlfriend.

151
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,124
Hey.

152
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:28,406
- I'm Norma Rae Wilson.
- Reuben Warshawsky.

153
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:32,406
- Nice meetin' you.
- My pleasure. Keep that on your nose.

154
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:36,824
Hey, l'm real sorry about my daddy.
He got a short fuse.

155
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:40,110
Yeah. Well, my credentials
keep me out of a lot of places.

156
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:44,630
But l'll tell ya, every once in a while
someone opens up their door to me,

157
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:49,184
puts me in their best bedroom and treats me
just like l was a cousin. It's nice.

158
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:53,988
- What?
- That sure as heck wouldn't be my daddy.

159
00:15:58,313 --> 00:15:59,951
You a Jew?

160
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,911
- Beg your pardon?
- Are you a Jew?

161
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,503
Born and bred.

162
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:11,865
- I never met a Jew before.
- How ya doin'?

163
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:19,262
I heard you all had horns.

164
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:23,887
Circumcised, yes. Horns, no.

165
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,961
Well...

166
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,562
As far as l can see, you don't look
any different from the rest of us.

167
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,311
- Well, we are.
- You are?

168
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:39,669
Well, what makes you different?

169
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:41,572
History.

170
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:43,921
Oh.

171
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,169
Got it now?

172
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,925
- Yeah, it looks better.
- I think it stopped.

173
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,322
- Thanks a lot for the ice.
- Any time.

174
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,608
Christ, l hope not.

175

Hey!

196
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:17,848
There's too many big words. If l don't
understand it, they ain't gonna understand it.

197
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:21,369
- That fella a friend of yours, Norma?
- Looks like he's gettin' to be.

198
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:25,162
- You better hotfoot it or you'll be late.
- I don't care if l don't get there till tomorrow.

199
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:29,371
Thank you very much. If you have any questions

201

Good mornin' to ya.
Thank you. Good morning.

202
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:42,287
All right, the lady wants to go to work.

203
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,368
I'll catch you later.

204
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,006
Well...

205
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,165
One of you guys shows up
about every four years.

206
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:56,325
- About the same time we get the locusts.
- Oh.

207
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,204
- What's your name?
- My name?

208
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:02,212
- Yeah.
- My name's Jimmy Jerome Davis.

209
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:06,525
Well, Jimmy Jerome, we already got
six of you boss men in civil contempt.

210
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,604
Would you care to make it seven?

211
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:12,402
Why, hell, we plaster the toilets
with them things.

212
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:17,367
Wanna read this on your break?

213
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:19,892
Asshole.

214
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:36,932
I already told him l wouldn't go out
to dinner with him. What's he want now?

215
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:40,608
Maybe he wants to
make it breakfast, Norma Rae.

216
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,532
Whatever it is, l didn't do it.

217
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,571
Norma, you got
the biggest mouth in this mill.

218
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:05,848
"Give us a longer break.
Give us more smokin' time."

219
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,606
"Give us a Kotex pad machine."

220
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:13,172
- Do it and l'll shut up!
- Well, we'll do better than that.

221
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,724
We figure the only way to close that mouth
is to hand you a promotion.

222
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,168
You're goin' up in the world, honey.

223
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,051
Yeah? How far and for how much?

224
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,886
Well, we're gonna put you on spot-checkin'.

225
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,242
Well, hell, it sure ain't gonna make me any friends.

226
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,328
It'll make you
another dollar and a half an hour.

227
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:48,169
- How am l doin', little girl?
- You're doin' good, Daddy.

228
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:52,925
I think you better try to
speed it up some if you can.

229
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:55,402
I'm goin' as fast as l can.

230
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:59,683
Yeah. Well, they're watchin' me.

231
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,683
They're watchin' you.

232
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,889
Well, what, I guess you're sore at me?

233
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,883
I don't think you should
push your own daddy.

234
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:36,172
- It's more money, daddy. I need it for my kids.
- Well, l don't need it for my kid.

235
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:55,744
Millie, Craig, what are you doin' in Grandma's
marigolds? Ya know she's gonna kill you. Come on.

236
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:58,367
-Craig, get up from th... Look at you.
- I don't wanna.

237
00:22:58,453 --> 00:23:02,844
Well, you do it anyway! Look at your behind!
lt's filthy dirty. It's all full of dirt.

238
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:07,726
I asked you to watch him!
Criminy, l cleaned you up once.

239
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:21,125
Get it! Get it, Steve! Come on, Steve!
Come on, Steve! Come on!

240
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,401
Oh, wow! He's got an arm on him!

241
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:39,528
Whoo!

242
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,446
- Hey, do you want somethin'?
- Yeah, this is awful.

243
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,525
Get me a hot dog, lots of relish.

244
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,968
Whoo! All right!

245
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:52,803
- Hi. Can l have a hot dog, please?
- OK.

246
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:55,123
Thank you.

247
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,246
- Hi, Weona.
- Hi, Norma.

248
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,405
- Can l have two dogs?
- OK. Just a minute.

249
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:01,482
- Hi.
- Hi.

250
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,643
- How you doin'?
- Are you enjoyin' the game?

251
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,166
Oh, yeah. I love the shortstop.
Guy really goes right into the hole.

252
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:11,644
I know. That's JC McAllister.
Scouts are down here lookin' at him.

253
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:17,005
What's the matter? You don't like it?

254
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:22,451
This is not Nathan's. I don't even think this is
a hot dog. What do they put in these things?

255
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,491
Lotta red dye and other things
you don't wanna know about.

256
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:27,768
Excuse me a minute.

257
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:38,604
Hello, Norma.

258
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:42,605
- Hey, Ellis.
- You're lookin' fine.

259
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:45,287
I'm always fine. I'm a horse.

260
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:50,092
- Changed your hair.
- It grew.

261
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:55,608
How's Craig?

262
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:57,684
He lost a tooth.

263
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:03,044
You know, it wouldn't hurt if you
came by to see him every now and then.

264
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,852
I don't believe l can do that, Norma.

265
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,922
Well... suit yourself.

266
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,889
You always have.

267
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:24,010
- Gimme a Coke, will ya, please. You want a Coke?
- Yeah.

268
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:26,368
Two, please.

269
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:30,844
Thank you. Here, this is for hers.
For mine. Keep the change.

270
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,161
Thank you.

271
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:34,844
Here you go.

272
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:42,411
I climbed into the back seat of his Cadillac one rainy
night six years ago, stuck my feet out the back window,

273
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:47,487
and got myself my little Craig
off that southern gentleman.

274
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:50,531
He ain't done nothin' worthwhile since.

275
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:53,773
Did you get married?

276
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,651
He didn't bother. I didn't bother.

277
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:03,361
My first affair, as l recollect it,
was with my Hungarian piano teacher.

278
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:07,329
I was playing Smetana,
she put her head in my lap.

279
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:10,610
I tell ya, l played the hell outta that.

280
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:15,766
Next thing l knew, we were in her bedroom,
underneath a Russian icon,

281
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:20,404
and her husband came home and found us.
And the poor guy burst into tears.

282
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:26,247
I felt so bad. I went up to him, put my arms around him,
and said, "Hey, man, l'm sorry. I'm really sorry."

283
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:30,326
Then we all went into the kitchen
and had a glass of tea.

284
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:36,362
I guess it seems like every time you run
into me, l'm hasslin' with some other guy.

285
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:41,649
- That's what it seems like.
- What do you think of me, l wonder?

286
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:46,368
I think you're too smart
for what's happenin' to you.

287
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:10,570
Come on, lady, l'm over here now.

288
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:12,848
I got the jump on you.

289
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:21,490
Come on, lady.
Come on, come on, come on! Come on!

290
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,962
Clock me down! Clock me down!

291
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:29,366
I'm over here now, lady.
Come on! l'm over here!

292
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:37,047
Hey, lady! Come on, what you waitin' for,
girl? l'm over here now! Come on!

293
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:41,525
Come on, lady!

294
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:43,808
Come on! l'm over here!

295
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:47,648
Come on! Lady! Come on!

296
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:51,931
You damn fool! You're gonna be
gettin' us both to lose our jobs!

297
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:01,164
I'll get it.

298
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,812
Hey.

299
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:19,371
I won't trouble you. I just came to apologize.

300
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:23,250
I know l could've lost you your job today.

301
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,122
Well, you sure went crazy on me.

302
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:29,804
I know.

303
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:35,732
I got handed divorce papers this mornin'.
I guess... I went off my head.

304
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:47,765
Well...

305
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,888
Things can get to you.

306
00:28:56,813 --> 00:28:59,202
Would you come and have a drink with me?

307
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:04,003
Uh, just to make up for the ruckus
and all the bother l put you to.

308
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,084
I'm Sonny Webster.

309
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:10,765
You used to come in my mama's bakery.

310
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,368
- Sonny Webster?
- Yeah.

311
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:21,887
Sonny Webster! l remember you!

312
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:26,964
You used to stand behind the cash register
and give everybody the wrong change!

313
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:32,844
- Well, l never was too good at math.
- You're tellin' me. Sonny Webster! Golly!

314
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:38,092
How about that drink?

315
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:41,926
OK. Just wait one minute, will you?

316
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,331
Who was that? l heard a man's voice.

317
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,368
Yep, you did. I'm goin' out with him.

318
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:56,763
- Where'd you meet him?
- Just now on the front porch.

319
00:29:57,453 --> 00:30:01,241
Some Tom, Dick or Harry comes to the front
door and you've got your hat on? No, sir.

320
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,801
Daddy, l'm over 21. Way over.

321
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:09,286
Let me say some names to you, Norma.
Buddy Wilson, Ellis Harper, George Benson.

322
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:12,126
A US sailor, Trailways bus driver.

323
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:17,765
None of which is lookin' after you as far as l
can see. I got that spot. It's my roof. My food.

324
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:21,690
There's something wrong with this. There's something
wrong with the way you try to keep men off me.

325
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:26,324
There is nothin' wrong with a daddy's love for his
little girl. You oughta be grateful for your daddy's love.

326
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:28,802
You're lovin' me to death.

327
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:34,409
("lt's All Wrong, But lt's AlI Right"
by Dolly Parton)

328
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:51,167
God darn, that lady can sing!

329
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:56,168
- And her words are so true.
- I like Elvis myself.

330
00:30:56,253 --> 00:31:00,610
Oh, l wish l could just make a whole lotta
money by openin' up my mouth and wailin'.

331
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:05,571
- That don't necessarily make 'em happy.
- What does? What does, what does, what does?

332
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:07,928
Oh, I think a man and a woman's
about your best chance.

333
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,412
Mm?

334
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:14,684
You are a fine one to talk. Didn't you tell me you got a gun,
you went skinnin' along on your belly underneath the bushes,

335
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,241
took a beat on your wife, and you was
aimin' to blow your wife's head off?

336
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,606
I was gonna burn 'em both down.

337
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:22,684
Her and her boyfriend.

338
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:26,682
But l couldn't.

339
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:32,007
She was a real good person
when we went to school together an' all.

340
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,732
Real nice person, but then, uh...

341
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:37,850
The change that come over her...

342
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,128
still really amazes me.

343
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:43,805
Listen.

344
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:48,365
I'm a lot different from what l was.

345
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:51,172
I mean, you go through things...

346
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:54,682
Hey!

347
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:58,607
Hey! Whoo! New York!
Hey, man! New York! Hey, buddy!

348
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:02,326
Hi! Hey, come on over here!

349
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:06,167
- Hey, do we need anybody else?
- The more the merrier. Reuben!

350
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:10,769
Golly! Here you are with
your papers and everything.

351
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,651
- Come on over!
- Come on, Reuben! Jeez!

352
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:17,646
How are you? Reuben, l want you to meet
Sonny. Sonny, this is Reuben Warwashawsky.

353
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,324
- How about it?
- Sonny, how are you?

354
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:24,247
- All right. Why don't you sit down?
- Come on. Sit down. Take a load off.

355
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:27,652
- What are you doin' here?
- I'm workin'.

356
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,724
- You're workin'?
- Yes.

357
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,043
- This is a drinkin' place.
- Drunk or sober, l want 'em.

358
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:36,285
- Well, can l pour you out one?
- No, no, no, thank you. I'll just have some plain Seltzer.

359
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,570
- Alright, here. You're just drinkin' club soda, then, is that it?
- That's it, I'm sorry.

360
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:44,804
Well, you're gonna feel a whole lot better
than l will tomorrow morning.

361
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:46,884
- Reuben is a union man.
- Mm-hm.

362
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:49,248
He's gonna put a union in the mill.

363
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:53,929
- But there ain't never been one.
- Then maybe its time has come.

364
00:32:55,173 --> 00:33:00,201
Well, there better be more than one of you!
Cuz there's more than one of them!

365
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:05,032
- There will be.
- Big companies get everything they want, ya know.

366
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:08,469
- Everything goes to the rich man.
- You gettin' tired of it?

367
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:13,547
Oh, when l do, l just
wash it down with beer, see?

368
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:19,504
Hey, you know what?

369
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:24,501
You know this song on the... jukebox?

370
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:27,903
This was the song... I remember it was
on the radio the night they called me up

371
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:32,623
and they told me my husband
had been killed in a fight in a beer joint.

372
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,702
Yeah, l knew Buddy Wilson. In high school.

373
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:38,990
- You did?
- Yeah. We had wood shop together.

374
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:42,664
Yeah, God.

375
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:49,183
He was drunk, and he got in a fight
and he broke a beer bottle.

376
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:53,266
And then this other guy,
he had a broken beer bottle, too.

377
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:57,990
I remember l went down
to the funeral parlor.

378
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:03,303
Cuz l wanted to see him, you know?
And this old guy, he comes out and says...

379
00:34:03,393 --> 00:34:09,389
that he didn't think it'd be a good idea if
l'd see Buddy cuz he wasn't prepared yet.

380
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:15,105
I don't know, l just...
I really just wanted to see him.

381
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:17,582
And my daddy wouldn't let me.

382
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,725
Well... that were the end of Buddy.

383
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:33,004
Far as that goes.

384
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:52,690
- I'm gonna drive.
- I'll drive.

385
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:55,287
- What do you mean, you'll drive? You're drunk.
- So are you.

386
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:58,331
I think l'll drive. No, no, no, gang. Here we go.

387
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,402
This way.

388
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:09,402
I went out with one man
and l'm comin' home with two!

389
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:13,168
Now, that sure as heck is gonna
surprise the hell outta my daddy.

390
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:18,244
- He sure keeps a close watch on you, doesn't he?
- Yeah. We're close.

391
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:24,646
I remember he used to drive 250 miles
to take me down to Crescent Beach.

392
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:31,046
He used to buy me a chicken dinner
and take me swimmin' and tell me jokes.

393
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,546
And we used to sleep in the
back of the car, ya know.

394
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,447
We'd wake up that morning and we'd walk out
on the sand. We were all wet and everything.

395
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:39,730
He bought me this ring. I wear..wear it all the time.

396
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:45,769
Reuben, would you pull the car over?
l think l'm going to be sick.

397
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:49,564
All right, hang on.

398
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,404
Easy. Easy.

399
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:55,884
You OK?

400
00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:01,971
- Come on.
- I'd help you, Norma, but l think l'd give it up too.

401
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,249
- That was real ladylike of me.
- It's all right.

402
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:19,928
I did bedpans one summer
at Stuyvesant Hospital.

403
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,723
One of these days, l'm gonna
get myself all together.

404
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:30,387
Well, make it soon. Because one of
these days, l'm gonna start in on you.

405
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:37,822
Thank you. Read this when
you have a chance, please.

406
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:41,186
I took your advice.
Got it down to two syllables.

407
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:43,070
One's better.

408
00:36:43,153 --> 00:36:47,385
Good morning. Good morning.
Read this when you have a chance, please.

409
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:51,322
Mornin', Norma Rae.

410
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,924
Hey, Lucius!

411
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,184
Mornin', Linette!

412
00:37:19,593 --> 00:37:21,185
Linette?

413
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:35,904
Hey, Billy Joe.

414
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:45,745
What the hell is goin' on around here?

415
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,644
I'm talkin' to you!

416
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:53,765
Fink!

417
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,364
Well, shit!

418
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:13,281
- Nobody out there's talkin' to me.
- Less talk, more work.

419
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:18,242
Yea, but they're my friends, and they gonna stay my friends.
I'm quittin'. I'm quittin' right here, and I'm quittin' right now.

420
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:22,929
- You're speedin' 'em up so you can weed 'em out!
- You knew all that.

421
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:31,609
Yea, well, l was greedy, and l was dumb. Now l'm
sorry, so you can just go ahead and fire me.

422
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:36,564
No, we won't do that. We'll put you
back to work in the weaving room, Norma.

423
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:39,850
Your family's been with this mill a long time.

424
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:18,182
- Good mornin'!
- Mornin'!

425
00:39:20,013 --> 00:39:21,810
- Hey.
- Hey.

426
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:24,610
We're all ready.

427
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:26,570
All of you?

428
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,723
All three of us.

429
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:36,087
- Well, then, everybody hop in!
- OK. Millie, you can climb in yourself.

430
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,370
- OK, now, be careful. Don't fall down.
- What's your name, big guy?

431
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:41,068
Craig.

432
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:46,102
That's Craig and this is Mi... Craig,
l want you to put your seat on the floor.

433
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:47,903
Bye!

434
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:49,472
- Bye, Mama!
- Bye-bye!

435
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,544
Bye, Grandma!

436
00:39:54,313 --> 00:39:56,304
I wanna sit up front.

437
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,827
- Well, you can't.
- Are we there yet?

438
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:04,590
No, we're not there yet, you silly willy.
Goodness sakes. We just started off.

439
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:08,427
- I thought we were goin' to the lake.
- We are. I gotta make a stop first.

440
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:13,306
Well, you should've done that
before you got in the car.

441
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:19,064
This is Alice.

442
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:22,024
She's mine.

443
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:28,503
Well, like l always say, the more the merrier.

444
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:33,690
OK. You gonna watch what you're doin' now?

445
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:45,652
- Next time, you get up there yourself.
- (Millie) Alice, over here!

446
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:48,327
Sure easy with your kids.

447
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,444
I yell at 'em. I swat 'em.

448
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,524
(Millie) Look at this!

449
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:57,366
You're a pretty woman.

450
00:40:57,453 --> 00:41:01,128
I was good at 18, but things
have kinda slipped and slid.

451
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:03,204
You look all right to me.

452
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,853
Keep the lights down low, l'm all right.

453
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:09,550
Well... I'll take you where it's dark.

454
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:12,848
I've been there.

455
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:31,443
I don't owe a nickel in this town.

456
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:36,448
I'll eat anything that's put down in front of me.
I can fix anything electrical.

457
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:41,766
I'm all right aft... after my first cup of coffee.
I want that bad, though.

458
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:45,047
I got me a new job at the gas station.

459
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:48,603
I turn my paycheck over
the minute l get it - that's every Friday.

460
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:52,981
And l come straight home
from work. And l stay there.

461
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:56,423
I got me and Alice.

462
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,902
We're alone.

463
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:02,190
You got your two kids. You're alone.

464
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:07,042
If you could help me...

465
00:42:08,173 --> 00:42:10,562
maybe l could help you.

466
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:16,025
It's been a long time between offers.

467
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:24,868
Kiss me.

468
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:27,148
If that's all right...

469
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:31,152
then everythin' else will be.

470
00:42:56,593 --> 00:42:59,949
And now, by the authority
vested in me by this sovereign state,

471
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:03,206
I pronounce you man and wife.

472
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:06,091
If you like, you may kiss the bride.

473
00:43:15,453 --> 00:43:20,891
Mother over here has a little homemade wine
for us. Picked the berries myself last summer.

474
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:23,064
Ah! Thank you, ma'am.

475
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,384
Thank you.

476
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,023
To my wife, Norma Rae.

477
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,824
And, uh...

478
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:38,891
I just hope l can keep up with her.

479
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:54,769
Roscoe says l shouldn't go,
but l think l'm gonna.

480
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:58,711
I'm not askin' anybody. I'm goin'.

481
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,942
On October 8th, 1970,

482
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,983
my grandfather,

483
00:44:25,073 --> 00:44:30,625
Isaac Abraham Warshawsky, aged 87,
died in his sleep in New York City.

484
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:36,310
On the following Friday morning,
his funeral was held.

485
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:41,887
My mother and father attended.
My two uncles from Brooklyn attended,

486
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:45,090
and my Aunt Minnie came up from Florida.

487
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:49,970
Also present were 862 members of
the Amalgamated Clothing Workers

488
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:53,932
and the Cloth Hat and Cap Makers
Union ofAmerica,

489
00:44:54,713 --> 00:44:56,783
also members of his family.

490
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:02,102
In death, as in life, they stood at his side.

491
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:06,049
They had fought battles with him,
had bound the wounds of battle with him,

492
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:10,445
had earned bread together,
and had broken it together.

493
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:14,242
When they spoke, they spoke in one voice,

494
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,142
and they were heard.

495
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:20,509
And they were black, and they were white.
They were lrish, and they were Polish.

496
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,710
And they were Catholic, and they were Jews.

497
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:26,102
And they were one.

498
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,787
That's what a union is.

499
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:30,965
One.

500
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:34,409
Ladies and gentlemen,

501
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:39,123
the textile industry in which you are
spending your lives and your substance,

502
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:44,048
and in which your children and their children
will spend their lives and their substance,

503
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:50,265
is the only industry in the whole length and breadth of
these United States of America that is not unionized.

504
00:45:50,953 --> 00:45:53,262
Therefore, they are free to exploit you,

505
00:45:53,353 --> 00:45:58,108
to lie to you, to cheat you, and to take away
from you what is rightfully yours.

506
00:45:58,193 --> 00:46:02,505
Your health. A decent wage.
A fit place to work.

507
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:09,987
I would urge you to stop them... by coming
over to room 31 at the Golden Cherry Motel

508
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:13,065
to pick up a union card and sign it.

509
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,265
Yes, it comes from the Bible.

510
00:46:18,353 --> 00:46:21,345
"According to the tribes of your fathers

511
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:24,224
ye shall inherit."

512
00:46:25,273 --> 00:46:30,666
But it comes from Reuben Warshawsky:
"Not unless you make it happen."

513
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,728
Thank you.

514
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:44,725
Thank you, Reverend. I appreciate it.

515
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,647
Everybody should have come.
They should have heard you.

516
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:51,986
- Next time.
- Uh-huh. If l have to drag 'em.

517
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:54,805
Hey!

518
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,488
- You preach real good.
- When you gonna join up?

519
00:46:57,573 --> 00:47:00,007
- Me? Who's got the time?
- Make time. Sleep less.

520
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:05,587
Cuz if l don't get some help soon,
l'm outta here and you got nothin'.

521
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:11,547
Hey. I appreciate any help - thank you -
that you can possibly give me.

522
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:16,070
Uh... Lickin' stamps, stuffin' envelopes,
typin' with two fingers, anything.

523
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:19,247
- I'll show up.
- All right. Thanks.

524
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:37,023
I'm here. I'm ready to inspect your plant.

525
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,384
The federal government of
the United States, brothers,

526
00:47:41,473 --> 00:47:45,512
in accordance with federal court order
number 7778, states the following:

527
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:49,722
"The union has the right to inspect every
bulletin board in the mills at least once a week

528
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:54,284
to verify in person that its notices
are not being stripped off."

529
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,732
- Do you have a trash can?
- Inside.

530
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:06,485
- Keep America beautiful.
- Downstairs.

531
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:22,604
Thank you.

532
00:48:31,853 --> 00:48:33,445
Mornin'!

533
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:45,044
- How are ya?
- Am l movin' too quick for you or somethin'?

534
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:48,682
I did my running when l was in the army.
I'm not in the army now, brother.

535
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:54,267
- Well, if you're outta shape, l'll slow down a little bit.
- Appreciate it.

536
00:48:54,353 --> 00:48:57,151
Let's keep it to a basic saunter.

537
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:08,532
Good morning! l'm Reuben Warshawsky
of the Textile Workers Union of America.

538
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,763
- What's your name, brother?
- Buffum.

539
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:12,525
Mr Buffum?

540
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:15,525
- How long have you worked here, sir?
- 12 years.

541
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:19,912
Do you like your job?

542
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:22,188
- I'd like to keep it.
- Yes, sir.

543
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:28,792
Warshawsky, you're interferin' with the work.
The court order says you can't do that.

544
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:33,764
Well, then, brother, let us both
keep to the letter of the law.

545
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:36,447
I ain't got no kike brother.

546
00:49:38,313 --> 00:49:40,747
- I don't think you meant to use that word.
- I meant it.

547
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:44,872
You did, huh? Well, shit, now l'm gonna
have to stop and get into a fight, huh?

548
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:50,186
- Come on. The bulletin board's over here.
- The bulletin board's over here.

549
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:54,824
Good morning.

550
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:04,943
Somebody's lookin' to get into a car pool.

551
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:07,911
Somebody wants to sell a basset pup.

552
00:50:07,993 --> 00:50:13,465
And you can pick pecans for 40 cents a
bushel at Selma Landing. Isn't that terrific?

553
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:16,508
The only thing missing is my notice.

554
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:19,209
It's there.

555
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:21,488
It is? l don't see it!

556
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:26,884
Ah, yes.

557
00:50:28,173 --> 00:50:31,404
Wilt Chamberlain on stilts
could read that thing, maybe.

558
00:50:31,993 --> 00:50:35,702
Wanna bring it down to eye level,
brothers, where everybody can read it?

559
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:38,387
We'll make note of your request.

560
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:42,592
Why do you guys pull this horseshit, huh?

561
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:47,144
I have to go to the phone, call my lawyers
and get 'em on your ass. That's childish!

562
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:53,102
- Well, where's the pay phone? And who's got two nickels?
- Hey!

563
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:56,228
Briggs, bring it down.

564
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,387
Eye! Eye level! Eye.

565
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:19,027
You ain't supposed to read the damn thing.

566
00:51:19,113 --> 00:51:21,991
No union organizer,
not even a known union member

567
00:51:22,073 --> 00:51:26,703
has been inside the fences and walls of this
factory for more than ten years. I'm readin' it.

568
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:30,032
- Well, read fast, then.
- While l'm readin' this,

569
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:34,231
you read the court order that says any agent
of this company can be held in contempt.

570
00:51:34,913 --> 00:51:38,792
You're messing with a contempt citation.
If you're hot for jail, you just keep it up.

571
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:42,832
- I ain't violatin' no laws.
- You're violatin' the law now, baby.

572
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:46,032
- Can we finish this?
- Certainly.

573
00:51:50,493 --> 00:51:53,053
- Where's the other bulletin board?
- In the weavin' room.

574
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:55,124
- You wanna show it to me?
- Yes, hell, yes!

575
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:56,805
Briggs!

576
00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:08,071
Good mornin'! How are ya? Mornin'!

577
00:52:09,953 --> 00:52:12,308
Good mornin'! Mornin'!

578
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:17,467
Good mornin' to ya. Good morning. I'm Warshawsky,
Textile Workers Union of America.

579
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:21,906
Good morning! Mornin' to ya.

580
00:52:21,993 --> 00:52:24,188
Good mornin', ma'am.

581
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,942
Good morning. Warshawsky,
Textile Workers Union of America.

582
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:32,070
Good morning. Good morning to you, ma'am.

583
00:52:37,873 --> 00:52:43,869
Good morning! l'm in room 31, the Golden
Cherry Motel, if you have any questions.

584
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:46,130
Thank you.

585
00:52:46,513 --> 00:52:48,504
Good morning!

586
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:52,344
Good mornin' to ya!

587
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:55,424
Good morning.

588
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:02,284
Nice.

589
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:09,842
Gentlemen, your average
working man is not stupid.

590
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:13,341
He just gets tired!

591
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:16,425
You wanna move this outta here, please?

592
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:34,321
Move it! Move the stuff!

593
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,285
Hey, Reuben?

594
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:10,406
Hey!

595
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:12,802
- You busy?
- Oh, yeah. Very busy.

596
00:54:14,373 --> 00:54:16,762
- Well, can l come in?
- Please.

597
00:54:27,713 --> 00:54:29,544
Jeez!

598
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:33,148
Don't they ever clean up around here?

599
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:38,384
I don't want them messin' up my stuff.
I know where everything is.

600
00:54:39,573 --> 00:54:43,885
- If l joined up with you, would l lose my job?
- No way.

601
00:54:43,973 --> 00:54:47,249
You can wear a union button
as big as a Frisbee when you go to work.

602
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:52,009
You can talk union to any mill hands that
wanna listen, as long as it's during a break.

603
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:54,448
You can take union pamphlets to
the mill and pass 'em along.

604
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:58,628
There's not a goddamn thing
they can do to touch you.

605
00:54:59,793 --> 00:55:02,865
I was never a very good Girl Scout.

606
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:05,069
I'll go along with you.

607
00:55:05,153 --> 00:55:07,383
You're the fish l wanted to hook.

608
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:10,785
Well...

609
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:16,985
You got me. So what the hell
you gonna do with me?

610
00:55:17,573 --> 00:55:19,848
- Make a mensch outta you, kid.
- You are?

611
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:20,809
Mm-hm.

612
00:55:21,493 --> 00:55:23,688
What is that?

613
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:30,092
Somebody who goes to the old folks' home
on Saturday morning to visit instead of playin' golf.

614
00:55:30,173 --> 00:55:33,290
Somebody who puts a dollar
in a blind man's cup for a pencil.

615
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:37,828
- I'd do that.
- Uh-huh. But would you take the pencil?

616
00:55:37,913 --> 00:55:39,585
Of course, I would. I paid for it.

617
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:42,904
Hey! Somewhere between logic and
charity, maybe there falls a little shadow.

618
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:48,362
- Reuben, if you put...
- We could debate this all night. Here.

619
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:50,045
Sign.

620
00:56:03,313 --> 00:56:05,383
"Norma Rae Webster."

621
00:56:05,773 --> 00:56:08,287
How come everybody down here
has three names?

622
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:15,172
Come on, Wayne.
Lemme pin this old thing on you.

623
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:18,051
Cover up the gravy spot on your shirt.

624
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,724
Well, now, what do l get if l do?

625
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:27,223
You don't get nothin' if you don't.
Besides, ain't you had enough of that?

626
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:31,306
You and me, we used to heat up that NCO club
down at the base pretty good. Now, remember?

627
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:35,625
- Bygone days.
- Well... then pin it on me for bygone days.

628
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:39,391
Oh, good, Wayne! l'm so proud of you!

629
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:44,024
Do you think we'll ever see
that club again, Norma, honey?

630
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:47,105
Take your wife. She doesn't get out much.

631
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:53,222
Looks like you strayed off
the reservation, Norma.

632
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:55,904
Is that right?

633
00:56:57,753 --> 00:57:01,302
You got your own
coffee machine at your end!

634
00:57:01,393 --> 00:57:05,944
Yeah, but l don't got a water fountain, and
l gotta cool down my coffee afore l drink it!

635
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:08,728
You cool everythin'!

636
00:57:24,453 --> 00:57:28,366
- Hey, Reverend!
- Well, Norma, you caught me in my shirt sleeves.

637
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:30,444
Oh, that's OK.

638
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:34,890
Maybe we can have flowers out of your yard
for Sunday. Spider mites eaten up everything.

639
00:57:35,473 --> 00:57:36,872
OK.

640
00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:41,147
Somehow l can help you, Norma?

641
00:57:42,913 --> 00:57:45,507
How long l been comin'
to this church, Reverend?

642
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:47,584
Since you were a little girl.

643
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:52,463
That's right. I accepted Christ
when l was six years old, didn't l?

644
00:57:56,913 --> 00:58:00,189
Well, would you call me a good Christian?

645
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:04,710
- With a lapse or two, l'd say so.
- "With a lapse or two."

646
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:10,492
- Would you call yourself a good Christian?
- That's for the Lord to say.

647
00:58:11,413 --> 00:58:16,885
I want this church for a union meetin' next Saturday
afternoon. That's blacks and whites sittin' together.

648
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:21,830
- This is a house of God.
- That's what I'm waitin' to see...whether it is or whether it isn't.

649
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:24,108
You're comin' mighty close to blasphemy, Norma.

650
00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:29,448
I've come here and said l sinned, and I done wrong
and l'm sorry, and l asked for God to forgive me.

651
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:31,923
Now, I wanna see what this church stands for.

652
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:36,052
I wanna see if you'll stand up on that pulpit and say
there oughta be justice, there oughta be a union,

653
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:39,011
and if you're smitten, and you
rise up, and the Lord'll be on your side.

654
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:43,252
And if you don't, then l say there ain't
nothin' good for me in that church,

655
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,052
and l'm gonna leave it flat.

656
00:58:52,253 --> 00:58:55,928
We're gonna miss your voice
in the choir, Norma.

657
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:02,963
You're gonna hear it
raised up someplace else.

658
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:19,442
Y'all go in and sit down.
I'll be in there in a minute.

659
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,848
We're holdin' a meetin' at our house,
Jimmy Jerome. Union business.

660
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:37,430
Afterward we're havin' lemonade
and cookies - ginger snaps.

661
00:59:37,513 --> 00:59:39,902
I'll roll up the front shade,
so you can see right in.

662
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:45,267
Washed my windows on Saturday.
You shouldn't have any trouble.

663
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,519
You're goin' too far now, Norma.
This here is our home.

664
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,513
- How am l goin' too far?
- There's a bunch of black men in there!

665
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,149
- You're gonna get us in a whole lotta trouble.
- I ain't never had any trouble with black men.

666
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,028
The only trouble l ever had
in my life was with white men.

667
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,569
I remember some of you
from the Chockoyotte church.

668
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,311
I did all of the talking that day.

669
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,198
Now l would like for you to speak.

670
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,832
Please.

671
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,652
A man's work should be a man's work.

672
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,571
And not a term in jail.

673
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:51,733
The black have been pushed,
pulled, and scorned. For what?

674
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,348
If the union is what everybody
believes in it, l'll follow all the way.

675
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,371
Excuse me for sayin' this
with menfolks in the room,

676
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,454
but, when l get my menstrual cramps,
which come pretty hard,

677
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,179
they don't let me sit down on my job.

678
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,832
They say you gotta keep to your feet
unless you bring a note from the doctor.

679
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,117
We wouldn't say we was sick if we wasn't.

680
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,329
You know, l look at a brick wall all day.

681
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,411
There used to be a window there,

682
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,290
but they come and brick it up
to give us the feelin' that we shut in.

683
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:38,533
My husband Averil
died of brown lung two months ago.

684
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:45,298
His children are gonna grow up
not even... knowin' him.

685
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,790
I got all his clothes if someone could use 'em.

686
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,152
I'm not gettin' the message across.

687
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,810
17 people out of 800.

688
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,992
Well... you're an outsider.

689
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,750
Things move slow around here. This isn't New York,
where you grab a taxi and grab your hat.

690
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,331
Mama, Craig's wet the bed.

691
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,012
Oh, Jeez.

692
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,888
I told him not to drink Coke
afore he went to sleep.

693
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,372
Craig?

694
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,051
Come on, sugar, wake up.

695
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,928
Get up. Put your arms
around my neck. Attaboy.

696
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,120
You got any ideas?

697
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,397
Yeah. Buy a jug of corn whisky
and meet me here on Saturday.

698
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,916
We're gonna hit the back roads.

699
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,470
Are you finished, honey? OK.

700
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,699
Now, no more Cokes afore you go to sleep.

701
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,858
How are you, Mr Robinson?

702
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,216
- How you doin' today?
- I'm busy.

703
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,689
I'm Norma Rae. You know me.

704
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,640
- Yeah! How do you do?
- Good to see you.

705
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,712
- This is my friend, Reuben.
- Hi. How ya doin'? How do ya do? So nice to see ya.

706
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,430
Listen, sir, why don't you, uh, read this,
if you will, sir, and l'll fix your tire for you?

707
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,919
How about that?

708
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,253
- You've got a deal.
- Yes, sir.

709
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,892
- Do you know how to do this?
- Are you kidding? I don't even got a car.

710
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,734
Uh, let's look like we know what we're doin'.

711
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,039
- Watch your hand.
- Reuben?

712
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,112
- What?
- I think he was takin' this thing off.

713
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,748
- I know that.
- You gonna make a baseball bat or somethin'?

714
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,989
Hey! Hey, Joe, how are you?
I want you to read one of these, will you?

715
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,312
Hey! Hey, Jake! How you doin'? Will you read
one of those for me, please? Everybody.

716
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,551
Hi, James. How are you? I want you
to meet Reuben here. He's a friend of mine.

717
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,870
How you doin', gentlemen?

718
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,357
- Would you like to read one of these, sir?
- No.

719
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,749
Elwood? Bob, you wanna read one of these?

720
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,752
- I wouldn't be interested.
- Bob, you're not interested in a union?

721
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,750
No, no.

722
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,071
Why? You think you're gonna get a better shake
from management than you are from the union?

723
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,390
- I always have.
- You always have, huh?

724
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,959
- Yeah.
- Ow!

725
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,237
Damn glad you cut it.

726
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,079
That's telling him about it, Bob.

727
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,118
- Hey, Robert!
- Hi, Norma!

728
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,918
- How are you?
- Fine.

729
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,797
- We come out...
- Argh!

730
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,616
It's only grass and water, Reuben.

731
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,554
- This is where we used to swim when we were kids.
- Oh, yeah?

732
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:32,510
We'd come down here after we'd hookied off from
school and shuck off our clothes and jump in.

733
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,536
The only water hole
l ever saw when l was a kid...

734
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:40,135
when we used to open the fire
hydrant on 110th and Riverside

735
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,688
with a monkey wrench.

736
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,197
- This is the life!
- It's just an old mud hole.

737
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,840
Oh, it's terrific. It's coolin' off my mosquito bites.

738
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,710
Oh, well... this is as clean
as l'm gonna get this.

739
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,291
Thank you.

740
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,132
Whoo!

741
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,211
It is hot.

742
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,535
- I'm comin' in.
- Come on.

743
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,717
(Reuben) Great!

744
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,031
You know what?

745
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:32,319
There used to be this old farmer
that lived round here... with a BB gun.

746
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,290
- Sure hope he's moved away.
- Yeah. Me too.

747
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,728
What the hell is that? Get out...
There's somethin' flickin' around my...

748
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,311
- Those are minnows.
- Those are what?

749
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,960
- Minnows. They won't hurt you.
- They'd better not.

750
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,555
You sure are a fish outta water down here.

751
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,474
This is not exactly my native habitat. No.

752
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:01,011
Reuben, what would you be doin'
on a day like this at home?

753
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:07,569
Play some handball at the Y.
Go see Aida at the Met.

754
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:12,089
Eat Chinese. Play a little poker. Hit the sack.

755
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,774
I've been two places in my life.

756
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,773
I've been to Henleyville.
Been on down to Piston.

757
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,075
Oh, you'd love New York. You would. Wow!

758
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,675
Super town. Most beautiful
women in the world.

759
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,478
Best food.

760
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,437
Opera. Theatre.

761
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,397
Ballet.

762
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,269
Reuben... you're homesick.

763
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,476
Oy vey!

764
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,437
God!

765
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,294
Reuben...

766
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,938
You got a skinny build.

767
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,612
Yeah.

768
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,768
Sonny works out with weights.

769
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,111
I tried that.

770
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,992
I dropped 'em and broke my goddamn foot.

771
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,472
Well...

772
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,295
You don't gotta worry.

773
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,648
Cuz you got a head on you.

774
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,451
And you use it.

775
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,332
What?

776
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,789
Well...I know why we got a bad connection here,
Henry. It's cuz l think the line is bein' tapped.

777
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,094
Hey, you! Whosever listenin' in on this,

778
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:50,200
this is Norma Rae Webster, and l'm talkin' union
to Henry Willis. I'm on tonight and every night.

779
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,534
Same old story. No commercials.
Union, union, union.

780
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,737
Look, why don't you
have your bossman tap me,

781
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,176
and then you can go on home
to your wife and kids?

782
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,854
Henry, let... Henry!

783
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,531
Oh, shoot!

784
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,094
You ain't gettin' any sleep.

785
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,695
I ain't gettin' any sleep and
we gotta get to work in the mornin'.

786
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,977
I got a hundred calls to make tonight.

787
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,635
- Is that goin' on our phone bill?
- Take it outta my paycheck, alright?

788
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,915
Damn milk is sour.

789
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,915
I didn't have a chance to get to the market.

790
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,468
Oh, you didn't have a chance
to get to the market, did ya?

791
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,951
And you didn't get to the washin', and you didn't
get to the kids, and you didn't get to me.

792
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,577
- Is that right?
- That's right. That's right.

793
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:44,448
Damn TV dinners,
kids goin' around in dirty jeans!

794
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:47,054
I'm goin' around, uh, without!

795
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,732
Altogether!

796
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,096
You want cookin'?

797
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,471
You got cookin'.

798
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,111
You want laundry?

799
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,471
You got laundry.

800
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,011
You want ironin'?

801
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:34,898
You got ironin'.

802
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:40,054
You wanna make love? You get behind me, and
lift up my nightie, and we're gonna make love.

803
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,555
Norma.

804
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,831
Norma!

805
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,194
Hey.

806
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,199
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

807
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,679
Shh.

808
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,478
Veta, will you come down to the Golden Cherry this
time. Don't just read it and nod your head at me.

809
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:12,472
Hey, Doris. Millicent. Now, do as I want. You come on down
to the Golden Cherry and bring your peanut-butter pie.

810
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,815
Hey, Vicky. Debra. How's your little one?

811
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,972
Heard he got the measles.
Keep him away from mine, will you?

812
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,135
Hey, Brenda! How's your new baby?

813
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,929
Listen, get on down to the Golden Cherry,
will you? You can type. l know you can type.

814
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,251
Hey, get on down to the Golden Cherry,
will you, and help us out?

815
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:32,733
Sue, now, come on, read this.
Every single word of it's important.

816
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:37,814
And come on down to the Golden Cherry.
Cuz if l got the time, you got the time.

817
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:51,169
Well, l don't bump into you
much anymore, do l?

818
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,252
- You all right, Daddy?
- About the same.

819
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,874
Your color's bad. You been drinkin'?

820
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,475
- Thimbleful now and then.
- Well, you know it's not good for you.

821
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:09,715
Oh, honey, what's the difference? Sometimes
l wonder when l lie down if l'm gonna get up again.

822
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,372
Don't talk old to me. I don't like it.

823
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,492
Listen...

824
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,192
I'm gonna come over there
one of these nights real soon

825
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,477
and take you out to a grand supper.
How about that?

826
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,234
- OK.
- OK.

827
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,719
OK.

828
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,830
James, uh... coming back?

829
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,511
I guess so.

830
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,870
- Where'd he go? Home?
- I don't know.

831
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:13,217
Jeez. I oughta be goin' home, too.

832
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,498
Hey... how's Dorothy?

833
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,133
Terrific. Thanks.

834
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:28,178
I see you got a new picture of her.

835
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,094
Oh, yeah. You like it, huh?
My mother sent that.

836
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:36,449
She and your mother,
they must get along real well.

837
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,373
Are you kidding? My mother loves her.

838
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:44,735
She's a lawyer, she's lefto,
she's Jewish, and she's a great cook.

839
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,459
What the hell else could she want?

840
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,856
How come she's so smart?

841
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,032
Dorothy?

842
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,512
Books.

843
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,958
Oh, oh, madame, your dinner.

844
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,908
Le grand banana and a beer.

845
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,399
No.

846
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,897
Who's this? Dylan Thomas.

847
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,820
He was a poet.

848
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,095
Genius and a drunk.

849
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,560
What's he write about?

850
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,518
Love, sex, death.

851
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,433
Other matters of consequence.

852
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,398
- Is he hard to read?
- Ah.

853
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,277
Ah.

854
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:42,150
- So why should l bother?
- Cuz maybe he has somethin' to say to you.

855
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,071
Open that, will you?

856
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,388
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

857
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

858
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,211
Well, l'll try him.

859
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,732
Good.

860
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,138
Ew!

861
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,575
There ain't nothin' on TV but reruns anyway.

862
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:11,333
Hey, ya wanna do me a favor. Don't eat while
you read. I can't stand banana in my books.

863
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,309
Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch!

864
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,091
Hey, Warren!

865
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,699
Warren!

866
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,734
Hey, man. What's happened?
Nobody showed up at the meeting.

867
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,457
- They got us on a stretchout.
- Oh, man.

868
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,770
Put us on a three-day week.

869
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,852
Twice as much work for half the pay.

870
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,818
- All on account of you.
- Hey, just a second, huh?

871
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,892
Now, you just stand there for a minute.

872
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,419
Oh, man.

873
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,010
Now, there are six turnips
and two quarts of water in there.

874
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,592
That's supper for seven people.

875
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:42,674
- You just go sell your union someplace else.
- Hey, l'm tryin' to get you...

876
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,474
My arm's gone numb on me, Jimmy.
I think l better go and lie down.

877
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,918
Y'all got a break comin' up
in 15 minutes, Vernon.

878
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,393
- I think l better go now, Jimmy.
- Y'all hang on, Vernon. Your break is comin' up.

879
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,089
I'll loan you a bucket, Lucius, in a minute.

880
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,618
Mavis.

881
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,292
Rhonda.

882
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,371
Hey, Betty.

883
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:42,698
You get off the shift at 3:00.
You're supposed to be here at 3:15.

884
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:46,534
It's 4.15. Where the hell you been?
Workin' for this union or aren't you?

885
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:51,091
- I was gettin' my tooth filled.
- You were gettin' your beer gut filled!

886
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,439
Chew your old man out at home
and get off of me, Norma.

887
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,752
I'm just startin' in on you. Now, l'm givin'
nine, ten, eleven, twelve hours here.

888
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,072
That's every day. There's a pile of work around here.
We're doin' our share, but either you do your share,

889
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,870
- but don't call yourself a union member.
- Norma! Shut your cakehole.

890
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:14,336
- In fact, get the hell outta the office.
- What'd l do? l only said what was true.

891
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,138
Out.

892
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,211
Come on.

893
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,639
Peter, get to work, man. Come on.

894
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,677
Let's go. Everybody back to work. Come on.

895
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,832
Mouth.

896
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,388
You're too muscular. You can't come down
that hard on the man and leave him his balls.

897
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:58,319
Easy, Jesus! lf you were in
the State Department, we'd be at war.

898
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,899
OK.

899
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,697
- You're right. I got a big mouth.
- Mm-hm.

900
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,998
You know, cotton-mill workers
are known as trash to some.

901
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:20,516
I know the union's the only way we're gonna
get our own voice, make ourselves any better.

902
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,495
I guess that's why l push.

903
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:26,616
Our own Mother Jones.

904
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,736
Who's she?

905
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:34,816
She was some considerable lady. She made it
happen for the coal miners in West Virginia.

906
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,391
You ain't mad at me.

907
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:45,595
If the situation ever called for a smart,
loud, profane, sloppy, hard-workin' woman...

908
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,519
I'd pick you every time, kid.

909
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,593
Well, how come "sloppy"?
Nobody wears girdles any more.

910
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:00,354
- Whattaya givin' this to me for? l didn't order it.
- Well, hey, you ate it!

911
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,294
- Whatta ya want?
- Warshawsky around?

912
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,696
Reuben's at the printer's.

913
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,340
Pretty late for the printer's.

914
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,292
Yeah, well, Reuben keeps him workin' late.

915
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,713
You're Norma Rae, aren't you?

916
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,199
Hm?

917
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,794
I'm Mrs Webster.

918
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,395
We're from the union, national headquarters.
This is Al London, and l'm Sam Dakin.

919
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,040
Is that right?

920
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:52,977
Well, now that you're here, l might as well
give you my shoppin' list. Let me see.

921
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:57,258
We need some more envelopes. We need some
stamps. We're almost outta typin' paper.

922
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:01,458
Hey! We could do with a loudspeaker.
How about some typewriters that don't stick?

923
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:07,194
- We're not in office supplies, Mrs Webster.
- And you aren't around here much, either.

924
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,271
Ah, hello, Reuben.

925
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,351
- Sam. How are you?
- All right.

926
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,670
- Gettin' fat.
- Put on a couple of pound.

927
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,150
- Al, how are you?
- Lousy. I got a cold.

928
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,149
What brings you guys?

929
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,959
You're not gettin' up
much of a head of steam, Reuben.

930
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,338
You've had my reports.
You know what l'm up against.

931
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,854
- We're worried.
- That makes three of us.

932
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,977
This is a small
Southern Baptist town, Reuben.

933
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,759
- You gotta keep your nose very clean.
- Well, you see any snot in mine?

934
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:45,409
Maybe, uh, Mrs Webster'd like to leave.

935
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,288
- Why should she leave?
- Cuz this concerns her. And I'm tryin' to make it easy...

936
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:54,170
Ah, come on, will you, please?
lt's late. What do you guys want?

937
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:00,657
Company wants us to look bad, they're gonna
use anything they can to make us look bad.

938
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,135
Reuben, the mill hands in this town
go to church every Sunday.

939
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,018
And she's talking union to them.

940
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:16,972
They say she's made a porno movie with
a local police officer. Very explicit one.

941
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,977
- Show it to me. Run it for me, will ya please.
- Oh, come on.

942
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:27,114
There doesn't have to be a movie,
just people talk like there's one!

943
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:33,570
The lady has an illegitimate child. She's slept
around. She takes naps on your bed late at night...

944
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,373
-I don't believe this.
-Whatta ya mean, you don't believe...

945
01:23:36,397 --> 01:23:39,297
Are we in the union business or are we
in the character-assassination business?

946
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:44,215
All of a sudden, after l put in an 18-hour day,
l got the legion of decency on my hands here.

947
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,734
Do you know that this woman has
broken her ass for this organization?

948
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,959
She doesn't see her kids.
She doesn't have time to take a bath.

949
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:54,079
What the hell do l care if she has round heels? What is
this? The Catholic church? We're gonna canonize her?

950
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,230
- Hey, Reuben. It's your game.
- You're goddamn right it is!

951
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,938
- But we think she oughtta go.
- Well, make it stick.

952
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:02,511
If you can't, get the hell outta here!
Just get the hell outta here, anyway.

953
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,415
I'm sorry, Mrs Webster.

954
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:21,058
I don't wanna hurt the union, Reuben.
I'll quit if you want me to.

955
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:26,339
What were you doing sleepin'? You were
supposed to type some letters for me, weren't ya?

956
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,012
Yeah.

957
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:54,975
Hey. It's me, Norma.

958
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:01,340
OK, it's l, Norma. Will you forget the
grammar? Look, l gotta talk to you right away.

959
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,358
Um...

960
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,193
Maybe you can meet me at my break.

961
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,679
OK.

962
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,159
Just talkin' to my kids. Make sure
they got home from school alright.

963
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:20,211
Your kids are with my kids
at the grocery store buying candy.

964
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:24,377
Maybe that's why
my dentist bills is bustin' me.

965
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,859
Hey!

966
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,639
You want union? You'll get union! OK?

967
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,051
Break it up! Break it up!

968
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,051
Break it up!

969
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,290
Break it up! Break...

970
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,238
- You OK, man?
- You all right?

971
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,836
- What started this?
- They put up a letter.

972
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,790
They're tellin' the whites that the
blacks are gonna take over the union.

973
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,091
They gonna run it and push 'em around.

974
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:12,172
And any time you tell a white man a black man's
gonna sit on his head, this is what you get.

975
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:16,972
I love it when these pricks get mean. We can
take legal action. Now you get me the letter.

976
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,079
I can't just waltz in there and take it
off the board. They watchin' me.

977
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,958
- How good is your memory?
- I still don't know the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.

978
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,349
Get somebody to help ya. Write
it down, a line at a time.

979
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,000
Oh, Jesus, this reminds me of the time
l pinched a lipstick off a five and dime .

980
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,355
- Did you get caught?
- I went back next week for curlers.

981
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,512
- Then you know how to do it, kid!
- OK!

982
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,154
"..do-min-ate... it...

983
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,994
and... con-trol... it...

984
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:16,974
as... you... may... see... fit."

985
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,168
"lf... now..."

986
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,751
"lf now..."

987
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,549
Damn!

988
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,789
Damn! Damn! Damn!

989
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,510
"You black employees are being told
that by going into the union en masse

990
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,912
you can dominate it and control it
in this plant as you may see fit."

991
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,877
"lf..."

992
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,679
- Where's the rest of it?
- That's all l could get.

993
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,332
- Mata Hari.
- No, they was watchin' us every single minute.

994
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:48,298
This is the best chance we got to nail these
bastards, to catch 'em with their pants down.

995
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,668
So don't tell me you can't remember it.
Sweetheart, you walk up to it, you stand there

996
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,910
and you copy it down word for
word, line for line.

997
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,039
You get me the date. You get me the signature, you
get it all, and you get it back here to me. Come on.

998
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,417
- I'm gonna get fired.
- I'll run you a benefit.

999
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,456
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- Hey!

1000
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:09,137
You wanna get massaged, you go to a massage
parlor. Either we get beat or we don't get beat. Come on!

1001
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:15,051
I got three kids, a drawerful of bills, and
a husband who doesn't like what l'm doin'.

1002
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:18,856
Now I'll do it. But I don't need your
boot on my back side, Mr Warshawski.

1003
01:28:18,857 --> 01:28:20,257
Goddamn sludge has been sittin'
around here for three days.

1004
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:23,757
- Reuben, I'm gonna tell you somethin'!
- What are ya gonna tell me, Norma?

1005
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,928
You've been away from home a long time.
You been all business, and you gettin' crabby.

1006
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,739
Reuben! You need yourself a woman.

1007
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:35,859
Funny you should mention it.
Tonight's the night.

1008
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,591
- Well, what would Dorothy say?
- Wear a rubber.

1009
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,759
- "..that... where..."
- You can't copy this letter!

1010
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,992
- It's up on the bulletin board. I'm gonna copy it.
- Norma, you better not.

1011
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,196
I'm gonna take down every word of this letter.

1012
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:59,068
It's my break time, and l'm gonna
take down every word of this letter.

1013
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:03,551
Just stay outta my way. I'm gonna
take down every word of this letter.

1014
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:07,257
"..occur. Strikes..."

1015
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:11,299
- Hello, Norma.
- Mr Mason. You know who l am. "..means..."

1016
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,019
- Put the pencil and paper away.
- "..loss... of..."

1017
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,933
- You stop what you're doin' right now.
- "..cause of..."

1018
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:21,616
You're gonna leave. The law's gonna come
after you and take you right out of this plant.

1019
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,689
"..jobs."

1020
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,353
Mr Mason, l started this
and l'm gonna finish it.

1021
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,680
"..serious violence."

1022
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,349
Let's go to my office, Norma.

1023
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:52,431
Why did you make those personal
phone calls on company time?

1024
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,469
I want you all to spell out your names for me.

1025
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,440
Don't be foolish, Norma Rae.

1026
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,393
Mr Mason, no one around here is on my side,

1027
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,473
and l'm not gonna leave until l set down
all your names on this piece of paper.

1028
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:18,575
Lady, l want you off the premises now!

1029
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,371
You phone your husband. You come
over here and tell him to fetch you!

1030
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,452
I want you outta here right quick!

1031
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,269
- Norma Rae...
- Forget it!

1032
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,776
I'm staying put!

1033
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,055
Right where l am!

1034
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,817
It's gonna take you,
and the police department,

1035
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,894
and the fire department,
and the National Guard to get me outta here!

1036
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,697
I'm waitin' for the sheriff
to come and take me home!

1037
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,477
And l ain't gonna budge till he gets here!

1038
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,489
Come on down now, Norma Rae.

1039
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,611
Come on down now.

1040
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,934
You heard what l said. Come on down.

1041
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,937
Lamar...

1042
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:33,289
I want you to put it in writin'

1043
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:39,933

take Norma Rae Webster straight home,

1044

1045

and l want you to hand it to me.

1046
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:51,780
Don't you tell me what to do, young lady.
You're getting nothing from me in writing.

1047
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:56,058
- Mr Mason, you want her off the premises?
- Take her out.

1048
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:03,434
I don't know if l wanna get in the same car
with you and nobody else.

1049
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,717
Lamar... I ain't gonna bite you.

1050
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:42,216
That's a police car.
You're taking me to jail! No!

1051
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:46,254
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Quit that scrappin' now!

1052
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,332
You're going' where we're takin' you!
You're goin' to jail!

1053
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,911
- No!
- Get her feet in there.

1054
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,639
No! No! No!

1055
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,075
- No!
- Get in there, now.

1056
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,311
- No! No!
- Get in there.

1057
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,391
Get her in there.

1058
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,129
No!

1059
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,332
No!

1060
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:24,215
Webster, Norma Rae.

1061
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:28,691
704 Priesta Road, Henleyville.

1062
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:32,295
She's white, female, 31.

1063
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:35,294
Occupation, textile.

1064
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:39,373
Dark complexion, brown hair, brown eyes.

1065
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,078
Arrest number 2238B.

1066
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,357
Charge, disorderly conduct.

1067
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:52,332
Norma Rae, you're goin' with her now.

1068
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:14,738
(woman) Might as well sit down.

1069
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,619
(Miller) You got one phone call.

1070
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,691
Better call Sonny.

1071
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:24,772
I'll be callin' my union organizer.

1072
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:32,312
I know the first time you're in is bad.

1073
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,675
It comes with the job.

1074
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,080
I saw a pregnant woman on a picket line
get hit in the stomach with a club.

1075
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,152
I saw a boy of 16 get shot in the back.

1076
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:14,937
I saw a guy get blown to hell and back when
he tried to start up his car in the morning.

1077
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,637
And you just got your feet wet on this one.

1078
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,633
Norma.

1079
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,711
You all right?

1080
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,151
I put the kids to bed.

1081
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:56,378
Craig.

1082
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:59,497
Honey, wake up. It's Mama.

1083
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:04,449
Wake up, sugar, l wanna talk to you.
Come on. Put your arms around my neck.

1084
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:08,692
Alice, wake up. Millie, wake up.
I wanna talk to you, sweetheart.

1085
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,589
Come on in the living room.

1086
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,675
Come on. Attagirl.

1087
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,751
I love you kids.

1088
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,075
That's the first thing.

1089
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,391
And Sonny loves you.

1090
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:52,049
You got the both of us.

1091
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,531
Second thing is...

1092
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,391
I'm a jailbird.

1093
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:08,435
Now, you're gonna be hearin' that,
and a lot of other things.

1094
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,512
But you're gonna hear it from me first.

1095
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:18,771
Millie...

1096
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:21,852
your daddy, his name was Buddy Wilson.

1097
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:25,857
And he died four months after you was born.

1098
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,912
Craig...

1099
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,556
I wasn't never married to your daddy.

1100
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,915
And he wasn't Buddy.

1101
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,275
And he's not Sonny.

1102
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,851
He's another man.

1103
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:47,291
And there been others in my life.

1104
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:50,372
You're gonna be hearin' about them, too.

1105
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,311
I'm not perfect.

1106
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,191
I made mistakes.

1107
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:12,517
Millie, these are pictures of your daddy.

1108
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,838
Craig, l got pictures of your daddy.

1109
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,155
They belong to you.

1110
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,229
If you go in the mill,

1111
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,835
I want life to be better for you
than it is for me.

1112
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:45,959
That's why l joined up with the union,
and that's why l got fired for it.

1113
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,071
You understand me?

1114
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,671
Now, you kids...

1115
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,375
you know what l am.

1116
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:09,651
And you know that l believe in
standin' up for what l think is right.

1117
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:23,972
Go to the bathroom
before you get back into bed.

1118
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:26,971
Take your pictures.

1119
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,031
Go on.

1120
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,355
Gonna take a bath.

1121
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,469
There's lice in that jail.

1122
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,512
She had one call and she called you.

1123
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,314
She knew l could make bail.

1124
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:11,836
You come in here, you mix her up,
you turn her head all around.

1125
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,531
She's all changed.

1126
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:21,778
I didn't want that.
I didn't want her to be a frontrunner.

1127
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,679
What's gonna happen to us now?

1128
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:32,070
She stood up on a table. She's a free woman.

1129
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,357
Maybe you can live with it, maybe you can't.

1130
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,309
Busted my shoelace.

1131
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:53,910
- There's another one in the drawer.
- I busted that one last week.

1132
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,838
Did you ever sleep with him?

1133
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,512
No.

1134
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,115
But he's in my head.

1135
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:18,452
I'm gonna see you through gettin' tired...

1136
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,331
gettin' sick...

1137
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,971
gettin' old.

1138
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,895
I'm gonna see you through
anything that comes up.

1139
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,778
And there's nobody else in my head.

1140
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:41,175
Just you.

1141
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:19,876
Folks, ballots tabulated for
the OP Henley Company against the union,

1142
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,474
373.

1143
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,472
Folks...

1144
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:53,728
Now, for the union, 425.

1145
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,934
Yeah, we done it, baby! Union!

1146
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:16,090
Union! Union! Union! Union!
Union! Union! Union! Union!

1147
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:32,171
Union! Union! Union! Union! Union!

1148
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:20,413
- You gonna drive straight through?
- Yes.

1149
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:25,494
- You better stop for coffee to stay awake.
- I got a Thermos in the car.

1150
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,632
Well...

1151
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,798
"Well"?

1152
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:33,949
Well.

1153
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,679
Well!

1154
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:40,093
So, what are you gonna do now?

1155
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:41,329
- Live.
- Yeah.

1156
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,570
What else?

1157
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:47,209
Now, you drop me a line once in a while, OK?

1158
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:51,009
- Anyone read your mail?
- Well, my mother...

1159
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,878
How about l send you
a copy of Dylan Thomas?

1160
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,633
I already bought one for myself.

1161
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,597
You did?

1162
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,478
Nobody can do anything for ya, huh?

1163
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,272
You've done something for me.

1164
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:12,851
A lot.

1165
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:19,158
Well, you did somethin' for us.

1166
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:23,517
A mitzvah.

1167
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,829
- What's that?!
- What is that?!

1168
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,031
That's a good work.

1169
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:35,718
I don't say goodbye. No.

1170
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:38,394
I have been known to cry.

1171
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,869
- Well, what do you say?
- Uh...

1172
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,748
Be happy. Be well.

1173
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:48,171
Same to you.

1174
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:57,291
B-best wishes don't
seem hardly enough.

1175
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:58,859
I...

1176
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:01,329
I'd like to thank you.

1177
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:07,010
I do. I... I thank you for your companionship,

1178
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:12,054
your stamina, your horse sense,

1179
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:15,212
and a hundred and one laughs.

1180
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:19,932
I also enjoyed very much...

1181
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:24,252
looking at your shining hair
and your shining face.

1182
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,254
Reuben, l think you like me.

1183
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,191
I do.

1184
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:39,952
I was gonna buy ya a tie clip or some shavin'
lotion or something, but l didn't know what you'd like.

1185
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:45,991
Norma, what l've had from you
has been sumptuous.
