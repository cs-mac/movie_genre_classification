1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,085
In previous episodes.

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,504
What did you put in the stamps Chaz?

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,007
Codeine and morphine to soften the brain.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,801
Take in as soon as it will not.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,512
You are married.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:18,101
but it is in cahoots with Sykes.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,399
Flying to be careful that your mother is not a crime.

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,276
I ask you a favor.

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,277
My new assistant.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,754
In business, the easiest to forget,

11
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,839
these are the feelings of others.

12
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,592
2 weeks ago

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,011
because of its

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,930
with senior managers ".

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,350
and if it looks back

16
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,019
and served coffee.

17
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,315
but we all do.

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,859
How are you?

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,320
Very good.

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,243
I'm very good.

21
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,330
It does not work yet.

22
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,667
I am too well the small tasks to be entrusted me big.

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,670
I trust you and believe in you.

24
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,300
It does not displease me to be your assistant. Simply ...

25
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,845
- I could do more. - It will come.

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,472
I promise you.

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,852
You'll be late for an appointment with Mr. Gracen.

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,275
The FBI will land next week

29
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,903
and accuse me of selling missiles to China.

30
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,905
What are their sources?

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,283
They come from the government and are infallible.

32
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:02,497
It's not you, but one of our subsidiaries, Wong Industries.

33
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,416
The board does not care.

34
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,920
I wanted this deal. If they open the investigation, I'm fired.

35
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,257
It is a new redemption, we can break before the survey.

36
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,926
By aligning 100 million dollar fine?

37
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,262
The board chÃ¢trerait me.

38
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,224
Wong selling missile components to the Chinese.

39
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,019
We must get rid of them quickly

40
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,479
without paying a fine.

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,274
For that, I need your help.

42
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,235
I know you will reach there in one way or another.

43
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,050
Wong is equally disturbed Industries

44
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,678
by the FBI investigation that you, Mr. Profit.

45
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,806
We shall break our relationship before the start of the investigation.

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,184
I do not think it will be possible.

47
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,436
Why did you agree to see me?

48
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,521
Come into my office.

49
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,400
The device is called

50
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,321
Ultrachip, you know?

51
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,574
It is a descrambler.

52
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,537
Its user can penetrate all systems. It has been developed.

53
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,540
It was Dr. Jeremy Batewell who developed

54
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,168
and embarked upon leaving your company.

55
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,505
It is coveted by your Ministry of Defence.

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,717
I understand. You also want.

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
And how!

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,432
You will break our agreements if you get it back? No fine?

59
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,059
Absolutely.

60
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,188
If I were the suspicious type,

61
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,274
I would think that you have this handset to retrieve it.

62
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,069
I wish you success.

63
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,991
The good doctor Jeremy Batewell.

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,371
in G & G for 5 years.

65
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,125
Ultrachip the descrambler.

66
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,003
for unknown reasons.

67
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,672
of intense speculation

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,508
Washington and elsewhere.

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,135
Sadly

70
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,304
at G & G was shortened

71
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,433
who accused him of sexual harassment.

72
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,728
was returned.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,106
s'appelait Gail Koner.

74
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,150
You remember her.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,029
The temptress of hell. You know her?

76
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,614
I can enter?

77
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,119
G & G wants to talk about what happened?

78
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,872
to keep you returning.

79
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,167
it misinterpreted

80
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
emotional and fleeting.

81
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,423
What is your interest in all this?

82
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,218
This is my assistant. I like it.

83
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,681
She would like to buy but do not dare take the first step.

84
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,142
You are telling me

85
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,144
she wants me?

86
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,940
I almost go to court to get rid of this man.

87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,735
He has to come back into your life.

88
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,234
Batewell something we want.

89
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,153
You only can we provide.

90
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,448
Listen ...

91
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,035
I do not know what you know, but ...

92
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,665
I read the report. I know he called you, you followed ...

93
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,794
He held obscene about yourself in public.

94
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,338
He touched you, caressed ...

95
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,049
I do things for you that I should not do.

96
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,344
You also do for me, but I will not do that.

97
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,638
Call the police, send me to prison ...

98
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,473
You send ...?

99
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,104
I will never force you to do anything.

100
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,527
Go see your mother.

101
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,821
It's late, visits will stop.

102
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,452
Good evening mother.

103
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,954
How do you feel?

104
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,792
Doctors say you take strength.

105
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,880
They say you're going to get you out.

106
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,925
They also say that you can hear me.

107
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,803
It's true?

108
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,683
I need you, Mom.

109
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,936
You see, I made

110
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,523
ugly things to make you care.

111
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,693
I could give you all that, but now,

112
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,571
I feel depress me even more.

113
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,955
Fax intercept my brother, this is sometimes pleasing.

114
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,584
On Friday, the office will be infested by the FBI.

115
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,587
Chaz will be returned faster than we think.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,508
Okay, but I have bad news.

117
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,136
Profit sent us a draft separation.

118
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,098
You abstracts me?

119
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,975
He hopes to cut us off from Wong before the survey.

120
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,062
For that, it will bring 100 million.

121
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,272
He must have a reason. I followed.

122
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,151
You really have a sneaky side.

123
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,405
Profit went to Jeremy Batewell.

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,365
The mad scientist?

125
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,700
He had been fired.

126
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,202
He continues to develop defense systems.

127
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,288
Wong would love to get their hands on.

128
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,042
It could be extremely serious.

129
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,628
Profit and Chaz could end up in jail.

130
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,050
Jim is a friend. It is very useful to our society.

131
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,847
As for Chaz imagine in prison, I really like the idea.

132
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,228
Profit could use as his assistant Batewell covets.

133
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,647
He was fired for trying to skip it.

134
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,733
Very good.

135
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,611
Chaz does not let escape.

136
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,622
It left for detoxification.

137
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,460
- I will inform you about our deal. - And I, on Profit.

138
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,803
Sorry it did not call. She's a bit disoriented.

139
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,263
Her mother goes wrong.

140
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,808
I feel that mocks me.

141
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,605
She is very concerned. Be understanding.

142
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,108
I will. I censure me for what ...

143
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,569
200 days. No letters,

144
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,779
or call ...

145
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,448
on a government contract,

146
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,492
but his mind has been busy.

147
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,952
All that to agree to wait.

148
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,623
I know you are very busy. She will call tonight.

149
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,002
How are you?

150
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,338
You'll see my brother?

151
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,883
I would like to leave a message for Bobby Stokowski. It's urgent.

152
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,469
Tell him I still called ...

153
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,054
Pete, I'm on the phone.

154
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,306
I wanted to say goodbye.

155
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,183
I go.

156
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,437
In rehab. As you have asked me.

157
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,109
She knows my number. Thank you.

158
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,905
Jim, enter and close the door.

159
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,078
You did well in need.

160
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,706
From now on,

161
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,624
everything will change.

162
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,918
I hope.

163
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,548
You'll be surprised

164
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,176
to see how quickly things will change.

165
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,860
- It advances with Wong? - All was launched.

166
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,696
We will be released by Friday?

167
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,699
Yes, if all goes as planned.

168
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,788
Your wife is on line one.

169
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,790
I have for a second.

170
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,085
Good morning my darling.

171
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,589
- How are you? - I have a lot of work.

172
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,801
Finally, I will stay here until the end of the month.

173
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,512
I walk well on this story and I thought ...

174
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,765
Perfect. I miss you, have fun though.

175
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,892
I'm not here to write for fun.

176
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,269
We talk soon.

177
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,736
My wife thinks he's a writer.

178
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,031
This is more economical than when she played the architect.

179
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
I always have this migraine.

180
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,661
Since...

181
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,041
and gives him more morphine.

182
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,881
I try to reach your friend, Bobby. She does not remember ...

183
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,966
I got it yesterday.

184
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,635
And?

185
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,596
You are Marie.

186
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,891
Tell him this.

187
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,145
My divorce Constance would have legal consequences

188
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,856
for my family and this company.

189
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,274
This is what she wants?

190
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,985
I'll tell him you want to talk to him.

191
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,700
When you invited me to lunch,

192
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,119
I imagined something more class.

193
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,997
I could flirt with you and do the usual cinema

194
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,209
but I just wanted to be alone with you

195
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,671
to know what you think of Jim Profit.

196
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,508
It is complicated.

197
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,471
We are alone. There is no spy, it is far from G & G.

198
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,973
By the.

199
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,393
It's a dangerous guy that follows rules that I not know.

200
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,894
There are no rules.

201
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,771
If you stuck, you will be fired.

202
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,024
That's why I need a friend.

203
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,901
It's not for my mind and my smile?

204
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,154
Read that and then destroy it.

205
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,449
You tell me what you think of Profit during dinner.

206
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,242
A dinner in your office?

207
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,327
- In my car. - Your car!

208
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,748
Why Mr. Gracen office?

209
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,501
I want to show you something.

210
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,296
It should be here so late?

211
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,591
Of course. That's your problem.

212
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,093
You do not imagine in an office like this.

213
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,764
Do not you think you might be at the top.

214
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,767
Sit down.

215
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:44,115
Why this? You are as hardworking, intelligent,

216
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,409
as gifted as Gracen.

217
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,372
I believe in you.

218
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,750
You have a bright future in this business.

219
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,548
The key to this success depends on the choices you make.

220
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,053
All choices made with me were the right choices.

221
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,349
If I tell you that we will look after you,

222
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,351
and your mother,

223
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,603
you believe me?

224
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:20,110
And if I tell you that I have plans for you?

225
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,112
- Although I want you to believe. - Very good.

226
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,989
If I tell you to call Batewell,

227
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,660
you know that you risk nothing, is not it?

228
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,499
I do not know what you want me to do.

229
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,588
I want you call and tell him ...

230
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,758
Dr. Batewell.

231
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,137
I would like to explain my true feelings.

232
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,097
Go for it.

233
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,351
I love when you call me, you touch me,

234
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,978
at the office.

235
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,024
other women, I was jealous.

236
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,693
Your jealousy made me suffer a lot.

237
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:06,448
What I said about the harassment, it was wrong.

238
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,242
That is why I would like to redeem myself.

239
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,704
It's more like penance than of love.

240
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,790
I wonder if your boss does not push you.

241
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,919
- Do not forget who you work for.

242
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,838
G & G hopes to take me?

243
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:25,592
You are part of the lot of my eventual rehiring?

244
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,641
If you do not want to listen to me, let's drop.

245
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,852
I wanted to talk to us.

246
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,438
From what we could live, but I was wrong.

247
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,900
Tomorrow.

248
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,444
I do not have a car, come get me at 20 pm.

249
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,531
I have an appointment.

250
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,203
You really are at the leadership level.

251
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,963
Constance Grace.

252
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,008
whichever request

253
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,552
all rights,

254
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,555
and alimony.

255
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,892
It does not have the means.

256
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,186
Leaving Bobby in plan.

257
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,398
Chaz leaves.

258
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,984
with her husband.

259
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,862
away from it

260
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,241
and seminars.

261
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,745
someone who attracts.

262
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,372
Someone like...

263
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,963
Excuse me. My name is Eleanor Meecham.

264
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,132
Where do I register?

265
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,843
I will show you. Constance Gracen.

266
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,177
Enchanted.

267
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,887
Me too.

268
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,891
They can live a lie.

269
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,271
for whiling happiness.

270
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,982
are autobiographical,

271
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,360
since college

272
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,156
with her teacher.

273
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:15,493
my terrible mother?

274
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,873
some like their mother.

275
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,542
What are you doing here?

276
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,922
I go from time to time to see how it goes.

277
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,427
Doctors say his prognosis is excellent.

278
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,846
- Why bed ... - I placed near the window.

279
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,474
This is more pleasant for her.

280
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:43,146
This is important, your visits and what you tell him.

281
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,775
She hears everything.

282
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,152
It seems.

283
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,947
When you were a kid,

284
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,035
she boasted to other mothers?

285
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,082
I put myself at the window and I heard

286
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,461
on the porch, telling that I would succeed in life,

287
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,421
I would win money

288
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,258
and that I would take care of her.

289
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,261
Your parents were like my mother?

290
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,309
My father...

291
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,606
He never expected much from me.

292
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,027
Perhaps it was easier for me.

293
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,822
It has been?

294
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,617
It's late, let's talk.

295
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,712
You'll need that.

296
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,551
- And that. - What's this?

297
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,013
A medicament for the voltage. Harmless if one knows how to use it.

298
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:02,017
Pour into his glass, he will sleep for 12 hours.

299
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,351
After that?

300
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,396
What was said. Call me at home.

301
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,192
You look lovely.

302
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,430
Speak!

303
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,183
Hello, it's me.

304
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,286
and extreme paranoia

305
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,955
with the Ministry of Defence,

306
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,250
Impressive security

307
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,254
and from which one can not escape.

308
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,429
You look fit.

309
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,641
- Where do you go to dinner? - Nowhere.

310
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,727
Reference may be delivered later.

311
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,241
What a beautiful home!

312
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,411
A small question, where are you going like that?

313
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,206
I wanted to serve us a drink.

314
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,625
You're welcome,

315
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,378
serve yourself.

316
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,554
I get you something?

317
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,305
I do not drink.

318
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,266
Pardon?

319
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,811
I spoke Turkish? I said that I did not drink.

320
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,646
I hate to drink alone.

321
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,190
Share this glass.

322
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,657
I am not thirsty.

323
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,341
I do not like that word.

324
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,469
No! Harder! Pull me stronger hair!

325
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,930
That's it. Do you have another dose?

326
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,601
Let yourself go.

327
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,570
Burg Agent, FBI.

328
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,532
This is Sykes. You've heard of Jeremy Batewell?

329
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,992
I am busy.

330
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,495
He invented the "Ultrachip".

331
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,331
A super descrambler that the Pentagon expects.

332
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,460
Someone will steal it. Are you listening now?

333
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,878
vas-y.

334
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:21,091
A secretary at G & G is in Batewell.

335
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,345
She works for which Jim Profit works for Chaz Gracen.

336
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,057
G & G would be involved in this flight?

337
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,852
Completely. They want to pass on to the Chinese.

338
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,855
This is liable to how many years in prison?

339
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,775
I would say 140 years.

340
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,777
That must happen when?

341
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,613
- I jumped on a plane.

342
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,783
I booked you a flight. Tomorrow, Tony.

343
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,807
We drank earlier than expected.

344
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,185
- In the living room.

345
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,650
Return to the entrance and go up.

346
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,781
Je monte.

347
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,535
Proceed down the hallway.

348
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,579
Right, the Office Batewell.

349
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,338
Ãa va, Gail?

350
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,381
I'm a little nervous.

351
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,052
No reason to worry.

352
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,595
Unless he lives with someone.

353
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:50,805
You could?

354
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,729
A cat. It was a cat.

355
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,068
to the server. You see?

356
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,321
Turn on the computer.

357
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,239
And if there is an alarm?

358
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:09,824
Do not worry.

359
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,079
This is a violation ...

360
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,039
- Insert the disk.

361
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,335
Type "lock" and "load" then "Enter."

362
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,095
He designed our IT security

363
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,848
and carried her off with everything he could.

364
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,767
Type "Ultra" and figures

365
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,311
3-6-3, asterisk then "Enter."

366
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,564
What is there on the screen?

367
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,317
Un logo. "Ultrachip".

368
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,861
All right, turn off the computer.

369
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,534
Excuse me.

370
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,455
Ms Gracen wants to see you.

371
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,958
Take it up, thank you.

372
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,294
You know what?

373
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:06,881
Make it work, make sure it is the right and get him out.

374
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:26,109
in fact detox.

375
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,153
Nora is the only one to know.

376
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,947
You want some? It's good for stress.

377
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,285
What happened?

378
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,412
Uncle Art.

379
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,498
He was with Pete?

380
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:47,005
I must not tell anyone. They want to seize G & G.

381
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,966
more Society uncle.

382
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,052
to get rid of Chaz.

383
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,430
I am his wife, I have to support it.

384
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,600
Your uncle abused you.

385
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,730
What should I do?

386
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,359
When they plan redemption?

387
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:12,072
After Chaz has sold a chip that will drop capital.

388
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:15,784
What's happening?

389
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,788
I hate to see you like this, caught between his hatred and greed.

390
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,456
It's ugly.

391
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,418
Excuse me.

392
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,215
There is a problem.

393
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,884
The diagnosis does not work on the chip.

394
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,845
- This is Ultrachip.

395
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:39,474
It does not work. I thought it had to be ready.

396
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,268
Since a month. You are right.

397
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,020
What should I do?

398
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,233
As agreed, but meet me at the office.

399
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:52,529
When Batewell discover what I have done, it will come at G & G.

400
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,199
Trust me.

401
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,786
le secret

402
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,122
is how to improvise.

403
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,749
Thank you for seeing me so quickly.

404
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,793
What do you say?

405
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,255
If I give you the Ultrachip I conned you.

406
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,674
- What do you mean? - It's fantastic today

407
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,718
but it could be obsolete within 2 years.

408
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,345
Then you have to buy the version # 2.

409
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,348
It can be anything. The chips are time-sensitive.

410
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,058
Fleas are.

411
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,602
Not those who make them.

412
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:35,238
- You are married? - Somehow.

413
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,951
You belong to him, and drag whatever passes under his nose?

414
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,580
He had a difficult childhood.

415
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,041
His father beat him.

416
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,252
Not enough, apparently.

417
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,631
My God, I'm horrible!

418
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:58,845
Who had a happy childhood? That's no excuse.

419
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:03,558
What hurts is that men treat us

420
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,101
like we did not matter.

421
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,148
It's unbelievable.

422
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,401
You understand me so well and we hardly knows.

423
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,574
Qu'y a-t-il?

424
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,871
I feel so alone.

425
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,751
It sometimes happens to you?

426
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,253
I wrote a book about it.

427
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,760
My husband died a long time ago.

428
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,721
I do not really have any friends.

429
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,724
No one to talk.

430
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,936
I am uninteresting.

431
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:52,232
Not at all. You're great.

432
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,738
You're so nice.

433
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:04,828
You remind me of my best friend in high school.

434
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,957
We often spent the night at one another.

435
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,797
All is well.

436
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,608
Hello.

437
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,861
It's late. I've got to go.

438
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,282
- What do you ... - We did everything, it was great.

439
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,452
Why am I lying there

440
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,370
with this horrible pain?

441
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,958
You threw your head back and you're hit you in ...

442
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,756
Really enjoyed it, but I gotta run.

443
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,936
Secretary of Profit is now hand over the Ultrachip.

444
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,023
My secretary did not even make me a coffee.

445
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:19,652
It goes back to the Chinese people, is not it?

446
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:21,613
Of course.

447
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,198
- About Coffee ... - I'm on it.

448
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,992
Profit must not know that the FBI is here.

449
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,295
I read the report on Profit. All that is written is true?

450
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,880
All.

451
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,968
Patience! Just now, you will have excellent news.

452
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,398
Put that.

453
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,859
Why did you decide to be here?

454
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,986
You will see.

455
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,240
- There is a small problem. - Which one?

456
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:08,118
Batewell did not drink the medicine.

457
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:09,327
And so?

458
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,454
I knocked him out.

459
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,375
I made him believe it was an accident.

460
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,293
Put that locked.

461
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:24,843
Call Mr. Wong on her direct line. He must be anxious.

462
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,054
But the chip is not working.

463
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,308
You thought you were smart?

464
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:36,855
Here's my fierce and expensive lawyer with a legal writ

465
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:40,608
that is only the beginning of a civil and criminal process

466
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,695
to rid the company of a large weight.

467
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:47,574
Here is the thief and the one who pushed her. Find the chip.

468
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,202
What are they talking about?

469
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:55,540
You will soon find yourself in prison, Gail.

470
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,044
How do I know what they're talking?

471
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,006
It is locked.

472
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,383
Give her the key.

473
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,802
Gail has nothing to hide.

474
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:15,894
The key!

475
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,357
reacts under pressure.

476
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:23,234
Will she panic or obey?

477
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:38,333
Why pick this chip is not working?

478
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,292
Pardon?

479
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,464
You have defrauded the US government.

480
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:47,967
This will be discovered when we stopped, but ...

481
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,137
It'll be good to out of here.

482
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,807
Stop!

483
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,395
Drop the writ, I retract. Go!

484
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:11,032
That was exciting.

485
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,160
Come into my office.

486
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,873
You said at the Defence Ministry

487
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:23,086
your research on the descrambler would be delayed by a month.

488
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,091
We all know that it's a scam.

489
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,552
You can not make it in time.

490
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,056
I dealt with the government and they do not forgive so quickly.

491
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,439
You will believe a robbery,

492
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,818
that a foreign power you stole the chip.

493
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,612
The chip is gone, you stash your money

494
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,116
and wait a contract with the government that will bring.

495
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:56,161
I am delighted to be an honest American citizen.

496
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,874
Want a piece of the pie?

497
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,047
I found you a real buyer, if you're implying.

498
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:08,923
Wong Industries.

499
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:12,969
I should sell the Ultrachip the Chinese?

500
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,932
For $ 10 million plus 20% commission for me.

501
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,602
Not bad, since the chip does not.

502
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:25,357
You do not think they'll be unhappy?

503
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,196
I'll take care of that. You enter the game?

504
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,823
Okay.

505
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,659
But I will never forget that.

506
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:40,038
- Good. - Do not be rude not.

507
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,500
Chinese buyers await.

508
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,002
Oh yes?

509
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,632
Doctor Batewell,

510
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,761
you must understand that you work

511
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,930
for me now.

512
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,476
I pay much more than the government.

513
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,230
$ 8 million for a working day, it will not refuse.

514
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,778
Your appointment is at 2:00.

515
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,699
I can not drive.

516
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,785
Gail will take you there.

517
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,872
Excuse us.

518
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,217
And it is surprising that I was never married me!

519
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,436
Wong Batewell must be at 10 am sharp.

520
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:49,524
I should believe you when you said you Ã©pauleriez me.

521
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,364
People fight,

522
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,658
mature,

523
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,871
who they actually are.

524
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,250
- You dry this morning? - Well seen.

525
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,253
- You slept well? - Very good.

526
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,632
Thank you for helping me last night.

527
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:22,057
I told myself that I had perhaps not need a man.

528
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:25,643
But someone guessing my feelings.

529
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:28,521
We all need someone like that.

530
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,190
Come here.

531
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:47,582
Constance, you feel like ...

532
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,713
I've never felt that before.

533
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,299
That's wonderful.

534
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,060
I can not.

535
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,190
You are married.

536
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,928
He is calm.

537
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:43,763
Very.

538
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,850
He let others sweat.

539
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,644
It reminds me of someone.

540
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,941
Here it is.

541
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,235
Wait until he passes it.

542
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:07,537
Go for it!

543
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,296
FBI. We stop you!

544
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,966
Lower your weapons. I know him.

545
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,719
Larry Sun, Ministry of Commerce. Remain calm.

546
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,554
We're all in the same camp.

547
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,306
What do you mean?

548
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:30,352
Mr. Profit intercepted the cryptographic program.

549
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,437
Intercepted?

550
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,899
And prevented its illegal export. He will be rewarded.

551
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:40,779
Mr. Profit, if all citizens were as lucid as you!

552
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,365
Not so lucid. Dr. Batewell disappeared.

553
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:46,785
You should send ... how do you say again?

554
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:47,911
A message to patrols.

555
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:48,870
Un message.

556
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,747
Go for it!

557
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,585
Larry, forget all that.

558
00:38:56,044 --> 00:39:00,256
You also deserve a reward. I will make the request.

559
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:11,226
I love you well, I'll talk to you nicely.

560
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,520
Lose my phone number.

561
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:19,067
We return to the mine?

562
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,237
I wait in the car.

563
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,133
Benefit he will get me to do other things?

564
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:46,469
That would be logical. It takes you a hard time?

565
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:49,264
I do not mind it. I'll see for myself.

566
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:50,807
And now?

567
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,395
Nice bunch!

568
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,984
Slowly, I was joking.

569
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:02,694
What are you doing?

570
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:05,405
We end the agreement for the inventor of the chip.

571
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,948
Go ahead, Miss Koner.

572
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,825
Do not look at that.

573
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,577
Let me go!

574
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,753
Help me!

575
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:21,963
Call for help.

576
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,550
Do something.

577
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,097
Help me, Gail!

578
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,564
to judge his moral character.

579
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,650
it would succeed brilliantly.

580
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,125
Here I am kidnapper.

581
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,212
Not really.

582
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,632
Batewell is a wanted fugitive. They help to escape.

583
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,885
This is a fugitive because of us.

584
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:13,390
No, because of what he did.

585
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:16,851
The government would have quickly realized that the chip was unusable

586
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,728
and had been swindled them.

587
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:23,900
Batewell has just fled

588
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,028
instead of going to jail.

589
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:31,324
Moving is the best solution.

590
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:34,869
I thought that I would relish my revenge.

591
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,707
He deserved what will happen to him, but it did not seem right.

592
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,835
Of course.

593
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,296
Revenge is useless. It is a weapon for the weak.

594
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,173
You are not weak.

595
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,427
Not anymore.

596
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,986
I was looking for you.

597
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:12,282
Jim told me that you had taken risks with Wong.

598
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,451
I wanted to show my gratitude.

599
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:16,911
Thank you sir.

600
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,457
We will follow this young woman closely.

601
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,377
Of course.

602
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,431
The secret of real success

603
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,767
all fears,

604
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,437
and lock them up.

605
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,242
Of course,

606
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:59,913
enclose all evils.

607
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,540
That is the challenge.

608
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,210
Dealing with our own darkness

609
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:08,546
where they can not hurt us.

610
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:11,675
to make the world

611
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:13,760
a better world.
