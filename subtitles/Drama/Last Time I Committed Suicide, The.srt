1
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,179
- I do not know where I am. I am lost.
<i>- It is an island.</i> - What?

2
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,682
<i>- How can you on an island lost?</i>
- I know that it is an island.

3
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,309
<i>And you made it, to get lost?</i>

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,915
Yes, it is possible to get lost in Cyprus.
<i>- How</i> - Because I have made it possible.

5
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,628
Listen, I'm sorry, I'm tired.

6
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,821
I do not understand,
why are you so mad.

7
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,242
- What have I done? Come on, tell me.
<i>- You have no idea?</i>

8
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,578
- I do not think I'm wrong thing did.
<i>- Because you never do what.</i>

9
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,247
What do you mean by that,
that I never do what?

10
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,167
That's why you're mad, because I know
nothing doing? That can not be true.

11
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,894
Hello? Hello!

12
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,998
<i>Hello</i> - Hey, buddy.
<i>- George? What time is it?</i>

13
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,602
<i>- No idea.
- Where the hell you are?</i>

14
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,295
No idea.

15
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,381
<i>Oh, man,
It is six clock in the morning.</i>

16
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,967
<i>Six clock in the morning, George,
on Saturday. Are you hurt?</i>

17
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,526
- No.<i>- In prison?</i>
- No. <i>- Then I'll call later.</i>

18
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,274
<i>- You're an asshole.</i>
- Seems today to be a widely held opinion.

19
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:36,585
<i>Do you know why</i> - Look,
I think I've got it with Christina dirty.

20
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,535
We were on this
Engagement party last night.

21
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,094
We talked, and then all of a sudden
there was a heated argument.

22
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,679
<i>What you fought her?</i>

23
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,546
<i>- George</i> - Yes, here.
<i>- You're an asshole.</i> - Why?

24
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,049
<i>- Answer the damn question.</i>
- In addition I'm not ready.

25
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,187
<i>She was smart enough
at least this time to leave you?</i>

26
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,015
<i>Listen, driving home,
sleep it off and call me later.</i>

27
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,992
Yes. Let's see.

28
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,445
What is...

29
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,995
Sorry.

30
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,692
Is everything okay?

31
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,749
Best. Thank you.

32
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,115
Can I help you?
Maybe Do you want a ride?

33
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,218
In a church would be conceivable.

34
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,662
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

35
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:53,917
- I did not mean to be rude, but we are here
the middle of nowhere and... - Do not worry.

36
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,601
My car has broken down and...

37
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,228
But wherever you want?

38
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,977
I do not know.

39
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,472
Great.
I go obviously in the same direction.

40
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,452
- You should ride a piece?
- Probably not, but thank you.

41
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,453
Okay.
So, all the best.

42
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,766
Actually...
Wait! Wait!

43
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,242
Thank you very much.

44
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,131
Buckle up, please. You're welcome.

45
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,737
I don't want to talk about it.

46
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,150
Is just curious.

47
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,908
I am George, by the way.

48
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,294
Are you from Cyprus?

49
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:49,032
Original yes.
But growing up in the States.

50
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,419
My Greek is not so good.

51
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,791
You are not a serial killer,
or something like that?

52
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,018
What?

53
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,714
- Hello? <i>- George</i> - Mom?
<i>- What happened?</i>

54
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,467
<i>- I'm going to inform the police.</i>
- Mom, it's all right.

55
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,929
- No, no, I'm fine, I'm in the car.
<i>- Did you have an accident?</i>

56
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,765
No, I had not. I could
otherwise talk to you, if it were so?

57
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,642
<i>Why are you yelling at me?
You are gone.</i>

58
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,561
- I do not shout at you.<i>- Christina makes
worried and you drive through the area.</i>

59
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,399
<i>- When are you coming home?</i>
- Mama mou, I do not know, later.

60
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,944
<i>- When later I don't know.
- Do not shout so later on, now, Mom.</i>

61
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,488
- But I did not cry yet.
<i>- But why do not you call?</i>

62
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,574
<i>- We are very worried and you disappear just</i>
- Mom, please.

63
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,326
- I have the phone always with me.
<i>- Okay.</i>

64
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,714
- Okay, see you until then.. <i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

65
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,731
- Can that answer your question?
- Yes.

66
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,856
Yes, even Norman Bates
loved his mother.

67
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,652
- Good Morning.
- Even so.

68
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,860
Do you feel better?

69
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,280
Where are we?

70
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,168
Well, I'm not sure
but I think somewhere east.

71
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,655
Did you know,
where you are going?

72
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,964
No plan. Is there a place
where should you be?

73
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,755
Actually yes.

74
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,415
'Cavo Greco' so against sunset.

75
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,893
This is the cliff by the sea, right?

76
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,013
A wonderful goal.

77
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,642
Yes, a very popular place
for weddings.

78
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,985
Yes, I heard.

79
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,902
- Are you married?
- What?

80
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,164
No, not yet.

81
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,083
And you?

82
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,626
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

83
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,549
Are you a mechanic or something?

84
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,260
Mechanics? No.

85
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,474
I am an engineer.
This is my hobby.

86
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,749
Take often with anybody,
if you are traveling?

87
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,251
They call themselves
So even 'someone'?

88
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,630
- And you answer questions with questions?
- You do that?

89
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,757
Oh, we are similar.

90
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,842
So, how does your story?

91
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,179
- There is no story. - Oh please.
- What?

92
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,391
Look at us. Everything we lack,
is a giant white cake,

93
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,030
and we were both these figures,
the top of it are.

94
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,496
Tell me your story,
everyone has one.

95
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,754
All right, fine, Let me guess.

96
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,753
They are on the run, but you flee
nowhere because you are without a goal.

97
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,431
So you need
run away from anything.

98
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,430
Of what would a man
probably run away?

99
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,481
In law?
You do not look like a convict.

100
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,733
Hardly money problems.
Looks not at all like it.

101
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,739
So it can really
merely still being here, right?

102
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:13,620
This is not original.
This is only a bombastic clichés.

103
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,235
I'm so sorry,
that I have to disappoint you.

104
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,904
Her story is certainly fascinating.

105
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,541
No, I am also a cliché.

106
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,385
But I'm going to change that.

107
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,177
Then make straight
a really good job.

108
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,722
So what is it? What now?

109
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,059
Her girlfriend?

110
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,516
Fiancée?

111
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,969
She's your fiancee. And you have
dissolved the engagement, right?

112
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,777
No.
It is not my fiancé.

113
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,113
But I think, they would like to.

114
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,648
And she's tired of waiting,
that you overcome your commitment phobia.

115
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,536
You have quarreled
and fled. Yes?

116
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,338
This really is not original.

117
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,330
They are really a bombastic
Cliché with a small capital 'K'. - 'C'

118
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,167
- Which toe? - In French is from
cliché with 'C'... Oh, by me.

119
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,897
No, in your case it is a 'K',
as in 'schrec'K'lich'.

120
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,092
I'm not a cliché, all right?
Things are as they are.

121
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,512
I do not understand why they
This piece of paper so desperately needs.

122
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:33,186
- It's not just a piece of paper. - Yes.
I like happens to be the way things are.

123
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,605
And to be honest with you...

124
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,710
You know, I'm here,
because I want it, not because I have to.

125
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,877
Is that what
as the fear of commitment Mantra?

126
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,971
I am sorry,
that's me, of course, nothing.

127
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,499
So, 'Cavo Greco'?

128
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,485
If you do not mind?

129
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,294
Why not? Good thing I
not have to go elsewhere. Let's go back.

130
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,910
- Wedding at sunset.
- From wedding was out of the question,

131
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,297
- only of 'Cavo Greco'.
- Okay.

132
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,264
So you love them?

133
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,940
- Excuse me, please?
- A very simple question.

134
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,258
What are you? Psychologist?

135
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,470
- No, I am a teacher. I give Film Studies
and Drama. - Shocking.

136
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,558
If you really love, you should
call her. And you should do it now.

137
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,644
- Now she sleeps probably.
- No, she does not.

138
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:01,329
She was on all night and did you
a long Mail wrote about their feelings.

139
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:09,323
In my opinion, if you
they lose and it does you very sorry,

140
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,160
They are at this
Remember the moment here,

141
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,705
beat his head against the wall and say
to himself: "I should have to call."

142
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:20,251
I do not want to offend,
but you are not in the position,

143
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,171
People advice
to give in relationship matters.

144
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,340
- Think about it only once,
as you just look like... - How?

145
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,219
- More like a Hochzeitsfee.
- I am the Hochzeitsfee.

146
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,931
I always appearing all
lost men and save them from...

147
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,435
Crap! - What?
- Hold On Stop the car. - What?

148
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,071
Stop the car.

149
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,282
"Buckle up, please."

150
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,330
<i>Blue?</i>

151
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,500
- Hey, you're on.
<i>- Yes, I'm going to write something.</i>

152
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,685
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I drive just like wars, clear head.

153
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:09,133
<i>- George, I will not argue.</i>
- I still do not.

154
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,219
<i>I'm very happy, you called.</i>

155
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,762
I have him!

156
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,098
<i>I've been thinking and...</i> - Me too.
- I have him again.

157
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,684
<i>Who's that?
George, who is with you?</i>

158
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,521
- You no further.
<i>- What the hell is going on?</i>

159
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,440
Nothing at all. I swear to you,
the does not mean anything, it's just...

160
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,420
I drove around and ran because
suddenly a bride in the street...

161
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,165
Everything OK?

162
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,579
Was there turn your fiancee?

163
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:18,046
It is not my fiancé.

164
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,292
- You may not even my girlfriend,
thanks to you. - Hey!

165
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,020
How could I know,
that you talk to her?

166
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,311
Opps.

167
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,266
Shall I call her?

168
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,135
No.

169
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,893
- Is there anyone, you want to call?
- No.

170
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,439
I have not even my phone here.
Only the dress and my veil.

171
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,074
You think determines I'm crazy.

172
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,919
Today is the day of my wedding.

173
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,007
I have planned it for a year.

174
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,677
We have 500 guests expected.

175
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:49,182
We had tons of white roses and hundreds,
hundreds of torches as decoration.

176
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,598
Did my parents cost a fortune.

177
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,568
Because it yet everything
should be like a fairy tale.

178
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,822
What happened?

179
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,442
No idea.

180
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,700
I really do not know it.

181
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,220
What's happening?

182
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,856
Oh, damn it!

183
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,811
Whatever it is, I'm sure you get
the way 'Mr all rounders engineer'.

184
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,539
Yeah, right.
We just need gasoline.

185
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,421
Wait here.
I'll get what I'm back.

186
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,545
The nearest gas station
is in two kilometers.

187
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,756
I'll come along.

188
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,933
My best buddy Chris introduced us,
as we have studied in London.

189
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,811
- So that's your British accent.
- Yes.

190
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,344
He said she was perfect for me.
She is a female version of himself.

191
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,947
Even for the same name,
Chris, Christina.

192
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,851
Feel it?

193
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,908
I love it, when the wind turns.

194
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,040
They just do not respond.

195
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,584
- Maybe she has it on silent mode.
- No. Your phone is always on.

196
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,156
And she logs in rhymes.

197
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,407
How does it work, please?

198
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,826
If you 'Yes, please' would have to say,
she says 'Yes, Quince'.

199
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,305
And if I call her now,
says she always 'blue' or 'purple'.

200
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,166
That also I could be.

201
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,168
She's not like you.

202
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,555
Because that is their only tick.

203
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,856
I'm not so bad.

204
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,093
Okay, stop. Ow!

205
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,180
Ow!
Just a sec.

206
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,566
What happened?

207
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,273
They really wanted 2 km
running in stilettos?

208
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,943
How could I know,
that the time has come?

209
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:23,656
Well, why do not you
back to the car and wait there for me?

210
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,491
Running all the way back?

211
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,410
In addition, how far can
Be the gas station to get away?

212
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,330
Could you do it because
make it to the gas station?

213
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,386
No.

214
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,347
So, then pull it out yet.

215
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,310
I'm not crazy,
all the way to go barefoot.

216
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,775
So what do you suggest then?

217
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,349
I'll get petrol,
go back to the car...

218
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,194
- ...then I come back here, okay?
- Okay.

219
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,565
Want to society on the way back?

220
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,115
Can I cash
have for something to drink?

221
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,413
Oh yeah, sure.

222
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,325
Thank you very much.

223
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,003
But they did not fuck off,
You come back, will you?

224
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,536
Should I maybe a pledge here be?

225
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,513
No, I trust you.

226
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,001
<i>Have I done something?</i>

227
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,837
<i>Is there a reason,
that you do not let me sleep?</i>

228
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,975
You would not believe what I
I for one day, my friend.

229
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,800
<i>Where are you?</i>

230
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,346
I'm on my way.
I have picked a bride.

231
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,848
<i>Is 'bride' now
synonymous with 'whore'?</i>

232
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,850
No, she's a real bride.

233
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,771
<i>I think this whole wedding talk
brought you to the brink of madness.</i>

234
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,316
Chris, please, shut up.
It is not imagination.

235
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,902
<i>And Christina knows about it?</i>

236
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:29,383
She has mitgekriegt on the phone.
And she broke up with me.

237
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,953
<i>All right. Where are you?
I'll come pick you up.</i>

238
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,930
No no, all right, I'm fine.

239
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,165
I'll come back soon.

240
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,392
<i>Okay.</i>

241
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,988
<i>Hi, this is Christina,
all good news, please.</i>

242
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,531
That's why need bridesmaids.

243
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,493
Bride!

244
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,049
Hello!

245
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,010
Hello?!

246
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,071
What are you doing?

247
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,107
Nothing at all.

248
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,443
I just wanted to stretch my legs.

249
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,829
Okay.

250
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,864
Can we go now?

251
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,825
- No. - No?
- No.

252
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,632
I need two minutes.

253
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,340
All right.
I wait in the car.

254
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,309
- Ready when you are.
- Okay.

255
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,874
Are you in any Difficulties?

256
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,818
- What do you mean by that?
- I'm surely not stupid.

257
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,297
- What was that just with the cops?
- Because it was nothing.

258
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,417
Listen, I do not want
be involved in something.

259
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,225
- Whatever you have done...
- There is certainly nothing.

260
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,851
My fiance is a cop.

261
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,221
He may have sent his boys,
looking for me,

262
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,014
but I'm not ready.

263
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:08,227
- Why should the police are looking for you?
- Not the police, my fiance. - Okay!

264
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,536
Her fiancé.
Why should he look for you?

265
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,543
Because I was gone and no one knows,
where I would go.

266
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:22,032
I woke up this morning
and the first time I thought

267
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:26,012
of my time after the wedding.
And what will be afterwards.

268
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,958
And my whole future
overtook my eyes

269
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,096
and everything seemed so unexciting.

270
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,816
- I thought that should be there?
- What do you mean by 'unexciting'?

271
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,936
To do just that,
what is expected of you.

272
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,597
You'll even get married,
then comes the credit, build a house,

273
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,891
have a baby
and still a baby, work, school...

274
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,278
The same story,
which every human being has.

275
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,745
I knew exactly
how my life is run.

276
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,735
But is it any good?
I mean, to know?

277
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,238
No.
I want the uncertainty.

278
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,716
I want it all prefer to explore.

279
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,593
Yes. And what will be,
if nothing happens?

280
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,849
The risk you should take.

281
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:19,599
I would choose the challenge,
instead these predetermined boredom.

282
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,483
That's not boredom.
Life's like this calmly.

283
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,908
- What kind of adventures await You then?
- Perhaps you're right.

284
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,101
But even before I was engaged,

285
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,354
there was at least
the possibility of some adventure.

286
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:38,584
From something secret.
Now I feel as imprisoned.

287
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:44,072
I could not do it.
He was not the love of my life.

288
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,130
Oh, and women get cold feet.

289
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,508
It's more than 'cold feet'.

290
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,345
And why then the dress?

291
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,337
I woke up and suddenly panicked.

292
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:02,424
I thought, pulling it at times, may bring
it get me down and I feel better.

293
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,010
But everything was worse
and then woke up all.

294
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,740
I thought I can not go back.
So I got into the car and drove off.

295
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:15,906
Do you have something underneath...
You know. Something like 'Blue'?

296
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,610
That's everything you
interested in the whole story?

297
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,417
Okay, sorry.

298
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,881
But has your family
somehow not afraid for you?

299
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,261
Yes.

300
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,039
Then call them but to please.

301
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,124
I can not at the moment.

302
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,461
I'm embarrassed,
we can not just continue?

303
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,518
- After 'Cavo Greco'?
- Yes.

304
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,022
And not on the highway,
when it's done.

305
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,261
Then that will certainly
take a long time.

306
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,681
That's okay, as long as we
sunset are there.

307
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,987
As they want.

308
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,660
Oh, just so,
I do not even know your name?

309
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,500
Oh yes?

310
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,480
I do not know what you want,
at the end of the two are together.

311
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,984
- But they do not stay. - Stay still.
- No, no chance.

312
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,278
- But of course.
- Definitely not.

313
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,156
How can you know that?
In the film, they come together.

314
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,963
Yes, but it will not hold.

315
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,465
What? How so?

316
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,957
Johnny and Baby,
they come from different worlds.

317
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,626
It is a small,
rich princess and he is a bum.

318
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,547
Eventually, she had enough of 'Dirty Dancing'
and leaves him for a lawyer or something.

319
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,258
Yes, but you forget,
that the two of them but love.

320
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,895
- Not such a big thing.
- What?

321
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,806
Lust? Yes. Love? No.
Because this whole Liebesgetue

322
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,810
is a product of movies and society
and we should believe in it.

323
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,522
- They do not believe in love?
- Of course, love between friends,

324
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,485
in the family, yes, but not at the
'romantic love'. They do not exist.

325
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,792
Are you crazy,
as you can only...

326
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,880
- How can you say such a thing?
- Because it's the truth?

327
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,788
The whole history of the world
shows yet but that love exists.

328
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,875
Empires on up
and fell because of love,

329
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,212
- People sacrificed their soul...
- That is not love.

330
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:50,091
That is an illusion. That is a
temporary feeling of infatuation.

331
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,319
It can never remain forever.

332
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,490
Why probably ending any
great romance with a bad breakup?

333
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,434
To create the illusion alive.

334
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,355
Not every great romance ends
in a nasty separation, that's ridiculous.

335
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,911
'Romeo and Juliet'.

336
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,983
'Casablanca'.

337
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,818
'Gone with the Wind', 'Titanic'...

338
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,956
- 'Pretty Woman'.
- That's not a great romance.

339
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,481
What the hell, that should now?

340
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,788
- I'm afraid of goats.
- What?

341
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,004
- Buckle up.
- What is this belt-obsession?

342
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,481
Just do it.

343
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,156
So, you love him?

344
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:40,716
I mean, this magical feeling,
to which you want to believe so deeply.

345
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,307
- I thought.
- Is the feeling gone?

346
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,629
No. I just think,
that it was wrong to begin with.

347
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:55,383
- So you do not love him?
- No, I love him, it's just not Filmlie...

348
00:35:55,403 --> 00:36:00,194
Say it.
No movie love. Say's already going on.

349
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:06,061
You women, you have the film industry ruined,
looking around this romantic comedies

350
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,938
and thinks that the
True love should be as accurate.

351
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:13,443
- All these films are based on something yet.
- Yes, on one's imagination.

352
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,739
- True love exists. - You need to be crazy,
do you think that really.

353
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,718
And you do not believe,
So you are crazy.

354
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:29,014
Can you keep a short time? - What, here?
- Yes. - How so? - Just for a second.

355
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,733
Here.
Hold the.

356
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,783
- What are you looking for?
- Messages. There are certainly some news.

357
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,748
- Leave me.
- Oh thank you.

358
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,284
- What are you doing just?
- The Beginning previously loosely.

359
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,078
That was not easy,
You have aborted him.

360
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,998
Do you know how hard it is,
to find these parts?

361
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,055
I'm sorry,
it happened by accident.

362
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,547
By mistake.

363
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:01,356
Do you realize,
that you are going to destroy me?

364
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,345
Now you are sometimes not as dramatic.

365
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,182
It is also clear,
that you know nothing about love.

366
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:10,070
- I know a lot and that's enough
for me also. - Oh yes? - Yes.

367
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,730
- There is even a scientific Declaration.
- Of course there's the.

368
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,399
We men are programmed to
to find a wife.

369
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,944
Because our biological
Determination is to procreate us.

370
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:24,282
Then we find that particular person
and our brain secretes dopamine.

371
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,035
What identical
the same effect as cocaine.

372
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,996
And why turn
people through when they fall in love.

373
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,291
- Real a stupid photo.
- Can you put away that, please?

374
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,585
You are suddenly
an obsessive man.

375
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,796
You can not stop,
to think about them.

376
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,756
That's why you want it,
like a drug.

377
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:44,427
And these hormonal state describes
anyone who can, stupidly as 'love'.

378
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,564
- Is that your mother?
- Yes.

379
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,350
Then, finally,
Are you sleeping with the person.

380
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,534
And another chemical
is active, Oxitocin.

381
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,189
The stimulated the togetherness.

382
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,817
Whereas it is important because the couple
so long together,

383
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,902
until the boy has grown.

384
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,739
So, there you have it:
Dopamine and Oxitocin.

385
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,216
Where is your father?

386
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,886
I have no idea.

387
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,502
It is a forced brainwashing,
that connects us with one person,

388
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,139
they have to get married
and to have babies.

389
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,300
That is our specific
Survival mechanism.

390
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,691
Of these poets and dreamers
transfigured as love. Damn it!

391
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,669
Oh, oh, hold on!

392
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,755
- Hold on.
- What? - Let me go a bit.

393
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,842
- No, it already. I am okay.
- Hold on, immediately.

394
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,094
Chill out, You must not drive.

395
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,232
I'm going to "The Ants Go Marching" sing,
continue until you.

396
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,182
You're welcome.

397
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,866
<i>♪ The ants go marching one by one
Hurrah, hurray!</i>

398
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,152
<i>♪ The ants go marching one by one
The little one stops to suck her thumb</i>

399
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,613
<i>♪ And They all go marching down</i>

400
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,700
<i>♪ To The Ground to get out of the rain
Baram Baram, Baram</i>

401
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,995
<i>♪ The ants go marching one by one
Hurrah, hurray!</i>

402
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:38,499
<i>♪ The ants go marching eight by eight
Hurrah, hurray!</i>

403
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,170
Okay! Hey, stop!
Now, right now, okay?

404
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,728
It's nothing,
I'll stop immediately.

405
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,300
The car belongs to you, okay?

406
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,688
Satisfied?
Jesus Christ, my ears.

407
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,036
Hey! Hello! What...

408
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,305
You should have seen your face.

409
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,230
Come on, get a.

410
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,234
Oh, no, please! Come!

411
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,697
That was the last time you promised.

412
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,458
Come.

413
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,387
Keep them.

414
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,556
Thank you very much.

415
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,177
- Go barefoot?
- You want me to go with it?

416
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,020
Good argument.

417
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,903
Hey!

418
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,705
Where the hell are we?!

419
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,579
Listen.

420
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,714
What should I hear?

421
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,171
Nothingness.

422
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,119
Is not it grand?

423
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,706
You can not see anything
and nothing hear for miles.

424
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,126
Yes, for example the road.
Where is the street?

425
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,295
We will the road back.

426
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,353
Can not you be quiet
and enjoy the moment?

427
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,157
Would you dance with me?
Exactly here?

428
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,410
What?

429
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,238
This dress deserves a dance.

430
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,829
- No.
- Why not?

431
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:53,087
- No one will look.
- We are sorry, no.

432
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,382
Okay.

433
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,558
Are not you hot in that?

434
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,762
No.

435
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,566
- Drag at least, the gloves.
- This is an ensemble.

436
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,065
So where is the road?

437
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,270
Buckle up, please.

438
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,666
What you just do?

439
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,131
You're right, it's hot.

440
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,680
Stupid petticoat.

441
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,787
If you were single,
would you data myself?

442
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:58,569
- I think I am now single.
- No they are not.

443
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,906
There's still hope.
And you are not distracting.

444
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,950
Whether I'd data?

445
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,006
No.

446
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,036
Why not?

447
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,093
You must be crazy for me.

448
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:14,543
- It's just not a very good day.
- I wish you a good few days,

449
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,338
before you to be proud again.

450
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,147
And you have to get rid of the dress.
They act so much too greedy.

451
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,016
I am sure that I
would data on a good day.

452
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,154
- Do not be but please so condescending.
- Am I that?

453
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,958
You should be afraid of anything.

454
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,806
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

455
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,476
- How are you?
<i>- Do not like it.</i>

456
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:04,427
<i>Listen, I do not know what's wrong with
you, or who is the woman with you, but...</i>

457
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,095
It is no one, as I said.

458
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:09,223
<i>Anyway.
Come home, so we can talk.</i>

459
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,976
<i>If you want that too,
you need to come home.</i>

460
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,645
<i>I'm going tonight
be at our meeting place.</i>

461
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,524
<i>You can decide whether you want me
want to meet. I'll be there at eight, okay?</i>

462
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,110
- Okay.
<i>- This is our last chance, George.</i>

463
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,612
<i>I can not take it anymore.
Eight clock.</i>

464
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,669
- Okay.
<i>- Okay.</i>

465
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:36,059
- What did she say? - That they want to
meet today evening with me.

466
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,018
That sounds good, right?

467
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,604
I don't know.

468
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,863
- Please, stop.
- How so? - Just stop.

469
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,359
You should turn on the spot
and go back to her.

470
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,669
No idea on what kind of love
They think. You love it.

471
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,544
I love them now.

472
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,929
- Okay. - But how it will probably
look in the future with it?

473
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,429
Do not know whether you
in ten years are still alive.

474
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,962
What's with you and 'Cavo Gredo'?

475
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,100
For me, everything will be fine,
I'll find out it.

476
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,888
We should at least
experience the views.

477
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,365
Buckle up.

478
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,684
What are they doing?
They will not be back in time.

479
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,664
- However, I will. Buckle up.
- It's nothing.

480
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,375
Maybe Are you hungry?

481
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,222
Can you see it,
we can 'Cavo Greco' drive to

482
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,700
and I'll even sooner be back.

483
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,062
Okay, maybe not really earlier,
but we can do it.

484
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,647
So you eat.

485
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,126
- Know the 'Ham and Eggs-likeness'?
- That what?

486
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,820
That life as 'Ham and Eggs' is.

487
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,823
The more one is involved,
the more connected you are.

488
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,210
What does that have
to do with 'Ham and Eggs'?

489
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:19,121
'Ham and Eggs' is the difference
between involved and connected.

490
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,259
Chicken is involved,
Pork is more than that.

491
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,564
So, how was that out?

492
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,761
- In a restaurant.
- Why do people mean?

493
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:37,056
Well, he has the sandwich
taken apart.

494
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,558
No wonder,
that you have forsaken him.

495
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,036
He did not know better
and I said 'Yes'.

496
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,833
I was so in love,
I even had dance lessons.

497
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,336
Forget it.

498
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:53,715
What a pity.

499
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,242
I have a friend,
of has a crush on me

500
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,244
and says that,
he would make me a request,

501
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,133
he would surprise me with it,
me to make him while driving or something.

502
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,644
So, like, "We go left here
and will you marry me?"

503
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,022
And he has the ring
hidden in the glove compartment.

504
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,437
Is not that sweet?

505
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:18,615
- Well, you will find something nice?
- Yes. How would you do it?

506
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,032
You tell me.

507
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,406
No idea...

508
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,275
I have no master plan.

509
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,914
I just think that when the time comes,
I'll just ask.

510
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,340
I do not understand you.

511
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,952
What can you find only
on the idea of ​​marriage,

512
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,831
- if you do not believe in love?
- That's what I did not say that.

513
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,833
But, sure.

514
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,670
No, I said, 'romantic love'
or the imagination of eternity.

515
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,756
- Do we have a wedding today?
- Oh, no, certainly not.

516
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,633
- No no. No wedding.
- No, no wedding.

517
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:58,470
- But what about the dress?
- No, I have tried it only once.

518
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,807
We got lost
and are randomly ended up here.

519
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:05,019
- Just for practice. - We are already gone.
- You got married elsewhere

520
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,606
- and want to make here only photos.
- No, we're blown. - What?

521
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,085
- Do not say something like that.
- That he the nowadays still makes...

522
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,554
- What's now with the ring?
- What about it?

523
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,789
If you do not have special
Moment for the request search,

524
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,375
as they say,
what happens to the ring?

525
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,933
- No idea.
- Do you have a case?

526
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,609
No no no no.

527
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,034
Wow!
The is beautiful.

528
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,657
Listen, put it back.

529
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,901
In fact, you have to ring it.

530
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,695
I do not understand,
why you bought a ring,

531
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,752
if you do not want to ask?

532
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,700
Well, I guess,
it's like your dress.

533
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,509
I wanted to buy the ring,
so I can take the next step.

534
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,142
To give himself courage,
that's a pretty expensive way.

535
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,670
I think, They want it really.

536
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:17,810
I don't know. I think I should
really have the courage to ask them.

537
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,611
If it were not so difficult.

538
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,264
I think this means
that they are not frivolous.

539
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,369
Maybe make you worry too much,
but you are not frivolous.

540
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,105
Can I plug him?

541
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,233
No.
Listen, put him back easily.

542
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,652
Come on, what are you?
Superstitious?

543
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,208
Seriously now?

544
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,116
See, that's it,
what I'm talking all the time,

545
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,202
stop it,
to be so damn scared, please.

546
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,338
Shit!

547
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,272
Okay, that was not my fault.

548
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,238
What?
Say already.

549
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,975
They are just amazing.

550
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:11,979
You need the most irresponsible
Person that I've ever met.

551
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,648
Know the Meaning
the word 'consequence'?

552
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,067
Makes your behavior
other people unhappy.

553
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,821
Without a word, you knock on the wedding
and destroy her husband's life.

554
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,575
Your family must perish with worry,
but apparently not interested.

555
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:28,412
And who knows exactly what the
is with the police or 'Cavo Greco'?

556
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,220
Finds there instead of the ceremony?
Right there?

557
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,428
And now you lose even my ring!

558
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,725
You do not know anything
about me or my story.

559
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:53,228
And maybe I'm stupid,
but I'm not so paralyzed

560
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:56,064
from fear of the future,
I prefer doing nothing.

561
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,609
- I am paralyzed by fear?
- Yes!

562
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:03,749
God forbid, only enter into no risk
or even do something out of the ordinary.

563
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,452
What are you so afraid of what is
the worst that can happen?

564
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,870
This one!

565
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,849
They!
They live in a fantasy world!

566
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,042
What do you want to deny?

567
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,544
Keep people
not suddenly occupied dance

568
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:21,965
or not fall in love in a miraculous
Way or glued to each other forever.

569
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,052
The huge disappointment,
you prepare,

570
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,110
ruin the lives
all other around them.

571
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,064
Hey, Mom.

572
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:46,652
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I told you that I drive a car.

573
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,154
<i>to drive a car?
Where are you going?</i>

574
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,658
- Mom, please.
<i>- I've been expecting you for lunch.</i>

575
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,992
Yes I know.

576
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,287
<i>- There are Koupepia.</i>
- I'm sorry. <i>- It's all right.</i>

577
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,373
<i>I was just all morning
stood in the kitchen</i>

578
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,708
<i>and now thrown away everything.
Do you understand?</i>

579
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:06,296
<i>- Did you eat A Sandwich?</i> - Yes.<i>
- What? What did you eat?</i>

580
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,757
<i>This is not a meal.
And did you sleep?</i>

581
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,176
<i>I do not understand,
Why are you just disappeared.</i>

582
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,595
Mom, I'm not
just disappeared, okay?

583
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,056
<i>something happen with Christina?</i>

584
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,476
<i>Oh, no, you're killing me
even into the grave, you're killing me.</i>

585
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:23,063
Mom, relax, I take care
to make things with Christina, okay?

586
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,816
<i>It's been three years.
What are you waiting for?</i>

587
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:29,403
<i>You'll find no more like them.
And they deserve something better.</i>

588
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:33,573
Yes, you're right, Mom, she has something better
earned more than me. Maybe I should quit Use

589
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,368
and then they can perfect their
Find husband. How's would it?

590
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:39,246
<i>- I did not mean...</i>
- Give me the Hello..

591
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,915
- Hi, I'm a friend your son's.
<i>- Who's there?</i>

592
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,751
. Yes <i>- You do not mean...</i>
- - Oh, no, no, do not worry.

593
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,547
We have nothing or something.
I am engaged. I was engaged to someone.

594
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,133
Anyway.
I just wanted you to know,

595
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,361
that a have wonderful son.

596
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:56,430
He's nice, he's honest
and apart from that,

597
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,599
how stupid he often sounds,
He does not hang people.

598
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,270
He could not be better,
he has only one really bad day.

599
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,357
So, if you ask me,
they should be happy to have him.

600
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,610
<i>- I do not understand anything.</i>
- What is? I beg your pardon.

601
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,697
I can not hear you.
I think we have no signal.

602
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,908
<i>Hello</i> - We are sorry.

Hey, thank you very much.

613
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,984
- Best holiday.
- My birthday.

614
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,486
- This is no holiday.
- For me it is.

615
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,715
- Wear a garter?
- You will at times nothing.

616
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,587
But if I did,
it would not be blue, but pink.

617
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,229
Favorite quote?

618
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:48,073
What of Nietzsche,
something like, 'this dance'...

619
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,771
- 'Music'...
- Yes, that must really be a favorite quote.

620
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,579
What is that, please,
I have long thought about.

621
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,715
The most spontaneous,
what you have ever done?

622
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,797
This one.

623
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,432
The best compliment so far?

624
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,727
- This one.
- Oh, come on, please.

625
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,612
Your worst pick-up line?

626
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,112
You look like my
first woman from.

627
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,326
And you have to ask me now,
how many times I was married.

628
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,275
Oh, but what about...
How many times had it?

629
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,661
Not once.

630
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,406
Oh, my God, that's so pathetic,
have you really say that?

631
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,408
Yes I know.
I was very drunk.

632
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,953
She knew right away
what do you think really about marriage.

633
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,511
- I told it to Christina.
- Poor woman.

634
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:54,793
This can not be true,
They should really shoot it.

635
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,681
Maybe I should give her
so make the request. Yes.

636
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,603
Yeah, maybe you should.

637
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:23,488
- Hey buddy.
<i>- Hey. What's happening? Where are you?</i>

638
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,325
- I am on the way to 'Cavo Greco'.
<i>- Okay, your mother has just freaked out.</i>

639
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,161
- What, they called you?
<i>- Yes, they did and she said,</i>

640
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,998
<i>you with another woman
are blown.</i>

641
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,834
<i>- Hello</i>
- Yes.<i> - What's going on?</i>

642
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:39,004
Nothing's going on, I'm going
a bit through the area.

643
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,483
<i>alone</i> - As I said,
I'm traveling with this bride.

644
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,722
Listen, it's not,
what it looks like, okay?

645
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,640
<i>Have you talked to Christina?</i>

646
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,978
Yes, she wants to meet with me today
evening. <i>- Okay, that sounds good, or</i>?

647
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,188
I do not know, we will see.

648
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,165
<i>What the hell,
does that mean again?</i>

649
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,736
I'm not sure yet, if I go.

650
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,738
<i>And what are you doing
with this bride?</i>

651
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:07,546
I might bring them,
where they want to go, I guess.

652
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,048
<i>Is she hot?</i>

653
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:14,010
Well, it is unusual.

654
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,417
<i>All right.
Okay, buddy, but remember,</i>

655
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:21,254
<i>that during your small excursion
everyone goes me on my eggs.</i>

656
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,233
- That's what you deserve.
<i>- Shut.</i>

657
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,521
What will you do?

658
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,151
- What do you mean?
- With your girlfriend?

659
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,773
What do you think,
what should I do?

660
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,783
Honest.

661
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,870
Why interesting my opinion?

662
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:22,399
Let's say,
one year I do not want someone

663
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,787
in my wedding suit
be gleaned on the road.

664
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,881
They have the best
Experience with such things.

665
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,667
How nice that I will
can help with it.

666
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,257
So what do you think?

667
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,215
Well...

668
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,890
Whatever you do,
Be just a coward here.

669
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,558
If you want it,
then you must be brave.

670
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,469
But, if not,
Be the decency to tell her that.

671
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,277
Waste
Christina's no longer time.

672
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,527
You must not be a coward,
like me.

673
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,788
- You're not a coward.
- Yes, I am.

674
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:05,793
Instead of me problems
question about, I'm running away.

675
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:10,321
- Sometimes you need time, to be brave.
- How much time do you need?

676
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,798
Approximately one day.

677
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,339
I'm just kidding.
While it lasts.

678
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,516
So what will you do?

679
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,898
Why are we not both cowards
and run away together?

680
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,674
So what's going on?

681
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,676
Nothing at all.

682
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,836
Do you know,
nothing makes men more crazy,

683
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:11,424
as if a woman says that nothing is going on, where
it is very clear but that something is going on.

684
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:16,064
- And why do you ask if you know that
it is quite clear? - We could fix it.

685
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,074
That can not fix it.

686
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,269
My name is Eva.

687
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,740
I am pleased,
to get to know you.

688
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,297
Do you believe in destiny?

689
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,678
Not really.
I believe in free will.

690
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,049
Determines your will
not your destiny?

691
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,477
Well, then it's
not really fate, right?

692
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,297
All right. There is a reason,
that we met today.

693
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:42,106
- That was fate.
- Yes? What is our destiny?

694
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,238
That's not decided yet.

695
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,183
Then there is free will,
no fate.

696
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:53,072
Okay, what is your will,
what should be your fate?

697
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,374
Let him put us out of the way.

698
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,251
I'll take that to not.

699
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,670
- What?
- We should just go around it.

700
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,309
- We can not here do not, that's dangerous.
- All right.

701
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:35,205
- There's something in there.
- Okay. So, stay away and let us go.

702
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,779
- Come on.
- No curiosity?

703
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,837
- Curious? What then? - Then what's inside.
- No.

704
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,534
What if it's a million?

705
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,369
And if it's a bomb?

706
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:55,166
Yes, because here, the middle of nowhere,
a really worthwhile destination is.

707
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:57,752
Why do you want the box
absolutely open?

708
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,212
I just want to know what's inside.

709
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:03,257
- Why are you not a little curious?
- Because it does not interest me.

710
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,343
Have you ever
part of 'Pandora's box'?

711
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,762
Some things
better stay unopened.

712
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,848
I have not before,
the 'pure evil' to unleash.

713
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:14,352
- It could be a human head.
- The moves?

714
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,581
Well, let me a stick
or something will find that open.

715
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,374
Only Do not touch it.
Not, do not...

716
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:28,797
Okay, it do not take up...
Oh, she takes him up.

717
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:36,207
You do not know where he comes from
and perhaps he is ill.

718
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,765
- Look how cute.
- I know where that leads.

719
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,978
- Can we keep him?
- No.

720
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,634
We?

721
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,886
I mean, me.
I want to keep him.

722
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:52,525
This thing
does not come to me in my car.

723
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,208
Thank you, Uncle George.

724
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:08,290
Thank you, Uncle George.

725
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,552
Say thank you, Uncle George.

726
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,775
You know that the
is a great responsibility, right?

727
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:33,904
Responsibility.
How scary. Yes. Yes!

728
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,072
Hey, you're bleeding?

729
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:41,203
No, that's nothing,
that's just an old wound.

730
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,901
Must be risen,
when I played with the puppies.

731
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,210
- And will not you see?
- No, it's fine.

732
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:55,077
I'll tell you what. At the next stop
you can buy me bandages,

733
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,884
if it makes you feel better.

734
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,632
Okay.

735
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:06,853
<i>KIOSK</i>

736
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:46,309
<i>patient disappears from mental hospital</i>

737
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,562
<i>patient disappears from mental hospital</i>

738
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:52,987
Everything OK?

739
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,373
Yes sure.

740
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,992
How do you feel?

741
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,470
I'm fine.
I love my flip flop.

742
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,720
Why did you stop?

743
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,682
Actually, I still have time.

744
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,764
Oh well.

745
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:17,025
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, you can take the little guy?

746
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,239
Well, go.

747
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,174
Come on, take off.
Take off.

748
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,664
<i>- What now?</i>
- Hey, I have a problem.

749
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,083
<i>Please do not.</i>

750
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,586
The bride is a patient who had fled
from a mental hospital.

751
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,296
<i>Why?
What did you?</i>

752
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:56,777
No, I mean really.
It is in fact in psychological treatment.

753
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,555
What the hell,
is there to laugh about?

754
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,724
<i>How do you the know?</i>

755
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,768
From the newspaper,
black on white.

756
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,270
Apparently she wanted ago
one years to marry a man,

757
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,440
but cut down before the altar
and had a nervous breakdown,

758
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,943
So the family has
put them in the hospital.

759
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,751
And now she has broken
and in my car.

760
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,921
<i>And she knows that you know</i>
- No.

761
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,535
<i>Okay.
How crazy is it?</i>

762
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:26,038
<i>I mean, is it 'I-slay-dense
with-a-ice pick 'crazy,</i>

763
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,832
<i>or crazy as usual?</i>

764
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,641
What do I know?
She seems to be normal. It was...

765
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,606
It was a great day with her.

766
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,467
<i>Maybe you're just as crazy.</i>

767
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,887
Could you please stop
and just tell me what should I do?

768
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,973
<i>Bring her back,
That you should do.</i>

769
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,280
But maybe there's
for everything a reason.

770
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,911
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

771
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,814
<i>You like them, am I right?</i>

772
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:55,442
Listen, it does not concern me at all
nothing on, anyway, so...

773
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,987
She wanted to go
Be 'Cavo Greco' brought.

774
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:02,950
I'll bring them back and then
we just go separate ways.

775
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,119
<i>Are you completely crazy?</i>

776
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,371
- How so?
<i>- You're going after 'Cavo Greco'?</i>

777
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:08,598
Yes and?

778
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,918
<i>You want a crazy girl
bring to a cliff?</i>

779
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,725
Yes, you look so... if

780
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,140
Is that a dog?

781
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,156
Hi!

782
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:29,310
Well, who do we have here,
you sweet little thing.

783
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,447
Was it nice, yeah?

784
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,953
Here, again better
Thank you for bandages.

785
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,001
Eva?

786
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,503
Yes, George?

787
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,666
You know,
the day is almost over.

788
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,929
If you can not call anybody
and say that everything is okay?

789
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,387
I can not.
Not yet.

790
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,596
- So what happens next?
- But what then?

791
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,688
This, now,
where you are a free woman.

792
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,984
I start by, I guess.

793
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,571
And you're ready for that?

794
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,822
Its possible.

795
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:04,623
<i>Hiking trail Cape</i>

796
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:15,930
We are there.
Is not that great?

797
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,057
Wait wait.

798
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,561
I have to ask you something.

799
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,800
So what's going on?

800
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,777
Why are we really here?

801
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:31,529
- What do you mean by that? - What's really going on?
- What do you mean, what's really going on?

802
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,825
Your story
stand today in the morning newspaper.

803
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:47,531
- Let me go!
- No no!

804
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:51,201
- What is this, I just wanted here!
- Take off your gloves.

805
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,412
No! - Take them off.
- No! - Why are we here?

806
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:56,248
Let me go! - No.
- You are hurting me! - I want to help you.

807
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,543
- Only, please be honest with me, please.
- All I wanted was just here.

808
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,179
- How so?!
- That's why!

809
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,905
Because I've always been here,
before all this happened.

810
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,772
Before I was someone's girlfriend.

811
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,081
Or fiancee
or pathetic ex-fiancee.

812
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,545
And before I was sent away.

813
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:34,175
When I was just myself
and I just wanted to remind you.

814
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,260
Could not you talk about it?

815
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,598
What to talk about?

816
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,239
Do you feel better?

817
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,110
Yes, almost.

818
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:49,249
I should hurry,
before it is really good.

819
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,210
Okay.

820
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,636
Would you bring me back?

821
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,685
Is the same direction,
in which I have to.

822
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,907
- And you're sure, that we're really here?
- Yes. For sure.

823
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:05,788
But there's nothing here.

824
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,207
Only ten minutes walk.

825
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,414
Then let me take you.

826
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,628
No.

827
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:14,793
You're welcome.

828
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:20,963
Especially because I flip flop
have, it will go fast.

829
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,476
What about the little one here?

830
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,936
I'll keep him.

831
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,134
Honestly?

832
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,440
Yes.

833
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,403
Wait wait...

834
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,741
You need a little more light.

835
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,584
You'll get a flashlight.

836
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,457
Be brave.

837
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:12,407
Oh, wait.
Which reminds me...

838
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:13,857
What?

839
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:19,589
"And those who were seen dancing were those
, the music could not hear as crazy."



9999
