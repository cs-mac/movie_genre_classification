...and I had an infection,
which turned into a fever...

739
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,400
...which turned into inflammation
of my brain and spinal cord.

740
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,500
It's called encephalomyelitis.

741
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,200
And they had to operate,
in the back, here.

742
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,200
It was a complicated procedure. It was
eight hours. And they nearly lost me.

743
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,200
Actually, technically, they did lose me...

744
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,300
...and bring me back
on a number of occasions.

745

Anyway, they cured the illness...

746
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,800
...but they must've messed up something
else while they were back there, because...

...not long after,
I started to have these migraines.

And then nightmares.

749
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,600
And then these connections.

750
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:29,100
And one day I'm sitting with a friend,
and I had a vision of a woman...

751
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,900
...a crystal-clear vision.

752
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,500
And I described her to him.

753
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:38,900
And turned out it was an exact description
of his mother, someone I'd never met...

754
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,300
...who'd died the previous week.

No, I'm not.

757
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,600
Well, anyway, I assumed
it was some kind of a coincidence.

758
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:59,100
But as time went on, I began having more
and more of these things, connections.

759
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,500
So the doctors ran a bunch of tests.

760
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,300
They told my parents that I'd developed
something called passive schizophrenia.

761
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,600
They gave me a bunch of pills and,
you know, the pills stopped the visions...

762
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,800
...but they pretty much
stopped everything else also...

763
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,600
...so I had this choice.

764
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,800
I was either gonna live my life
with these hallucinations...

765
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,400
...with apparently no way
of switching it off.

at the time of his death.

This person your brother?

1406
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,700
Older brother.

1407
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,300
But not by much, he says.

1408
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,200
Only by a few minutes.

1409
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,700
I'm sorry, kid.

This guy... This guy talks a lot.

01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,600
Talks fast.

1412
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,000
Got a really weird laugh.

1413
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,600
Okay. Ahem. He says...

1414
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:40,000
...there's so much he wants to tell you.

1415

You wouldn't believe how it is.

And the weightlessness.

He says that's cool.

1420

Now he's laughing.

Okay.

1424
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:12,500
He says how you
always looked up to him...

1425
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:17,000
...and relied on him
to make the decision...

1426
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,400
...how maybe you used that
as an excuse.

1427
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,200
Is that true?

1428
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,000
Okay. He says can't do that anymore.

1429

Now you're on your own.

1430
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:36,800
Okay, now, hang on, okay, now.
Now he's saying something about a hat.

1431
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:39,300
The cap?

1432
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,800
A cap. Okay.

1433
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:48,800
He says to take it off right now.
Take it off.

1434
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,800
He doesn't...
He's telling you not to wear it again...

1435
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:57,300
...because it was his.

1436
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:01,900
And that's why he knocked it off
your head that day?

1437

At the tube? Do you know
what he's talking about?

He says good thing he did too.

And that's the last time
he's ever looking out for you.

1441
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,200
I'm sorry. I'm, uh...

I'm sorry, I'm losing him now.
He's leaving. He wants to leave.

...if you're worried about being
on your own, don't be.
