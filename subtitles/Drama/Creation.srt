1
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,725
Papa?

2
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,790
Tell me a story.
- Alright. What about?

3
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,233
I don't know. About everything.

4
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,333
Everything?

5
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:06,285
Very well, then.

6
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:19,080
In Tierra del Fuego, land of fire...

7
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,631
...a blighted and loveless country
on the Earth's furthest rim,

8
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,872
lives a community
of the dirtiest, most vulgar,

9
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:32,967
least civilised people
you can possibly imagine.

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,270
They appeared almost entirely naked...

11
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,511
...with their hair
all the way down to their bottoms.

12
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:44,051
They never washed their hands
or their faces, even before dinner.

13
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:49,571
One day, Captain Fitzroy
went ashore to meet them.

14
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,685
Thank you.

15
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:22,113
Not long now. I shall be with you
presently. Head to me, please.

16
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:25,830
Very good. Now, very still, please.
No fidgeting.

17
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,678
And above all, no smiling.

18
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,354
Excuse me, sir?
- Hmm?

19
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:36,033
Will this hurt?
- Oh, no, no, no.

20
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,765
It is only a beam of light.

21
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,955
Papa?
- Hmm?

22
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:47,031
How can light make a picture?

23
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:50,713
Well, they take a copper plate
and they prepare it with chemicals,

24
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,632
and these chemicals are activated...

25
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,313
...by the light that reflects back
from your face,

26
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:59,434
and so the silver...

27
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:04,231
...sticks to the places where the light
is brightest. Understand?

28
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,832
Yes.

29
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:08,875
Sorry. So sorry.
- No, thank you.

30
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:12,670
Go on. He went ashore to meet them.
- Yes, that's right.

31
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,390
So, erm, Captain Fitzroy went ashore
to interview the Fuegians.

32
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,955
Now.

33
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:20,835
He offered them
some axe heads, some calico,

34
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,395
and very pretty buttons.

35
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,950
Total value, probably two shillings.

36
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,792
This is yours. You take it.

37
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:32,357
Look how it... Look how it glisters.
See?

38
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,073
And all he asked in return?

39
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:41,035
A few spare children.

40
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,163
You give me el niña.

41
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:49,355
To the Fuegians, children
were cheap and buttons were precious,

42
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,273
so it wasn't long
before the Fuegians had their trinkets...

43
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:55,235
...and Captain Fitzroy
had his three children.

44
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:57,793
He named them Boat Memory...

45
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,720
...Jemmy Button and Fuegia Basket.

46
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:12,541
Come here, you dirty little beggar.

47
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,226
The good captain
had them washed and dressed,

48
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,946
and he taught them
the proper table manners.

49
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:05,711
Boat Memory died of smallpox,
but the two littlest ones,

50
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,873
they learned their prayers
and their times-tables so excellently...

51
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:14,393
...that they were invited
to meet the King and Queen.

52
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,675
Everyone agreed that
good Christian values...

53
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,316
...had tamed the most savage of hearts.

54
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,833
The King gave Jemmy
a genuine brass telescope...

55
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:49,906
...and the Queen gave Fuegia one of her
Sunday best bonnets to keep for ever.

56
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,716
Two years later,
Captain Fitzroy and I took them home,

57
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:57,032
accompanied by a young missionary,
in the belief that, by example,

58
00:06:57,132 --> 00:07:00,872
they would bring their fellow savages
to God.

59
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:04,321
And what do you think happened?

60
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,353
It didn't work.

61
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:10,768
That's right. Of course it didn't work.

62
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:17,632
Go after them, you fool. Get them now.
- Jemmy. Fuegia.

63
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:21,154
Put your clothes back on. Come back.

64
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:24,472
It was a complete and total failure.

65
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:27,000
No, no, no.

66
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:32,794
Quite still, didn't I say?
You shall have to do it all over again.

67
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:36,039
So sorry. So badly behaved. So sorry.

68
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,631
Mr Darwin, sir?

69
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:24,066
Come on, Mr Darwin,
or your dinner will be spoiling.

70
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:38,995
Mr D will be in presently, ma'am.
I imagine.

71
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:42,673
Thank you, Mrs Davies.
- Is Papa unwell again?

72
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:47,355
He's always unwell these days.
- He is not, Franky.

73
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,592
Maybe he caught something awful
from the Hottentots.

74
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:53,150
Nanny Brodie said
God was angry with him.

75
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,152
Brodie said no such thing.
- Yes, she did.

76
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:59,834
Good evening.
- Good evening, Papa.

77
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,599
Sorry I'm so late.

78
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Soup du jour, sir.

79
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:12,884
Thank you, Parslow.

80
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,711
Lord God, bless this family
and the food we eat.

81
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:23,879
We ask in Thy name. Amen.
- Amen.

82
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,312
I hear Mr Hooker is coming tomorrow.

83
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:34,603
Yes. Yes, that's right.

84
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,846
Did he say what it was about?

85
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:43,435
I'm not sure
that now's the time to discuss it.

86
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:47,194
Perhaps the time to discuss it
was before you invited him.

87
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:51,724
Well, quite possibly, but he...
He invited himself.

88
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,994
Sorry.

89
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:02,356
Tell Mrs Davies it was delicious,
but my...

90
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:07,896
My stomach's still not quite what it...
it should be. Forgive me.

91
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:15,516
Can we go fishing?
- Can we pick gooseberries?

92
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,035
October 17th, 1858.

93
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,672
Passed a poor night.
Stomach still wretched.

94
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:26,002
Noticed a slight tremor in right hand.

95
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:29,073
Consider increasing laudanum
by ten per cent, perhaps.

96
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:33,633
We'll sacrifice the two
tumblers. I want to skeletonise them.

97
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,276
Yes, sir.

98
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:38,156
Selective breeding is undoubtedly working.

99
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:41,355
Already seeing real changes
in wing structure.

100
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:45,993
I'm convinced that all fancy breeds,
pouter, carrier, tumbler et cetera,

101
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:49,068
derive from the common rock pigeon.

102
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:53,202
Nature selects for survival,
man for appearance.

103
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:04,861
Must improve skeletonising methods.
Consider aqua regia, quicklime, perhaps.

104
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,732
They'll need a few more hours,
those, sir.

105
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:24,866
Master George. Master Franky. Lady Etty
and Master Lenny. How are you, sir?

106
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:26,966
Sir?
- Thank you.

107
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,676
Anything else, sir?

108
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:33,594
No, no, no, you... carry on.
I'll clean myself up.

109
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,594
Is it true that he only let you go
if you married his fattest daughter?

110
00:11:37,694 --> 00:11:41,514
Absolutely true, George,
but don't you dare tell my wife.

111
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,916
Dear Joseph.
- Dearest Emma.

112
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:50,071
Ah. Yes. Forgive the short notice.

113
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,796
You know Thomas Huxley?
- Only by reputation.

114
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,873
He insisted on coming.
- It's a lie.

115
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:58,873
I have a question
for your esteemed, reclusive husband...

116
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:01,394
...and I didn't trust Hooker to ask it for me.

117
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:05,357
I see. Children, tell Papa
his visitors are here.

118
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,832
He already knows.
- He's hiding.

119
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:09,194
Do come in, please.

120
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:11,672
Can we play Charge of the Light Brigade?

121
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,274
You must be exhausted.
Will you take tea?

122
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:19,434
Hooker. My dear fellow.
And Huxley. Do come in. Come in.

123
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,679
Lead the charge, boys.
And away we go.

124
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,954
We're re-forming the Linnean Society.

125
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,432
The committee will comprise of myself.

126
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:50,593
Lyell, Hooker, yourself, of course,
if you're game for it.

127
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,194
Now that Hooker
and I finally have a bit of clout,

128
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,837
we can start to reclaim science
as a profession.

129
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:59,195
Wrest it away from the country parsons
and beetle collectors.

130
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:02,592
Some of whom are friends.
- Your book will be our rallying point.

131
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,236
No, it won't. There is no book.

132
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:07,553
There are fragments, and they're not
in any fit state to publish.

133
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,112
I've read your abstract
and the argument is hugely powerful.

134
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:14,396
Clear evidence of transformation
over millions of years...

135
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:17,713
...from a free-swimming prawn
to a shellfish stuck on a rock.

136
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:21,677
That's my point. You can't be sure of
that, and that's why I need more time.

137
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:24,361
Mr Darwin, sir?
- Yes?

138
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:29,433
Either you are being disingenuous or you
do not fully understand your own theory.

139
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:34,551
Evidently, what is true of the barnacle
is true of all creatures, even humans.

140
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:38,873
The Almighty can no longer claim to have
authored every species in under a week.

141
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,973
You've killed God, sir.

142
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:44,047
You have killed God.

143
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,475
Or to put it another way...

144
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,835
And I say good riddance
to the vindictive old bugger.

145
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:53,712
Charles? Charles?
- Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

146
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:56,235
Thomas, please.
- Yes, I quite understand.

147
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,754
It is time to write your book.

148
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:02,472
Strike hard and fast
with a blow that is utterly conclusive.

149
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,153
Really, sir, you...

150
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,754
You talk as if we're at war.

151
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:09,754
Yes. Science is at war with religion,
and when we win,

152
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:12,594
we'll finally be rid of
those damned archbishops...

153
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:15,476
...and their threats of eternal punishment.

154
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,915
No, Mr Huxley, we...

155
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:23,880
We live in a society and it is a society
bound together by the Church.

156
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:29,067
An improbable sort of barque,
I grant you, but at least it floats.

157
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,392
It floats. And you would what?

158
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:34,473
You would have us all rebuild,
plank by plank,

159
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,356
the very vessel in which we sail?

160
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:43,153
Oh, come, come, Charles. Did...
Did God's laws change your Fuegians?

161
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:47,947
Was Jenny the ape any less personable
for not being a person?

162
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:52,556
Our behaviour, like our physical forms,
evolves according to our needs.

163
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,234
Your very own words, sir.

164
00:14:54,334 --> 00:15:00,316
And thus, in time, we lose those parts
that are no longer required.

165
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,191
Like the appendix, the male nipple,
and finally, thank Christ,

166
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,031
our belief in an utterly redundant Almighty.

167
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,687
Mr Hooker?

168
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:24,512
I... implore you,
please do not push him.

169
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:28,115
No one can push Charles.
You know how fixed he is.

170
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,076
Bit of a barnacle himself, really.
- Yes.

171
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:34,707
And if you prise him from his rock,
he will die.

172
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:37,867
Come on, Hooker. It'll be dark soon.

173
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:52,565
So, what did she say to you?

174
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,467
She said it was killing him.

175
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:03,587
Yes. Mighty slow death considering the
length of time he's sat on this stuff.

176
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,992
We shall all be dead and buried
ourselves if he takes much longer.

177
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,834
Yes, since his girl died,

178
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:13,125
one has to admit...
he's not the man he was.

179
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:14,467
When are you going to be done
with those stinky old barnacles?

180
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,033
Well, I've been chasing
this little crustacean...

181
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:22,237
...in all of its evolutionary forms
over 30 million years.

182
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:26,748
Now, eight years doesn't seem a very
long time to achieve that, does it?

183
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,653
What does 'procrastinating' mean?

184
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,828
Oh, I think you know very well
what it means, Annie.

185
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,733
It means putting things off. Why?

186
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,557
That's what Mr Hooker thinks you're doing.

187
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,657
Does he indeed?

188
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,263
Is it because of Mama
or what's in that box?

189
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,768
Both.

190
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:58,314
I should probably just burn the lot.
- You can't. I'm in it.

191
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:00,516
Don't be absurd. Of course you're not.

192
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:04,611
What do you mean?
- When I was a baby, you said.

193
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:09,563
Oh, that.
- The Natural History of Babies.

194
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,728
Yes, that's right.

195
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,814
Look at my finger.

196
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:21,684
Oh, you're so strong. You're so strong.

197
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,882
Here. Annie.

198
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:48,392
I think that will not help her sleep.

199
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:51,836
I'm sure you're probably right.

200
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:54,313
Who's that?

201
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,922
Who is that? Is that you?

202
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:05,875
Oh, sweetheart. Oh, I'm so sorry.

203
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:10,035
Oh, what a mean old papa you have.

204
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,193
Oh, sweetheart.

205
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,183
Oh, what a mean old papa you have.

206
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,958
What a mean old...

207
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:19,523
What a mean old man you have.

208
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:23,797
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

209
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,953
'Six weeks: gurgles.'

210
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:29,157
'Tries to suck.
Holds tight to my finger.'

211
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:31,915
'Perceives bosom
when three or four inches from it.'

212
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,073
I should add that she's musical.

213
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,517
I hope you do not plan to treat all our
children as specimens of the ape genus...

214
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,318
...to be included in your experiments.

215
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:45,073
All of our children?
You mean you want more?

216
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:48,034
Oh, sorry. I assumed.

217
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:51,875
No, if the idea doesn't appeal,
then we won't have any more children.

218
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:56,480
Darling, I have plans to breed
an entire army of them.

219
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:01,721
Look at that. That's called the waltz.

220
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,957
Careful, now. Not too far ahead.

221
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:14,396
Make yourself useful, Hooker.
- Stay away from that water.

222
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:18,916
Fear not, Brodie,
I have them in my sights. Children.

223
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:22,315
Now, which of the four of you...

224
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:25,634
...would be the first who would
like to learn how to hook a worm?

225
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,075
Me. Me.

226
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,873
'A little further on,
the leading Highlander snuffed the wind...

227
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:32,874
...like a setting Spaniel,

228
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:35,997
and then made a signal to his party
again to halt.'

229
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:40,038
'He stooped down upon all fours,
wrapped up in his plaid...'

230
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,077
Look what I found, Mama.
- Look at that.

231
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:46,075
What shall I feed it?
- Let's ask Reverend Innes.

232
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,175
Oh, erm...

233
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:52,597
A leaf, I should think.
Necrophorus humator, isn't he, Charles?

234
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:57,436
Rather a splendid specimen.
- Yes, he is. He's a... carnivore.

235
00:20:57,536 --> 00:21:00,477
He eats carrion and insects.

236
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:03,118
Boys. We need carrion and insects.

237
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:06,354
Look, here's a worm, here's a worm.

238
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:09,674
An earwig. Squish it.
- No, don't kill it.

239
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:12,116
I know that expression.

240
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:16,477
He's dreaming of his glory days when he
was unencumbered with wife and family.

241
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,315
Free to wander the planet.

242
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:23,996
Actually, I was...
I was remembering how the tropical seas...

243
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,717
...teemed with living particles...

244
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,316
...that seemed to surround the Beagle
with a luminous glow...

245
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:33,751
...and leave a glistening pathway
through the night.

246
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:56,354
Puzzling.
So much beauty for so little purpose.

247
00:21:56,454 --> 00:22:00,398
So little purpose? They were helping
to light the ship's way.

248
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:03,241
Well said. Exactly.

249
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:07,148
John, are you familiar
with the works of Thomas Malthus?

250
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:10,563
He married his first cousin.
- So did I.

251
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:16,236
Yes, but I wasn't suggesting that...
- Of course you weren't.

252
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,916
Anyway,
Thomas Malthus calculated that if,

253
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,878
well, if every trout, say,
had a hundred or so offspring...

254
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:25,715
...and so on and so forth
throughout the generations,

255
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:29,895
we'd be knee-deep in trout
in just a few decades.

256
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,437
How would you respond to that?

257
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:35,234
I'd respond by saying that
most of the eggs are destroyed or eaten...

258
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:39,757
...so that the numbers remain stable.
That's the beauty of God's plan.

259
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,196
It doesn't strike you as a wasteful plan,

260
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:45,717
these myriad lives created
only to be immediately extinguished?

261
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,556
They provide food for others.
- Cheese and cucumber?

262
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:51,794
Thousands die so that only a few may live.

263
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:55,918
Is not the sum total of happiness
in some sort of massive deficit?

264
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:59,554
Charles, it is really not my duty
to speculate on the mind of God,

265
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:03,564
but it does seem to me
that nature is at peace.

266
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:09,779
There is another view.
That all of nature is a battlefield.

267
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,468
Remind me where I read that.

268
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,396
This is very good.
- Good. Shall I continue?

269
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,496
Hmm, please do.

270
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:23,514
'In a short time, he returned,

271
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:26,355
and dismissed his attendants,
excepting one,

272
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:32,150
and intimating to Waverley that
he must imitate his cautious way...'

273
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:07,234
''Now,' thought Christian,
'What shall I do?''

274
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:11,997
'And ever and anon the flame and smoke
would come out in such abundance...

275
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:16,794
...with sparks and hideous noises that
Christian was forced to put up his sword...

276
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:21,824
...and betake himself to another weapon
called All Prayer.'

277
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,529
Let us stop there.

278
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:28,396
Is Papa not coming to kiss us goodnight?

279
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:32,194
He is a little unwell
from working. Maybe tomorrow.

280
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:34,598
You said that last night.

281
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,317
I think when Annie died,
he stopped loving us.

282
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,278
No, Etty.

283
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:45,713
He's just a little bit tired and a little bit busy.

284
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:57,209
Goodnight, darling.

285
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:30,394
What are you doing, Annie?
- I'm making you beautiful.

286
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,929
But I need to think.

287
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,380
What are you so scared of?

288
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,968
It's only a theory.
- No, they're right.

289
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,399
It changes everything.

290
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,678
Suppose the whole world
stopped believing...

291
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,835
...that God had any sort of plan for us.

292
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:59,676
That nothing mattered.
Not love, not trust.

293
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:02,204
Not faith, not honour.

294
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,159
Only brute survival.

295
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,514
Apart from anything else,
it would break your mother's heart.

296
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:17,269
Hearts can't break, silly.
You told me that.

297
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,047
Breathe in, Papa. Breathe out.

298
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,514
Tell me a story.
- Alright. What about?

299
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,614
About Jenny.

300
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,439
It's late. I have no time.
- Please?

301
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:46,000
Why Jenny? It's so sad.
- I like sad stories.

302
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,556
Once upon a time,

303
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:54,598
there was a family of orang-utans...

304
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:58,353
...living in the deepest jungles of Borneo.

305
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:10,638
Their eldest daughter
was the most loving, the most caring,

306
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:13,713
and the most trusting orang of all.

307
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:19,435
But she was also the most...

308
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:21,275
Intelligent.

309
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,520
Well, I was going to say inquisitive.

310
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,314
Did I neglect to mention
she was not always...

311
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:33,304
...the most obedient of creatures?

312
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,710
By the time she realised her danger,
it was too late.

313
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:35,678
They put her in a bag
and they carried her off...

314
00:29:35,778 --> 00:29:37,755
Much to her loving parents' despair.

315
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:42,597
So sorry. Much to her loving parents'
despair, of course. And the Dayaks...

316
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:48,222
...bundled her into a cage
and set off to sell her down the river.

317
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,715
They sold her to a trader
for threepence, three farthings,

318
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:59,105
and he put her in a bigger cage and sold
her to London Zoo for 300 guineas.

319
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,550
She was the first orang-utan
that anyone had ever seen in England.

320
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,875
Everyone peered at Jenny,
and Jenny peered back,

321
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:18,820
and she marvelled
at what strange creatures they all were.

322
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:24,319
The curators of the zoo, they...
they cleaned her up...

323
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,401
...made her presentable for polite society.

324
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,470
Which was when
I was first introduced to her.

325
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,965
What is that, Jenny?

326
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,725
Oh, come on.

327
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,610
Bravo.

328
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,159
When eventually
it came time to say goodbye,

329
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,997
she grew quite downcast
and refused to shake my hand.

330
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:43,997
Finally, she took it, but only after
I'd made her a promise

331
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:48,040
I was never able to keep:
that I would visit her again...

332
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
...very soon.

333
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,535
Go on. Tell me about the bit
where she gets sick and dies.

334
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:02,280
Why do you want to hear that bit?
- I like it. It makes me cry.

335
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:39,436
Huxley is of the opinion
that I should write and be done with it.

336
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:42,676
Says it's a question
of moral courage, or of...

337
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:45,079
Or rather my lack of it.

338
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,876
Did you tell him about your health?

339
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:53,240
His theory is that I'm making myself ill
by holding back,

340
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,280
and... that I should lance the boil,
so to speak.

341
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,780
Thank the Lord he's no longer a surgeon.

342
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,975
I have concluded that he's right.

343
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,409
You know, bite the gag.
Speed is everything.

344
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:14,741
It will all be over in a matter of months.

345
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,440
It is not mere months...

346
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,600
...nor even years nor decades
that concern me, Charles.

347
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,730
Do you really care...

348
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:31,397
...so little for your immortal soul?

349
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:35,599
Charles... do you not care...

350
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,357
...that you may never pass
through the gates of heaven...

351
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:41,197
...and that you and I may be separated
for all eternity?

352
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:44,612
Well, of course I care. Of course I do.

353
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,835
What do you think has kept me in limbo
all these years?

354
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,935
I am a neuter bee.

355
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,480
I'm a scientist, and I dare not study...

356
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:03,040
...for the fear of seeing more clearly
what is already as plain as day to me.

357
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:06,438
Do you not think that's torture enough?

358
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,938
I think you are at war with God,
Charles.

359
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:14,746
We both know it is a battle you cannot win.

360
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,441
Give me the ball.
- No, you cheated.

361
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,958
Curse you, woman.
- You cheated.

362
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:39,058
Etty.

363
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,850
Etty, Etty, Etty.

364
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:13,036
Were you never married, Brodie?
- Myself? No.

365
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:16,876
He went off to Australia.
I missed my chance.

366
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:19,440
I shall never marry.

367
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,479
I know how men give you babies.

368
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:26,064
I sincerely hope you do not,
Annie Darwin.

369
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,998
Everybody step back and look at the rock.

370
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:34,716
If you look at it, really look at it,
it can take us back through time.

371
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:37,956
See these greyish, muddy layers?

372
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:41,719
They were brought here
by quiet, patient, gentle rivers,

373
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,036
whereas these dramatic
sandstone deposits...

374
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,318
...are telling us of huge storms,

375
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,440
storms that came through here
millions of years ago...

376
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,836
...when Aunt Sarah was just a little girl...

377
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:56,475
...and Down Village
was a swamp full of dinosaurs.

378
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:59,158
What's a dinosaur?
- It's a lizard...

379
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,679
Professor Owen invented them.
- He didn't exactly invent them.

380
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:04,916
They weren't real.
- Yes, they were.

381
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,119
Put some clothes on. You're going blue.

382
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:12,598
Look what I found. Spiny starfish.
Don't tell me.

383
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:15,039
Marthasterias gacialis, look.

384
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:17,356
Glacialis.

385
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:20,647
Whoo. Whoo.

386
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,371
I am Fuegian.

387
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:35,410
I'm making custard.

388
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,891
He did, he told me.

389
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:48,958
It is not fair to the other
children, nor to Annie herself,

390
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,238
that her head be filled with these ideas.

391
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:54,120
But Daddy said.
- I will leave you to deal with this.

392
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,920
He did, he told me.
- Hush.

393
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,597
Goodbye, Annie.

394
00:37:57,697 --> 00:37:59,756
What happened?

395
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,856
Nothing.

396
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:04,358
Your knees.
What happened to your knees?

397
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,001
Reverend Innes
had to have words with her.

398
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:08,677
What happened to her knees?

399
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:14,472
Reverend Innes sent me to the corner
and made me kneel on rock salt.

400
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:19,381
Why?
- I said there were dinosaurs,

401
00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:22,238
and he said there weren't.
But you found them.

402
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:25,280
Where's my coat?
- Take her to the kitchen, will you?

403
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,380
Where's my coat?

404
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:30,396
He told her to kneel until she repented,

405
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:33,759
so the marks are a result
of her own stubbornness.

406
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:37,997
She contradicted him repeatedly.
- Listen to yourself. Emma.

407
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:41,476
How dare he torture our children
for expressing the truth?

408
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:46,336
It is not the truth as he sees it.
- Damn how he sees it.

409
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,916
Must our children be revolutionaries
at nine years of age?

410
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:55,476
He is teaching them to deny
the evidence of their own senses.

411
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:57,557
No more than I have told them at bedtime.

412
00:38:57,657 --> 00:39:00,398
It is the instruction
of our parents and grandparents.

413
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:03,041
It's what all of the village believe,
or try to.

414
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:07,311
Charles, Reverend Innes
is a dear friend and neighbour.

415
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:11,370
Please, do not set yourself against him.

416
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:16,531
I beg you.

417
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:25,491
For you.

418
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:28,251
Not for him.

419
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:40,016
¶ All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small...

420
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:43,759
...¶ All things wise and wonderful...

421
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:49,642
...¶ The Lord God made them all

422
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:52,411
Let us pray.

423
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:06,008
Lord God... we know the world
is governed by Thy plan...

424
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:11,361
...extending to the merest creatures
Thou hast made,

425
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:16,986
such that even a sparrow falls
not to the ground without Thy will.

426
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:24,117
Teach us that all misfortune,
all sickness and death,

427
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:28,977
all the trials and miseries
of which we daily complain...

428
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:32,286
...are intended for our good...

429
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:37,131
...being not the whims
of an uncaring universe...

430
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:43,010
...but the corrections of a wise...
and affectionate parent.

431
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:48,968
Teach us this in Thy name, O Lord.

432
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,005
Amen.
- Amen.

433
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,799
The lesson today is taken
from the Book of Genesis.

434
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:02,089
Chapter one, verses 26 to 30.
- Sorry.

435
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:06,439
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
- And God said,

436
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:10,789
'Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness.'

437
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:15,159
'And let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

438
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:19,397
and over the fowl of the air, and over
all the cattle and over all the Earth,

439
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:24,512
and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the Earth.'

440
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:34,837
Dearest Emma, last night
you said I was at war with God,

441
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:37,998
but truly it is nothing so dramatic as a war,

442
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:44,048
just a silent struggle with myself
extended over a thousand afternoons.

443
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,520
The loss of religious faith
is a slow and fragile process,

444
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,255
like the raising of continents.

445
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:56,611
What can I say to you except that
the process now seems complete?

446
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:25,852
What are we looking at?
- See the rabbit?

447
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:37,452
Stay very still.

448
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,519
Make it stop.

449
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,401
Quickly, Daddy, make it stop.

450
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:00,919
Quickly.
- Etty. Etty, darling.

451
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:03,758
Daddy, make it stop.
- Ssh. Darling girl.

452
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:05,880
Dear girl.

453
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,800
Dear sweet girl.
- It's not fair.

454
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,850
It's not fair.
- I'm sorry.

455
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:17,359
Not fair.
- It's not fair.

456
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:20,330
Etty, it has to be that way.

457
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:26,902
The fox has to eat the rabbit,
otherwise the fox's babies will die.

458
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:30,507
It's the balance of things.

459
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:36,322
Come on, little duck. Give us a smile.

460
00:44:53,532 --> 00:44:57,491
Dear Hooker, I am finally decided.

461
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,718
I think I owe it to my children...

462
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:04,038
...to at least have the courage
of my own convictions.

463
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:08,039
My title will be 'On the Origin of Species',

464
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:12,039
and I shall endeavour to keep God out of it,

465
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:16,644
although no doubt
He will see it as a personal attack.

466
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:22,278
Nothing is easier than to admit the truth...

467
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:24,358
...of the universal struggle for life,

468
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:29,048
or more difficult
than to constantly bear this in mind.

469
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:33,801
I shall devote my first chapter
to variations under domestication,

470
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:38,278
wherein we will see
how great is the power of man...

471
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:40,560
...in accumulating slight variations.

472
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,992
I will then pass on to see how natural
selection causes much extinction...

473
00:45:46,092 --> 00:45:49,322
...of the less-improved forms of life.

474
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,762
Charles?
- Yes?

475
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,637
What is Lewis making?

476
00:46:16,737 --> 00:46:21,752
He's making a water tower
like the one they have at Malvern.

477
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:28,072
The writing's not been going well, so I
thought I might try my own water cure.

478
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:30,467
You're still angry with me.

479
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,262
I can always tell by your playing.

480
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,847
Not angry. Sad.

481
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,892
Pull.

482
00:47:35,692 --> 00:47:40,079
The face of nature
may be compared to a yielding surface...

483
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:43,121
...with 10,000 sharp wedges
packed close together...

484
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:45,517
...and then driven inwards
by incessant blows.

485
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:48,998
Sometimes one wedge being struck
and then another with great force.

486
00:47:49,098 --> 00:47:52,078
The mind cannot possibly grasp
the full meaning of the term...

487
00:47:52,178 --> 00:47:53,882
...a hundred million years.

488
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:58,481
It cannot add up and perceive the full
effects of many slight variations.

489
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:03,119
We forget how largely these songsters
or their eggs or their nestlings...

490
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:06,241
...are destroyed by
birds and beasts of prey.

491
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,282
Thus, over tens of thousands
of generations,

492
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:12,039
tiny variations accumulate.

493
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,640
Organs change their very function.

494
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,841
The female sexual organ
becomes a cement gland.

495
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:23,080
Limbs become blind feelers
or fall away entirely.

496
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,079
What was once a free-swimming creature...

497
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:31,959
...finds itself glued by its head
to a rock, blindly flailing for food.

498
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,059
Papa.

499
00:49:16,613 --> 00:49:19,200
Why is sweating
supposed to be good for you?

500
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,380
Because it gets rid of the poisons
in your blood.

501
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:27,722
I thought you didn't believe in sin.
- I don't.

502
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:31,677
Not in the way Reverend Innes
understands it, anyway.

503
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:34,562
Then why are you afraid of going to hell?

504
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:36,681
I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

505
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:38,918
You think you deserve it.
- No, I don't.

506
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:42,520
Of course I don't.
What could possibly make you think that?

507
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:46,530
Because you think
you should never have had me.

508
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,258
Oh, for God's sake, girl.

509
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:54,160
Oh, I don't have to listen to this nonsense.

510
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,190
You're cruel. You're just being cruel.
The girl's gone mad.

511
00:49:59,653 --> 00:50:01,840
That's why you won't talk to Mama
any more.

512
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,802
Enough of this. I talk to her.
Of course I talk to her.

513
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:07,240
Not about the important things.
Not about me.

514
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,001
Why must everything be about you?
- That's what you won't talk about.

515
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:14,528
What?
- How you think you're responsible.

516
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:19,133
Get out of here.

517
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:24,717
You get out of here. Get out of here.

518
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:27,762
You said honesty was
the most important thing in the world.

519
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:31,360
If you won't be honest, I won't
come again. It'll serve you right.

520
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,332
Get out. Please, get out. Get out.

521
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:48,801
You have not been well for months now.

522
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:50,963
I'll be fine. I'm fine.

523
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:55,917
Will you talk to John Innes?
- What about?

524
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:59,681
Whatever it is that ails you.
- What is he now, exactly? What is he?

525
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:04,881
He's a physician, is he?
- Yes. A physician of souls, anyway.

526
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:11,273
Talk to him as a friend.
You used to be such friends.

527
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:16,203
I think he can help you.

528
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:53,002
Mr Darwin? Excuse me.

529
00:51:53,102 --> 00:51:55,201
Little 'un coming through.
Ah, Mr Darwin.

530
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:58,801
I was just explaining to Mr Goodman
about your interest in breeding.

531
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:00,320
Oh, good. Excellent.

532
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,443
Mr Goodman is our foremost pigeon
fancier in all of southern England.

533
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:08,999
I swear, he can give you any beak
or plumage within four generations.

534
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:12,878
What's your secret?
- I interbreed them.

535
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:15,358
Brother and sister, cousin with cousin.

536
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,561
It's the fastest way to alter the strain.

537
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:22,359
There's a danger that you'll weaken it,
but a gentleman like yourself.

538
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:26,539
I'm sure you can afford
to lose a few chicks, eh?

539
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,733
Now, plenty of rest, young lady.

540
00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:33,013
Down you go.

541
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:34,600
Keep her warm.

542
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,918
Thank you, Doctor.
- Goodbye, Annie.

543
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:41,131
Goodbye.

544
00:52:42,853 --> 00:52:45,759
Unfortunately,
if we let them run wild on the beach,

545
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:49,398
we have to expect the consequences,
do we not, Mrs Darwin?

546
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:53,277
So, increase the calomel to twice...
- I will not give her any more of it.

547
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:55,518
Why not?
- She's been taking it for weeks.

548
00:52:55,618 --> 00:52:58,483
Can you not see she's not...
- It is chloride of mercury.

549
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:01,559
I've prescribed it often in babies.
- Not to any of mine.

550
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:05,824
If she would submit to being bled...
- Please, no.

551
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:10,080
I will write to Dr Gully again.
- The hydrotherapist?

552
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,478
I have found his treatments very effective.

553
00:53:12,578 --> 00:53:16,713
No matter that they defy logic?
- Logic isn't everything.

554
00:53:16,813 --> 00:53:18,813
Clearly not.

555
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:22,979
I'll see myself out. Good day, madam.
- Good day.

556
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:29,080
I should take her to Malvern
to be treated as I was.

557
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,563
It is better she's here.

558
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:34,488
She needs her family.
She needs love and rest.

559
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:36,813
She'll get well.

560
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:41,093
One more week.

561
00:53:42,173 --> 00:53:45,743
We'll watch her for one more week.
Alright?

562
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,493
Thank you.

563
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:32,523
Papa.

564
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,839
Post for you, sir.

565
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:56,829
This one's from the Spice Islands.

566
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:31,654
Charles.

567
00:56:32,814 --> 00:56:37,319
Charles, my old friend, there you are.
May I join you?

568
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:40,134
Yes. Yes, of course.

569
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:50,322
Mrs Darwin has told me
about the book you are writing.

570
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:53,682
Oh, no, no, not any more.
Thank goodness.

571
00:56:53,782 --> 00:56:55,643
You mean you finished it?

572
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,639
It's been finished for me, actually.

573
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:02,200
A Mr Alfred Russel Wallace
has arrived independently...

574
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,935
...at exactly the same opinion.

575
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:07,614
Expressed in a...

576
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:11,129
In a mere 20 pages.

577
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:14,479
Now, there's brevity for you.

578
00:57:15,454 --> 00:57:18,483
I had covered 250 so far
and come to a dead end,

579
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:25,252
so whilst having wasted 20 years
on the project, I am at least rid of it.

580
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:30,174
Well.

581
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:34,413
Well...

582
00:57:35,013 --> 00:57:38,158
...the Lord moves in mysterious ways.

583
00:57:40,494 --> 00:57:43,044
Hmm, yes, He does, doesn't He?

584
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:47,202
You know, I was remarking
only the other day...

585
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:51,281
...how He has endowed us
in all of His blessed generosity...

586
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:54,759
...with not one but 900 species
of intestinal worm,

587
00:57:54,859 --> 00:57:58,319
each with its own unique method
of infiltrating the mucosa...

588
00:57:58,419 --> 00:58:01,161
...and burrowing through
to the bloodstream.

589
00:58:01,261 --> 00:58:05,321
And on the love that he shows
for butterflies...

590
00:58:05,421 --> 00:58:09,800
...by inventing a wasp that lays its eggs
inside the living flesh of caterpillars.

591
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,120
I have said on many occasions, it is not
for us to speculate at His reason.

592
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,280
No, we can leave that to Mr Wallace.

593
00:58:17,334 --> 00:58:21,074
Shall I advise him to stay abroad,
do you think?

594
00:58:21,174 --> 00:58:23,884
With his opinions,
if he shows his face around here,

595
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:27,469
he may be required to kneel on rock salt.

596
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:43,889
I always valued our friendship.

597
00:58:46,614 --> 00:58:49,999
Until now, I regarded you
as one of those rare mortals...

598
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:55,709
...with whom one could disagree
and yet feel no shade of animosity.

599
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:01,811
Sadly, that feeling is...
no longer reciprocated.

600
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:22,935
What?

601
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,920
I'm forestalled by Wallace.

602
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,362
What have I done? What?

603
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:35,412
What possible... What possible reason
could you have to be angry at me?

604
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:38,734
Annie.

605
00:59:39,455 --> 00:59:41,722
Annie. Annie. Come here. Come back.

606
00:59:41,822 --> 00:59:44,647
Come back here now.

607
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:50,759
I am your father. You...
You come back here. What?

608
00:59:50,859 --> 00:59:54,642
What did I do?
What did I do to you? What?

609
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:59,243
Annie. C-Come here. Come back.

610
01:00:00,455 --> 01:00:03,962
What did I do to you?
Please. Annie, please.

611
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:07,525
Come here. Annie. Annie. Come here.

612
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:24,815
Get rid of them.

613
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,485
Get rid of all of them.

614
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:35,083
Come on. Get out.

615
01:00:35,183 --> 01:00:37,183
Get out.

616
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,001
Go. Come on.

617
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:42,101
Get out. Go.

618
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:44,143
Go.

619
01:00:50,294 --> 01:00:52,600
Mr Darwin. Mr... Mr Darwin.

620
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,840
Mr Darwin, sir.

621
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,804
Mr Darwin?

622
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,961
I'll have Lewis dismantle it, sir.

623
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:04,461
Now, Mr Darwin,
I'll send for Dr Holland.

624
01:01:05,215 --> 01:01:07,215
God, no.

625
01:01:09,494 --> 01:01:11,494
God damn it.

626
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Damn it all to hell.

627
01:01:15,615 --> 01:01:17,615
Mr Darwin?

628
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:21,974
Help me here. Help me here.

629
01:01:28,535 --> 01:01:31,935
So, increase the calomel to twice a day.

630
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:36,184
Yes, of course.
- Keep him warm, plenty of rest...

631
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:49,300
I think Papa's going to die, too.

632
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:11,414
Oh. Hello, Hooker. Hello.

633
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:14,159
Still talking.

634
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:18,242
That's good. Word had reached London
you'd suffered an apoplectic stroke.

635
01:02:18,342 --> 01:02:20,964
Your enemies are celebrating
at the Athenaeum.

636
01:02:21,064 --> 01:02:23,064
I have no enemies.

637
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:30,080
This is the Wallace letter?
- Yes.

638
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,161
Well, he has 20 pages.

639
01:02:33,261 --> 01:02:35,523
You have a whole book,
or at least half of one.

640
01:02:35,623 --> 01:02:38,324
I intend to extract the other
even if it kills us both.

641
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:40,523
Have you been talking to Huxley again?

642
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:44,362
No. Had I been, he'd be here himself
with a cat-o'-nine-tails. Up you come.

643
01:02:44,462 --> 01:02:48,484
No, I cannot. I know not what ails me,
but it's more than I can endure.

644
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:52,402
Bosh. You have had this illness
as long as I have known you.

645
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,321
It's worse in times of overwork,

646
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:58,322
but it has nothing to do with your soul,
wherever that resides now.

647
01:02:58,422 --> 01:03:00,682
Go and get yourself treated.
- I cannot.

648
01:03:00,782 --> 01:03:03,123
Believe me, you do have enemies.

649
01:03:03,223 --> 01:03:06,084
I'll bet half the nation
would see you burnt at the stake...

650
01:03:06,184 --> 01:03:09,364
...if they knew what you were writing,
but you have friends, too,

651
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:11,760
and all of us are fighting the same battle.

652
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,761
And we can win this in our lifetimes.
We have to win this.

653
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:19,044
I implore you, go to Malvern,
take your blessed water cure,

654
01:03:19,144 --> 01:03:21,524
come back and win it for us.

655
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,802
She's nearly ready.
- Thank you. Move those quickly, please.

656
01:03:49,902 --> 01:03:51,880
I want to come with you.
- No.

657
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,360
Malvern's not so far.
- Parslow. It's two days by coach.

658
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,361
What if the baby comes early?
- They have doctors there.

659
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:01,999
Your job is here with the children.
- They also need their father.

660
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,275
I can't care about the other children
now. I can only care about Annie.

661
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:10,775
Mind her shawl,
make sure it's tucked in.

662
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,110
Alright, thank you. Thank you.
Alright, little frog.

663
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:20,309
I made these. It's Annie's favourite.
- Thank you.

664
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:23,160
You will see your mama
when you're well again.

665
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,241
Brodie, get aboard.
- No. No.

666
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:29,040
Say goodbye, now.
- No, I don't want to say goodbye.

667
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:33,122
Say goodbye now.
- No, I'm going with you.

668
01:04:33,222 --> 01:04:36,877
I'm going with you.
Wait there. Wait for me.

669
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:51,013
Go. Go now.

670
01:04:53,095 --> 01:04:55,095
Walk on.

671
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:34,283
Mr Darwin, old friend. Mr Darwin.

672
01:05:34,383 --> 01:05:39,235
How long has it been?
I haven't clapped eyes on you since...

673
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:46,013
Well... So, what have we now?
What have we now?

674
01:05:47,095 --> 01:05:50,720
Tongue? Hmm-hm.

675
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,625
Shirt up. Let me feel your liver.

676
01:05:58,016 --> 01:06:00,443
Right. Up.

677
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:05,481
Pulse hectic, tongue furred,
liver tender and enlarged.

678
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:10,281
And obviously you've been exercising
your brain every hour that God gave you.

679
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:12,723
I have been writing a book.
- Madness.

680
01:06:12,823 --> 01:06:15,445
There are far too many of those already.

681
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:17,963
Are you sleeping?
- Poorly.

682
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:21,882
And I suppose never taking
the 50c dilution of Chelidonium?

683
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:26,962
I had my carpenter build a water tower.
It no longer has any effect.

684
01:06:27,062 --> 01:06:30,084
Of course not.
Your carpenter isn't a hydrotherapist.

685
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:33,800
What on Earth possessed you?
- I feared I was dying.

686
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,244
Oh, come, come, come.
We shall not have that talk here.

687
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:41,844
A sharp spinal scrub,
cold douche daily at 7:00am,

688
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:44,403
and sweating by the lamp.

689
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:49,365
No red meat, no reading,
no mental agitation of any kind.

690
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:55,330
We shall soon have you right, Mr Darwin.
We shall soon have you right.

691
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:42,929
Papa? I think I'm feeling better now.
Honestly.

692
01:08:35,855 --> 01:08:38,848
Papa.

693
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:28,696
Sir, I kneel before You in all humility.

694
01:09:32,496 --> 01:09:36,066
If it is in Your power, God,
to save her...

695
01:09:37,296 --> 01:09:41,801
...then I will believe in You
for the rest of my days.

696
01:09:45,256 --> 01:09:50,250
Take me, if You must take someone,
but not her. She...

697
01:09:54,016 --> 01:09:57,841
She's such a good little girl, you see.
She...

698
01:10:09,056 --> 01:10:11,281
I ask this in the name
of Your child and mine...

699
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:14,356
...and in the name of all children.

700
01:10:16,096 --> 01:10:19,168
Thank you. Amen.

701
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:26,926
With what do you most
associate these symptoms? Eating?

702
01:10:28,215 --> 01:10:32,123
Strong emotion? Physical exertion?

703
01:10:32,223 --> 01:10:34,223
Any particular action?

704
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:39,071
Is... Is memory an action?
- Memory of what?

705
01:10:42,096 --> 01:10:44,815
My daughter.
- Of course.

706
01:10:47,536 --> 01:10:51,701
You must accept
there was nothing more to be done.

707
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:59,373
Oh, dear fellow... she is in heaven.

708
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,066
Yes, that's what my wife believes.

709
01:11:06,856 --> 01:11:09,283
It is a great consolation to her.

710
01:11:09,383 --> 01:11:11,383
But not you?

711
01:11:12,496 --> 01:11:15,047
She and I are divided on it.

712
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:18,048
Were you always?
- No.

713
01:11:19,616 --> 01:11:22,414
Only since Annie died.

714
01:11:25,496 --> 01:11:27,496
Whoa, there.

715
01:11:30,576 --> 01:11:35,244
Charles, I'm...
I'm so very sorry about Annie.

716
01:11:35,344 --> 01:11:38,604
Where is she?
- In the Lady Chapel.

717
01:11:38,704 --> 01:11:40,704
Thank you. Thank you.

718
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:21,156
Since that time, she has sought
refuge in religion, and I in science.

719
01:12:21,976 --> 01:12:28,575
Has this division...
affected your marital relations?

720
01:12:30,936 --> 01:12:34,770
We have none any more... to speak of.

721
01:12:37,256 --> 01:12:39,636
Perhaps that's for the best.

722
01:12:40,296 --> 01:12:42,296
Meaning?

723
01:12:44,536 --> 01:12:46,536
Our last baby...

724
01:12:49,896 --> 01:12:55,336
Baby Ch... Baby Charlie.
He barely survived beyond infancy and...

725
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:03,564
Are you familiar
with the writings of de Quincey?

726
01:13:03,664 --> 01:13:06,046
Yes, I... I've read him.

727
01:13:07,097 --> 01:13:09,082
I have no time for the man.

728
01:13:09,182 --> 01:13:14,197
He maintains that certain thoughts
can reside in our mind...

729
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:17,036
...without us being aware of them.

730
01:13:17,136 --> 01:13:21,283
They then may manifest as boils...

731
01:13:21,383 --> 01:13:25,847
...and fainting spells... and ghosts.

732
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:34,288
It's po... It's possible, yes.

733
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:39,086
Annie is buried here in Malvern,
is she not?

734
01:13:44,377 --> 01:13:49,405
Yes.
- And have you yet visited the grave?

735
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,766
I really do not wish to discuss this.
- Of course...

736
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,885
What possible bearing can it have?
- It has every bearing.

737
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:04,681
That is your opinion. Your treatments
have been effective. I feel cured.

738
01:14:04,781 --> 01:14:06,926
I think not, sir.

739
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:10,322
I think you're not yet cured.

740
01:14:11,017 --> 01:14:15,126
Do you have faith, Mr Darwin?
- What?

741
01:14:15,226 --> 01:14:21,007
You say you take no comfort
from religion, but do you have faith?

742
01:14:23,176 --> 01:14:29,730
Until you do, all the waters in
the world will not be the cure of you.

743
01:15:19,256 --> 01:15:21,256
Annie?

744
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:25,496
Annie. Annie.

745
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:29,257
Annie.

746
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:31,692
Annie.

747
01:15:32,777 --> 01:15:34,777
Annie.

748
01:16:07,257 --> 01:16:09,850
Hello?

749
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,937
Hello?

750
01:16:25,897 --> 01:16:28,650
Hello? Hello?

751
01:16:30,657 --> 01:16:32,685
Good evening.
- Good evening.

752
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:35,443
I'm Mr Darwin.
I lodged here some time ago.

753
01:16:35,543 --> 01:16:37,926
Room number 12, wasn't it?

754
01:16:39,017 --> 01:16:41,017
Yes, it was.

755
01:16:43,097 --> 01:16:45,987
I would only be ten minutes or so.

756
01:16:48,977 --> 01:16:50,766
First floor.

757
01:16:50,866 --> 01:16:54,157
Last room on the right.
- Yes, I remember.

758
01:16:54,257 --> 01:16:56,257
Thank you.

759
01:17:19,297 --> 01:17:22,209
I have the embrocation.

760
01:17:23,377 --> 01:17:27,161
Does she want for anything else?
- No, I'm sure that will do admirably.

761
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:30,090
Alright. Alright, little one.

762
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:35,650
Here we go. Now, then.

763
01:17:37,537 --> 01:17:39,537
Just rub this on.

764
01:17:40,497 --> 01:17:42,931
How's that? Better?
- Yes.

765
01:17:46,897 --> 01:17:52,422
Dearest Emma, I think it best
for you to know how each day passes.

766
01:17:52,657 --> 01:17:56,518
Doctor Gully's treatments
are having some effect at last.

767
01:17:56,618 --> 01:17:59,407
I will write again tomorrow,
but in the meantime...

768
01:17:59,507 --> 01:18:03,277
The surgeon came today
to draw off Annie's water.

769
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:07,757
This did not hurt her,
and seemed to give much relief.

770
01:18:07,857 --> 01:18:10,923
I asked if there was
any immediate threat to her life,

771
01:18:11,023 --> 01:18:14,593
but he believes she has turned the corner.

772
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,608
My Emma, Annie rallied yesterday.

773
01:18:20,218 --> 01:18:24,646
For a moment, I was foolish
with delight, but now, suddenly,

774
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:27,404
our dear child
has taken a turn for the worse.

775
01:18:27,504 --> 01:18:31,165
This last attack was first thought
to be of the smallest importance...

776
01:18:31,265 --> 01:18:35,717
...but rapidly assumed the form
of a low and dreadful fever.

777
01:18:35,817 --> 01:18:39,522
She talks a great deal,
but we can seldom make out anything.

778
01:18:39,622 --> 01:18:41,892
Look, Mama, I'm a general.

779
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,482
Much of what she says
we cannot make out...

780
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:50,637
...from the roughness of her poor mouth.

781
01:18:50,737 --> 01:18:53,607
We sponged her with water and vinegar.
- There we are.

782
01:18:53,707 --> 01:18:57,046
Made her sweet with chloride of lime.
- Alright.

783
01:18:57,146 --> 01:19:00,283
Gully thinks our poor, sweet child
is in imminent danger.

784
01:19:00,383 --> 01:19:03,166
Is that better, my darling?
Is that better?

785
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,266
Beautifully good.

786
01:19:08,257 --> 01:19:10,327
I'm making custard.

787
01:19:16,977 --> 01:19:21,822
My darling Emma, I miss you, terribly.
More now than ever.

788
01:19:21,977 --> 01:19:25,717
I often think of the precious looks
Annie gives you.

789
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:28,564
You were always
the tenderest of human beings to her...

790
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:31,324
...and comfort her so on all occasions.

791
01:19:31,424 --> 01:19:36,694
This dreadful alternation
of hope and no hope sickens the soul.

792
01:19:37,178 --> 01:19:41,088
I feel we must prepare ourselves
for the worst.

793
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,573
Tell me about Jenny.

794
01:19:57,098 --> 01:19:59,098
What about Jenny?

795
01:19:59,183 --> 01:20:01,930
Ab... About how she dies.

796
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:10,446
Please, Papa. I like it.

797
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:18,897
Well...
what the keeper told me was this.

798
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:26,011
When she was very sick
with pneumonia, lying very still...

799
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:31,643
...he tried to feed her with a spoon.

800
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:39,525
But she shook her head
and she looked at him...

801
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,625
...as if to say...

802
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:45,527
...'That's very sweet of you. Really.'

803
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:49,928
'We're beyond that now.'

804
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:59,582
And the keeper was much moved
by the gentleness of the little ape.

805
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:04,126
And as he bent down to comfort her,

806
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:07,796
she brought her arms up around his neck...

807
01:21:08,457 --> 01:21:12,962
...and looked into his eyes
in the most human fashion.

808
01:21:17,778 --> 01:21:21,263
And then she laid her head against him...

809
01:21:25,738 --> 01:21:27,738
...and died.

810
01:22:13,618 --> 01:22:17,053
Oh, my darling girl, my darling girl.

811
01:23:05,338 --> 01:23:07,925
Sorry.

812
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,691
So sorry I startled you.

813
01:23:12,018 --> 01:23:14,366
Goodness, Charles. Take off your coat.

814
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:18,206
You're dripping wet.
- Emma, we need to talk.

815
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:22,008
I went back to Worcester Road.

816
01:23:23,138 --> 01:23:25,138
I saw Annie.

817
01:23:28,498 --> 01:23:30,498
You're hurting my arm.

818
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:33,644
I need to make you understand...
- I do not want to hear it.

819
01:23:33,744 --> 01:23:36,847
I am glad you're feeling better.
- You're not listening.

820
01:23:36,947 --> 01:23:39,525
I need you to listen
or you will never understand.

821
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:43,638
I understand perfectly.
Do you think that I am deaf and blind?

822
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:47,326
You've lived with her and spoken
with her every day since she died.

823
01:23:47,426 --> 01:23:50,238
She is more real to you than we are.

824
01:23:50,338 --> 01:23:53,484
She is dead, Charles.
- I know she's dead.

825
01:23:53,584 --> 01:23:55,584
She is dead.

826
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:58,165
What in God's name is wrong with you?

827
01:23:58,265 --> 01:24:01,484
Why can you not leave our poor girl
in her grave?

828
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:04,288
You're the one who wants to keep her alive,

829
01:24:04,388 --> 01:24:07,008
but on a cloud,
dancing with little fairies.

830
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,244
I will not listen to this.
- In a night shift and snowy wings.

831
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:12,366
Is that how her death was for you, Emma?

832
01:24:12,466 --> 01:24:15,567
Something gutted of darkness?
- Get away from me.

833
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,846
Away from you?
There is a gulf between us.

834
01:24:17,946 --> 01:24:21,286
We're like some, some survivors
of some shipwreck.

835
01:24:21,386 --> 01:24:25,083
Yes. Yes, because of you.
You've torn everything apart.

836
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:28,446
How? How? How?
- With your cruel theories.

837
01:24:28,546 --> 01:24:31,407
With the truth, Emma.
Just with the truth.

838
01:24:31,507 --> 01:24:34,607
Open the door. Open the...
Open the door.

839
01:24:34,707 --> 01:24:37,132
Open this door. Open it.

840
01:24:41,298 --> 01:24:42,522
What do you want from me?

841
01:24:42,622 --> 01:24:44,604
I want us to be honest with each other.

842
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:45,763
About what?

843
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:50,198
About this... nagging belief
that you have nurtured.

844
01:24:50,538 --> 01:24:54,008
That what?
- That I killed her.

845
01:24:55,378 --> 01:24:58,966
I never said that.
- But you think it, so you must say it.

846
01:24:59,066 --> 01:25:01,363
And say everything else that follows,

847
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:06,733
that I should have kept her warm
that day on the beach, that...

848
01:25:06,858 --> 01:25:11,533
...I should never have taken her
to Malvern without you.

849
01:25:13,178 --> 01:25:17,258
I should have waited for you.
I... I should have.

850
01:25:18,258 --> 01:25:21,063
These are your thoughts, Charles.

851
01:25:21,818 --> 01:25:23,818
They are not mine.

852
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:28,939
I was on the beach.

853
01:25:32,218 --> 01:25:34,218
And I let you go.

854
01:25:36,858 --> 01:25:40,407
I knew, when you left for Malvern...

855
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:45,239
...that I would never see her again.

856
01:25:45,818 --> 01:25:47,818
And I hated you.

857
01:25:49,299 --> 01:25:52,359
I hated you for taking her, Charles.

858
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:55,458
But I was her mother.

859
01:25:57,058 --> 01:26:01,529
And what was I thinking?
I could have insisted.

860
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:07,719
I should have followed you up there.

861
01:26:12,379 --> 01:26:14,379
I let her go.

862
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:19,819
That's the truth.

863
01:26:22,659 --> 01:26:24,784
And more than anything...

864
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:28,459
...I have...

865
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:32,575
...hated... myself.

866
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,618
Perhaps...

867
01:26:49,578 --> 01:26:53,731
Perhaps we should never have married.

868
01:26:56,738 --> 01:26:58,778
Our blood was too close.

869
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:12,449
You see, Emma... I thought
that we were making the perfect child.

870
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:28,759
But perhaps instead we endowed her
with the weakness that killed her.

871
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:39,566
I just... wanted to be with you
so very much.

872
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:57,175
The fact... of it is...

873
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:03,594
...knowing everything I now know...

874
01:28:07,059 --> 01:28:10,892
...I would marry you again tomorrow,
my love.

875
01:29:55,299 --> 01:29:58,727
The affinities of all
beings of the same class...

876
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:02,124
...have sometimes been represented
by a great tree.

877
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:05,524
The green and budding twigs
may represent existing species,

878
01:30:05,624 --> 01:30:07,967
and those produced
during each former year...

879
01:30:08,067 --> 01:30:11,125
...may represent the long succession
of extinct species.

880
01:30:11,225 --> 01:30:14,727
So, I believe it has been
with the great Tree of Life,

881
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:19,407
which fills with its dead and broken
branches the crust of the Earth,

882
01:30:19,507 --> 01:30:21,884
while covering the surface with its...

883
01:30:21,984 --> 01:30:25,284
The frameworks of bones have been
the same in the hand of a man,

884
01:30:25,384 --> 01:30:28,684
wing of a bat, fin of a porpoise
and leg of a horse...

885
01:30:28,784 --> 01:30:32,207
...at once explain themselves
on the theory of descent...

886
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:34,365
...with slow and slight successive...

887
01:30:34,465 --> 01:30:37,525
It is interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank,

888
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:39,764
clothed with many plants of many kinds,

889
01:30:39,864 --> 01:30:43,809
with birds singing on the bushes,
with various insects flitting about...

890
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:46,928
...and with worms
crawling through the damp earth...

891
01:30:47,028 --> 01:30:50,287
...and to reflect that these
elaborately constructed forms,

892
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:53,408
so different from each other
and dependent upon each other...

893
01:30:53,508 --> 01:30:59,798
...in so complex a manner, have all been
produced by laws acting around us.

894
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:09,607
'Advancing gently forward over
my breast, came almost up to my chin,

895
01:31:09,707 --> 01:31:14,680
and bending my eyes downwards
as much as I could, I quivered.'

896
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,924
Hello.
- Hello.

897
01:31:17,024 --> 01:31:20,853
I was wondering if I might, might take over.

898
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,420
Alright.

899
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:38,688
Where were you?

900
01:31:38,788 --> 01:31:42,244
'I perceived it to be a human creature
not six inches high.'

901
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:44,490
Not the book.

902
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,968
Please, a true story.

903
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,540
Like you did with Annie.

904
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:07,698
Alright. Let me think.

905
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:13,124
Did I ever tell you
about my riding with gauchos?

906
01:32:13,224 --> 01:32:16,286
Yes.
- Yes.

907
01:32:16,386 --> 01:32:19,684
Or the time our ship was struck
by Saint Elmo's fire?

908
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:22,243
Yes.
- My attempt to climb the Andes?

909
01:32:22,343 --> 01:32:24,343
Yes.
- Earthquakes?

910
01:32:24,425 --> 01:32:26,528
Yes.
- Tidal waves?

911
01:32:26,628 --> 01:32:30,287
Really? I did?
- Yes.

912
01:32:30,387 --> 01:32:34,722
Goodness gracious,
I think I've told you everything.

913
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:38,285
And yet I fancy

914
01:32:38,385 --> 01:32:43,230
I have never told you
about the giant sloth of Punta Alta.

915
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:45,619
No.

916
01:32:46,619 --> 01:32:50,447
Alright, then.
Millions and millions of years ago,

917
01:32:50,547 --> 01:32:55,222
in a rich and verdant land
that we now call Argentina...

918
01:32:55,579 --> 01:32:57,854
...there lived a mammal.

919
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,363
There lived a mammal
as large as an elephant,

920
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:09,808
as gentle as a lemur and as slow
as an incredibly slow snail.

921
01:33:09,908 --> 01:33:12,407
And he lived a happy life...

922
01:33:12,507 --> 01:33:17,182
...watching the slow green march
of the passing seasons.

923
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,487
Er... I've finished.

924
01:33:41,587 --> 01:33:43,855
I've finished.

925
01:33:47,659 --> 01:33:50,333
You decide.
- About what?

926
01:33:51,499 --> 01:33:54,449
Well, about what should be done with it.

927
01:33:54,549 --> 01:33:59,208
Someone needs to take God's side
in all of this.

928
01:33:59,308 --> 01:34:01,886
I'd much rather it was you than Innes.

929
01:34:01,986 --> 01:34:05,088
Supposing I think it should be destroyed?

930
01:34:05,188 --> 01:34:10,379
Well... then you must do
what you think is right.

931
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:16,660
Read it first.

932
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,607
Emma?

933
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,710
Well, you said it was my decision.

934
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:53,555
Emma, where... Where are you going?

935
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,070
To John Murray publishers.

936
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,300
Do I have it right?

937
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,495
Yes.

938
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:15,978
And so... you have finally
made an accomplice of me.

939
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:23,860
May God forgive us both.

940
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,325
Good morning, Jim.
- Morning, Mr Darwin, sir.

941
01:36:50,425 --> 01:36:53,570
That parcel for me?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

942
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:59,685
Thus, from the war of nature,
from famine and death,

943
01:36:59,785 --> 01:37:03,086
the most exalted object
we are capable of conceiving,

944
01:37:03,186 --> 01:37:08,031
namely the production of higher animals,
directly follows.

945
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:12,330
There is grandeur in this view of life,

946
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,928
that whilst this planet
has gone cycling on...

947
01:37:15,028 --> 01:37:20,407
...according to the fixed law of gravity,
from so simple a beginning,

948
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:24,587
endless forms,
most beautiful and most wonderful,

949
01:37:24,667 --> 01:37:29,290
have been, and are being, evolved.
