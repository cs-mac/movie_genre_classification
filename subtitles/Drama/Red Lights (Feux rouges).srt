00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,391
RED LIGHTS

"Meet you as planned at 5 p.m.

"I feel like a young man in love
on his first date.

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,355
"I can't wait for us to get on the road
and see the children again."

5
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,515
Come for a drink?

6
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,791
No, I'm meeting my wife at 5.
We leave this evening.

7
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,070
- Where to?
- To fetch the kids.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,714
Then to my in-laws
in the Basque country.

9
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,353
Drive safely!

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,392
- I'll see you in 20 min.
- <i>Already?</i>

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,308
- We said 5 at the bar.
- <i>Get my necklace at the jeweler's?</i>

12
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,237
The one ne<i>xt</i> to the florist?

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,199
I'll take care of it.

14
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,478
A beer, please.

15
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,511

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,070

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,553
Anything else, sir?

- <i>Antoine? I'm so sorry...</i>
- What're you up to?

25
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,509
- <i>I got held up. I'm coming!</i>
- Stop saying that. Just come!

26
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,198
<i>I'm coming, I'm coming!</i>

27

- How're you?
- Fine. You?

28
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,429
Exhausted.

29
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,597
You didn't look exhausted
across the street.

30
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,269
I had to answer an email from the US.
It took time.

31
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,799
Get my message?

32
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,792
What're you staring at?

33
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,831
- Your necklace.
- Why?

34
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,554
I hadn't noticed
you stopped wearing it.

35
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,591
I took it in 3 weeks ago.

36
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,039
Want a drink?

37
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,559
No, let's get going.

38
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,148
You have to get the car
and I have to pack.

39
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,840
I want to shower first, too.

40
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,275
Why leave so early?
In an hour, traffic will let up.

41
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,038
Let's eat here.

42
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,276
You don't mind eating cold, do you?

43
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,078
What are you doing?

44
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,029
Why are you standing there?

45
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,639
I'm going out.

46
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,557
- What?
- I'm going out.

47
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,274
- What for?
- Cigarettes.

48
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,992
There are plenty here.

49
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,192
I'll get gas and check the oil.
It'll save time.

50
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,793
A scotch, please.

51
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,751
- A single?
- Double.

52
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,636
I filled the tank...

53
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,152
And checked the tires.

54
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,472
And the cigarettes?

55
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,909
- You said we had some.
- I was wrong.

56
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,355
- Want me to drive?
- No, thanks.

57
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,278
Sure you're okay?

58
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,469
Of course.

59
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,399
What's on your mind?

60
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,357
Nothing special. And you?

61
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,156
I'm dying to see the kids.
I wonder if they've changed.

62
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,553
You can take a shower.

63
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,595
You have time.
I have to finish packing.

64
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,432
<i>On the A42 south of Beaune</i>
<i>a car collided with a truck.</i>

65
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,233
<i>The car's occupants</i>
<i>were killed instantly.</i>

66
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,396
<i>The truck driver is unscathed.</i>

67
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,717
<i>10 minutes later,</i>
<i>at the Mâcon exit...</i>

68
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,228
Let's get off and take the back way.

69
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,193
We'll get back on the highway
after Tours.

70
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,552
What do you think?

71
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,156
<i>Hélène?</i>
<i>Know Ducasse's fees?</i>

72
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,511
Not off the top of my head.
It can wait till I'm back.

73
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,629
<i>When's that?</i>

74
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,512
Tell them the 18th.

75
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,959
Hang on!

76
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,674
<i>That's a long break!</i>

77
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,279
Two weeks. I deserve 'em.

78
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,914
<i>Sure you can live without me</i>
<i>that long?</i>

79
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,678
Aren't you presumptuous!

80
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,916
- <i>Take care.</i>
- You, too.

81
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,559
- What're you doing?
- I want to move.

82
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,035
But it's only for a few miles!

83
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,599
Take the left lane. It's moving faster.

84
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,119
Can't you see I'm trying?

85
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,759
Watch out!

86
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,318
- Why the face?
- What face?

87
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,112
You seem irritated.

88
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,869
Because I'm in the left lane
when the right line was fine!

89
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,472
- If you're tired, I can drive...
- I said no!

90
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,595
What're you doing?

91
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,152
I have to pee.

92
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,271
Need anything?

93
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,115
A scotch, please.

94
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,071
- Single or double?
- Double.

95
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,354
There's a detour.
We have to go right.

96
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,038
Thanks, I noticed.

97
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,631
There's always a detour on this road!
Can't they repair in winter?

98
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,752
- When the ground's frozen?
- Or the fall!

99
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,110
Not with 2 million on the road!

100
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,195
- You missed the turnoff.
- What turnoff?

101
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,958
For Tours.

102
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,757
What about the cars behind us?

103
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,030
They aren't all going to Tours.

104
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,957
Relax, you'll get to Tours!

105
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,716
What'd I tell you?

106
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,239
We're on the wrong road.

107
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,272
It never occurs to you
you could be mistaken.

108
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,269
Say what's on your mind for once!

109
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,197
- Remember that 125-mile detour?
- To avoid traffic!

110
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,389
Not intentionally.

111
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,318
You trying to piss me off?
Just say so!

112
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,477
Shut up a second!
I'm trying to see where we are.

113
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,032
I think we're on Route 182
heading toward Blois.

114
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,637
Sure you won't turn around?

115
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,955
- Furious?
- Me?

116
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,718
You see anyone else here?

117
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,038
Just because I dared ignore the arrow
and we'll make a detour.

118
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,159
- What's wrong?
- You almost hit the guardrail.

119
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,028
Can't I drive?

120
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,549
And get there three weeks from now?

121
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,831
- The lady doesn't like my driving?
- Watch the road.

122
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,473
I'll watch the road,

123
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,513
I'll drive nicely, carefully,
without going off the tracks.

124
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,630
You know which tracks I mean?
You get my meaning?

125
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,034
Is this necessary?

126
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,958
That you care what I think?
It might help you.

127
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,795
- Help me what?
- Help you...

128
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,552
To understand me, for instance.
And in that way...

129
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,716
to make my life easier.

130
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,912
But I doubt that really interests you.

131
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,837
You're far too selfish.

132
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,679
If you loved me even a little, you'd...

133
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,110
- Finish your sentence!
- What's dumber than a train?

134
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,474
I felt like a train on that highway.

135
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,833
I had to get off the tracks.
Understand?

136
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,714
Do all these guys ask their wives
before getting a beer?

137
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,433
You had a beer?

138
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,671
- What'd you drink?
- A scotch.

139
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,949
A double?

140
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,672
- And before?
- Before what?

141
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,951
What did you drink before you got gas?

142
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,433
- Nothing.
- Is that so?

143
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,553
Don't believe me?

144
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,148
If it's true,
then it went to your head.

145
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,475
Think I'm drunk?

146
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,953
You talk as if you are.

147
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,433
Am I talking nonsense?

148
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,993
No, but you hate me.

149
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,473
Not at all.

150
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,511
I can see it in your eyes.

151
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,473
- Why won't you understand?
- Understand what?

152
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,639
I don't hate you. I just wish
you'd treat me like a man sometimes.

153
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,716
And let you stop at every bar?

154
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,831
- Here we go again!
- What?

155
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,837
You always find the putdown.

156
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,272
- Think I'm an alcoholic?
- I wouldn't have married an alcoholic.

157
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,072
- Do I drink often?
- Not often.

158
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,760
- How many times a year?
- I've never counted.

159
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,711
Two or three times at most.

160
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,159
So what's got into you?

161
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,271
Dunno. I'm in a tunnel tonight.

162
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,433
It's your fault.

163
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,950
If only you didn't treat me
as the lowest of the low,

164
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,390
as soon as I feel like
stepping out of line.

165
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,751
Is your life that tough?

166
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,711
Take Hervé...

167
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,876
Every evening he's half-drunk.

168
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,913
But you still find him interesting.
You talk to him for hours,

169
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,951
even when he's smashed.

170
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,559
First, he's not my husband.

171
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,476
And second?

172
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,910
- There's a truck.
- I saw it! Mind talking about Hervé?

173
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,112
Will you shut up!
I'm trying to read the signs!

174
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,832
- Admit you'd rather be with him.
- Stop it!

175
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,631
Now we're on Route 10.
Tours is to the left.

176
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,714
<i>A spectacular escape</i>
<i>from Le Mans prison...</i>

177
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,833
<i>The fugitive, highly dangerous,</i>
<i>was last seen in a stolen car.</i>

178
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,520
<i>He threatened the police</i>
<i>before fleeing.</i>

179
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,835
<i>His description has been sent out.</i>

180
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,393
What're you doing?

181
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,156
As you can see, I'm stopping.

182
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,636
If you get out of this car,
I'm going on alone.

183
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,596
If you intend to join us,
you can take the train.

184
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,471
And a drink for my young friend here.

185
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,152
- This round's on me.
- No, my wife's waiting.

186
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,070
See George? Life's great. Yep!

187
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,839
To the good life!

188
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,717
Hey, buddy...

189
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,556
That's not very smart.

190
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,314
It's very bad for your health,
understand?

191
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,596
The devil's on vacation with you.

192
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,996
Let it all out.

193
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,269
I gotta go...

194
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,674
You...

195
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,360
You're a nice guy.

196
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,989
It's written on your fucking face.

197
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,632
Everyone can see it. So be careful!

198
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,872
I'm going.

199
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,872
Buddy, you're going
in the wrong direction!

200
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,997
"I'm taking the train."

201
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,593
<i>You've reached Hél...</i>

202
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,748
- Where's this train go?
- To the depot.

203
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,158
I'm looking for my wife. A brunette
with light pants and a tank top.

204
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,509
- Any more trains?
- Last one just left.

205
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,868
- For where?
- Bordeaux.

206
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,150
- What's the ne<i>xt</i> stop?
- Sainte Maure.

207
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,032
- Is that far?
- 20 miles.

208
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,278
<i>You've reached...</i>

209
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,639
Move your ass!
I've got a train to catch!

210
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,677
What're you holding up
decent people for?

211
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,631
Don't stay here, please.

212
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,032
Go back to your car.

213
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,313
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

214
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,353
Mind cluing me in?

215
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,391
They're after a fugitive.

216
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,910
What's it to me?
There are worse things going on!

217
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,716
I gotta meet my wife's train.

218
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,239
- The Bordeaux train go by?
- 25 minutes ago.

219
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,191
Sorry, I have to lock up.

220
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,833
What time is it?

221
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,913
Ten past midnight.

222
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,834
A scotch.

223
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,117
This one's on me.

224
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,791
Hey, boss, two.

225
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,074
Two what?

226
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,317
Ask the gentleman
what he's having.

227
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,877
Two whiskies.

228
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,113
I've got lots of time.

229
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,877
It's my night.

230
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,398
You married?

231
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,748
Not married?

232
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,313
I'm married.

233
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,159
I have two kids,
a daughter, 10, a son, 8.

234
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,316
They're at camp in the southwest.

235
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,115
I'm on my way to pick them up.
I'm from Paris.

236
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,710
And you? From around here?

237
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,398
Not drinking? Don't like it?

238
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,796
Never mind, it's a free country.
Do what you like.

239
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,797
I don't like whisky either.

240
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,278
But tonight
I happen to be drinking whisky.

241
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,030
But it's not my fault really.

242
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,752
It's my wife's fault.

243
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,840
If you're single,
maybe you never wondered,

244
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,916
but the question is crucial.

245
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,758
Take my wife, for instance.

246
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,509
Am I right, am I wrong?
Who knows?

247
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,078
She must hate me right now,

248
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,952
but I don't give a shit.

249
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,591
I got sick of playing
the good little doggie.

250
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,798
Here are my kids.

251
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,031
Notice anything?

252
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,115
What?

253
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,993
That guy. Did you notice
a tattoo on his wrist?

254
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,873
- What guy?
- The one you bought a drink for.

255
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,992
And he refused. But that's okay.

256
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,715
- It's a free country...
- I'm not talking about that.

257
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,593
So he got up and left!

258
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,511
- Where you headed?
- Bordeaux.

259
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,389
Gimme a lift?

260
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,913
You're on.

261
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,752
Oh, shit!

262
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,630
Looks like another roadblock.

263
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,237
I could use a drink.

264
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,553
It's moving.

265
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,633
Want a cigarette?

266
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,959
Friendly advice:
don't breathe in their face.

267
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,278
We're through!

268
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,393
- Can't you read?
- Why?

269
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,511
- Speed limit's 55.
- I know.

270
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,473
- Play it safe and slow down.
- Relax!

271
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,909
- Know the road?
- You bet I know it!

272
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,634
Every summer for 15 years.
It's my road!

273
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,759
I wouldn't mind stopping in.
I'm thirsty.

274
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,279
Interested?

275
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,550
- You're like my dog.
- Why's that?

276
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,317
Always thirsty.

277
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,908
Tongue always hanging out, that it?

278
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,396
- Where's your dog?
- He's dead.

279
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,112
- What're you doing?
- What?

280
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,708
- Can't you drive straight?
- Sure, I can...

281
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,199
You're off your rocker!

282
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,958
I thought it was a roadblock.

283
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,798
You're a real wimp.

284
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,310
I got scared, so what?
Everybody gets scared. Don't you?

285
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,794
What the fuck?
I didn't tell you to stop.

286
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,593
I need gas.

287
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,118
Got any cold beer kicking around?

288
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,913
No, but I've got scotch.

289
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,519
Pefrect.

290
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,073
Want some?

291
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,917
Can you talk to me a bit?
It'll keep me awake.

292
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,708
Talk about what?

293
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,674
Anything. I'm a curious guy,
I'm interested in everything.

294
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,633
Falling asleep? Tired?

295
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,478
Never mind, watch the road.

296
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,832
I am.

297
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,395
Why? Think I'm a bad driver?

298
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,112
You're sluggish.

299
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,878
- Want me to go faster?
- No, straighter.

300
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,280
You should trust me more.

301
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,709
I drive best when I've had a drink.

302
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,592
Sure, one maybe.

303
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,358
Why don't you drive
if you don't trust me?

304
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,798
Leave that alone!

305
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,474
Why should I?
Don't you ever get smashed?

306
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,079
It doesn't interest me.

307
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,871
Me neither, usually.

308
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,952
An occasional beer after work...

309
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,559
Even that...

310
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,276
I rarely have time.

311
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,598
Gotta be home by 6 sharp.

312
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,759
The sitter's waiting for me
at the door with her coat on.

313
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,309
She's always in a hurry. Dunno why.

314
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,351
Her time must be valuable.

315
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,835
Everyone's is, except mine.

316
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,837
My wife's, especially.

317
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,235
She's a corporate lawyer.

318
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,476
You can't imagine what it's like.

319
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,272
Business lunches every day,

320
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,278
always in meetings,
never home before 8 p.m.

321
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,709
Year in, year out.

322
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,877
She's so important
that after the kids were born

323
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,032
her partners came in person

324
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,197
to convince her
to come back to work. Imagine!

325
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,674
What're you doing?

326
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,519
A flat. I didn't do it on purpose.

327
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,113
Get out.

328
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,514
I'm going.

329
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,354
- No spare?
- In the trunk.

330
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,919
Go get it!

331
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,835
Get the jack!

332
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,074
- You got a jack?
- I must have one.

333
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,119
Where is it?

334
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,554
Know how it works?

335
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,873
Sure I do.

336
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,195
Sorry.

337
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,715
Wait... I'll do it.

338
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,233
Get up.

339
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,995
Would you get up!

340
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,071
Stop hitting me. I'll get up.

341
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,757
To think, hundreds of 'em
are out looking for you,

342
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,633
howling your name
on every TV program...

343
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,273
You screwed 'em good.

344
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,398
You don't give a shit
about their laws.

345
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,757
That's the truth!

346
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,950
If men weren't scared shitless,

347
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,392
if they were real men like you,
we wouldn't need courts and cops

348
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,034
and red lights at every intersection.

349
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,271
You're above all that.

350
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,755
You're a lord, a prince.

351
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,990
Tonight, I feel happy.

352
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,476
Happier than I've ever been in my life.

353
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,068
You can't imagine how happy I am.

354
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,993
You're a brother.

355
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,555
You could've left me back there
to die like a dog.

356
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,919
If you didn't do it
for fear I'd turn you in, you're wrong.

357
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,992
I'm no snitch.

358
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,634
I have a sense of honor.
I'm a man, too.

359
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,919
You misjudge me.

360
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,756
That hurts me.

361
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,314
It really hurts me
that you misjudge me.

362
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,070
Hélène misjudges me, too.

363
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,634
She doesn't think I'm a man, either.

364
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,598
What're you doing?
Think I didn't see that?

365
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,312
Hey, you hear me?

366
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,112
This isn't the road to Bordeaux!

367
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,993
- Shut up!
- It's my car, my road, turn around!

368
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,792
Shut up, or out you go.

369
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,798
It's my car.
You don't scare me. You got no gun.

370
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,273
- Shut up!
- You got no gun.

371
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,437
I saw you with the tire.
Why drive with one hand?

372
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,279
- You're a cripple, that it?
- Will you shut up!

373
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,439
Get out.

374
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,912
What're you gonna do?

375
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,193
If you're gonna kill me,
do it fast and clean.

376
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,151
I don't wanna suffer.

377
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,192
- Break down?
- A flat.

378
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,471
- Give me a lift to the ne<i>xt</i> garage?
- Sure.

379
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,670
No, the other side.

380
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,038
Is that the village?

381
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,233
Are we far from Bordeaux?

382
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,191
This isn't the road.

383
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,357
- Really?
- Bordeaux's quite a ways. Why?

384
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,311
You want to go to Bordeaux?

385
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,631
What's the make of your car?

386
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,036
A gray Rover with Paris plates.

387
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,999
Got the keys?

388
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,638
They in the ignition?

389
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,912
I'll send someone.

390
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,598
That's my car.

391
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,399
You must've driven a long time
with the flat.

392
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,993
It's torn to shreds.
You need a new one.

393
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,629
Did you find a cell phone in the car?

394
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,199
Sure that clock's right?
Is it really 11 a.m.?

395
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,753
Yes, why?

396
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,318
What time do you think it is?

397
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,551
You think it's still last night?

398
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,158
Not going down?

399
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,679
Badly.

400
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,597
Won't you eat something?

401
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,078
I'd rather not.

402
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,038
What happened to you?

403
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,037
Why? What's wrong?

404
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,071
Looks like you got into a fight.

405
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,953
Can I use your phone?

406
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,352
Local calls only.

407
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,392
<i>You've reached Hélène's...</i>

408
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,315
It's Antoine Dunan.

409
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,512
<i>Your children are ready,</i>
<i>they're waiting for you.</i>

410
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,631
<i>We expected you at 10.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

411
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,274
- My wife's not there?
- <i>Isn't she with you?</i>

412
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,231
- She hasn't called?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

413
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,477
She was supposed to arrive
by the morning train.

414
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,160
- <i>What time?</i>
- The first train, I think.

415
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,033
- <i>The 6 a.m. bus?</i>
- I'll call you right back.

416
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,389
- <i>France Telecom...</i>
- The Cascade Hotel.

417
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,670
- <i>Which town?</i>
- Andernos.

418
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,791
- <i>Shall I connect you?</i>
- Please.

419
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,794
<i>Cascade Hotel.</i>

420
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,629
This is Mr. Dunan. Did my wife
take the room we reserved?

421
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,034
<i>No, sir. No one showed.</i>

422
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,752
Can you check the room?

423
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,236
<i>The key hasn't moved.</i>
<i>How will you pay? We held the room.</i>

424
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,114
Do you know what time
the first train arrives from Bordeaux?

425
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,071
<i>6 a.m. It's a bus.</i>

426
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,475
- And the ne<i>xt</i> one?
- <i>Just before 10.</i>

427
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,594
<i>France Rail.</i>

428
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,790
Is this the Andernos station?

429
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,912
Do you know if
the 6 o'clock bus arrived?

430
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,792
And the 10 o'clock bus?

431
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,194
On time?

432
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,233
You sure?

433
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,636
My wife should've been on one.
A brunette, short hair...

434
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,399
<i>We don't check our passengers.</i>

435
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,272
Of course. I'm sorry.

436
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,752
<i>Andernos Police Dept.</i>

437
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,518
Excuse me,

438
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,918
I'm worried about my wife.
She was to arrive this morning. Do you...

439
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,429
- <i>Name?</i>
- Hélène Dunan.

440
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,312
- <i>Age?</i>
- 40.

441
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,910
- <i>Description?</i>
- Average height, short brown hair.

442
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,669
- Wearing light pants and...
- <i>No one answers that description.</i>

443
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,153
You sure?

444
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,749
- No one was taken to the hospital?
- <i>A man who had a car accident.</i>

445
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,998
Did you hear if the bus
had any problems this morning?

446
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,078
<i>Not to our knowledge.</i>
<i>Try the train station.</i>

447
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,349
Thank you.

448
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,677
Antoine Dunan again.

449
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,998
- Has my wife arrived?
- <i>Not in the past 5 minutes.</i>

450
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,314
She hasn't called?

451
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,956
- You sure?
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

452
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,073
- Could anyone else have answered?
- <i>Only I answer the phone.</i>

453
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,794
- <i>So what do we do?</i>
- What do you mean?

454
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,309
<i>What do I tell the children?</i>

455
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,317
Tell them...

456
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,197
Tell them we've been delayed.

457
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,914
<i>When do you expect to arrive?</i>

458
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,553
In two hours at most.

459
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,875
<i>And if your wife arrives?</i>

460
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,991
Tell her she can reach me...

461
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,315
Is this the number?

462
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,796
- At 0546541322.
- <i>All right.</i>

463
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,792
Want anything else?

464
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,277
Sure you're all right?

465
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,719
It's my wife.

466
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,319
What's happened to her?

467
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,508
I can't seem to find out.
She's vanished.

468
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,517
We left Paris last night.

469
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,871
We had a spat,
she decided to take the train.

470
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,558
After that I don't know.

471
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,079
Where were you?

472
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,792
In Tours.

473
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,638
You saw her board a train?

474
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,228
<i>France Telecom...</i>

475
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,112
The Tours police, please.

476
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,910
I'm looking for my wife.

477
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,079
We split up just before Tours
and I have no news.

478
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,112
I wondered if you heard anything.

479
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,593
<i>Hold the line.</i>

480
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,712
<i>No, sir, nothing unusual reported.</i>

481
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,678
Where was the train going?

482
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,360
- Bordeaux.
- Maybe she left you a message.

483
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,714
<i>Bordeaux station.</i>

484
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,751
Is there a message for Mr. Dunan?

485
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,791
<i>A message when?</i>

486
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,514
- Last night or this morning.
- <i>Hold the line.</i>

487
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,435
<i>No, sir, no message. Sorry.</i>

488
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,269
Did the night train from Tours
arrive this morning?

489
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,594
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

490
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,759
- No problems? No delay?
- <i>Hold the line.</i>

491
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,233
<i>I'm told it was 30 minutes late</i>

492
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,079
<i>due to an incident in Poitiers.</i>

493
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,394
What was it?

494
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,034
<i>I'm afraid I don't know, sir.</i>

495
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,709
<i>Poitiers station.</i>

496
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,355
I understand there was a problem
on the train last night.

497
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,754
<i>That's correct.</i>

498
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,791
Can you tell me what?

499
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,435
<i>A woman was found unconscious</i>
<i>with a head wound.</i>

500
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,677
<i>The Emergency Squad took her</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

501
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,597
Do you know the woman's name?

502
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,995
<i>We weren't told her identity.</i>

503
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,269
You didn't see her?

504
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,516
<i>I wasn't on duty last night.</i>

505
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,958
<i>Poitiers Hospital...</i>

506
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,833
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Hélène Dunan.

507
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,718
<i>She's not on my list.</i>

508
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,759
<i>Is she in maternity?</i>

509
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,589
No, she was brought in
to the emergency room last night.

510
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,280
- <i>About what time?</i>
- After midnight.

511
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,913
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

512
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,274
<i>There's a mistake. The hospital's full.</i>
<i>No one's been admitted.</i>

513
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,518
<i>She may have been treated here</i>
<i>and taken elsewhere.</i>

514
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,797
<i>Try Jean Bernard Hospital.</i>

515
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,795
<i>Hold the line.</i>

516
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,512
<i>Is she in surgery?</i>

517
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,870
I don't know.
She was found on a train.

518
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,910
<i>Hold the line.</i>

519
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,393
Just a minute!

520
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,318
She's probably not registered
under her name.

521
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,032
<i>What name would it be?</i>

522
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,550
None.

523
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,478
I just found out
she has a head wound.

524
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,399
- <i>How old is she?</i>
- 40.

525
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,714
<i>Hold the line.</i>

526
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,788
<i>We don't have that person.</i>
<i>Last night several ambulances...</i>

527
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,990
<i>Poitiers Hospital...</i>

528
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,315
Sorry to bother you again.

529
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,432
My wife's probably not registered
under her name.

530
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,312
- <i>What name then?</i>
- None.

531
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,115
A woman of 40 was found on a train
with a head wound.

532
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,396
<i>I'm terribly sorry. We have no one</i>
<i>of that description.</i>

533
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,078
<i>Did you try Jean Bernard?</i>

534
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,034
Try the police in Poitiers.
They should know which hospital.

535
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,712
- <i>Try the University Hospital.</i>
- She's not there.

536
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,070
- <i>And Jean Bernard?</i>
- Not there either.

537
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,758
<i>Try Châtellerault.</i>

538
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,233
<i>Châtellerault Hospital.</i>

539
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,670
Did you admit a woman
with a head wound?

540
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,199
- <i>You are?</i>
- Her husband.

541
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,276
<i>Your name, please.</i>

542
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,075
- Is she there?
- <i>If she's the one found on a train.</i>

543
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,668
- Can I speak to her?
- <i>Your name, please.</i>

544
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,677
- Antoine Dunan.
- <i>Hold the line.</i>

545
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,391
<i>I'll pass you the head nurse.</i>

546
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,910
<i>I'm told you're the husband</i>
<i>of our injured patient.</i>

547
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:24,236
<i>I can't wake her up right now.</i>
<i>The doctor ordered not to disturb her.</i>

548
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,715
- How is she?
- <i>She's in shock.</i>

549
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,115
- What happened?
- <i>The doctor will explain.</i>

550
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,958
Can't you tell me anything?

551
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,189
- Is she okay?
- <i>She's out of danger.</i>

552
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,118
- <i>We're expecting you.</i>
- I'm leaving now.

553
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,477
Can I make one more call?

554
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,033
Sure.

555
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,915
It's Antoine Dunan. I found my wife.
She's in a hospital in Châtellerault.

556
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,429
<i>What happened?</i>

557
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,997
She was hurt on a train.
That's all I know. I'm going right now.

558
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,590
Could you keep the children
until this evening?

559
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,711
<i>Yes, but till what time?</i>

560
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,478
Eight at the latest.

561
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,875
<i>Don't you want to speak to the kids?</i>

562
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,391
I'm in no shape to.
I'll worry them even more.

563
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,919
I'm sorry...

564
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,234
Explain the situation. Reassure them.

565
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,237
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

566
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,277
Won't you eat something?

567
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,679
Can I pay for the calls
and the rest by credit card?

568
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,074
If you like.

569
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,988
My wife's in a hospital in Châtellerault.

570
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,039
I heard.

571
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,832
But are you sure it's her?

572
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,831
I'm Antoine Dunan.
I called about my wife.

573
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,714
You can't go up now.
Visiting hours start at 2:30 p.m.

574
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,832
- The head nurse said...
- One moment.

575
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,996
I'm the one you spoke to earlier.

576
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,758
Your wife's still sleeping.

577
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,077
With what the doctor gave her,
she'll be out a while.

578
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,875
- I must see her.
- Let me ask the doctor. He's busy now.

579
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,114
- I have to see her.
- I understand, but you can't just yet.

580
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,712
Can you tell me what happened?

581
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,831
The doctor will see you.

582
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,235
Take a seat.
Someone will come for you.

583
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,991
Lt. Levet, Poitiers police.

584
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,514
Have you managed to see your wife?

585
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,513
Not yet.

586
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,278
I'm to wait for the doctor.

587
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,628
Very well.

588
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,028
Please follow me.

589
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,949
Wait.

590
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,558
You can go in.

591
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,956
I haven't had time to fill you in
on the facts.

592
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,478
Your wife, if it's her in there,
is out of danger.

593
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,830
The doctor is definite about that.

594
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,555
But she's in a state of shock.

595
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,831
Whatever she does or says,
you must remain calm.

596
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,158
Your husband's here.

597
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,116
Forgive me.

598
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,832
I was so afraid.

599
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,188
I called the children. They're fine.
They're waiting for us.

600
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,797
Did they tell you?

601
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,955
What?

602
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,274
What is it?

603
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,753
Tell me what?

604
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,353
What's the matter?

605
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,038
Hélène, look at me.

606
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,436
You'd better leave now.

607
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:58,789
The doctor doesn't know
if your wife can leave tonight,

608
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,957
and he wants her
to rest this afternoon.

609
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,150
He'll examine her again at 7 p.m.

610
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,717
Do you hear me?

611
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,958
Do you know what my wife
was trying to tell me?

612
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,110
Let's find a place
where we can talk quietly.

613
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:27,712
Can you give me
your wife's maiden name?

614
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,599
Meurissey.

615
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,517
Place of birth?

616
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,755
Dakar, Senegal.

617
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,108
Your address?

618
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,629
54, blvd. de la République, Boulogne.

619
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,159
Is your wife employed?

620
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,508
Yes. In a law firm.

621
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,709
Do you work as well?

622
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,400
I work for an insurance company.

623
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,033
Do you have children?

624
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,515
Two. A daughter, 10, and a son, 8.

625
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,189
They're at summer camp.
We're on our way to pick them up.

626
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,713
Have you and your wife
known each other long?

627
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,399
We married 12 years ago,
3 years after we met.

628
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,590
- What terms are you on?
- Good terms.

629
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,472
You weren't with her last night?

630
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,955
Only in the early evening.

631
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,153
Why only then?

632
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,679
I stopped for a drink.

633
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,994
Where?

634
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,195
First just south of Chartres.

635
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,039
On the old road.
I can't say where exactly.

636
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,752
Did your wife go in?

637
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,155
- She stayed put.
- What'd you drink?

638
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,191
- Scotch.
- Then what?

639
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,959
- We got back on the road.
- Did you argue?

640
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,354
Not really.

641
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:34,713
Hélène was testy. That makes me
belligerent, but it was no big deal.

642
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,478
A normal spat.

643
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,956
But you stopped another time?

644
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,389
- Where?
- Just before Tours.

645
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,351
Your wife didn't join you?

646
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,791
When I came out of the bar...

647
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,149
Yes?

648
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,993
She was gone. She left a note
saying she was taking the train.

649
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,877
Did she threaten to do that?

650
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,230
She said she'd leave in the car.

651
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,793
Why didn't she?

652
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,798
I'd taken the keys with me.

653
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,029
She didn't say she'd leave anyway?

654
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,199
You sure?

655
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,753
No mention of a train?

656
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,875
Mr. Dunan, does your wife
have a habit of disappearing?

657
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,949
Did you have a violent row before?

658
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,274
Just a few words.

659
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,311
Did she mention divorce?

660
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,149
I had one drink too many.
It's not grounds for divorce!

661
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,878
When you realized your wife was gone,
what did you do?

662
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,558
I went to Tours station.

663
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,714
How long do you think
you were in the bar?

664
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,593
Ten minutes, maybe 20.

665
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,439
I tried to leave,
but a guy bought me a drink.

666
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,959
You return the favor?

667
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,515
No, but he wouldn't let me go.

668
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,152
Think she could've got to Tours
on foot?

669
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,157
Maybe someone drove her
or she called a taxi.

670
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,271
She did call a taxi.

671
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,676
And the taxi driver,
who parked at Tours station,

672
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,157
said a gray Rover with Paris plates
roared off. Was it you?

673
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,000
- I tried to catch the train.
- Did you?

674
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:15,113
It left Sainte Maure 20 minutes
before I arrived. I gave up.

675
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,673
What did you do?

676
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,356
Mr. Dunan, what did you do?

677
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,599
I went into the bar across the street.

678
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,632
Did you notice anyone
in particular there?

679
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,748
You didn't strike up a conversation
as in the previous bar?

680
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,357
No, I just had a drink.

681
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,075
Very well.

682
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,550
I'll go get us something to drink.
Coffee or something else?

683
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,796
- I wouldn't mind.
- What?

684
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,993
Coffee.

685
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,798
Christophe Mantana...
He broke out of Le Mans prison.

686
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,150
He was found dead by the D35.

687
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,397
A car seems to have run over him
several times.

688
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,559
Witnesses sighted Mantana in the bar
after the train left Sainte Maure station.

689
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,794
After Sainte Maure,
we lose track of him.

690
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,469
He must've met some trusting soul
who gave him a lift.

691
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,270
But this time Mantana met a man

692
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,437
who didn't want to wind up
as road kill.

693
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,951
Other witnesses say Mantana was
at Tours station before the train left.

694
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,239
He followed your wife aboard.

695
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:55,195
The train was virtually empty.
He could attack her without being seen.

696
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,915
He got off after taking
her jewelry and purse contents.

697
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,752
We'll know in a few days,
when the DNA tests come back.

698
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,598
Why DNA tests?

699
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:13,430
It wasn't just to rob her
that he attacked your wife.

700
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,633
The doctor will examine
your wife again at 7

701
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,558
and tell you if you can see her.

702
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,113
That gives you time
to go into Châtellerault

703
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,038
and find a hotel for the night.

704
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,558
Are you in shape to drive?

705
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,191
- What time is it?
- <i>6:30 p.m.</i>

706
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,469
You sure?

707
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,594
Clara, this is Daddy.

708
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,836
- <i>Is Mommy okay?</i>
- Mommy's fine.

709
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,520
She gets out of the hospital tomorrow.

710
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,914
<i>For sure?</i>

711
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,396
Yes, I promise. Don't worry.

712
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,636
<i>Will you really be here tomorrow?</i>

713
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,991
C'mon, honey, don't cry.
Everything's fine.

714
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,714
If you cry, I'll cry, too.

715
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,478
<i>Yes, Daddy.</i>

716
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,160
We're thinking of you very hard.

717
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,790
We send our love, we love you.

718
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,354
- <i>Mommy, too?</i>
- Mommy, too.

719
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,959
See you tomorrow.

720
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,799
Is that Mr. Dunan?

721
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,191
Are you Mrs. Dunan's husband?

722
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,109
Barring complications,
she can leave tomorrow morning.

723
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,869
Her head wound isn't a pretty sight,
but it'll heal fast.

724
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,390
The hardest part in her case
will be psychological.

725
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,478
It'll take time for her
to feel normal again.

726
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,952
She said you have kids?

727
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,229
Yes, two.

728
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,157
- How old?
- 8 and 10.

729
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,794
- Boy? Girl?
- One of each.

730
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,718
Her pregnancies weren't difficult?

731
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:04,194
No complications, no miscarriages?

732
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,396
She's awake. Let's go see her.

733
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,318
Take a seat.

734
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,356
Can you come out a minute?

735
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,473
It's past visiting hours.

736
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,955
Make sure he stays no more
than 20 min.

737
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,555
The nurse will come for you.

738
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:38,559
Don't stay more than 20 min.
and don't let her talk too much.

739
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,999
All right?

740
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,271
Your wife's waiting to see you.

741
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,913
Don't say anything.

742
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,314
The nurse wanted to make me up.
I said no.

743
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,998
I don't look too awful?

744
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,633
Not at all.

745
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,159
You looked so scared earlier.

746
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,271
I was afraid you'd hate me.

747
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,072
Why?

748
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,952
It's all my fault.

749
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,431
I have to tell you something.

750
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,392
Do you know when
I started to lie last night?

751
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,158
We hadn't even left.

752
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,635
I told you I'd had a beer, but no.

753
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,113
I'd had three.

754
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,551
When you were in the shower,

755
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,477
I said I'd get gas.

756
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,878
It wasn't true, either.
I had a scotch.

757
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,877
I kept going all night.

758
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,672
I wanted to feel strong.

759
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,074
Completely free.

760
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,314
You hated me.

761
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,795
I took it all out on you,

762
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,592
on us,

763
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,358
on the children even.

764
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,839
With a drunkard's rage, I tried

765
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,439
to debase everything

766
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,551
and I kept going all night.

767
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,638
Until I wound up this morning
on the roadside

768
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,431
without knowing where I was.

769
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,397
Did you have an accident?

770
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,594
You're shaking.

771
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,597
In just a few hours,
our life turned upside down.

772
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,438
Be quiet.

773
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,039
And I'm afraid.

774
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:22,028
Afraid nothing will ever be the same...

775
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,196
That each time the memory of...

776
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,920
When we're happy,
we don't pay attention.

777
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,880
The four of us were happy, right?

778
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,797
Please stop.

779
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,108
I want us to leave here tomorrow
and go get the kids together.

780
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,956
Antoine, I want to live with you.
