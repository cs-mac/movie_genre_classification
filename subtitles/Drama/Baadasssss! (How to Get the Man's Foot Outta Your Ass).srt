1
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:12,593
<i>I am Ghost Agent K.</i>

2
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,387
<i>A shadow without a name or reputation.</i>

3
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,991
<i>The hunting rifle with a dragon on it.</i>

4
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:21,995
<i>The NIS director has the same one.
I've seen it.</i>

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,746
<i>What will you do about K?</i>

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,063
He must be eliminated.

7
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:29,502
<i>I have a copy of material
which I could use against him.</i>

8
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:30,837
<i>It's in my safe.</i>

9
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:32,237
Let's begin our deal.

10
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:34,948
<i>The mission is not over yet.</i>

11
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,503
Answer truthfully to the questions asked.

12
00:00:55,177 --> 00:00:57,471
It's an assassination-use explosive
developed in Mossad.

13
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:07,981
With a press of this button,

14
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:09,816
only your heart will go

15
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:11,693
boom.

16
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,078
Don't try to run or do anything stupid.

17
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:23,914
Just answer truthfully.

18
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:36,593
<i>Person to person.</i>

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,597
Only the truth can save you.

20
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,175
Hello.

21
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,659
- Yes.
- Thank you for joining us.

22
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:24,850
<i>We're going on live.</i>

23
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:26,393
Camera start.

24
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,896
Three, two, one.

25
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,773
Cue.

26
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,628
Hello, I'm Byung-pyo Jang.

27
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:39,364
Welcome to the live talk show,
<i>Person to Person.</i>

28
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,820
<i>He went from being a Korean star
to a Hollywood star.</i>

29
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,470
<i>"The worst there is."</i>

30
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,204
<i>We have actor Un-Gwang Yeo with us.</i>

31
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:48,498
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

32
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:50,459
<i>Thank you very much for joining us.</i>

33
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:54,254
<i>It's my pleasure.
It's an honor to be here.</i>

34
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,024
<i>Also, the top businessman in the nation...</i>

35
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:59,551
<i>Listen carefully to what my husband says.</i>

36
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:01,028
<i>Agent Y.</i>

37
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:04,782
<i>He was voted number one next generation
leader. Mr. Seung-Jae Mo.</i>

38
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,975
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

39
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,580
<i>Live talk show, Person to Person,</i>

40
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,356
is not scripted or edited,
and is broadcast live.

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,692
First, why don't you greet each other?

42
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,070
It's been a while.

43
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,448
I'm a huge Dark Death fan.

44
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,073
Are you?

45
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:27,996
Then why did you try to kill me, twice?

46
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,004
<i>What is he saying?</i>

47
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,233
Mr. Choi, please trust me.

48
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:42,844
I guarantee your ratings will soar today.

49
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,642
<i>Mr. Yeo.</i>

50
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:50,519
What are you saying?

51
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:53,414
- This is live...
- Eight years ago

52
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:54,731
and two months ago.

53
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,358
The accidents during my stunt shoots.

54
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,653
Those were hits ordered by you,
Mr. Seung-Jae Mo, to kill me.

55
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,414
- I don't understand what...
- Do you need proof?

56
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:17,587
This is a pen used by a prosecutor
who I truly respect.

57
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,175
<i>You need to do something.</i>

58
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:24,593
<i>The actor Un-Gwang Yeo.</i>

59
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,300
<i>Get rid of him.
Make it look like an accident on set.</i>

60
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:29,975
<i>Songsan's CEO, Seung-Jae Mo.</i>

61
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:32,227
<i>Order to murder Un-Gwang Yeo.</i>

62
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:33,811
<i>November 18th.</i>

63
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,274
Go to commercials! Now!

64
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:40,610
<i>We will take a short commercial break.</i>

65
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,950
We are taking a commercial break.

66
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,764
Don't think about running.

67
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:25,965
<i>Ms. Cha.</i>

68
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:29,743
- Are you trying to kill me?
- You started in current events,

69
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,369
so you know better than anyone.

70
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:36,416
We can uncover Songsan's CEO,
Seung-Jae Mo's dirty connections.

71
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,228
Is that recording real?

72
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,252
It's real.

73
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:41,754
Plus,

74
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,444
these are Songsan's confidential documents
that we obtained.

75
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,677
Please check them.

76
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:13,202
It's K.

77
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,707
Look under the table.

78
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:26,967
You know what that is, don't you?

79
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,491
It's an assassination-use explosive.

80
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,013
If you hang up or move,

81
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:34,683
it will explode.

82
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,407
Songsan group audit report

83
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,827
Listen carefully.

84
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:57,831
The host will exit and leave
Seung-Jae Mo and Un-Gwang Yeo alone.

85
00:06:58,415 --> 00:06:59,457
Cameras, stand by.

86
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,273
Do you think this will change anything?

87
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:08,299
The world cannot take your side.

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Who knows?

89
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,471
Just once in a while,
the world flips upside down.

90
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,305
Today is that day.

91
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:17,058
<i>We're going back on air.</i>

92
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,768
<i>In ten seconds!</i>

93
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:20,937
<i>What do you want?</i>

94
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,276
It's very simple.

95
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,571
Crime and punishment.

96
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,831
It's time for revenge.

97
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,061
<i>We are back on air.</i>

98
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:47,047
<i>- It's time for you to answer.</i>
- They are starting again.

99
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,258
<i>Is this like candid cameras or something?</i>

100
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,238
Your joke is a little out of line.

101
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:57,766
Well, this is a live broadcast disclosure.

102
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,316
Do you refuse to answer?

103
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,153
I will tell you the truth.

104
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,883
I never ordered something so vicious.

105
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,116
So are you saying

106
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:18,828
that your personal assistant ordered
something without your instruction?

107
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:20,996
I don't know.

108
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:23,458
Even if my assistant did it,

109
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,710
I know nothing about it.

110
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,255
That recording must be fake.

111
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,009
How effective
is a poorly fabricated recording?

112
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,781
That will be proven easily
through science.

113
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,224
Verification is irrelevant.

114
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,101
Evidence

115
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:45,063
is only real if it's in the hands
of the powerful.

116
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:48,775
<i>- That's useless.</i>
- Don't worry about that.

117
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:53,464
We have plenty of evidence in our hands.

118
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:54,656
<i>Next.</i>

119
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,158
<i>That scholarship foundation
you recently created.</i>

120
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,244
It isn't a donation to society, is it?

121
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:04,874
From what I can see,
rather than scholarships...

122
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,709
Songsan group audit report

123
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,129
<i>you're creating a slush fund.</i>

124
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,083
<i>If there's a problem with it,</i>

125
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:17,446
- the Prosecutor's Office will take action.
- So that you're not responsible, right?

126
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,266
It may be my fault for not checking
the minute details of the foundation,

127
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,227
but I have nothing to do with it.

128
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:26,688
My wife...

129
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:31,025
My wife is managing the foundation.

130
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,000
<i>Since when</i>

131
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,587
<i>was Mi-eun on your side?</i>

132
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,465
<i>Mi-eun was never on anyone's side.</i>

133
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,302
She's just a mom...

134
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,555
who's protecting her child.

135
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,183
<i>First, you blamed your assistant.</i>

136
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:04,767
Now,

137
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:06,537
you're blaming your wife.

138
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:09,731
If you're saying I'm at fault
for not keeping those around me in check,

139
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,401
I will apologize for that.

140
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:15,402
However,

141
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,572
a moral responsibility differs

142
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:19,592
from legal responsibility.

143
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:22,243
Conclusively, you're saying
you aren't responsible at all.

144
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:24,387
<i>That's because I haven't done anything.</i>

145
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,210
<i>Track my location and send agents.</i>

146
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:36,507
What about the prosecutor,
Dong-Hyun Lee, and his accident?

147
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:39,676
Who?

148
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,971
Dong-Hyun Lee?

149
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:44,724
Who is he?

150
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:48,770
Why, that little scumbag.

151
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:50,562
Goodness.

152
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,959
He'll keep denying everything.
I'm sure of it.

153
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:56,569
Goodness, that evil bastard.

154
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:03,076
I don't know him at all.

155
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:04,618
You don't know him.

156
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,287
You don't remember.

157
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:08,873
Do you even know who your assistant is?

158
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:11,542
You keep mentioning my assistant.

159
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,879
I would like to call that assistant
and question him myself,

160
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,674
and ask what he's been doing
without my knowledge.

161
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,467
Even if you want to,

162
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:23,179
you won't be able to see him for a while.

163
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,975
<i>Mr. Jang, who stuck to you like a shadow,</i>

164
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,187
<i>is being interrogated
at the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

165
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:36,150
I do not know

166
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:38,653
what my assistant did.

167
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:45,743
Do you know why Dark Death
is a scary villain?

168
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,124
If he thinks it's necessary,

169
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,710
he blows up bombs like nothing,

170
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,005
regardless of the time and place.

171
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,354
Boom.

172
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,237
What did you put on Mr. Mo?

173
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:24,782
<i>A microphone of truth.</i>

174
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:28,286
If he lies,

175
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,246
his heart will explode.

176
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:36,210
Do you really have nothing else to say?

177
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:43,676
Are you fine
ending the broadcast like this?

178
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:09,952
If you won't tell us any truth...

179
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,206
Everyone, I am being threatened.

180
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,838
<i>If Seung-Jae tells about the explosive,</i>

181
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:23,800
you people will be the ones in trouble.

182
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:29,180
If the bomb goes off on live television,
he will become a martyr,

183
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,891
and you all will be terrorists.

184
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:37,647
My dear citizens, you must know the truth.

185
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,774
The person behind all of this...

186
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:53,704
is the NIS director.

187
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,664
It's Seung-Jae Mo,
third generation conglomerate head.

188
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,590
A young prince in a greenhouse.

189
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:10,430
He will never take a gamble with his life.

190
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,562
The NIS director is a frightening man.

191
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,397
Do you have any proof?

192
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,901
I have a file
with all of his past evil deeds.

193
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:32,952
The NIS director

194
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,288
<i>masterminded everything.</i>

195
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,210
My goodness.

196
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:45,047
How far will this go?

197
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,633
K.

198
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,980
You said there's an explosive
on him, right?

199
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,182
- So?
<i>- Blow it up now.</i>

200
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,392
<i>Blow him up with those files.</i>

201
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:59,061
<i>I'll pay you as much as you want.</i>

202
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,123
<i>I'll give you anything you want.</i>

203
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:02,732
So press the button now!

204
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,193
Why did you have to

205
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:09,906
hurt Dong-Hyun?

206
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,330
He adhered too strictly to the rules.
That was the only way to stop him.

207
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,536
<i>It was for the nation!</i>

208
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,873
If those files get out,
the nation will be in turmoil!

209
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,960
This has files on people
called the first generation.

210
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:25,296
Ghost agents.

211
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,126
Give this to the prosecutor.

212
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:33,179
Then all the truth will be revealed.

213
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:36,306
<i>No.</i>

214
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,976
<i>You must stop the files
from being disclosed!</i>

215
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,563
I'm sorry about Dong-Hyun.

216
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,314
<i>I apologize.</i>

217
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:48,295
So blow him up right now!

218
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:49,820
<i>Press the button!</i>

219
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:00,664
Sure.

220
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:30,611
I don't need your apology.

221
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:33,114
Accept your punishment.

222
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:36,283
By the law.

223
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,451
By the rules.

224
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:51,299
Your confession was recorded.

225
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,503
You are under arrest
upon the President's special orders.

226
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,190
My mission to catch the traitor within NIS

227
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,943
has been completed.

228
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:18,200
The NIS director was behind
everything that happened?

229
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:19,784
That's correct.

230
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,122
I'm a victim who was threatened.

231
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:28,418
Everyone.

232
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:32,923
Please watch the evening news
for details regarding this.

233
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:37,584
<i>Get ready for the ending title.</i>

234
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:41,807
Okay. Three, two, one.

235
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:43,683
Switch.

236
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:46,102
Whatever.

237
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:49,875
I don't know what will happen,
but whatever.

238
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:51,442
It will be something normal.

239
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,112
We'll see a criminal being punished.

240
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,039
Good work, making cowardly excuses.

241
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,350
You were excused from military service.

242
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,127
Go become a decent human being in prison.

243
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,458
- Boo.
- Stop that.

244
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:33,067
How immature.

245
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,909
But Brother, is this really a bomb?

246
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:47,015
Anything can become a bomb to him.

247
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,293
As in, it's like a psychological bomb
targeting the anxiety of villains?

248
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,045
I knew it.

249
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:58,759
What about that alarm clock bomb
you used to wake me up?

250
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:04,848
Brother?

251
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,099
Villain?

252
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:08,269
Why I ought to...

253
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,415
What? Do you want to fight?

254
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm a collective eighth-degree black belt
in martial arts. I'll stomp on you.

255
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,235
I'm a tenth degree.

256
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:19,154
Let's go.

257
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:45,973
What do you plan to do?

258
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:49,059
I'm no longer a conglomerate head's wife,

259
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,188
so I'll live an average life
with Jae-young now.

260
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,147
Are you okay?

261
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:58,194
This was going to happen eventually.

262
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,460
He regained consciousness,

263
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,838
but we'll have to see
how much he recovers.

264
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,263
He seems frustrated.

265
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,141
He must be, given his temper,
having to lie here.

266
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,273
He'll get up.

267
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:41,612
His toes are moving,

268
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:43,572
which means his spinal cord is fine.

269
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:45,991
So he won't be paraplegic.

270
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,217
<i>Really?</i>

271
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:05,737
Mr. Lee woke up?

272
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:06,761
Yes.

273
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:10,599
I cried like a baby earlier.

274
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,061
It was more emotional than when we made
the World Cup semifinals.

275
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:17,147
Thank goodness.

276
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,024
Seriously, thank goodness.

277
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:22,236
They will call off
Seol-woo's manhunt now, right?

278
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:24,779
They should.

279
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:26,364
That's right.

280
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,592
They should.

281
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:30,327
They need to clear Seol-woo's name.

282
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:37,376
Why did you think he was framed?

283
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,546
Isn't it obvious?

284
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:43,132
You trust him, so naturally, I trust him.

285
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,716
Goodness.

286
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:52,266
Hi, Un-Gwang.

287
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:56,562
Right now?

288
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,993
Decide already.

289
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:15,497
It's been an hour.

290
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:17,517
Think carefully.

291
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,959
You should be the one thinking.

292
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:25,966
Just go with the $5,000,000.
You like money.

293
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:29,154
I heard the value doubles
if the three of them are together.

294
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,655
Then keep the wood carvings.

295
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,847
In a down economy like now,

296
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,766
nothing beats cash.

297
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:40,123
Brother gave them to me anyway,
so maybe I should keep both...

298
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:43,400
You said yourself
that it would be wrong to keep both.

299
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:45,276
Exactly.

300
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,111
That's right.

301
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:50,991
- I can't keep both.
- Will you please...

302
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:54,119
Fine.

303
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:55,805
I will return the wood carvings then.

304
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:56,829
No.

305
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,583
This.

306
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:02,878
Fine. I'll take the cash...

307
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,010
- Let go.
- What?

308
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:12,262
- Let go.
- Okay.

309
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:16,058
- I'm leaving.
- Hurry.

310
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,437
Goodness.

311
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:24,483
Goodness.

312
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,621
I did good, right?

313
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:41,375
I mean, considering the time
we spent together...

314
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,169
What?

315
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,547
Are you smiling?

316
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:48,882
You are smiling.

317
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:51,802
Smile.

318
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:58,808
I'm returning this.

319
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:02,247
He can consider it as an interest
and keep both of them.

320
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:05,816
Come on. He isn't that shameless.

321
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:09,485
Yes, he is.

322
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:15,951
Is the manhunt off?

323
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:21,165
May I ask you something?

324
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,920
How did you know that Seung-Jae Mo
would betray the NIS director?

325
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,992
Because I'm such a skilled agent.

326
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,427
Stop joking.

327
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,053
I'm really curious.

328
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:41,602
Scientific profiling
and natural-born instincts.

329
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,063
In other words, I've got skills.

330
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:47,356
Sure.

331
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:51,527
What?

332
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,030
Wait a second.

333
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:58,702
When you first came as a bodyguard
and I was your target,

334
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,288
did you profile me

335
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:05,375
and conclude I was an easy woman
whom you could easily seduce?

336
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:08,878
Was that it?

337
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:12,525
Do you want some noodles?

338
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:15,552
When you kissed me and asked me out,

339
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:17,887
why did you do it?

340
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:23,017
Because you were pretty.

341
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:27,688
No.

342
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,901
You must have read my feelings.

343
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:35,864
You must have laughed at me on the inside.

344
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:38,450
How humiliating.

345
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:40,661
I did read your feelings.

346
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,611
It was my feelings I didn't know

347
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,417
back then.

348
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:38,886
Am I really your CEO?

349
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,930
How am I your CEO?

350
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:43,700
If you were going to pull
something this big,

351
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:45,159
you should've given me a heads up!

352
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,537
It was of national security, so...

353
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:48,561
This!

354
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:53,942
This is awesome! Crazy awesome!

355
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:55,712
What?

356
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:58,572
Number one trending as
"a celebrity with decency."

357
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,326
The requests are pouring in from
variety shows to current events shows.

358
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:04,470
- Really?
- Un-Gwang.

359
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:06,973
You're going to be crazy busy, so...

360
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:09,124
You punk. I did a good thing.

361
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:11,835
Why were you yelling? You scared me.

362
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,814
- Un-Gwang.
- What?

363
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:17,591
Yesterday's show was amazing.

364
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,018
- Se-hoon.
- Yes?

365
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,788
I have a favor.

366
00:27:30,812 --> 00:27:33,899
Sure. Just say the word.
I will do anything you ask.

367
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:40,197
Look after Mi-eun.

368
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:43,783
Okay.

369
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:45,493
I will.

370
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,790
Knowing her, I'm sure she's putting on
a brave face but is crying inside.

371
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:02,562
It's the money I received
from Seung-Jae Mo.

372
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:05,263
Okay.

373
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,001
It should go back to the country.

374
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,643
Songsan's slush fund
that went into the foundation

375
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,020
will be seized as well.

376
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,982
Are you back with the agency?

377
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:18,193
When I think about what I've done to you,

378
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:21,238
I'm ashamed, but I need to close it out.

379
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,742
I will reseal your Ghost agent file.

380
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:30,664
You've been reinstated as well.

381
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:33,583
You can take the next month off.

382
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:36,712
Use it to rest and think things over.

383
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:53,597
I was threatened by the NIS director.
I had no choice but to do as I was told.

384
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,456
Think about it.

385
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,024
It's the NIS director.

386
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:59,901
How could a mere company CEO defy him?

387
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,698
He's the owner
of the great conglomerate, Songsan.

388
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:08,660
An average government worker like myself
can't threaten someone of his caliber.

389
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:16,585
I heard you are a dear friend
of Chief Prosecutor Oh.

390
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,771
Yes. That's correct.

391
00:29:18,795 --> 00:29:21,858
Reassignments are coming up soon,
I believe?

392
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:23,508
Attorney General Park,

393
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:26,720
who is above Chief Prosecutor Oh,
is from your high school, isn't he?

394
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:28,346
That's right.

395
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:34,603
Actually, both of them
gave me special instructions

396
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:37,647
to follow the law and the rules.

397
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:46,674
I knew ever since those two
were gallivanting around.

398
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:49,743
This is so sweet. They deserve it.

399
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:52,286
Hey, Ki-Chul.

400
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,790
Let's get our stories straight,

401
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:58,269
and make those two rot in jail forever.

402
00:29:58,293 --> 00:29:59,896
I'll only tell the truth.

403
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,131
The truth can be painted differently.

404
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:06,527
Rather than "he ordered me to do it,"
say "he pressured me to do it."

405
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,553
That changes everything.

406
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,993
Punk. You're so quick.

407
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,603
I'll testify for your case too.

408
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:19,189
You punk.

409
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:23,902
Do you really want to fight?

410
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:35,122
What deal did you make with K, anyway?

411
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,252
It's the final plan.

412
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,505
I'll catch Mr. Jang and take care of him.

413
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,719
I'll turn myself in afterward,
as promised.

414
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,824
Even after considering
the extenuating circumstances,

415
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:54,088
you'll be in there for a while.

416
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,812
I should pay the price for what I've done.

417
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:00,896
Your daughter...

418
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:04,876
will be able to continue her treatment.

419
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:13,160
My deal with K...

420
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,250
is to stay alive.

438
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,496

Did you make all this yourself?

00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:47,689
No. Song-yi is a great cook, so...

448
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,750
- Here.
- Look.

449
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:51,151
They are so pretty.

456
00:34:16,384 --> 00:34:18,178
It's my favorite poem too.

457
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:21,013
Do you know this poem?

458
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,390
Yes.

459
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:24,577
Starting today.

460
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:25,727
Hey.

461
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:28,187
Read it to me again.

462
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:31,650
I can't anymore.
Un-Gwang's schedule is packed.

463
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,547
- Why?
- He has programs left and right

464
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:38,490
ever since he became
"a celebrity with decency."

465
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,469
I'll post a comment that the agency
is exploiting its celebrity.

466
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,707
That celebrity is the agency's
largest shareholder.

467
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,043
I'll call later.

468
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:52,563
- Damn it!
- My goodness.

469
00:34:52,587 --> 00:34:53,898
I'm on vacation.

470
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:55,816
Then come back as his bodyguard,

471
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,485
so that we can have
our office romance again.

472
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:59,010
You're supposed to rest on vacation.

473
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:01,680
Then rest.

474
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,746
That punk Tae-ho must be busy.

475
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,498
He never calls.

476
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,791
Goodness.

477
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:33,145
You have me.

478
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:34,295
Aren't you leaving?

479
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:36,797
I'm not.

480
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:38,882
Give me that drink.

481
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:40,719
Come on, give it.

482
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:47,535
Just keep being a bodyguard.

483
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,310
I'm on vacation. Stop telling me to work.

484
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:52,928
What about after your vacation?

485
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:56,568
What will you do then?

486
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:00,280
I'll resign and disappear.

487
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:03,746
You said that's the appropriate death
in Korea.

488
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:08,121
Do you mean you will resign
as a bodyguard or from NIS?

489
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:10,414
What?

490
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:14,419
I'm the patient. Get off.

491
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,343
Go!

492
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:27,974
An actor as fit as I am
can just diet a little bit.

493
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,185
Why is Ms. Cha making me run?

494
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:33,539
- You have to keep your promise.
- Okay.

495
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:35,750
Once you hit 10,000 steps,

496
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:39,068
I'll give Ms. Cha a week off. I promise.

497
00:36:47,577 --> 00:36:48,870
What?

498
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:53,809
- I need to take a break.
- Okay.

499
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:57,337
Here. Eat this and recharge,
and run again.

500
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,121
You can't go back on your word.

501
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,027
One week paid vacation.

502
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:05,094
Who am I?

503
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:08,765
I'm a respected actor
and a trustworthy large shareholder.

504
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:21,444
But you won't refuse to do it.
Ms. Cha really is your weakness.

505
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:25,906
Shall we go?

506
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:28,952
Go!

507
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:30,619
Eleven!

508
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:33,182
Run like an Italian stallion!

509
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,582
Twelve!

510
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:35,792
Go!

511
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:38,920
- Stop.
- Go! Go!

512
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:41,816
Run! Run!

513
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,383
Congratulations on your promotion.

514
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,467
The sleeve is a bit long.

515
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:51,140
You have to wear my suit when you receive
the Certificate of Appointment.

516
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:54,978
How much do suits here cost?

517
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,999
Are you trying to put a price tag
on my gift?

518
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:02,485
I cannot accept a gift that's too valuable
as per the Anti-corruption Law.

519
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:06,239
- I appreciate the thought.
- I know that much.

520
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:08,992
But you can wear my suit.

521
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:15,535
I don't know these things, but I can tell
this costs more than 1,000,000 won.

522
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,558
I'm sorry, but I really can't accept it.

523
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:24,340
I assume it's okay if it's a gift
from a wife to her husband.

524
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:29,053
Stand straight.

525
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:31,067
It needs to fit right for it to look good.

526
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:53,202
I transferred all the stock, real estate,
everything in my name

527
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:55,663
to you.

528
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:58,875
I have no right

529
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:02,253
or authority in Songsan anymore.

530
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:05,589
Also,

531
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:12,339
these are our divorce papers.

532
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:15,808
Sign it if you want.

533
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:19,938
Petition for divorce

534
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,538
Okay.

535
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:40,392
It's a salad you make

536
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:43,795
how you like, with what you like,

537
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,296
and eat as much as you want.

538
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:48,132
- Thank you.
- Sure.

539
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,472
This fall is lucky.

540
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,796
Best wedding date
October 8th

541
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,904
I asked a shaman.

542
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:12,991
Stop dating now,

543
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:15,618
and make her your wife.

544
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:18,413
Don't worry about where you will live.

545
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:21,582
Un-Gwang kept begging,

546
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:25,962
so I'm going to open the second location
of this <i>budae jjigae</i> place.

547
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:27,422
I know.

548
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,757
The man usually provides the home.

549
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,008
But it's okay.

550
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,319
You can accept it

551
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,845
if it comes from me.

552
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:39,475
It's because I feel like
I'm gaining a son.

553
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:42,413
Okay.

554
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:43,813
Let's eat.

555
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:50,278
Best wedding date
October 8th

556
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:54,758
That son that the secret agent man's
daughter is dating

557
00:40:54,782 --> 00:40:56,325
is that headache junior agent, right?

558
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:57,826
Yes.

559
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,119
Why?

560
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:00,222
Do you want to stop her?

561
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:02,891
Why? He's handsome.

562
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:03,915
Right?

563
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,211
You do care a lot about looks.

564
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:09,546
I do not.

565
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,483
I wouldn't have dated you then.

566
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:13,384
There is no need to be so honest.

567
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,349
What is that?

568
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:25,980
Damn it.

569
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:29,650
Why are you all dressed in black?

570
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,360
Are you going to a funeral?

571
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:35,281
What?

572
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:39,118
Seriously.

573
00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:45,875
- Dong-Hyun Lee.
- What?

574
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:49,646
Medal of honor

575
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,590
"The above-named played a large role
in protecting the nation,

576
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:56,469
and is thus granted this medal of honor."

577
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:17,740
Attention.

578
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:19,533
Salute.

579
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:31,838
I said no hospitals or the NIS,

580
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,860
so you bring the NIS to the hospital?

581
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:54,253
Okay, for this scene,

582
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:57,113
let's focus on the patient...

583
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:03,911
Your employer gave you time off.
A paid vacation.

584
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:10,334
- Why are you working?
- I must do my work.

585
00:43:12,712 --> 00:43:14,046
Should we take a one-day trip?

586
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:17,401
I know plenty of islands
where boats stop running early.

587
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:18,509
Go ahead.

588
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:20,177
I'm really busy.

589
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:26,893
Hello, sir. I'm coming.

590
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,964
What are you doing?

591
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,720
Moisturizing my disappointed lips.

592
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:05,556
Hey.

593
00:44:06,474 --> 00:44:09,194
How are things going with you and Song-yi?
Do you want some pointers?

594
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:11,520
Worry about yourself.

595
00:44:12,188 --> 00:44:13,624
She's almost mine.

596
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:15,483
We will be dating in no time.

597
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:18,610
Goodness.

598
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:42,051
<i>LAST LOVE</i>
UN-GWANG YEO'S DRESSING ROOM.

599
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,905
Come on.

600
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:46,389
Let's just kiss.

601
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:53,646
Will you really use a stuntman
for the kiss scene at the end?

602
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,917
I may kiss, but I don't do kiss scenes.

603
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,860
I know your rules. I respect that.

604
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:03,739
But it will be super weird
to use a fill-in for this scene.

605
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,929
You think so too, right?

606
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:10,121
We're actors.

607
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,749
Let's be cool about it
and just do it for the movie.

608
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:16,189
If we're going to kiss in this scene,

609
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:18,587
it must be sincerely passionate.

610
00:45:19,255 --> 00:45:20,415
Because they love each other?

611
00:45:22,216 --> 00:45:23,426
Because there is

612
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:27,054
no other love for these two people.

613
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:31,016
What?

614
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,940
<i>LAST LOVE.</i>

615
00:47:00,856 --> 00:47:03,692
What did you want to talk about
this late at night?

616
00:47:05,778 --> 00:47:06,987
My vacation is over.

617
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:12,743
An East European terrorist organization
seems to be active again.

618
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,413
This doesn't sound
like you are retiring as a Ghost agent.

619
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:18,249
My bodyguard cover was blown

620
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:20,126
by the police manhunt,

621
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:21,417
so I must leave.

622
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:23,791
Are you going to disappear?

623
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:26,756
Yes.

624
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:31,095
An East European terrorist organization.

625
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:35,099
I need to be Dark Death for real,
to be able to help.

626
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:41,438
I can handle them on my own easily.

627
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:48,445
That isn't where Dark Death is needed.

628
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:54,243
The brave child.

629
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:03,335
Brother, you knew, didn't you?

630
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,839
I believed it was your choice.

631
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:16,098
I will end the Guard Kim tactic now.

632
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:17,932
Okay.

633
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:22,938
I knew I wouldn't be able to stop you
if this day ever came.

634
00:48:26,025 --> 00:48:27,025
But Brother,

635
00:48:29,195 --> 00:48:30,395
remember that tactics may end,

636
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,032
but life continues on.

637
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:35,491
Don't forget that.

638
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:48,213
What is it?

639
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:49,882
We just have...

640
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:52,685
the ending scene left
to shoot for <i>Last Love</i>.

641
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:56,263
Things were so hectic.
I didn't realize that much time passed.

642
00:48:58,182 --> 00:49:01,143
I'm going to do the kiss scene myself.

643
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:05,898
I'm going to stop keeping my promise

644
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:08,460
not to shoot kiss scenes.

645
00:49:08,484 --> 00:49:09,610
Sure.

646
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,060
You have to, with this script.

647
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,198
That promise isn't important.

648
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:16,659
It was important to me.

649
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:20,871
Because I kept loving you.

650
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,711
I thought we broke up eight years ago,
but I was wrong.

651
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:32,216
My love lasted for so long.

652
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:40,724
Let's break up for real now.

653
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:44,144
Let's do so without guilt,

654
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:47,523
and without clinging on.

655
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:53,569
Okay.

656
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,531
Let's do that.

657
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:06,250
How is the brave child?

658
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:08,751
Is he doing well?

659
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:14,424
Tell him...

660
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:17,684
that Dark Death is always
on Jae-young's side,

661
00:50:19,722 --> 00:50:22,641
and that he will appear
whenever Jae-young needs him.

662
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:51,503
Coffee from the coffee shop
is all about the view.

663
00:50:53,005 --> 00:50:55,591
Did you miss me that much already,
that you couldn't wait?

664
00:50:58,677 --> 00:50:59,677
What is it?

665
00:51:08,103 --> 00:51:09,188
That's not it.

666
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:16,111
Are you going far away?

667
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:21,158
When will you return?

668
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:29,832
Are you not coming back?

669
00:51:33,045 --> 00:51:34,630
Once my undercover mission begins,

670
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:36,994
I don't know whom I will become,

671
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:39,009
what I will look like,

672
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,470
or anything.

673
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,602
I don't know when I will return to being

674
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:51,684
the person you know either.

675
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:01,782
Don't wait.

676
00:52:07,162 --> 00:52:08,580
I won't wait.

677
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:12,143
I won't look for you.

678
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:13,919
I won't be curious.

679
00:52:16,171 --> 00:52:17,171
If possible,

680
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,925
I won't think about you either.

681
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,180
I will just be here,

682
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,019
so just come back someday.

683
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:06,555
K, you will have to end
your vacation and come back.

684
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:07,763
It's an emergency.

685
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,286
I need to go to Hungary
and obtain the satellite data first.

686
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,745
Did you start the mission?

687
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:16,124
Once I go undercover,
you won't be able to reach me for a while.

688
00:53:16,148 --> 00:53:17,125
<i>You can't</i>

689
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:18,668
just do whatever you want.

690
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:21,361
You need to report in and receive orders.

691
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:23,071
I just gave you my report,

692
00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:25,717
and let's say I received your orders.

693
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:26,741
You punk.

694
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:29,487
I'll see you when you return.

695
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:31,830
<i>You have to come back.</i>

696
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:33,540
That's an order.

697
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,501
That will be all.

698
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:57,105
Okay. It's time for your bath.

699
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:08,325
He left.

700
00:54:10,202 --> 00:54:11,828
Guard Kim disappeared.

701
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:18,293
His fight never ends.

702
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:21,630
Because the world is wide,

703
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:23,757
and there are many villains.

704
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:30,221
Are you okay?

705
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:34,934
I'm okay.

706
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:39,398
Because our tactic hasn't ended either.

707
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:41,023
Good.

708
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:45,654
Guard Kim may have disappeared,

709
00:54:47,072 --> 00:54:48,991
but Brother will be back.

710
00:55:09,344 --> 00:55:10,887
You hold onto it.

711
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:13,223
The lucky charm.

712
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:30,490
My weakness.

713
00:56:08,487 --> 00:56:09,380
Vip.

714
00:56:09,404 --> 00:56:10,864
It is time to wake up.

715
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:19,456
The clothes don't matter.

716
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:22,501
Dress in front of a mirror.

717
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:30,735
- You have to get up.
- No, I don't.

718
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:33,613
It's a live broadcast.
They will freak out if you're late.

719
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:36,139
You get paid to stop them
from freaking out.

720
00:56:36,723 --> 00:56:39,160
Goodness. If you have time for this,
just get up...

721
00:56:39,184 --> 00:56:43,772
I'll have to sleep more to make up
for this, so I will be even later.

722
00:56:44,856 --> 00:56:45,857
Please.

723
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:49,694
This is so stuffy.

724
00:56:55,158 --> 00:56:58,537
<i>I'm selling Un-Gwang's jacket
he wore in his debut movie.</i>

725
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,814
<i>Why aren't you here yet?</i>

726
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,399
We are supposed to go watch a movie.

727
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:12,610
Sorry, but I can't make it.
I need to go somewhere.

728
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:13,760
Where?

729
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:15,721
To carry out a mission.

730
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:18,557
It's awesome!

731
00:57:19,516 --> 00:57:22,829
It really is the jacket he wore
in <i>A Detective's Enemy</i>.

732
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,688
This is my treasure.

733
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:27,592
I never thought I would ever sell it,
but I need the money.

734
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:29,919
It's for my grandpa's medical bills.

735
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:31,528
I see.

736
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:34,948
But did Un-Gwang really wear this?

737
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,993
Do you see the scratch on the left here?

738
00:57:38,577 --> 00:57:40,996
That's from the scene
when Bin Won cut him with a knife.

739
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:43,123
You're right.

740
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:46,686
This is a secret,
but you know his manager, right?

741
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,380
That bad-tempered witch Do-ha Cha
who sticks to him like glue?

742
00:57:50,922 --> 00:57:52,049
She is my sister.

743
00:57:52,674 --> 00:57:54,384
So it's the real deal.

744
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:56,136
Really?

745
00:57:56,887 --> 00:57:59,323
You're sisters with that
bad-tempered witch Do-ha Cha.

746
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:00,241
That's right.

747
00:58:00,265 --> 00:58:02,744
Since you came to my house,
I will knock off 30,000 won.

748
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:05,187
- I will take 720,000 won in cash.
- What?

749
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:08,148
- For 720,000 won?
- Yes.

750
00:58:08,774 --> 00:58:09,667
That isn't expensive.

751
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:11,836
Hey! You call yourself his fangirl

752
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,060
and you'll sell this rare item
for a measly 720,000 won?

753
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:16,090
You stupid brat.

754
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:18,658
Also, the scratch is not
on the left sleeve,

755
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:20,327
but the right sleeve.

756
00:58:21,286 --> 00:58:22,406
Whom are you trying to fool?

757
00:58:29,294 --> 00:58:32,714
I'm Do-ha Cha of Chewing. Your big sister.

758
00:58:33,715 --> 00:58:34,715
Hey sister.

759
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:37,177
I have recorded our talk.

760
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:42,763
I have saved your picture.

761
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,560
You shouldn't do this to your family.

762
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,414
Please forgive me.

763
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:51,667
How dare you scam people using
Un-Gwang's name and his scent?

764
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:54,569
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

765
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,696
This is so embarrassing.

766
00:59:33,775 --> 00:59:35,068
CREATE YOUR OWN <i>BUDAE JJIGAE.</i>

767
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:40,240
Dad! I thought about the layout
for the salad bar, and...

768
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:41,658
It's done already.

769
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:45,996
I used the sketch that you left,
and it fit absolutely perfectly.

770
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,580
My sketch?

771
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,376
Didn't you leave me this sketch?

772
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:13,398
Can Seol-woo not make it
for the grand opening either?

773
01:00:14,441 --> 01:00:15,441
Well...

774
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:16,776
He's busy.

775
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:19,028
True.

776
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:22,407
I'm sure it isn't easy for him to come
and go from there as he pleases.

777
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:25,075
Dad.

778
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:26,661
Do you know where he is?

779
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:29,414
Of course, I do.

780
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:32,459
It's of national security.

781
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:45,013
Petition for divorce

782
01:00:49,142 --> 01:00:50,142
I miss

783
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:53,396
Jae-young.

784
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:06,993
Not yet.

785
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:09,731
You will when Jae-young is older.

786
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:24,070
Thank you for coming.

787
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:25,345
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

788
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:26,595
Please have a seat.

789
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:28,932
Thank you for having me. It's an honor.

790
01:01:29,432 --> 01:01:33,812
You came all the way from China.
Of course, I should invite you to my home.

791
01:01:34,396 --> 01:01:37,732
I've brought some brochures
about our company.

792
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:38,941
I see.

793
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:42,612
They were recently listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.

794
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:46,366
They are a global electronics company
and are just huge.

795
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:51,454
A movie with a global company investor
starting a Hollywood star.

796
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:54,541
That's awesome.

797
01:01:58,086 --> 01:02:01,548
Aren't they the wood carving triplets?

798
01:02:02,048 --> 01:02:05,528
Your artistic insight has class.

799
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,013
You could tell they are authentic
in a glance.

800
01:02:08,513 --> 01:02:09,699
Are they really authentic?

801
01:02:09,723 --> 01:02:12,267
The identities of all three
were confirmed.

802
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:17,314
They are pieces that our company's CEO
has been searching for quite ardently.

803
01:02:18,023 --> 01:02:20,108
Are you interested in selling them,
by any chance?

804
01:02:22,527 --> 01:02:26,156
You do know that the price doubles
if the three of them are together, right?

805
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:30,160
I will double the price
you are thinking of.

806
01:02:32,912 --> 01:02:35,665
How much is that?
Isn't that more than the investment?

807
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:47,611
Let's continue talking about the movie.

808
01:02:47,635 --> 01:02:48,720
Why?

809
01:02:49,346 --> 01:02:50,698
If you do not like my offer...

810
01:02:50,722 --> 01:02:51,890
I can't put a price

811
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,726
on my family's memories.

812
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:08,632
- Look. A bomb.
- Okay.

813
01:03:08,656 --> 01:03:09,592
- A bomb.
- Okay.

814
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:11,927
- Take it.
- Okay.

815
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:13,078
Okay!

816
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:15,789
That's right.

817
01:03:15,997 --> 01:03:20,335
See? Playing with teamwork like you
makes playing video games more fun.

818
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:23,380
Seol-woo takes
all the special items, right?

819
01:03:24,005 --> 01:03:25,757
That punk plays so cheaply.

820
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:27,981
He needs to relearn video game etiquette.

821
01:03:29,094 --> 01:03:31,846
You're the one who told my dad

822
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:33,302
about Seol-woo, aren't you?

823
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:34,992
What?

824
01:03:35,016 --> 01:03:38,103
He thinks Seol-woo is a guard
at the White House.

825
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:41,356
I see. Well...

826
01:03:42,857 --> 01:03:44,818
He kept asking,

827
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,946
so I had to tell him something.

828
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:54,201
Do you miss him?

829
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:57,789
I'm sure he's fine.

830
01:03:58,998 --> 01:04:02,061
That punk. We could look him up
if he had a tracker or something.

831
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:03,336
The commemorative coin?

832
01:04:04,462 --> 01:04:05,940
Seol-woo has that.

833
01:04:05,964 --> 01:04:07,090
I see.

834
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:08,590
What?

835
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:15,473
Then...

836
01:04:16,724 --> 01:04:18,017
I...

837
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:21,271
Goodness.

838
01:05:20,955 --> 01:05:24,209
Hungary, Budapest

839
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:28,588
The dot is very pretty.

840
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:35,469
Okay.

841
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:52,611
Hungary, Budapest

842
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,820
What?

843
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:55,531
What?

844
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,460
<i>I am Ghost Agent K.</i>

845
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:18,047
<i>A shadow without a name or reputation.</i>

846
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:21,258
<i>I have a good feeling</i>

847
01:06:23,552 --> 01:06:24,552
<i>about this mission.</i>
