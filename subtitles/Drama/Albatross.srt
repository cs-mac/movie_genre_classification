1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:14,206
 

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,773
 Ooh 

3
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,868
 Ooh 

4
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:54,048
 Ooh 

5
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:58,276
 

6
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:06,690
 

7
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:11,451
 

8
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,906
 If you can't
make me happy 

9
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,532
 Gonna walk away the blame 

10
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:20,573
 

11
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:23,677
 If you can't make me happy 

12
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:25,958
 Gonna walk away the shame 

13
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:29,286
 

14
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,776
 See, I got my cuts
and bruises 

15
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:32,928
 Ah-ooh 

16
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:36,285
 Gonna walk away the pain 

17
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,302
 Ah-ooh 

18
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,610
 And if you can't
make me happy 

19
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,727
 Ah-ooh 

20
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,523
 Gonna walk away again 

21
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:45,467
 

22
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:47,137
Oh, you are up.

23
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:49,180
I'm taking Posy
to an audition,

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,744
so you're manning the front desk
this morning.

25
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:53,668
Can I not? I'm revising.
Is Dad not around?

26
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,294
Your dad's writing.

27
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,643
You can revise on the desk.

28
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,459
You have to give
people keys, Beth.

29
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:01,150
Won't be any different
to up here.

30
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:02,117
Come on.

31
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,161
Take your hair down

32
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,762
and make yourself
a bit more presentable

33
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,657
 Why don't you see 

34
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,557
 What you're doing to me? 

35
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:13,597
Police! Run!

36
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:16,770
 Why won't you go? 

37
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:19,174
 Leave me walking alone 

38
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,581
Hey!

39
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,076
 Why won't you go? 

40
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:23,047
 If you can't 

41
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,341
 Make me 

42
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:27,717
 Happy 

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,426
 

44
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,478
Mmm,
did you bring coffee?

45
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:34,010
Yes, thanks.

46
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,355
I'm taking Posy
to an audition,

47
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,463
so you're gonna have to get
your own lunch as well.

48
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,509
There's some nice
turkey ham in the fridge.

49
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,476
Which?

50
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:42,589
Which what?

51
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:44,536
No, which is it,
turkey or ham?

52
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:46,653
It's turkey ham.

53
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,799
That's what it is,
turkey ham.

54
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:50,725
]Why do they call it
turkey ham

55
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:52,383
when it's only got
turkey in it?

56
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,266
It's from flying bloody pigs,
that's what,

57
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,957
like your next bestseller.

58
00:02:56,983 --> 00:03:01,336
 Why won't you see 

59
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:05,949
 What you're doing to me? 

60
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:10,300
 Why won't you go? 

61
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,710
 Leave me walking alone 

62
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,786
 Why won't you go? 

63
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,987
 

64
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,032
Was everything all right?
Did you sleep okay?

65
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:21,500
No, I didn't.

66
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,645
All those bloody Seagulls
squawking since sunrise.

67
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:25,626
They kind of come
with the sea.

68
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:28,123
Wasn't like that
in the book.

69
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:30,021
It was a peaceful retreat
in the book.

70
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:37,531
 

71
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,312
You're lucky
I'm not coming in...

72
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,654
to talk to your mother
and father.

73
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,658
Well, good luck with that
if you change your mind.

74
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,454
Um...

75
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,633
is this actually your house?

76
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:59,168
Yeah.

77
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:06,751
 

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,700
Hmm.
I'm late, aren't I?

79
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,227
You've missed breakfast,
I'm afraid.

80
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:16,196
Which room are you in?

81
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:19,227
All of them,
unfortunately.

82
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:21,244
I'm the new cleaner.

83
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,423
Right, yeah.

84
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,508
I'm Beth Fischer.

85
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:25,724
Oh, charmed.

86
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,140
Serena.

87
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,757
Nice to meet you, Serena.

88
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:32,033
Can I just take your surname
for the key log?

89
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:33,310
Yeah, um,

90
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:37,817
it's spelled M-O-L-I-N-A.

91
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:38,783
Great.

92
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:39,931
So you know
you don't need to do

93
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,913
the attic room on the top floor,
just the guestrooms.

94
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:44,322
This is Edna,
our other cleaner.

95
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:48,061
She'll show you around.

96
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:50,918
How do you say your surname,
just so I don't get it wrong?

97
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,064
Molina.

98
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,343
Molina.

99
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,626
Mm-hmm, yeah.

100
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:57,795
Serena Molina the cleaner.

101
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:01,377
Meant to be.

102
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:08,640
Right, um, so Edna's
just down there.

103
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,053
EW.

104
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:12,985
Yeah, in deep.
Oh.

105
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,798
You don't need
to clean here.

106
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,305
Are you sure?

107
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,519
Looks pretty dirty
from where I'm standing.

108
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:21,145
Filthy, actually.

109
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,069
Fuck.

110
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,033
Is that your dad then?

111
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,760
The pervert you keep locked away
in the attic?

112
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,204
So you've read the book then?

113
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,668
No.

114
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,017
It's a little
lightweight for me.

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,507
Any good?

116
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,662
Really brilliant.

117
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:48,066
What's he doing here then?

118
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:49,441
He lives here.

119
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,256
No, I mean he's German,
isn't he?

120
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,146
So What's he doing in this
culture vacuum?

121
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:56,319
Well, I imagine he's asking
himself the same question...

122
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:58,494
now that
he's got Writer's block.

123
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:02,681
My name's not Serena Molina,
by the way.

124
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,665
Did you not realize
I was joking?

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,380
Oh.

126
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,825
I thought the joke
was on you.

127
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,434
Emelia... Conan Doyle.

128
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,221
And, yes, I am related
to the Sherlock Holmes author.

129
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,590
Wow.

130
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,150
That's great.

131
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:22,840
Anyway...

132
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:25,699
I'd better go.
Got to skooch.

133
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:29,731
Bye.

134
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:44,314
 

135
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:45,561
 

136
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,016
She wants to do it,
so why can't she?

137
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:50,465
Because she will-

138
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,441
Because she will have
to come out of school

139
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,456
if the rehearsals
are during the day.

140
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:57,019
She is six years old,
Jonathan.

141
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,783
What's she going
to miss, eh?

142
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:00,060
What's she going to miss?

143
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:01,177
Oh, I don't know.

144
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,330
Just the unimportant stuff!

145
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,450
Reading! Writing!

146
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,524
A lot of bloody good
those things have done you,

147
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,317
parked up here
fiddling with your asshole,

148
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,426
and it's the rest of us-
do not turn away!

149
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:13,148
It is the rest of us
who are running around,

150
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,802
trying to make money
out of this godforsaken house

151
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,274
to make ends meet.

152
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:18,593
It's a professional engagement

153
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:20,516
she's been offered,
and she wants to do it.

154
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:21,475
Does she really want to?

155
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:22,915
Yes, look at her!

156
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,368
Or is it just you trying to
make up for your own failures?

157
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:28,413
Oh, well, I can only bow

158
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,871
to your superior knowledge
of failure.

159
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,857
You are the Grand Poobah
of it.

160
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,482
You are so fucking
childish.

161
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,246
It takes years to write
a great novel.

162
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,825
And it takes you just as long
to write a shit one.

163
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:47,840
Go away, Mum!

164
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,850
I'm revising!

165
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,828
Oh.

166
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,937
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were here.

167
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,795
I'd say the same goes
for this lot.

168
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:03,766
You caught the show then?

169
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,943
This is my
get-out-of-jail card.

170
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,981
And, uh...
is that your sex hat?

171
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,130
Look, I don't have long.

172
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:12,928
I just stopped by
to give you this.

173
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:18,080
You had a book on fairies
by your bed.

174
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,523
Oh, yeah.

175
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:21,461
Yeah,
it was my little sister's.

176
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:23,808
But that's lovely.
Thanks.

177
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,873
Anyway,
I should get going.

178
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,729
You should come
for dinner,

179
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,767
tonight, as a thank-you
for the book.

180
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:34,551
Seriously?
With your family?

181
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:35,935
Yeah.

182
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,141
That would be amazing.

183
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,218
Great, so do you need
to call your mum to check?

184
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,777
I would,
but she's a bit dead.

185
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,036
Oh.
Sorry.

186
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,698
It's okay.

187
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,606
It's not very fair
for you to take the blame.

188
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:54,099
She did kill herself.

189
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:55,517
But thanks anyway.

190
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,669
Fucking useless asshole.

191
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,274
Come on, Posy,
get in the car.

192
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,872
We need to get going
if we're gonna really

193
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,895
fuck your father off.

194
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,980
You said a bad word!

195
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,068
Nice!

196
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:09,596
Bye.

197
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:10,780
Bye.

198
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:37,113
Have you got any ID?

199
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,590
Yeah, definitely me.

200
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,802
No.
Are you 18?

201
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:48,788
Yes.

202
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:49,810
Can you prove it?

203
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:54,426
There.

204
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,125
Are these not the breasts
of an 'I 8-year-old?

205
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,918
That'll be 짙2_99,
please.

206
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,536
I can't believe we're stooping
to the hired help...

207
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,642
for friendships now, Beth.

208
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,036
What's going on?

209
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:13,243
Your daughters invited
the bloody cleaner for dinner.

210
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:14,362
Which one?

211
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,702
Well, I assume it's
the '17-year-old.

212
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:18,046
Please tell me
it's not Edna,

213
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,631
the bearded pensioner.

214
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,051
Sorry.

215
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,551
I came in through
the private entrance.

216
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,932
I didn't know which one
I should use.

217
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,014
Oh, hey.

218
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,572
Hello, Mrs. Fischer.

219
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:33,208
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

220
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,172
This is for you.

221
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,212
Oh, thank you.

222
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:37,945
Are you old enough
to drink Wine?

223
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,641
Yes...

224
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,198
in Denmark and restricted parts
of Europe.

225
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,618
Oh, have you met my dad,
Emelia?

226
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,846
No, I don't think we've
actually been introduced.

227
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:50,812
Beth, can you come
and finish up the plates?

228
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,541
Hi, I'm Jonathan Fischer.

229
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:54,946
Hmm.

230
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:57,531
I hope you've washed that hand
before I shake it, Mr. Fischer.

231
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:01,628
Emelia.
Hi.

232
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:03,737
Lovely to meet you
properly, Emelia.

233
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,222
Conan Doyle.
Emelia Conan Doyle.

234
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:11,192
Yes, I am related to
the Sherlock Holmes author.

235
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,273
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

236
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,198
Oh.

237
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,888
I've read all his work.

238
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:21,528
So I'll get you a drink.
Wine?

239
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,736
You can have a glass of wine
with dinner, can't you?

240
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:24,855
white, huh?

241
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:26,803
That's what you girls prefer,
white?

242
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:35,576
So tell me about
the cliff house.

243
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,567
I want to know everything.

244
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:38,655
Hmm.

245
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:41,560
There's not much to tell.

246
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,057
I came over here
to go to Cambridge.

247
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,814
Saw a beautiful young actress
in a touring play...

248
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,637
and whisked her
away to the cliff house,

249
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:49,849
just for the weekend.

250
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:52,573
Wrote the book
in ignorance at 22,

251
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:53,949
struck gold,

252
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,350
and now it hangs
around my neck,

253
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:59,132
taunting me
with its success.

254
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,143
Yeah, I meant the house,

255
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,193
like the actual building.

256
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:04,509
Is it Victorian?

257
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:13,019
No, Edwardian, actually.

258
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,678
I'm joking.

259
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,757
I'd love to know
about the book.

260
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,802
Are you applying
to university, Emelia?

261
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,754
I'm sure Beth told you
she's applying to Oxford.

262
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,116
Um, I'm not actually
going to uni.

263
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:27,009
Are you at the
University of Life, Emelia?

264
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,111
Yes.

265
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,576
Mum says that's what
dossers say.

266
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,264
Hmm.

267
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:37,535
Actually, um, I'm also
writing a novel.

268
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,835
Are you?
That's cool.

269
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:43,516
Yeah, but, um, got quite a lot
to live up to, though,

270
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,012
as you can imagine.

271
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,128
I mean, you can't exactly
go looking under "Conan Doyle"

272
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:49,406
and come up with some
airport read...

273
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,669
called Dirty Bitch, can you?

274
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,385
That's exactly
what I should have done.

275
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,455
Nothing to me,
all this university education.

276
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,052
What a shame
you didn't realize that...

277
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,502
before you wrote
Mental Interiors.

278
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:04,406
You might still have
a publisher.

279
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:06,780
You should take it on board,
Mr. Fischer.

280
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:10,164
"It is with bad sentiments
that one makes good novels".

281
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:13,107
That's Aldous Huxley,
Mrs. Fischer.

282
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:48,854
Who does this belong to?

283
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,071
It's not mine.
It's Emelia's.

284
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,602
Well, where is Emelia?

285
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,680
What are you doing?

286
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,219
Was having a break.

287
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,431
Don't be smart.
Get in.

288
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:04,764
Emelia!

289
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,521
Emelia!

290
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,888
Fuck you very much.

291
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,372
What?
I said, "Thank you. "

292
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:13,846
Like, I just sang it.

293
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,644
 Thank you 

294
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,385
Hi.

295
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,277
What are you doing here?

296
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,124
Certainly not waitressing,
if that's what you're thinking.

297
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,272
Hello, Pokey.

298
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,236
It's Posy!

299
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:31,195
I know.

300
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:32,693
Sit in my section.

301
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,642
I'll move someone.

302
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:40,150
How's your novel going?

303
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:42,262
Oh, well, you know.

304
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,933
Posy, would you like
a milkshake?

305
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,792
Yes.

306
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,755
I'd like to have-

307
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:52,243
Uh, ladies first.

308
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:54,006
I'll be back in a moment
to take your order.

309
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,157
Excuse me?

310
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:57,944
I am a vegetarian.

311
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:00,345
That isn't something
to boast about.

312
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,792
Mmm, thank you!

313
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:21,877
I need a spoon.

314
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:23,959
So what can I do for you?

315
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:26,386
Actually,
I was just thinking-

316
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,923
You know, if you get that
down on paper,

317
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,752
it's called writing.

318
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,893
You can have that lesson
on me.

319
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,493
Actually, I was thinking
I might be able...

320
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:35,254
to do something for you.

321
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,016
Seriously.

322
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,546
I could teach you
creative writing...

323
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,516
if you're struggling.

324
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:41,588
Just you and me
writing?

325
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,187
Yes.

326
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:45,080
Sounds fun.

327
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,089
I'll see you tomorrow.

328
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:34,833
Oh, Annie, you scared
the wits out of me.

329
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:37,145
Granny, it's Emelia.

330
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,186
Not Annie.

331
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:41,464
Mum's dead, remember?

332
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:51,164
Don't stay up too late now,
will you?

333
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,533
There's school tomorrow.

334
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:57,179
Granny, it's only 4:00,
and it's Sunday tomorrow.

335
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:00,024
And I'm working as well,

336
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,273
to tide me over for a bit.

337
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,960
Yes, yes.

338
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,420
Of course.

339
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,045
Basically, yeah,
I go like,

340
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:24,662
"So who's your sexual fantasy?"
Yeah?

341
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,830
And instead of saying like,
you know, Pamela Anderson

342
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:30,932
or something,
he goes, "A mermaid. "

343
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,076
I was like, "A mermaid?

344
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,568
That is half fish you want
to shag, you sick fuck. "

345
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,262
He goes, "Yeah

346
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:40,691
Pretty much is
with most girls, innit?"

347
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:46,908
I think my granny's dying.

348
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,236
All right.

349
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:50,706
When my granny died, yeah,

350
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,993
my brother,
little Tommy, yeah,

351
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,710
starts singing,
"Burn, baby, burn,"

352
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,635
as she's going
in the oven.

353
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:59,927
Fucking priceless,
calling my nan "baby"

354
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,798
Babe?

355
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:09,808
Babe?

356
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,080
Well, I... I haven't actually
acted professionally...

357
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,354
for a few years now,
no.

358
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:27,185
Um, I was in a really
popular coffee commercial.

359
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:30,457
Um, I used to be
Joa Saunders.

360
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,148
I'm the one who married...

361
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:35,003
the novelist
Jonathan A. Fischer.

362
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,515
So, um, I was just calling
because I'm looking...

363
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:40,280
for new representation.

364
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,007
Right.

365
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,735
Yeah.

366
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,430
Yes, all right, I will.

367
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,953
I'll, um-I'll call back
when I'm in something.

368
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,903
Thanks.

369
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:59,123
Morning, Mrs. Fischer.

370
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:01,070
How's it hanging?

371
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:03,248
You're late.

372
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,327
And I want to have a word
with you.

373
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:08,333
What are you doing with things
that are left in the rooms?

374
00:21:08,363 --> 00:21:10,580
Oh, well, uh...

375
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,027
The bed, I'm making.

376
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:13,433
The carpet, I've...

377
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:14,996
I've been walking on that.

378
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,466
And the curtains,

379
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:18,169
recently I've taken
to swinging on them.

380
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,546
Is that okay?

381
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:24,182
I mean the things that people
leave behind accidentally.

382
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:25,876
Are you stealing them?

383
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,608
No.

384
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:30,131
I haven't found anything
that's been left behind.

385
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,414
What's been left behind?

386
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:36,885
Well, the man who vacated
room three on Tuesday...

387
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:39,158
couldn't find his teeth.

388
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,548
Are you actually accusing me
of stealing

389
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:44,308
a set of old man's
false teeth?

390
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,061
What did you think I was going
to do with them?

391
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,560
These not look like mine?

392
00:21:48,592 --> 00:21:50,705
I know that you live
with your grandparents.

393
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:52,784
Yes, and they both
have their own teeth.

394
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,232
If things get left behind,

395
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:56,532
they come down
to the lost property box.

396
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:59,253
I know.

397
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,176
I read the memo.

398
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,222
It was... fascinating

399
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,267
You should have been the writer
in the family.

400
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:08,634
Emelia,

401
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:12,442
you are this close
to getting fired.

402
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:27,919
Come in.

403
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:31,854
Hi.

404
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:34,999
Give me one minute.

405
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:36,461
Let me just finish
what I am doing here.

406
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:38,261
Sit down.

407
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:50,356
Sorry about that.

408
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,945
A moment of inspiration
can be lost in far less time

409
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,417
if you don't indulge it.

410
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:57,941
But I... caught it.

411
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,244
So hello.

412
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,316
Did you just fake that?

413
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:04,435
No.

414
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:11,638
Yes.

415
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:15,694
So Where's your Work?

416
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:18,072
I didn't bring
anything with me.

417
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,731
I understand if
you're not ready to show me...

418
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:22,703
what you have
written so far.

419
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:25,647
Wherever you've been,
I went there first.

420
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,975
I'm not sure
I'd own up to that.

421
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:36,268
So can you at least tell me
what your novel's about?

422
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:41,902
Do you have anything
to drink?

423
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,501
No.

424
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:44,689
Can't you just
go downstairs?

425
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,422
I mean, there must be something
downstairs.

426
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,711
So you haven't told your family
about our lessons then.

427
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:56,405
No, I haven't.

428
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,344
Hmm.

429
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:02,549
I do have a story actually.

430
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,455
It's about a naughty pixie.

431
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:09,140
Emelia, come on,
this isn't school.

432
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:11,249
Good, because I got expelled
from school.

433
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:16,342
I really wouldn't let your
daughter anywhere near me.

434
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:18,771
She's 17.

435
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,776
That's old enough to know
your own mind.

436
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:24,748
Is this a lesson on subtext,
Mr. Fischer?

437
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:31,627
Okay, let's start with text
and subtext then.

438
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:33,196
I suppose that's something.

439
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,611
And please don't call me
Mr. Fischer.

440
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:36,054
It makes me feel old.

441
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,325
I don't want to eat it!

442
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:10,296
I don't like it!

443
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,308
You haven't even tried it.

444
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,260
Come on, you have
to eat some.

445
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:15,569
No, she doesn't.

446
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,711
You don't have to eat it,
Posy darling.

447
00:25:17,738 --> 00:25:19,538
Beth, don't force-feed her.

448
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:21,264
You would have made me
eat it.

449
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,757
Well, We've learned
from our mistakes.

450
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:31,374
How's the book going?

451
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,868
Hello?

452
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:56,018
Emelia!

453
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:04,660
Can I go out
for the evening?

454
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,468
Well, it's a school night.

455
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:08,621
Yeah,
but I'm on study leave.

456
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,767
Technically,
it's a school night.

457
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:13,107
You can go out.

458
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:16,469
Be back by 10:00.

459
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,638
Great.

460
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,630
Show some fucking backbone,
you total tool.

461
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:26,293
Don't start, Joa!

462
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,434
You'd slept with half
of Basingstoke by her age.

463
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,611
Lucky fucking Basingstoke!

464
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:34,831
Wow, look at that.

465
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,721
Wow.
That's amazing.

466
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:38,678
Boy, I wish I had a camera.

467
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,825
Take a picture
on your phone.

468
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:41,491
I wish I had a phone.

469
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,805
Anyway, we should grab
what we can...

470
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:45,522
before they realize
it's wrecked here.

471
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:46,542
Oh.

472
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,459
Huge men's T-shirts.

473
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,220
Not as good as these.

474
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:56,180
Women's shoes.

475
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:57,841
Oh, those are revolting!

476
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:00,370
Look at the size of them!

477
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:03,057
Why is everything
so massive?

478
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:04,077
Here, you should have this.

479
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:05,229
We can't actually
take them.

480
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,349
They might belong to someone.

481
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,244
No, you can claim it,
provided notice is given...

482
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:10,961
so the rightful owner
has a chance to come forward.

483
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:13,719
 

484
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:17,911
We are taking all your
stuff, okay?

485
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:21,719
We're having the big T-shirts
and the shoes, all right?

486
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,867
Is that all right with you?

487
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:32,565
 

488
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:39,281
Ha-ha!

489
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:41,074
Aah!

490
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:43,283
 

491
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:53,043
What's that?

492
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,005
It's a joint.

493
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:55,347
Do you want some?

494
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,616
No, thanks.

495
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,408
Where on Earth do you get
hard drugs from?

496
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,247
Are you for real,
Pollyanna?

497
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:08,343
Can I try it?

498
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,899
Yeah.

499
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:12,279
It's just a rollie, though.

500
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,353
I just wanted
to see your face.

501
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,545
How come you're not doing
your A-levels?

502
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,267
Surely you want to get out
of here like everyone else.

503
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:38,962
My dad thinks
you're really clever.

504
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:41,781
I was doing A-levels.

505
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,944
I was at The Holy Family,
but I got kicked out.

506
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:48,520
I'm quite pleased actually.

507
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:51,434
'Cause my mum always said
that being a Conan Doyle

508
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,965
made you special,
and now I get to skip

509
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,471
all that
religious indoctrination

510
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:57,402
and do something proper.

511
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:01,715
Did your dad
really say that?

512
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:04,471
What else did he say?

513
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,294
Nothing.

514
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:13,229
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but what happened to your mum?

515
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:17,617
She jumped off the flyover
at Shoreham...

516
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:20,369
'cause my dad
didn't love her.

517
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:22,262
That didn't kill her, though.

518
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,666
She squeaked around
in a wheelchair...

519
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:25,197
for a couple years
after that.

520
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:27,759
And then when he didn't
come back and save her,

521
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:30,644
she overdosed
on sleeping pills.

522
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:31,790
Why didn't he come back?

523
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:33,456
Where is he?

524
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:36,788
Dead... disabled, divorced.

525
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,152
Fuck knows.

526
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:41,577
God, Emelia, that's awful.

527
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:45,841
So is this what your book's
gonna be about?

528
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:50,709
No.

529
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:54,934
It's about bestiality.

530
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,566
Emelia?

531
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:06,638
Do you want to come up
to Oxford with me?

532
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,758
For my interview?

533
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:09,458
We could go
for a couple of days.

534
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:12,341
Stay over.

535
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:13,650
I'll pay.

536
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,843
What, and hang out
with a load of geeks?

537
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:19,088
Fuck that.

538
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:20,207
I'd rather chew off
my own arm...

539
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,316
and club myself to death
with it.

540
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:04,724
Uh, sorry.

541
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:05,837
I was looking for Beth.

542
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,470
Yeah, I can see that.

543
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:10,378
Looking... long and... hard.

544
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:16,243
What, is that quits now?

545
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,908
Oh, that's right.

546
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:23,979
Go back to your
procrast-urbating

547
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:35,445
I'm done with my answers.

548
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:36,406
Are you?

549
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,412
No.

550
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,805
Stop cheating.

551
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,872
How can you write
like that?

552
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,340
Well...

553
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,525
I found these miraculous...

554
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:50,572
clawlike appendages
at the end of my arms,

555
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:53,037
and they were ideal
for clutching blunt instruments...

556
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,312
such as this, a pencil.

557
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,883
I meant, wouldn't it just be
easier to use your laptop?

558
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:03,377
I'd be lost without mine.

559
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:08,082
I don't have a laptop.

560
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:10,350
I come from
a no-parent family.

561
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:12,875
We spend most of our money
on gravestones

562
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,065
Ah.

563
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:19,111
I'm sorry.

564
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,809
Maybe you could use
Posy's computer.

565
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:24,372
Maybe I could.

566
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,108
I forgive you.

567
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:36,244
Your shoes are massive.

568
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:08,557
There you are.

569
00:33:08,582 --> 00:33:10,089
Yep, here I am.

570
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,774
What are you doing here?

571
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:14,316
I thought you'd finished
for the day.

572
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:17,108
Um, I was wondering
about Oxford.

573
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:19,181
Um, and I wondered
if the offer still stands...

574
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,467
for me to come
with you.

575
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:22,640
I thought you said
you didn't want to come.

576
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,140
Of course I want to come.

577
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,426
You don't have to.

578
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:26,866
I don't mind.
I'm not bothered.

579
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:28,843
I want to come.

580
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:31,406
Well, the offer's
still there.

581
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:32,392
I'd love you to come.

582
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,301
Wicked.
Cup of tea?

583
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:39,242
Yeah, great.

584
00:33:58,117 --> 00:33:59,591
What's that?

585
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,161
It's a doggie bag, Granny.

586
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:04,845
Is it Bonnie's food?

587
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,466
No, Granny, um...

588
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,086
doggie bag,
as in leftovers.

589
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,076
Bonnie's dead, remember?

590
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:16,848
Bonnie's dead?

591
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:20,974
- Bonnie's dead!
- Yes, yes.

592
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:22,985
Well, well, when?

593
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:26,738
Why didn't somebody tell me?

594
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:29,194
Oh, Annie...

595
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:31,405
Why didn't you tell me?

596
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:35,119
Why didn't somebody tell me?

597
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:50,379
What are you doing?

598
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:51,759
Nothing.

599
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:53,103
The usual, boring.

600
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:59,150
I was wondering...

601
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:01,676
if you would like to go
out to dinner.

602
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:03,861
I can't, darling.

603
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:05,005
I've got tons to do.

604
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:06,157
Oh, come on.

605
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:07,179
It's Friday night.

606
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,912
I'm onto something here.

607
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:10,954
Really, I...
I can't just stop now.

608
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:13,870
Fine.
Starve then.

609
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:28,136
You're not going
to need that today.

610
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,423
Um...

611
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:31,280
You're going on
afield trip.

612
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,058
Hmm, what about the Shrew?

613
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:38,985
She's in London with Posy
for an audition, so... let's go.

614
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:50,864
 

615
00:35:50,864 --> 00:35:52,206
 

616
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:54,218
 Are you following me 

617
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,495
 Or am I following you? 

618
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,256
 Tell me, how do you do 

619
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,218
 What you do 

620
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,432
Come with me.

621
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:01,809
 'Cause the truth is 

622
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:05,137
 I never thought two 

623
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,245
So where are we going?

624
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:09,138
You'll see.

625
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,011
 Could ever come 

626
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:14,189
 Close as we do 

627
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:21,703
 

628
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:10,895
You are very quiet.

629
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:14,222
Have I bored you to death?

630
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:17,673
No... the opposite.

631
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,915
It's just...

632
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,822
My dad was never around
to talk to about him...

633
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,679
Arthur.

634
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,026
All I have are a collection
of his books my mum gave me.

635
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:31,760
That's your experience,
Emelia.

636
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:34,511
That's you.

637
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:39,697
And it's your experiences
that shape you as a writer.

638
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,224
When I wrote The Cliff House,
it was me.

639
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:47,306
It ripped everything I had
from my soul.

640
00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:48,624
It devoured me.

641
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,910
And it's left me
with nothing.

642
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,271
But, fuck, it was good.

643
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,915
Even if you do
say so yourself.

644
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:09,644
 If I could bottle you up
in an essence or two 

645
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:13,706
 I would sip you forever
and never need you 

646
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:17,900
 'Cause I howl at the moon
and the sun and the sea 

647
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:21,765
 But I wish I could tell
what this spell is on me 

648
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:26,033
 And I don't know how you do
what you do 

649
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:30,379
 But Shakespeare has nothing
on words like you do 

650
00:38:30,406 --> 00:38:33,354
 Don't know how you do
what you do 

651
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:36,742
 Please do it to me 

652
00:38:38,534 --> 00:38:39,659
Thank you.

653
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,149
That was one of the best days
of my life.

654
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,139
There was no one at the desk
when we got in,

655
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:21,969
so we helped ourselves
to our key...

656
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:23,790
only to find that the room
wasn't cleaned.

657
00:39:23,815 --> 00:39:25,388
It's not on.

658
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,507
No, it's not,

659
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:29,260
but I left my husband
manning the fort today,

660
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,757
and you know
what men are like.

661
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:31,730
No.

662
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:34,957
In the book,
the rooms are clean.

663
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:35,940
Look.

664
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:39,726
Here and, uh, here

665
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:42,413
and here.

666
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,172
"The room sparkles. "

667
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:46,312
It says it.

668
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,357
Where have you been?

669
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,150
Meeting a new editor.

670
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:55,274
I'm Jonathan Fischer,
the author.

671
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:56,717
Hi...

672
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,710
Actually, the room
was sparkling...

673
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:02,157
with energy and atmosphere.

674
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:05,222
Yeah, right, yeah,
of course.

675
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,022
The room is through here,

676
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:08,846
if you would like to take
your Wife for a tour.

677
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,151
Yeah.
Lovely.

678
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:12,264
Let's go.

679
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:14,213
Come on, Margaret.
Bring the cagoules

680
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:17,900
Jonathan,

681
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,845
how could you not have noticed
that that bloody girl...

682
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,814
didn't turn up?

683
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:24,392
Oh...
didn't she turn up?

684
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:29,033
You said, "bloody"

685
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:30,381
Bethany!

686
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:39,239
 

687
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,411
 Oh, yeah 

688
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:44,834
턔oh

689
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,268
 Mr. Big Stuff I

690
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:49,165
 Who do you think you are? 

691
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:52,012
 Mr. Big Stuff I

692
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,946
 You're never gonna get
my love 

693
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:58,791
 Now because you wear
all those fancy clothes 

694
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,206
 Oh, yeah 

695
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:04,073
 And have a big, fine car,
oh, yes, you do, now 

696
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:08,457
 Do you think I can afford
to give you my love? 

697
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:09,479
 Oh, yeah 

698
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:13,645
 You think you're higher
than every star above? 

699
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,925
 Mr. Big Stuff I

700
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,287
Dad?

701
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:42,820
Have you seen Emelia?

702
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,291
No, isn't she here?

703
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,564
And why ask me?

704
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:47,849
I only asked
if you'd seen her.

705
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,581
She just didn't show up
for work this morning.

706
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,178
That's all.

707
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,852
Hmm...

708
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,432
Oh, thank God.

709
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,931
I thought I was going
to be arrested.

710
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,666
Why?
What have you done?

711
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:18,088
Oh.

712
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:20,647
Well, I am 17.

713
00:42:20,675 --> 00:42:23,172
Unless there's some strange
local bylaw I don't know about,

714
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:25,156
and kissing's
been deemed illegal.

715
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,557
Well, anyway, got other things
to Worry about today,

716
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:35,044
starting with a showdown with
the Shrew 'cause of you.

717
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:36,490
Why, what-what's going on?

718
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,452
What's she said?

719
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,817
All right,
keep your Wig on.

720
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,134
It's about yesterday.

721
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,960
Somebody was supposed
to cover for me.

722
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:47,305
You're not very good at this,
are you?

723
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:53,928
Are you coming
to Posy's party?

724
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:58,217
It's a P party, but...

725
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,077
Um...

726
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,046
So she can come
as a princess.

727
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:06,316
You can come as... a pervert.

728
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,524
Or a... pedophile.

729
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,902
Finish your food, Posy.

730
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:41,482
Emelia said
to give peas a chance.

731
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:44,005
I love Emelia.

732
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:47,565
She's great,
isn't she, Dad?

733
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:50,572
Yes.

734
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,712
Yes, she's great.

735
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:04,204
So can she come
to Posy's party on Saturday?

736
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:07,402
- No.
- Of course she can come.

737
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,740
What on Earth are you
talking about?

738
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:11,111
It's bad enough
that Beth's decided...

739
00:44:11,134 --> 00:44:12,773
she's going up to Oxford
with her.

740
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,719
It's not like she's
one of our kids.

741
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,032
Of course she can come
to Posy's party.

742
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:19,783
I'm finished.

743
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:22,120
Fine, get down.

744
00:44:25,286 --> 00:44:26,757
Can I watch
Sex and the City?

745
00:44:34,661 --> 00:44:36,582
Thanks, Dad.

746
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:44,429
 

747
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:45,410
 Aw, unh! 

748
00:44:46,595 --> 00:44:47,530
 Hoo! 

749
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,679
 

750
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:50,757
Where do you want me
to put this?

751
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:52,042
Oh, just there,
anywhere.

752
00:44:52,068 --> 00:44:53,319
It's fine.

753
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:55,015
 

754
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,548
 Unh! 

755
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,292
 

756
00:45:06,593 --> 00:45:07,844
Hey!

757
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,557
Hello, Peter.

758
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,465
Why are you wearing
that massive coat?

759
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:17,000
To stash this.

760
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:21,131
And I'd have felt self-conscious
on the bus wearing this.

761
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:25,735
Oh, my God,
you look amazing.

762
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:33,254
 

763
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:36,877
 Aww, unh! 

764
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:38,253
Bethany.

765
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:39,844
Better go and help my mum

766
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:41,292
before she has
a nervous breakdown.

767
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:43,181
Wait here.

768
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:48,652
턔oh!

769
00:45:48,674 --> 00:45:53,924
 

770
00:45:56,992 --> 00:46:04,479
 

771
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:10,829
Hiya.

772
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,789
Hi.

773
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,679
 

774
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,946
Ooh!

775
00:46:16,994 --> 00:46:19,375
You look unbelievable.

776
00:46:19,397 --> 00:46:21,479
Um, is that appropriate
behavior for a man of the cloth?

777
00:46:21,506 --> 00:46:23,013
I can't help it.

778
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:24,647
Oh, well, it's not
the sexiest of outfits.

779
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:26,309
Was Piglet taken?

780
00:46:26,336 --> 00:46:27,329
 Aw, unh! 

781
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:28,322
 Hoo! 

782
00:46:28,354 --> 00:46:32,291
 Uno, dos, tres 

783
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,162
 Quatro, cinco, seis 

784
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:39,105
 Siete, ocho 

785
00:46:39,136 --> 00:46:41,797
 Aw, unh! 

786
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,360
I'll go out first.

787
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:57,767
Don't come until I'm out
and away, okay?

788
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:00,361
I won't come at all
after that performance.

789
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:08,620
Joa.

790
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:10,597
What were you doing
in there?

791
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,353
I spilled fromage frais
on my ecclesiastical smock.

792
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:17,826
Where's Beth?

793
00:47:17,856 --> 00:47:19,527
Definitely not
in the cleaning cupboard.

794
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:20,994
That's for sure.

795
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:22,890
Fuck.

796
00:47:22,912 --> 00:47:24,681
You stop right there,
young lady.

797
00:47:24,705 --> 00:47:25,993
What's going on?

798
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,651
I have just found,

799
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,994
in your underage daughter's
bedroom,

800
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,546
this...
at a children's party.

801
00:47:32,574 --> 00:47:36,418
You are weeks away
from your exams,

802
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:38,631
and you've started
drinking alcohol?

803
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,771
You still have to work.

804
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:43,045
Keep it together, Beth.

805
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,773
Oh, who bloody cares?

806
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:46,369
You want to be a dropout too,
do you?

807
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:49,280
Like that ghastly girl that
you've been hanging around with?

808
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:52,164
Emelia is amazing.

809
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:53,220
You're just too...

810
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:54,636
bloody stupid to see it.

811
00:47:56,964 --> 00:48:00,290
While you are living
under our roof...

812
00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:02,123
and you are only 17,

813
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:05,986
Bethany, you will live
by our rules.

814
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,271
Tell her, Jonathan.

815
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:09,545
I mean, it's hardly
a terrible crime, Joe.

816
00:48:10,976 --> 00:48:12,450
It's Beth
we are talking about...

817
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,029
Her idea of rebellion is staying
up late for News at 10:00.

818
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,627
Shouldn't we just be grateful
that she's showing some spark...

819
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,862
for the first time
in her life?

820
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:29,027
In fact, I applaud that
she's being more like Emelia.

821
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:32,098
At least she's getting
some spirit about her.

822
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:34,755
Gobsmacking

823
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,167
Utterly gobsmacking

824
00:48:37,757 --> 00:48:40,452
Parent of the year award.

825
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,362
On, thank God.

826
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,857
I actually thought I was gonna
have to go with my mum.

827
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:04,104
Well, don't worry.

828
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:06,594
I'm ready.

829
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:10,270
Come on.

830
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,764
What do you think
he meant by "staircase"?

831
00:49:33,794 --> 00:49:34,984
Seriously?

832
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:36,427
Can't recognize stairs?

833
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:38,316
Don't think
you'll get in here.

834
00:49:38,337 --> 00:49:40,171
Don't say that.

835
00:49:40,195 --> 00:49:42,025
Ah, hello.
Staircase 12.

836
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:43,849
Ah.

837
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,491
Oh, my God.

838
00:50:07,517 --> 00:50:10,377
I have never seen so many
ugly men in all my life.

839
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:11,589
I mean, look at them.

840
00:50:11,616 --> 00:50:13,448
Looks like they wear
their brains on the outside.

841
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:14,976
Obviously, I chose
The Queen's College...

842
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:17,026
because of a lifelong
fascination

843
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,814
with the Jacobean playwright
Thomas Middleton.

844
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,877
I assume you know why all of
the colleges are built in quads?

845
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,806
Is it so that geeks
only have to look at each other...

846
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:28,104
when they open the curtains
in the morning?

847
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,714
And what are you hoping
to read?

848
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:37,260
Wasn't it to keep
the gownies safe from attack...

849
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:39,014
from the townies?

850
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,961
Good girl.

851
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:43,237
I do like a lady
who does her homework.

852
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:44,800
Bet he fucking does.

853
00:50:47,263 --> 00:50:48,734
And so when he asked me
how I knew,

854
00:50:48,765 --> 00:50:53,285
I said, "Well, sir,
as Sherlock Holmes always said,

855
00:50:53,313 --> 00:50:54,466
Elementary, my dear Watson".

856
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:59,074
It was quite funny, 'cause his
name was also Watson, you see.

857
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,635
Holmes never said that.

858
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:04,574
I'll think you'll find
that he did in his books,

859
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:06,983
but I Wouldn't expect you
to have managed to squeeze in

860
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:08,446
much Conan Doyle
during your romp

861
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:11,488
around the chick-lit bucket
at Asda.

862
00:51:11,517 --> 00:51:13,734
And I think if you'd
actually read Conan Doyle,

863
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:15,656
you'd find out
that you're wrong.

864
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:18,061
In 1892, he used the words,

865
00:51:18,082 --> 00:51:20,678
"it was very superficial,
my dear Watson,"

866
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:24,231
and in the following year,
he said simply, "Elementary".

867
00:51:24,258 --> 00:51:26,657
He never, ever
said them together,

868
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:27,779
you fuck-trumpet.

869
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:36,448
Emelia, I am trying
to get a place here.

870
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:38,792
- Yeah, but he was
a pompous twat.

871
00:51:40,477 --> 00:51:42,049
All right, sorry.

872
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,416
Come on, We'll go out
for a drink.

873
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:55,267
Ugh, shared showers
are rancid.

874
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:58,337
I swear there was a pubic hair
doll in the plughole.

875
00:52:00,858 --> 00:52:05,148
Ah, look at you,
hot patootie.

876
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:07,047
I look ridiculous.

877
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:08,840
No, you don't.

878
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:16,457
I just don't want to
be embarrassing.

879
00:52:16,478 --> 00:52:18,629
You're not embarrassing.

880
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:20,075
I'm not your mum.

881
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:23,105
Doesn't bother me
what you wear.

882
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:25,798
Wear what you want.
You look amazing.

883
00:52:32,927 --> 00:52:34,596
- To Oxford.
- Oxford.

884
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:41,155
Shall we have another?

885
00:52:42,685 --> 00:52:44,290
Interview's not until Friday.

886
00:52:44,316 --> 00:52:46,086
Yes.

887
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:55,835
Tell you what.

888
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:57,470
Let's get them
to get us another.

889
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:01,066
All right.
Come on then.

890
00:53:03,295 --> 00:53:05,413
My sister and I were wondering
if you'd like to buy us...

891
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,313
a couple of pints... of wine.

892
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:11,428
We're sisters.

893
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,603
Yeah, she said.

894
00:53:13,629 --> 00:53:14,917
Go on then.

895
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,875
 Yeah 

896
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:23,010
 Pick up that sound 

897
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,456
 Yeah 

898
00:53:24,478 --> 00:53:27,490
 Pick up that sound 

899
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:28,769
 Yeah 

900
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:31,329
 Pick up that sound 

901
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:32,415
 Pick up that sound 

902
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:33,436
 They did it again 

903
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:34,406
 They did it again 

904
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:36,448
 They did it again 

905
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:37,503
 Yeah 

906
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:41,405
 Pick up that sound 

907
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:42,374
 Pick up that sound 

908
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:43,390
 They did it again 

909
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:44,356
 They did it again 

910
00:53:44,379 --> 00:53:45,338
 They did it again 

911
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:08,639
Emelia.

912
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:10,885
Mmm?

913
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,605
Mmm...

914
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,615
How did this happen?

915
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,832
Just stick your fingers
down your throat.

916
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,425
Honestly, you'll be fine.
I do it all the time.

917
00:54:32,411 --> 00:54:34,245
Oi!
Can't you read?

918
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:36,316
Get off of that grass!

919
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:08,803
What are you doing?

920
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:09,886
I'm going to do it
for you.

921
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,239
What?

922
00:55:11,262 --> 00:55:12,832
The interview.

923
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:15,239
It's been moved to today,
but it's fine.

924
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:17,792
I'm going to do
the interview for you, as you.

925
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,490
Today?

926
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:20,958
How do I look?

927
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,203
It's today?
When today?

928
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,402
Well, there was a notice
stuck to the door.

929
00:55:26,427 --> 00:55:27,363
It said 2:00, but...

930
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:29,284
it'll be fine.

931
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:30,244
I can bluff this for you.

932
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:32,183
Don't be ridiculous.

933
00:55:34,975 --> 00:55:37,028
Come on,
pass me my notes.

934
00:55:37,057 --> 00:55:38,145
Come on.

935
00:55:45,278 --> 00:55:47,047
It's all right.
Don't panic.

936
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:59,005
 

937
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:06,147
 Who gives a fuck
about an Oxford comma? 

938
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:09,664
 I've seen those
English dramas too 

939
00:56:09,692 --> 00:56:12,191
 They're cruel 

940
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,076
 So if there's any other way
to spell the word 

941
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:18,276
 it's fine with me,
with me 

942
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,257
Bye.

943
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:22,789
So hoW'd it go?

944
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,993
Touch and go on all fronts.

945
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:26,593
I did offer, though.
Can you imagine?

946
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,010
I know.
It was a stupid suggestion.

947
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:29,765
You know absolutely nothing
about medicine.

948
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,744
I dunno, I've taken some
drugs in my time.

949
00:56:31,774 --> 00:56:33,216
Why am I not surprised?

950
00:56:34,332 --> 00:56:35,556
But you did it, Beth.

951
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:37,500
I mean, you just went
right ahead and did it.

952
00:56:40,636 --> 00:56:43,201
You look absolutely
ridiculous, by the way.

953
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:44,896
 Who gives a fuck
about an Oxford climber? 

954
00:56:44,922 --> 00:56:48,383
 I climbed
to Dharamsala too 

955
00:56:48,412 --> 00:56:50,812
 I did 

956
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:52,764
 I met the highest lama 

957
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:55,839
 His accent sounded fine
to me 

958
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:57,767
Where did you get
that book from?

959
00:56:57,788 --> 00:56:59,524
Oh, I borrowed it
from one of the rooms.

960
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,046
Do you know there's one
in every drawer?

961
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:04,128
You don't have
to be embarrassed.

962
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:05,888
I do know what it's like,
you know.

963
00:57:05,912 --> 00:57:09,341
I mean, my great-grandfather is
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

964
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,972
Don't know why you keep
going on about it.

965
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,434
I mean, unless you're actually
Arthur Conan Doyle,

966
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:15,104
it's just a pointless hindrance,
isn't it?

967
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:18,024
My dad's
Jonathan A. Fischer.

968
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:19,487
So what?

969
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:39,269
Hello, darling.

970
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,991
Come on, give me a hug.

971
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:50,242
Emelia, are you coming back
for dinner?

972
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,219
Um, no, thanks, Mr. Fischer.

973
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,756
I've got to get back home.

974
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:55,707
But I'll see you on Monday.

975
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,816
Okay, see you then.

976
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:01,754
Bye.

977
00:58:11,899 --> 00:58:13,952
She ate it all.

978
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:16,033
She's not doing too badly.

979
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:22,115
What are you doing, Emelia?

980
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:24,059
I'm eating my dinner,
same as you.

981
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:25,565
Surely you can't find
fault in that.

982
00:58:25,597 --> 00:58:27,069
No, I mean with your life.

983
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,966
What are you going
to do with yourself?

984
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:30,428
What do you mean?
I'm writing a book.

985
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:33,795
I'm a Conan Doyle.

986
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:36,130
It's in my blood,
for goodness' sake.

987
00:58:36,153 --> 00:58:38,073
And I'm really good at it.

988
00:58:38,105 --> 00:58:43,385
Emelia... life is not
a fairy tale.

989
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,524
What is that
supposed to mean?

990
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:48,056
Look, I'm just saying,

991
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:50,271
it's not all
that's in your blood.

992
00:58:51,735 --> 00:58:56,571
Don't... waste your life
like your mother did.

993
00:58:56,601 --> 00:59:02,727
Don't cut yourself off because
of some fantasy you have.

994
00:59:04,668 --> 00:59:06,055
It's too late to start
with me now...

995
00:59:06,077 --> 00:59:09,315
just 'cause your own
daughter killed herself.

996
00:59:19,032 --> 00:59:21,117
Where have you been?

997
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:22,085
No.

998
00:59:22,107 --> 00:59:24,603
No?

999
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:25,887
No what?

1000
00:59:25,913 --> 00:59:27,680
That's not the answer
to that question.

1001
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:29,472
No, I'm not into you
any more.

1002
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,606
All right.

1003
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:33,824
Bye then.

1004
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:35,835
Babe?

1005
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:58,789
"In my younger
and more vulnerable years,

1006
00:59:58,811 --> 01:00:01,124
"my father gave me some advice
that I've been turning over...

1007
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:02,818
in my mind ever since. "

1008
01:00:02,844 --> 01:00:04,448
it's an odd first line,

1009
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,077
given the absence
of a father character.

1010
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,558
It's good.

1011
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:12,604
It's very good.

1012
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:15,712
Don't worry.
A little overwritten.

1013
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:19,261
Sometimes you get very confused
by the use of a simile.

1014
01:00:22,522 --> 01:00:24,440
There's something there.

1015
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:30,817
You seem very distracted.

1016
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:35,714
Is it that you can't take
criticism?

1017
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:38,272
Jonathan...

1018
01:00:38,295 --> 01:00:40,925
Dad?

1019
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:43,613
Come on.

1020
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:44,768
Hurry.

1021
01:00:46,397 --> 01:00:49,122
Can you sign this, please?

1022
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:51,014
What is it?

1023
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:52,768
Parental consent
for my Leavers' Ball.

1024
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:55,262
Do I have to do this now?

1025
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,899
That's a bit
of a lifeless outfit.

1026
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:05,881
Well, it's obviously
reflecting my personality.

1027
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,669
She didn't make it.

1028
01:02:00,696 --> 01:02:01,952
She's gone.

1029
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,591
Are you going to dress up
for the school ball?

1030
01:02:38,617 --> 01:02:41,629
Wear something special?

1031
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,066
Beth?

1032
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:50,235
What's wrong?

1033
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:53,058
Nothing.

1034
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,035
I know What's Wrong.

1035
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:57,890
Beth thinks you love Emelia
more than her.

1036
01:02:57,911 --> 01:03:00,921
You wish Emelia
was your daughter.

1037
01:03:23,673 --> 01:03:26,682
What was I fucking thinking?

1038
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,198
Hey.

1039
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,900
Hey.

1040
01:03:45,048 --> 01:03:46,686
Just wondered if you fancied
a cup of tea?

1041
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:48,861
Oh, I can't.

1042
01:03:48,888 --> 01:03:50,905
Got to get back,
unfortunately.

1043
01:03:50,935 --> 01:03:52,854
My bloody mother.

1044
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:57,017
Are you all right?

1045
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:00,406
My granny died.

1046
01:04:00,439 --> 01:04:03,131
When?

1047
01:04:03,156 --> 01:04:04,542
Why didn't you call me?

1048
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:09,915
I'm so sorry.

1049
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:25,818
Excuse me, has your room
been cleaned?

1050
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:28,313
Not yet. Yours?

1051
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:33,729
I heard the lady on the desk
moaning about the cleaner

1052
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:36,313
not showing up for work.

1053
01:05:36,341 --> 01:05:38,142
What about that pretty one?

1054
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:41,662
If only we were
20 years younger, eh?

1055
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,748
Hello.

1056
01:06:02,777 --> 01:06:03,834
How are you?

1057
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:10,749
There's been a lot
to sort out, but I'm fine.

1058
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:14,238
You look bloody awful, though.
What's up?

1059
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:17,786
- I've just been sick
every morning this week.

1060
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:21,080
I think it's just a bug.

1061
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,192
But isn't that
morning sickness?

1062
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:26,264
Can't be, can it?

1063
01:06:27,476 --> 01:06:29,692
We used a condom.

1064
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:35,295
Don't worry.
I'll get you a test.

1065
01:07:00,022 --> 01:07:01,081
Emelia?

1066
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:06,369
Can you come up, please?

1067
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:37,984
Emelia, I...

1068
01:07:40,631 --> 01:07:42,138
There's something-
- Jonathan-

1069
01:07:43,222 --> 01:07:44,283
I'm sorry.
I just want...

1070
01:07:44,313 --> 01:07:46,624
I can't write.
I can't do it.

1071
01:07:51,574 --> 01:07:52,863
Of course you can.

1072
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:57,178
I quite often think of a quote
by Tolstoy.

1073
01:07:57,205 --> 01:07:59,771
"In a writer, there
must always be two people,

1074
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:02,296
the writer and the critic. "

1075
01:08:03,508 --> 01:08:04,863
When I was writing
The Cliff House-

1076
01:08:04,886 --> 01:08:07,744
For God's sake,
get over The Cliff House.

1077
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:09,337
What do you mean by that?

1078
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:11,284
You haven't lived
a bloody day since, have you?

1079
01:08:12,628 --> 01:08:15,511
I mean, what else have you
achieved in the last 20 years?

1080
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,225
I've read your other work,

1081
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,819
and it sure ain't Tolstoy.

1082
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:25,212
Unless it's the sequel,
Bore and Cease.

1083
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:40,476
What's this?

1084
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:43,322
Nothing.

1085
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:46,713
What was that?

1086
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:48,475
That better not be what
I thought it was, young lady.

1087
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,493
"What's this?
What's that?"

1088
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:50,682
What's it got to do
with you, anyway?

1089
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,444
It's got everything
to do with me.

1090
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:53,657
You think you're pregnant?

1091
01:08:53,684 --> 01:08:55,006
I'm not pregnant.
It's negative.

1092
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,667
So why don't you
just fuck off!

1093
01:08:58,035 --> 01:08:59,991
Ng]

1094
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,494
Had your head so far
up your own ass,

1095
01:09:01,526 --> 01:09:03,358
you can't have seen
daylight in years.

1096
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:05,495
Do you even know that you
questioned The Great Gatsby?

1097
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,508
You idiot.

1098
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:11,063
You told Truman Capote
he need not to be so obvious...

1099
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,151
with his metaphors.

1100
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,849
What on Earth
are you talking about?

1101
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:17,083
Half of the stuff I gave you
as samples weren't even mine.

1102
01:09:17,107 --> 01:09:19,026
I just copied them
from books by my bed.

1103
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:23,993
Why are you being so cruel
and childish?

1104
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:27,293
Because I am a child.

1105
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:29,919
I'm best friends
with your daughter,

1106
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:31,262
in case you
hadn't noticed.

1107
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,990
Emelia, you don't need
to do this.

1108
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:41,984
I can't do this
to Beth any more.

1109
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:46,680
And I hate you
for being able to.

1110
01:10:10,064 --> 01:10:11,386
it's all right.

1111
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:14,462
It's going to be all right.

1112
01:10:14,485 --> 01:10:16,439
You're okay.

1113
01:10:27,476 --> 01:10:29,594
Thank fuck.

1114
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:37,214
Come on.

1115
01:10:37,236 --> 01:10:38,873
Get your things together.
We're going out.

1116
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,798
Okay.

1117
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,237
Let's go out.

1118
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:46,328
Let me put some makeup on
my big, fat, swollen face.

1119
01:10:56,017 --> 01:10:57,622
Did you know that Beth
is now having sex?

1120
01:10:57,649 --> 01:10:59,089
Did you?

1121
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,783
Well, she is, so maybe you can
think about that next time

1122
01:11:01,809 --> 01:11:04,094
before you celebrate her
for getting sloshed.

1123
01:11:04,117 --> 01:11:05,406
I mean, look at the mess
she is in

1124
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:08,058
because of that
stupid girl.

1125
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:12,702
You're just so selfish.

1126
01:11:12,724 --> 01:11:14,297
You lock yourself away up here

1127
01:11:14,326 --> 01:11:15,964
as if you're curing cancer

1128
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:19,131
instead of churning out
a potboiler once a decade.

1129
01:11:19,156 --> 01:11:22,845
You think buying this house
is just your entire contribution

1130
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:24,341
to this family done,
don't you?

1131
01:11:24,372 --> 01:11:26,869
That's your bit done,
isn't it?

1132
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,550
I've been sleeping
with Emelia.

1133
01:11:31,604 --> 01:11:34,199
You have got to be joking.

1134
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:39,447
Shall we get going, then?

1135
01:11:39,473 --> 01:11:40,795
Fat fucking father you are.

1136
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:42,803
You've been fucking the maid?

1137
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:45,944
If you want to put it
that way, um, yes, I have.

1138
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,014
I am going to throw up.

1139
01:11:54,288 --> 01:11:55,680
Shall we head out, then?

1140
01:11:56,758 --> 01:11:59,451
Let's head out.

1141
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:04,224
So while I've been bringing up
the kids and running this house...

1142
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:06,461
and this business has been
hanging around my neck...

1143
01:12:06,486 --> 01:12:09,310
draining every last morsel
of energy I've got left,

1144
01:12:09,332 --> 01:12:10,685
you have been up here...

1145
01:12:10,707 --> 01:12:14,199
fucking our daughter's
best friend!

1146
01:12:28,688 --> 01:12:30,609
I'm leaving you.

1147
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:33,175
Although, um,
I'll be keeping the house,

1148
01:12:33,203 --> 01:12:35,068
so technically,

1149
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:37,785
you'll actually be leaving me.

1150
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:38,898
Beth...

1151
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,217
I want you gone by morning.

1152
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:45,206
You can clear all of this out.

1153
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:47,802
Want you to take it with you.

1154
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,465
I thought
you were my friend.

1155
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:53,409
I am, Beth.

1156
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:55,710
I am.

1157
01:12:55,733 --> 01:12:57,651
Not you,
you fucking idiot.

1158
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,061
Look, Mummy, I'm Emelia!

1159
01:13:37,743 --> 01:13:38,872
See, my dad's right.

1160
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,666
I can't get anything
through my thick skull.

1161
01:13:53,938 --> 01:13:56,370
Beth?
Beth?

1162
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:58,299
Beth, I need to talk to you.

1163
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,874
Beth, I'm sorry.

1164
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:03,061
I didn't mean for it
to happen,

1165
01:14:03,089 --> 01:14:04,411
any of it, I just...

1166
01:14:04,434 --> 01:14:05,460
I want us to be friends again.

1167
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,540
We can't be friends,
Emelia.

1168
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,506
You're a liar.

1169
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:10,581
No, I'm not.

1170
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:13,207
You... you know everything now.

1171
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:15,032
You must know
why I had to lie.

1172
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:18,360
I did a bad thing.

1173
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:19,672
I'm not talking
about that.

1174
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:22,416
Your name may not be
Serena Molina,

1175
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:24,980
but it certainly isn't
Conan Doyle either.

1176
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:29,333
What?

1177
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:31,580
Do you actually believe
your name is Conan Doyle?

1178
01:14:52,912 --> 01:14:55,893
Grandpa,
can I ask you a question?

1179
01:14:55,922 --> 01:14:58,352
Yeah.

1180
01:15:08,525 --> 01:15:11,409
Was my father the grandson
of Arthur Conan Doyle?

1181
01:15:12,496 --> 01:15:13,911
Well, his name was Doyle.

1182
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:15,702
Was it Conan Doyle?

1183
01:15:15,726 --> 01:15:17,845
Was he related
to the author?

1184
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,335
Your mother did a lot of things
for the right reasons...

1185
01:15:29,362 --> 01:15:33,467
and a lot of things
for the wrong reasons.

1186
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:36,054
Your father's name was Doyle.

1187
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,204
But...

1188
01:15:38,226 --> 01:15:41,302
it wasn't Conan Doyle.

1189
01:15:44,179 --> 01:15:47,254
Me and your granny felt
it would have crushed you

1190
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:50,192
to take it away from you
after your mum died.

1191
01:15:50,223 --> 01:15:55,385
It seemed... another cruelty.

1192
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:59,577
We knew how much
it meant to you.

1193
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:05,713
This just means
that the foundation...

1194
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:08,241
that my life's built on
is based on lies.

1195
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:12,240
My ambition to be a writer
is based on a lie.

1196
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,763
I need to rewrite myself.

1197
01:16:15,794 --> 01:16:19,320
But you can.

1198
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:22,074
You're a great writer anyway,

1199
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,214
without all that nonsense.

1200
01:16:27,505 --> 01:16:30,388
You can't push everybody away,
Emelia.

1201
01:16:32,466 --> 01:16:35,030
Your mother Wanted you
so much.

1202
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:41,021
She can't have wanted me
that much.

1203
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:42,841
She jumped off a bridge
onto a main road.

1204
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,048
Millie, she was ill.

1205
01:16:45,073 --> 01:16:47,536
Her mind wasn't right.

1206
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:51,191
But she'd be so proud of how
clever you've made yourself.

1207
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:52,468
Because of him, without him,

1208
01:16:52,493 --> 01:16:53,815
what does it matter?

1209
01:16:53,839 --> 01:16:55,892
It's just a name, Emelia.

1210
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:59,344
It's just an albatross
around your neck, really,

1211
01:16:59,374 --> 01:17:01,143
but you just
can't see that yet.

1212
01:17:03,595 --> 01:17:06,877
You're still special,
you know.

1213
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,275
Special bloody needs,
thanks to her.

1214
01:17:10,545 --> 01:17:14,386
- You'll stop being angry
with her one day.

1215
01:17:15,601 --> 01:17:16,793
And with yourself.

1216
01:17:17,998 --> 01:17:20,313
You're a writer.

1217
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:21,297
But if you change your mind...

1218
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:22,898
and want to go
to college instead,

1219
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:24,215
there's money,
you know.

1220
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,440
I don't need anything
but to upgrade my tea bags

1221
01:17:28,463 --> 01:17:30,035
every once in a while.

1222
01:17:32,878 --> 01:17:35,891
Well, don't go bloody mad.

1223
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,655
I want some kind of
inheritance.

1224
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,482
Daddy!

1225
01:19:59,823 --> 01:20:01,811
Hello, my darling.

1226
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,956
Are you coming home?

1227
01:20:03,983 --> 01:20:07,191
No, I'm not.

1228
01:20:07,215 --> 01:20:10,192
I'm just here to drive my
Oxford undergrad to college.

1229
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:14,544
Hi.

1230
01:20:14,573 --> 01:20:15,534
Hi.

1231
01:20:17,518 --> 01:20:19,598
Thank you for letting me
drive you.

1232
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:26,485
Hi, hello.

1233
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:28,619
Hi.

1234
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:33,716
How are you?

1235
01:20:33,743 --> 01:20:36,276
Good.

1236
01:20:36,305 --> 01:20:38,803
Hear you got a job.

1237
01:20:38,831 --> 01:20:40,916
Yes, I'm teaching
creative writing.

1238
01:20:40,945 --> 01:20:42,451
Oh. Huh.

1239
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:49,165
Let's go.

1240
01:20:49,197 --> 01:20:50,487
Come on, then.

1241
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:51,448
Grab something.

1242
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,041
Yes.

1243
01:21:15,563 --> 01:21:18,893
Hi, um... can I get this
printed on A-4 and bound?

1244
01:21:18,924 --> 01:21:20,395
Yep, no problem.

1245
01:21:20,426 --> 01:21:21,549
Just take a seat.

1246
01:21:35,276 --> 01:21:39,512
 

1247
01:21:39,534 --> 01:21:43,539
 We've all been changed 

1248
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:47,025
 From what we were 

1249
01:21:47,053 --> 01:21:50,481
 Our broken hearts 

1250
01:21:50,511 --> 01:21:54,447
 Left smashed on the floor 

1251
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:58,263
 I can't believe you 

1252
01:21:58,285 --> 01:22:01,610
 If I can't hear you 

1253
01:22:01,643 --> 01:22:05,267
 I can't believe you 

1254
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:09,906
 If I can't hear you 

1255
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,598
 

1256
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:20,786
 

1257
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,993
 We've all been changed 

1258
01:22:36,014 --> 01:22:39,471
 From what we were 

1259
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:43,156
 Our broken hearts 

1260
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:47,252
 Smashed on the floor 

1261
01:22:47,278 --> 01:22:50,930
 We've all been changed 

1262
01:22:50,955 --> 01:22:54,676
 From what we were 

1263
01:22:54,698 --> 01:22:58,188
 Our broken hearts 

1264
01:22:58,217 --> 01:23:02,388
 Smashed on the floor 

1265
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:09,016
 Someone turn me 'round 

1266
01:23:09,038 --> 01:23:16,597
 Can I start this again? 

1267
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:24,207
 Now someone turn us 'round 

1268
01:23:24,235 --> 01:23:31,758
 Can we start this again? 

1269
01:23:36,139 --> 01:23:39,346
 We've all been changed 

1270
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:43,310
 From what we were 

1271
01:23:43,341 --> 01:23:46,546
 Our broken hearts 

1272
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:50,225
 Left smashed on the floor 

1273
01:23:50,249 --> 01:23:53,775
 I can't believe you 

1274
01:23:53,804 --> 01:23:57,713
 If I can't hear you 

1275
01:23:57,743 --> 01:24:01,333
 I can't believe you 

1276
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:05,908
 If I can't hear you 

1277
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:13,878
 I never wondered
now the world kept turning 

1278
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,549
 Till the middle of my world
came crashing in 

1279
01:24:18,574 --> 01:24:22,194
 Then I got to wondering how
I never got to wondering 

1280
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:23,856
 Way back then 

1281
01:24:23,882 --> 01:24:27,789
 

1282
01:24:27,819 --> 01:24:32,141
 And you see these walls that
wrap themselves around me 

1283
01:24:32,172 --> 01:24:37,068
 They made me promise that
I'd never let you in 

1284
01:24:37,097 --> 01:24:41,516
 And at night when I say
it's just the way 

1285
01:24:41,545 --> 01:24:46,065
 it's always been 

1286
01:24:46,092 --> 01:24:50,548
 So I wish you well 

1287
01:24:50,575 --> 01:24:55,155
 Yes, I wish you well 

1288
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:59,219
 Yes, I wish you well 

1289
01:24:59,246 --> 01:25:01,201
 Oh, I wish you well 

1290
01:25:01,231 --> 01:25:04,305
 

1291
01:25:07,211 --> 01:25:14,701
 

1292
01:25:22,761 --> 01:25:26,998
 I wonder what you know
when you are happy 

1293
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:31,667
 And I wonder,
do you ever know I hurt? 

1294
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,068
 'Cause all my tears,
well, they have roots 

1295
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:38,322
 And they keep growing
in your dirt 

1296
01:25:38,344 --> 01:25:40,664
 Ah-ah 

1297
01:25:40,686 --> 01:25:44,820
 Oh, I wish you well 

1298
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:46,996
 Oh, I wish you well 

1299
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:49,749
 

1300
01:25:49,774 --> 01:25:52,175
 Well, I wish you well 

1301
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:58,543
 Yes, I wish you well 

1302
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:03,406
 Oh, I wish you well 

1303
01:26:03,437 --> 01:26:06,097
 Yes, I wish you well 

1304
01:26:06,123 --> 01:26:09,003
