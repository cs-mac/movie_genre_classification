00:00:05,218 --> 00:00:07,228
<i>Episode 15</i>

2
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:27,723
<i>How are you? I am fine!
 (In Japanese, famous line in the movie, Love Letter)</i>

3
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,097
<i>Why aren't any tears coming out?</i>

4
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:35,217
<i>No matter how much I try to squeeze
them out, there's nothing.</i>

5
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,563
<i>But then again, it has
been over five years.</i>

6
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:48,553
<i>How are you? I am—</i>

7
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,122
<i>You are 1501 Han Mi Mo, right?</i>

8
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,852
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

9
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,902
<i>Your ex-husband sent you this.</i>

10
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:00,872
<i>What!? How would you know?</i>

11
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,632
<i>It's written there, in big letters.</i>

12
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,593
<i>What?</i>

13
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:11,632
<i>From your ex-husband, to his ex-wife.</i>

14
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:17,123
<i>What? He answered me? I only just
tried calling his name out loud.</i>

15
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:26,202
<i>Finally, I found someone I want to be with.</i>

16
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:29,392
<i>I've decided that we can
"thank" each other.</i>

17
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:32,552
<i>Please come and congratulate us.</i>

18
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:34,733
<i>Kim Seung Jae.</i>

19
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:39,183
<i>How did things get so
twisted and complicated...</i>

20
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,422
You have an appointment here?

21
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:50,973
You too?

22
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,172
If possible, let's sit far from each other.

23
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:57,162
I might lose my appetite,
in this gourmet restaurant.

24
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:59,653
You think my appetite will be good?!

25
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,892
By chance, are you?

26
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:21,042
Are you, by chance?

27
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,713
You are?!

28
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:32,932
That person is...

29
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,152
What, do you know her?

30
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:40,713
Should I say I know her? I
might say I know her a bit.

31
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:13,762
How can we have this kind of fate...?

32
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,592
I know, right?

33
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:19,222
We meet again. Our fate is so...

34
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,812
What are you saying?

35
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:24,832
That is Oppa, these two
were college classmates.

36
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,902
Oh, is that right?!

37
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:29,413
Not so close classmates.

38
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,022
Not so close classmates?

39
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:36,762
<i>By looking at their expressions, they
just might not be close classmates.</i>

40
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:39,702
What happened that you called
each other unfriendly?

41
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,503
<i>Ah, that is...</i>

42
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,683
That is, he was a Goo Seul Ah's fan.

43
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:52,622
When Angels disbanded and I was having
a hard time because of Good Seul Ah,

44
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:56,432
he was one of those fans who
used to send poison in the mail.

45
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,013
What?!

46
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,713
It's all in the past. We
just laugh about it now.

47
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:12,013
Honey. Were you really her crazy fan?

48
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:18,692
I was a bit of a crazy fan, but

49
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,492
I think you're misinformed.

50
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,892
I wasn't that big of a fan who
would send poison in by mail.

51
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:28,132
Just when I ran into Han Mi Mo
at school, it was unpleasant.

52
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,312
I disliked her for bothering Goo Seul Ah.

53
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:35,592
Have you seen her in person?
She's really annoying.

54
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:39,663
It's because she bothered an angel like
our Mi Mo, and that's why they disbanded.

55
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:46,432
It must have been so difficult for you when a big guy like
him was being hateful towards you. Weren't you scared?

56
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:50,253
I was scared. That's why I used
to avoid him and run away.

57
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,772
Seung Jae has a very cute side to him.

58
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:57,242
At that age, everyone admires a girl group.

59
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:00,712
It's fortunate he didn't
like Han Mi Mo of Angels.

60
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:04,973
Or else, this gathering
would've been awkward.

61
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:14,482
Min woo, happy birthday!

62
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:15,702
Me too, Happy birthday!

63
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:18,053
Thank you.

64
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,213
Tada.

65
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:34,982
You two aren't close...

66
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:39,063
But the gifts are the same...

67
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:44,322
Oppa, it's promising. Even though
you two aren't very close,

68
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:49,323
they might actually get along once they shake off the
hard feelings since they both have similar taste.

69
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,103
Is that right?

70
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:53,432
As a chance for them to get closer

71
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:56,572
should we meet up together
before going back to America?

72
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,562
I don't think we need to do that...

73
00:05:58,563 --> 00:05:59,952
I'm just joking, joking..

74
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:02,312
If you give it some time

75
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,092
they'll come around.

76
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,712
My Goldfish is such a charming woman.

77
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,142
Oppa.

78
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:14,012
In Korea, it's my first time seeing
someone so lovable who'd been wounded.

79
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:18,862
She is cute even when she makes a mistake, and
she's lovable even when she does something wrong.

80
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:21,532
She is adorable even when she's angry.

81
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:25,293
She's adorable even when she's angry?

82
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:30,352
Why, do you not agree?

83
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:35,422
No. It's possible. Our Shi Ah is
probably adorable too when she's angry.

84
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:38,562
But she never gets angry.

85
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:44,602
She's a woman who understands in any situation
and circumstance, and doesn't take it out.

86
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:47,672
<i>People who failed in their first marriage
tend to want to be compensated for it.</i>

87
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:54,433
<i>The person who is sitting next to me right now and her
are wanting to show that they have someone better.</i>

88
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,662
You haven't had time to eat right?

89
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,433
Thank you.

90
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:07,153
Coffee too.

91
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,693
This is awesome.

92
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,883
Ta da!

93
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:26,072
Hae Joon, would you like
to eat some sushi with us?

94
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,532
I'm okay, I have a lunch appointment.

95
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,172
It looks so tasty.

96
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:36,352
Doctor! The man you are matched with
this time seems to be very doting.

97
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:41,732
After seeing him a bit, he looks
like a nice person, I'm so jealous!

98
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,392
Does he look like that?

99
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:48,142
You should hold on to him, it's hard
to find a genuinely nice person.

100
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:49,492
Enjoy yourselves.

101
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:50,872
Doctor, please have some.

102
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:54,222
I'm okay, I don't really like sushi.

103
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,182
Is that right? I wonder why
he bought sushi then...

104
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,832
Looks like we'll be able to eat up.

105
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,742
Thank you for the food!

106
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:08,912
When he took the shots of eggs in my
place that time, he was totally cool.

107
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:14,402
And the worried looks in his eyes
looking at me was so touching too...

108
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:19,563
I got sucked into them. How can
I not get sucked into them?

109
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,012
You have me in your eyes.

110
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:27,523
My eyes are like that.
They pull in everything.

111
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:29,943
Especially you.

112
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,262
My Seung Jae has those
looks in his eyes, too.

113
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:41,503
Although they are a bit different than
Oppa's... How should I put it? Burning?

114
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:48,902
Soo Hyuk is lovely from
the head to his toes.

115
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,343
Even his nostrils are pretty.

116
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:55,252
Look! His nostrils are in heart shape.

117
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,412
Where is it in heart shape?

118
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,712
If you look from this angle... Look.

119
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,332
See it?

120
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,562
If you look this way.

121
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:06,973
Love is springing up
between the two of you.

122
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:12,363
I am totally blinded by love.

123
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,212
So I can never be apart from him.

124
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:22,172
I plan to be glued to him
for the rest of my life.

125
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:23,673
Right...

126
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:30,023
I guess I know why you put up an iron guard
to So Yeon. You are being loved like this.

127
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:38,763
What kind of fate is this...?

128
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:42,092
Unbelievable...

129
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:47,183
Soo Hyuk's little sister... Kim Soo...

130
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,123
Thank you.

131
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:56,213
What?

132
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:59,132
For loving, Oppa Soo Hyuk very much.

133
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,333
Ah, yes.

134
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:09,032
I am a bit disappointed for a certain
someone getting hurt, but it looks good.

135
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:12,963
To have such a great
girlfriend next to him...

136
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,072
Please take good care of
him from now on as well.

137
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:20,143
Stay right next to him and treat
him as well as you do now.

138
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:39,452
With your boyfriend... When
are you getting married?

139
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:40,472
In a week.

140
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,282
What?!

141
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:43,972
That fast?!

142
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:46,692
The main wedding will be in America.

143
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:50,632
So in Korea, we're only planning to just
invite close friends/family over dinner

144
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,773
and simply exchange rings.

145
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:59,193
Because it's Seung Jae's second marriage,

146
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:04,252
that's why we want to do it quietly here.

147
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,883
Shall we go out?

148
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,213
Yes.

149
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:15,542
That's right, Han Mi Mo.

150
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:18,683
That's what I'm telling you!
It's so awkward!

151
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:25,423
I did not even imagine that
my ex-wife would be here.

152
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,013
Dad!

153
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,043
Let's go.

154
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,023
Let's go.

155
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,823
Shall we go?

156
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,702
<i>What should we eat?</i>

157
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:09,212
<i>Anything except fish.</i>

158
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:10,203
<i>You don't like seafood?</i>

159
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,232
<i>Yeah, because it smells.</i>

160
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,312
<i>No matter how fresh it
is, it's always smelly.</i>

161
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:19,892
<i>Is that right? Then you'll probably
hate sushi, too. I like it though.</i>

162
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:23,762
<i>Then we should go eat, I can
always order something else.</i>

163
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,152
<i>Like teriyaki. I like that.</i>

164
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:29,093
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

165
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,222
Is Yeon Soo well?

166
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:34,282
I guess so.

167
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,972
Every time I see you guys,
it's so fascinating.

168
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:41,312
How could you guys break up
and work at the same place?

169
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,902
Because it's work.

170
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:44,652
That too can become affection.

171
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:48,683
Whenever you turn around, you feel secure
knowing she's there, sort of stability.

172
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:52,113
Affection?

173
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,132
<i>There is someone I want
to introduce you to.</i>

174
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:19,542
<i>There is someone, a woman Min Woo likes.</i>

175
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,022
<i>A Woman?</i>

176
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,292
<i>Yeah, my younger sister.</i>

177
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,422
<i>You have a younger sister?</i>

178
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:27,383
<i>Yeah I do.</i>

179
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:33,682
<i>Her name is Song Shi Ah. When I caused
a trouble and flew back to America,</i>

180
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,712
<i>she didn't ask or argued.</i>

181
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:39,312
<i>The younger sister who embraced me warmly.</i>

182
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:43,082
<i>That time, I couldn't see anything</i>

183
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,513
<i>and hear anything.</i>

184
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:51,943
<i>But as time passed, I saw Min Woo smiling</i>

185
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:55,252
<i>and I could hear him talking.</i>

186
00:13:55,253 --> 00:14:00,042
<i>The person who made that
possible was my sister Shi Ah.</i>

187
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:02,073
<i>She's a nice sister.</i>

188
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:05,372
<i>That's how I was able to gather
courage and come to Korea.</i>

189
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:09,513
<i>I'm so curious, how she'll look.</i>

190
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:21,952
What is the occasion,
coming here to my office?

191
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:23,373
Here.

192
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,302
What is this?

193
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:26,753
Lunch.

194
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:32,892
I asked them to pack something
while I was eating.

195
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:35,113
You used to love this.

196
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:47,203
Eat it, I'm leaving.

197
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,642
<i>Whether you meet him for
1 year or 10 years,</i>

198
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:02,063
<i>the thing you can't ever
be sure about is a person.</i>

199
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:06,162
<i>Although I met him briefly,</i>

200
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:11,313
<i>the Goo Hae Joon I knew,
had a beautiful back-view.</i>

201
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,713
I thought I knew him better.

202
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:34,832
CEO, are you coming in now?

203
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,682
Ah, this is our manager.

204
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,012
You've seen her once before, right?

205
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:41,232
Yeah, hello.

206
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:46,152
Ahh, this is the person who
swayed our CEO back and forth.

207
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,823
What?

208
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:50,373
Well, her mental status was
a little off recently.

209
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:55,502
Ah, I'm hungry, I'm going
to have a late lunch.

210
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,923
Eat a lot!

211
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:05,092
Because of work, I'll be
gone today and tomorrow.

212
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:06,812
Work? Did you find a job?

213
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:10,422
Yeah, I can't starve Min Woo.
I need to earn money.

214
00:16:10,423 --> 00:16:12,662
Thank goodness.

215
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,352
And it's the type of work you'd want to do?

216
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,012
Of course, don't worry.

217
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:18,833
Then...

218
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,143
Don't be upset you can't see me for a day.

219
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,183
Soo Hyuk.

220
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,543
Yeah?

221
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,853
Well...

222
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:53,933
It's nothing, be safe.

223
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:00,822
Mi Mo.

224
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,263
Huh?

225
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,393
I'll be back safely.

226
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,662
How was it seeing Han Mi Mo again?

227
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,012
Are you still uncomfortable?

228
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:28,313
Is there a reason to be concerned? It's not
like we'll be seeing each other often.

229
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:32,903
But when I see it, why does it
seem like it's bothering you?

230
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:38,223
Shi Ah.

231
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:43,232
To be honest, I have something to tell you.

232
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,893
Tell me what?

233
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:48,542
It's nothing.

234
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,313
You silly.

235
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,732
What?

236
00:17:56,733 --> 00:18:00,962
I wanted to spend some time with
you, so I asked for a vacation.

237
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:05,302
A vacation? You'd get scolded by your
goddess wasting vacation time like this.

238
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:08,582
I get scolded for this and that.
I get scolded everyday.

239
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,902
So if I am going to get scolded anyway, I might
as well do something I like and be scolded.

240
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:14,032
It's cumbersome.

241
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:16,162
Fine then. I'll void the vacation time.

242
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,723
I got it. Where shall we go first?

243
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:28,153
What's with her?

244
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:33,022
Why does it have to be that jerk?

245
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:35,423
How can it be twisted like this?

246
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:40,383
- Ah seriously... -Should
I give it to her later?

247
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:50,013
<i>Song Soo Hyuk. Song Min Woo.
And the same last name.</i>

248
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,273
Han Mi Mo.

249
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:57,013
<i>Kim Seung Jae</i>

250
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:01,183
<i>Previously husband and wife</i>

251
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:06,163
Actually there is no problem in kinship.

252
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:13,073
But my conscience is not clear.
The heaven and earth knows.

253
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:18,142
<i>When are you getting married
with your boyfriend?</i>

254
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,902
<i>In a week.</i>

255
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,633
Ahh, everything will end in a week.

256
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:28,662
Han Mi Mo! Can you give
up on Song Soo Hyuk?

257
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:31,512
Are you going to give up like this?

258
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:35,292
Should I ask Kim Seung Jae a favor
for both of us not to say anything?

259
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:40,043
No. No... That will...

260
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,442
<i>- Eat a lot. - Okay Oppa.</i>

261
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,153
<i>It's delicious.</i>

262
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,572
<i>She is a good cook.</i>

263
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,553
<i>You cook well.</i>

264
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:57,293
<i>- Honey, ah! -Uhm, ah!</i>

265
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:03,912
<i>Look at this happy face!</i>

266
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:07,503
<i>Her face is glowing after we got married.</i>

267
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:15,242
<i>Drink it.</i>

268
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:17,363
<i>Let's finish eating and go to bed early.</i>

269
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,053
<i>Miss Han Mi Mo?</i>

270
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,762
<i>Yes.</i>

271
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,543
<i>You got mail.</i>

272
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:35,223
<i>What is this?</i>

273
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,193
<i>Who is it?</i>

274
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:54,832
<i>I know what kind of relationship you
had with Kim Seung Jae five years ago.</i>

275
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,882
<i>And you want to marry Song Soo Hyuk?</i>

276
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,232
<i>Are you human?</i>

277
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:04,793
<i>You wish for a happiness making a
mess of someone's family registry?!</i>

278
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,503
Aigoo.

279
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,593
<i>Couple Love Note</i>

280
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:26,152
<i>Terms of endearment.</i>

281
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,872
<i>Write down your terms of endearment here.</i>

282
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:33,782
<i>Now you need to use these beautiful
terms of endearment to call each other.</i>

283
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:38,092
<i>Hey! You! Look! These won't do, right?</i>

284
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:40,832
<i>Don't call so and so's
mother or father either.</i>

285
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,662
<i>Terms of endearment that is full of love.</i>

286
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:48,712
<i>Call each other sweetly with
those terms of endearment.</i>

287
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:51,543
<i>Love has come back.</i>

288
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,953
What are you doing?

289
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:06,762
Homework that is assigned
by the couple camp.

290
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:08,452
Homework?

291
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,832
Movie date. Going to market together.
Learning yoga together...

292
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,372
Well, there's a lot.

293
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:19,552
I have to take photo as proof
after we do it together.

294
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:23,942
There is a prize of trip for the
first couple completing the tasks.

295
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,682
Then you wouldn't be so enticed.

296
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:29,582
You wouldn't put much
effort for winning a trip.

297
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,423
It's not like you can't take a trip because you
don't have money. It is the time you don't have.

298
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:39,422
Do you have any terms of endearment
to call your boyfriend by?

299
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:42,032
I broke up with my boyfriend recently.

300
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:44,352
Ah, right. Sorry.

301
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:46,802
Well, it's okay.

302
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:50,782
But... my terms of endearment
were Jajang and Jampong.

303
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:54,513
- Uh?
- Because our likes were so different.

304
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:58,273
Think simply. Doesn't have to be grandiose.

305
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:28,773
<i>Wh-what...</i>

306
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:33,483
<i>This will prevent from getting
bruised on your pretty face.</i>

307
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,802
Did you wait long?

308
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:53,412
No.

309
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:57,863
I ran quickly, but I'm late.
What do you have to say?

310
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:01,232
The thing is...

311
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,743
What is it?

312
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,462
The thing is...

313
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:10,653
Why so serious? You are making me nervous.

314
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:18,813
There's something you need to know.

315
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:27,313
What's wrong? Something happened?
You look nervous.

316
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:33,112
Honestly, I have something to confess...

317
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:35,672
Tell me. I'll listen to it all.

318
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,552
- All?- Yeah.

319
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:43,083
You wouldn't have lied about your age
like I did. You are a teacher after all.

320
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:48,803
Tell me. I'll listen to whatever you'd
have to say and forgive everything.

321
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:07,293
Did you tell him? Is it why you are alone?

322
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:11,082
He dumped you and left you, didn't he?

323
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,472
See... Ending it early...

324
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,482
I couldn't tell him.

325
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,252
What? Why?

326
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,692
I couldn't say it.

327
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:26,642
He believes I am an
innocent and honest woman.

328
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:31,913
I couldn't tell him looking at his
deer-like eyes and say "you got fooled."

329
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:35,292
Then, where did that guy go?

330
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:38,153
- His part-time job.- Part-time job?

331
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:48,222
Unnie. This is the reality for
you and for your formula baby.

332
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:51,993
You have a career and that
kid works at a part-time.

333
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,433
You still don't get it?

334
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:06,822
Han Mi Mo, what's wrong?

335
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:11,843
Da Jung, what do I do?

336
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:15,542
What? Kim Seung Jae?

337
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:18,863
He had to be the fiancee
to Song Soo Hyuk's sister.

338
00:26:19,873 --> 00:26:23,942
- Are you sure? - We even had a meal
together, so what's there to be sure?

339
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,022
What are you going to do?

340
00:26:25,023 --> 00:26:29,112
I just... I just have to give up.

341
00:26:29,113 --> 00:26:32,743
His sister and Kim Seung Jae
are getting married in a week.

342
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:38,492
Hey, what do I do? What do I do, Da Jung?

343
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:40,773
What should you do?

344
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,302
Did you tell Soo Hyuk?

345
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:50,323
What would I tell him?

346
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,062
He'd only get shocked.

347
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:55,653
But still you need to discuss it together.

348
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:03,473
Thinking Soo Hyuk getting
shocked pains me already.

349
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,832
If it wasn't for me...

350
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,893
If I didn't get entangled like this...

351
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:21,162
What's the theme for today's shooting?

352
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:22,282
Promise.

353
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:26,092
Are you perhaps talking about the promise
a man and a woman holding hands and vow?

354
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:28,722
Uh, that vow.

355
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,942
I shouldn't have used my vacation time.

356
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:34,552
Don't you have any theme that is more
dynamic and more exciting? Of all things...

357
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:38,462
You are quite a lucky guy being
able to joke about that.

358
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:42,343
- Yeah?
- Holding hands like that with someone

359
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,873
is a very difficult thing.

360
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,133
It is a very hard thing.

361
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,903
I got it.

362
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:01,383
Let's go eat now.

363
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:10,623
- Ah, cute.- The couple, the couple.

364
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,823
<i>Yeah. Look to the front.</i>

365
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:20,273
One, two, three.

366
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,242
They are looking at us.

367
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,883
- See...- We don't have to hide, do we?

368
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:27,802
Take it.

369
00:28:27,803 --> 00:28:31,283
Yes. Smile prettily. Smile.

370
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:45,973
Taking a vow is quite cunning.

371
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:53,182
You can take a vow but it's nothing
if you don't register for marriage.

372
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:55,372
Registered for a marriage,
but void if divorced.

373
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:58,082
It ends if you divorce and
turn your backs on each other.

374
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:03,092
If you forget about the vow
you made in your head,

375
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:04,712
then it's over, isn't it?

376
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:07,582
But I still want to do it.

377
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:11,563
And tell her I'd get the stars and
the moon from the sky for her.

378
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:15,852
That's corny. You even say
that kind of thing these days?

379
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,642
Why? Is it too childish?

380
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:22,302
What else doesn't keep its
place more than the stars?

381
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,862
What else changes more than the moon?

382
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:31,193
You should rather get something else
that doesn't change. What do we have...?

383
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:35,163
Changing is inevitable.

384
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:40,063
How you change is important.

385
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:51,222
Seung Jae, I beg of you, you give
up, I can't live without him.

386
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:56,082
I am already getting old and other guys
won't deal with my anger as you've said.

387
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,843
And if I cry, I became intolerably ugly...

388
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:04,163
Is this too subservient?

389
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:11,072
Seung Jae!

390
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:14,282
- Hi, Sister-in-law. - Hello.

391
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:17,242
Wow, you came looking so pretty.

392
00:30:17,243 --> 00:30:19,002
Of course.

393
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,413
What should we have for dinner?

394
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,173
Song Soo Hyuk.

395
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,712
What brings you here without calling?

396
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:39,303
I was on my way home and thought of you.

397
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:46,973
Just give up one of the two.

398
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:52,153
You can't have both.

399
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:56,662
Which one is more precious...

400
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:59,723
Wouldn't it be easier
once you figure that out?

401
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:10,843
This woman told me once
while walking away from me.

402
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,463
Just spit and forget about it.

403
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:35,883
Oh, thanks.

404
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:42,432
No, no. I'll do it.

405
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,432
Why? I was only going to rinse the dishes.

406
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:48,862
No. If you get the dish soap on your hands,
you'll get those wrinkles you hate so much.

407
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:52,593
Oh, that's right. I would.

408
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:55,672
Go on and rest.

409
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:57,403
Then, well.

410
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:38,402
It's suspicious. Something's definitely up.

411
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,363
What?

412
00:32:39,364 --> 00:32:44,062
Washing the dishes, throwing away food scraps,
and even ironing. He won't let me do any of it.

413
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,782
I came in first to go to bed,

414
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:50,522
but he even filled the water in the
humidifier and wished me a good night.

415
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:52,342
Any other man would say,

416
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:53,682
"I'm doing all the housework."

417
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:56,212
"But you're sleeping. How can you sleep?"

418
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:57,952
Wouldn't that be a normal reaction?

419
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:00,952
It's nice if he's good to you.
Why be suspicious?

420
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:06,142
Since he works at a beauty company, he probably heard
a lot from other women and is doing what he heard.

421
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:09,552
You should consider yourself lucky. Why
are you making up problems for yourself?

422
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:14,162
When someone is perfect,
it means something's up.

423
00:33:14,163 --> 00:33:19,232
Unnie, do you not remember how strongly
I got back stabbed at the wedding?

424
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:24,502
For some reason I am getting
that feeling again.

425
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,702
For sure this is a smoke screen.

426
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:31,602
If you go any further than that, you'd
be having a delusional jealousy issue.

427
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:35,493
No. I'll definitely find it.

428
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,083

the divorce paper, right?

473
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,872
What a scary thing to say...?

474
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:04,792
What's in the envelope?

475
00:38:04,793 --> 00:38:07,133
Confirm it yourself.

476
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,493
<i>Insurance Policy Application</i>

477
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:17,463
This...

478
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:20,352
I continued that policy because
because I didn't want to waste it.

479
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,382
But if I leave it the way it is...

480
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,943
You'd be the beneficiary if
something happened to me.

481
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:30,232
I checked with the insurance company, and
even though we are no longer married,

482
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:34,332
having your name on the policy,

483
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,842
you'd hit the jackpot later.

484
00:38:35,843 --> 00:38:37,373
So?

485
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:42,592
You take that and change it yourself.

486
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:45,272
Put my name as the policyholder
and the beneficiary.

487
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:46,312
Hey, Kim Seung Jae.

488
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:49,332
It's not like I am asking for too much,
and I've been paying for it too.

489
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,652
The thing you want to finish
up is the insurance policy?!

490
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:55,722
Do you know how much I've
been paying for that?

491
00:38:55,723 --> 00:38:58,223
Don't you think it's being
wasted if it were you?

492
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:01,192
Is this something that absurd?

493
00:39:01,193 --> 00:39:04,652
You never know how to
moderate your emotion.

494
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:08,392
Hey! After meeting you
and Song Shi Ah today,

495
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,492
do you know what kind of
agony I was in all day?

496
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:12,182
Agony...?

497
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,662
Wouldn't you be?

498
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:16,532
Since you are getting married,
it wouldn't matter. Is that it?

499
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:18,882
What are you talking about?

500
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:21,532
Forget it if you don't want to.
I'll give it up.

501
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,112
Fine, you give up!

502
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:26,882
Fine. Throw away that paper or burn it.

503
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,612
I said to give up!

504
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:30,832
I said I got it.

505
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,402
You give up. Don't you
know what I'm saying?

506
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,432
What now?

507
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:38,182
I can't give Song Soo Hyuk up!

508
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:40,533
So, you give up.

509
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:49,232
What are you talking about out of nowhere?

510
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,932
Out of nowhere?

511
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:54,232
Are you saying it is
expected that I give up?

512
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:57,832
Or shall we drag this into a mud?
Should I ignore everything and

513
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,242
get into the Song family?

514
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:00,083
What are you...?

515
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:03,442
We are going to be entangled as a family.

516
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,922
No matter how we much we close our eyes
and close our ears and close our mouth,

517
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,562
we'll see each other at the family's
events and holidays at least.

518
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:10,832
If I don't give up...

519
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,643
What are you saying?

520
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,243
<i>That is Oppa... Oppa.</i>

521
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:27,902
Laugh? Is it funny? This situation is?

522
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:32,873
It is funny. Isn't it funny to you?

523
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:39,302
Let's not drag this into the mud.

524
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:45,403
I am dumbfounded that you even thought
about that, and it makes me laugh.

525
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:50,872
I am saying Song Soo Hyuk
is that important to me.

526
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:54,672
Even so this isn't it. No matter how much you
love him, there is the line you shouldn't cross.

527
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:57,362
Let me tell you a fact that will
help you to make your decision.

528
00:40:57,363 --> 00:41:00,872
We are getting married in a week.

529
00:41:00,873 --> 00:41:04,583
Isn't it obvious who should give up?

530
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,593
Oh, what do I do?

531
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:51,193
Why are you crying in the rain?
You'll catch a cold.

532
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,882
What did you say?

533
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:13,333
I wrote my reason here.

534
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:16,092
What's wrong all of a sudden?

535
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:18,422
I've been thinking a lot.

536
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:20,423
Is it because of the age thing again?

537
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,622
When you read this, you'll understand.

538
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:30,543
Are you being sincere?

539
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:33,353
Yeah.

540
00:42:41,523 --> 00:42:43,383
I got it.

541
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:46,733
I'll read it.

542
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:52,623
Then...

543
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:02,583
Are you leaving?

544
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:08,222
I am getting up now.

545
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:14,122
I wrote down my heart there. You'll
know my heart after reading it.

546
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:17,342
I wrote about how I feel in here.

547
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:19,093
I got it.

548
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:22,403
Be careful in the rain.

549
00:43:24,513 --> 00:43:27,743
Okay. I'm going.

550
00:43:37,643 --> 00:43:43,263
<i>Jung Woo, I actually lied 3
years of my age like you did.</i>

551
00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:49,862
<i>So our age gap is 9 years
which we can't overcome.</i>

552
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:54,432
<i>I am sorry. Looking at those
deer-like eyes of yours,</i>

553
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:57,652
<i>I can't deceive you any longer.</i>

554
00:43:57,653 --> 00:44:00,252
<i>Please know this one thing.</i>

555
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:05,662
<i>All that was because I
didn't want to lose you.</i>

556
00:44:05,663 --> 00:44:10,392
<i>Thinking about it, when you
were eating baby food,</i>

557
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:14,803
<i>I was learning multiplications
and divisions at school.</i>

558
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:23,312
<i>Divisions... Right I was learning about the
divisions (homonym for knowing one's place)</i>

559
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:28,552
<i>Now I think I should get my head
straight and know my place.</i>

560
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:36,433
<i>I'd like it if you can understand that I am at the
age to meet and be married to an appropriate man.</i>

561
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:45,303
<i>I'm sorry. Let's break up. Dong Mi.</i>

562
00:44:57,783 --> 00:45:02,433
How can he not hold my arm even once?
As if he'd been waiting for it...

563
00:45:13,053 --> 00:45:15,572
Right. What Ae Ran said was right.

564
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:20,502
If I keep the relationship going like this, he'd
say "thank you for all this time Noona" to me.

565
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:24,182
Oh my, how heartbreaking that would be?

566
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:28,423
Ayissi. Fine, good riddance Ahn Jung Woo.

567
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,433
This umbrella is broken...
It's not opening.

568
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:04,343
It opened now.

569
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:10,132
My shoes are uncomfortable.
Uh my feet hurts.

570
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:13,132
- Is it just your feet that hurts?- Huh?

571
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:16,453
Your arms and legs or
your head doesn't hurt?

572
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:22,202
This is why it's tiring to have relationship
with a woman who is full of <i>the first time.</i>

573
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:26,933
Go Dong Mi, tell me honestly. You haven't
had many relationships, have you?

574
00:46:27,883 --> 00:46:29,432
How did you...?

575
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:33,192
Asking for a breakup is not
something you should say lightly.

576
00:46:33,193 --> 00:46:36,872
What are you talking about? Me
and you are really breaking up.

577
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:41,042
You idiot! Is this the letter written
by someone who wants to breakup?

578
00:46:41,043 --> 00:46:41,923
No.

579
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,922
If sincere, one phrase
<i>let's break up</i> will do.

580
00:46:45,923 --> 00:46:48,863
No need for a long explanation like this.

581
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:57,033
This is confessing <i>I really like
you very much</i> letter. You idiot.

582
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:05,253
Idiot. Just tell me that
useless thing again...

583
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:11,402
Go Dong Mi, don't eat my heart and runaway.

584
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:16,222
Wait. We'll probably
overcome the 9 year age gap.

585
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,403
Let's wait and see, okay?

586
00:47:35,693 --> 00:47:37,562
Do you have an umbrella?

587
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,343
Yeah.

588
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:43,343
It's raining a lot.

589
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:17,402
I have to go meet someone real quick.

590
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,992
Now? At this time?

591
00:48:19,993 --> 00:48:23,062
Yeah, I have to meet them for sure.

592
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:27,713
Okay. Don't get rained on and be careful.

593
00:48:31,343 --> 00:48:33,982
Don't cry, huh?

594
00:48:33,983 --> 00:48:37,563
If you continue, you'll look ugly.

595
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,562
<i>Let me tell you a fact to
help you make your decision.</i>

596
00:49:02,563 --> 00:49:06,613
<i>We are getting married in a week.</i>

597
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:51,892
- Is it fun?- What?

598
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:55,253
Seeing your ex-wife suffering?

599
00:49:57,613 --> 00:49:59,442
We've been running into each other lately.

600
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:00,822
I was angry about some things, too.

601
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:05,112
I just didn't want to say it with my own mouth
for the things that'll be known anyway.

602
00:50:05,113 --> 00:50:08,892
It'll be known anyway, but
even for just a few days,

603
00:50:08,893 --> 00:50:11,833
don't you think about the person
who'd be in pain for that time?

604
00:50:13,693 --> 00:50:15,682
I can guess why you guys divorced.

605
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,393
What did you say?

606
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:25,802
Don't hurt Shi Ah. She is
a precious sister to me.

607
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:30,843
But, I don't think I should see
you anymore because of my woman.

608
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:36,823
From this moment on, I will remain a
disappointing and bad older brother to Shi Ah.

609
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,443
So you be good to her.

610
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:44,853
Of course you would though...

611
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:24,163
Yes.

612
00:51:25,423 --> 00:51:28,222
I got all the materials.

613
00:51:28,223 --> 00:51:31,673
Now? Yes, I understand.

614
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:36,872
You weren't sleeping?

615
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:39,002
When did you come?

616
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:42,492
A while ago. But, you were
staying here like this?

617
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:48,713
The thing is, Soo Hyuk...
Soo Hyuk, the thing is...

618
00:52:51,193 --> 00:52:54,093
We have to break up.

619
00:52:56,903 --> 00:52:58,463
Mi Mo.

620
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:04,152
I see. You guys were married?

621
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:08,272
I am sorry to entangle you
uncomfortably like this.

622
00:53:08,273 --> 00:53:12,762
It's not a pleasant relationship,
but it isn't fatal either.

623
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:15,902
Oppa Soo Hyuk and I are not blood related.

624
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,452
We say we are family because of
the good relationship we've had.

625
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:22,773
But you are more important to me.

626
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:27,922
Thank you... for thinking
about it that way.

627
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:32,093
And, I'm really sorry.

628
00:53:34,213 --> 00:53:38,613
This jerk...

629
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:47,342
I am sorry Goldfish. You've been
suffering alone, haven't you?

630
00:53:47,343 --> 00:53:48,863
I'm sorry.

631
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:54,833
Do you know how much...

632
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:58,642
I am sorry. I should've
introduced you more clearly.

633
00:53:58,643 --> 00:54:01,432
I did wrong. I'm sorry.

634
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,172
Why did you say she is a family member?

635
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:07,362
Why didn't you put "kin" in front of
younger sister and why the same last name?

636
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:09,133
I did wrong.

637
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,293
Ah, Song Soo Hyuk!

638
00:54:15,263 --> 00:54:17,573
Oppa!

639
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:23,482
What are you doing in the hallway in the
middle of night? What if Min Woo sees this?

640
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:25,973
She is that sister's younger sister.

641
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:29,063
Oh, I see.

642
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:05,482
<i>I want to see her next to me.</i>

643
00:55:05,483 --> 00:55:10,423
<i>Even if she changes... It's okay
as long as she doesn't leave me.</i>

644
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:14,152
<i>That will do for me.</i>

645
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:18,562
<i>You just live with her. You'll ask her to sit
back when she is trying to get near you.</i>

646
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:22,012
<i>And if she tells you that she is taking
a trip for a month makes you happy.</i>

647
00:55:22,013 --> 00:55:25,213
<i>And so envious of the
<i>weekend husband and wife</i>.</i>

648
00:55:26,513 --> 00:55:28,542
<i>Ah, seriously.</i>

649
00:55:28,543 --> 00:55:30,403
<i>I am serious.</i>

650
00:55:47,163 --> 00:55:50,123
<i>Marriage Notification</i>

651
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,792
I recognize who this is.

652
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,053
I don't know.

653
00:56:08,763 --> 00:56:12,022
By chance, are you cheating on me again?

654
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:14,232
Why do you have a screen lock?

655
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:16,572
If you got nothing to hide,
then unlock the screen.

656
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:20,473
You unlock your first,
then I'll unlock mine.

657
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:25,252
Give me a day.

658
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:31,013
You smart for nothing! With that time, I'd get rid
of all the evidence even if I am cheating on you.

659
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,542
<i>Insurance Policy Application</i>

660
00:56:43,543 --> 00:56:48,472
I am turning it over because I don't want to
hear that I might hit the jackpot by keeping it.

661
00:56:48,473 --> 00:56:51,312
Was it fun for you to see me suffer?

662
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:55,822
I already got scolded for it
by someone, so give it a rest.

663
00:56:55,823 --> 00:56:58,483
- Who?- You don't need to know.

664
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:04,923
It was really tiresome us
living together, right?

665
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:09,833
It was... Because neither
one of us want to lose.

666
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:13,282
Shi Ah is perfect for me.

667
00:57:13,283 --> 00:57:16,933
Song Shi Ah. The person I am grateful to.

668
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:22,502
I don't know what kind of man Song Soo
Hyuk is, but I wish you the best.

669
00:57:22,503 --> 00:57:24,172
The man who is only looking at me.

670
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:28,913
The man who is on a different level from Kim
Seung Jae who plays with a woman's emotions.

671
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:36,033
The man who puts my feelings
first in any situation.

672
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:41,023
The man who worries all the
time that I might get hurt.

673
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:50,663
Seeing you, I covet Song Soo Hyuk
even more because of the comparison.

674
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:14,512
I am curious. Is that
spray really effective?

675
00:58:14,513 --> 00:58:15,353
What?

676
00:58:15,354 --> 00:58:19,072
No, just...

677
00:58:19,073 --> 00:58:22,853
You are just spraying there, so I
am wondering if it's effective.

678
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:27,673
Omo! Omo, omo!

679
00:58:28,553 --> 00:58:32,473
By this time the germs
would have been invaded.

680
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:39,193
If you do that too much, you won't get immunity
and will have more difficult time later.

681
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:44,903

Omo! Who put the papers on the walls?

684
00:59:09,923 --> 00:59:13,712
