1
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,050
Woman: Memory is
a selection of images,

2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,280
some elusive,

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,220
others printed indelibly
on the brain.

4
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,790
The summer I killed my father,
I was 10 years old.

5
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,530
My brother Poe
was nine,

6
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,830
and my sister Cisely
had just turned 14.

7
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,600
The town we lived in

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,440
was named after a slave.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,070
It's said that when
General Jean Paul Batiste

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,550
was stricken with cholera,

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,450
his life was saved by the medicine
of a slave woman called Eve.

12
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,010
In return for his life,

13
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,860
he freed her and gave her
this piece of land by the bayou.

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,260
Perhaps in gratitude,
she bore him 16 children.

15
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,360
We are the descendants of
Eve and Jean Paul Batiste.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I was named for her.

17
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,030
(Cajun music playing)

18
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,350
He'd better grab it now
while it still fits in his hands.

19
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,380
From what I hear,
it ain't just him giving it.

20
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,550
Do tell.

21
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,690
Don't let nothing fall out,
or I might have to catch you.

22
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,510
Don't hurt yourself
with that thing.

23
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,980
Harry...

24
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,550
why do you always do that
when we're drunk?

25
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,490
Put down the camera,
darling.

26
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,560
My baby Mozelle thinks
pictures make her look fat.

27
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,330
Put down the damn camera.

28
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,700
Harry. Here's
your favorite niece.

29
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,800
Oh, there she goes.
Hold on, sweetness.

30
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,330
Hey, Red.
What you got for me, baby?

31
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,940
A kiss and a chocolate...
for a price.

32
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,640
Well...

33
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,150
what do I get for this?

34
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,490
Two kisses and all
the chocolates you can eat.

35
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,960
That's my baby.

36
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,490
Here you go, sweetie.

37
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,190
- Thank you.
- Eve?

38
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,130
Where did you get those
delicious-looking chocolates?

39
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,400
You told me
to help serve, Mama.

40
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,700
This tastes kind of good.
Crunchy.

41
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,470
Well, don't just stand here
and let Harry eat them all.

42
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,210
Mama:
There's my baby boy.

43
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,250
Are you having
a good time, honey?

44
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,600
Chocolates, Poe?

45
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,110
They're beans.

46
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,000
Chocolate-covered beans.

47
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,750
Eve Batiste!

48
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,800
"Tybalt, Mercutio,

49
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,360
the prince expressly hath forbidden
bandying in Verona streets."

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,100
Really, make yourselves useful.

51
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,270
Help me with the champagne.

52
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,650
- Vive les Batiste!
- Bonne chance et bonne santé.

53
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,710
Merde!

54
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,470
Oh, you in trouble now.

55
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,310
Look at Daddy.

56
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,620
You must be so proud.

57
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,720
Your son is the best colored
doctor in all of Louisiana.

58
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,100
Every goddamn woman
in the parish

59
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,430
thinks Louis's
the Second Coming.

60
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,680
I used to be able
to keep up with you.

61
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,580
You're just out of practice,
that's all.

62
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,850
Come on, baby doll,
let's show them how to dance.

63
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,920
Hey, can't
my daughter dance?

64
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Louis:
Elle sait danser, eh?

65
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,690
Hey, Red. Red?

66
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,860
Do you want to dance?

67
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,930
No, thanks.

68
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,000
(squeaking)

69
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,750
- Woman: I can't see a thing.
- Louis: Just hold on to my hand.

70
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,980
(moans and kisses)

71
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,020
(clinking)

72
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,450
(Eve sobs)

73
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,140
Come here.

74
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,530
Shh...

75
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Breathe, come on.

76
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,850
Breathe deeply.
Deep breaths.

77
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,550
Deep breaths.

78
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,320
That's right.

79
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,330
- That's right.
- (Eve sobs)

80
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,430
Sorry.

81
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,590
I was asleep.

82
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,330
It's okay, baby.
You scared us too.

83
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,440
You remember
Mrs. Mereaux?

84
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,510
Almost gave me
a heart attack.

85
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,010
Sorry I scared you,
Mrs. Mereaux.

86
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,860
Matty, would you mind going
inside and fixing me a drink

87
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,890
while I talk to my daughter?

88
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,130
Of course not.

89
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,370
Good night, Eve.

90
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,560
Good night, Mrs. Mereaux.

91
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,280
Would you like
to go outside?

92
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,040
- Hey, Willie.
- Bonsoir, Louis.

93
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,580
Daddy loves you so much.

94
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,820
I know.

95
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,660
I know you know.

96
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,400
Do you love Mama?

97
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,040
Your mama...

98
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,870
is the most beautiful...

99
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,940
perfect woman
I ever met.

100
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,380
Your mama's a lady.

101
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,050
And I'll always love her.

102
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,680
Always. Understand?

103
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,450
Daddy?

104
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,630
Yes, baby.

105
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,730
How come you never
dance with me?

106
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,210
How can you say your daddy
never dances with you?

107
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,440
When we're alone and stuff.
But not at parties.

108
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,380
You always dance with Cisely.

109
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Tell you what.
From now on...

110
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,590
we'll dance at every party.
All right?

111
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,630
(Louis chuckles)

112
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,660
Mama:
There you are.

113
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,110
I was looking for you two.

114
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,370
Eve...

115
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,350
it is past midnight.

116
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,610
Your cohorts are
already in pajamas.

117
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,920
I was talking to Daddy.

118
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,220
Well, I guess
that's legal.

119
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,590
Hey, you.

120
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Are you sober?

121
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,920
Yes, Ma'am.

122
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,600
Just barely.

123
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,340
Did you have fun tonight?

124
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,780
I bet you did.

125
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,880
Go say good night to Uncle Tommy
before I put him down.

126
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,390
- I have to?
- Yes, Ma'am.

127
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,360
Then, straight to bed. And don't
forget to say your prayers.

128
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,830
Never cheat
the man upstairs.

129
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,500
Good night, Mama.
Good night, Daddy.

130
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,200
Good night, baby.

131
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,200
Night night.

132
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,570
What's wrong with her?

133
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,080
Oh, she'll be all right.

134
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,390
- And what about you?
- What about me?

135
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,590
You sober?

136
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,990
Barely.

137
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,140
- You're coming in?
- In a minute.

138
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,290
Hey, Uncle Tommy,
I came to say good night.

139
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,460
Hi.

140
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,700
Hi.

141
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,610
Oui, une grande party.

142
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,590
Cocktails...

143
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,420
you didn't miss anything.
It was boring.

144
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,150
Boring...

145
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,360
Yeah...

146
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,390
well, good night.

147
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,400
Boring...

148
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,610
Hey.

149
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,010
Where were you?

150
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,280
- I looked all over.
- (Eve sniffles)

151
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,550
I was outside with Daddy. Then
I said good night to the croaker.

152
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,460
Before that.

153
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,690
I was in the carriage house.

154
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,860
You was in there a long time.

155
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,810
(Eve sobs)

156
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,540
I fell asleep.

157
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,950
What's wrong, rabbit?

158
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,910
What's the matter?
What?

159
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,290
- What is it?
- Nothing.

160
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,950
Hey, don't tell me
it's nothing. What's wrong?

161
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,720
I saw Daddy.

162
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,800
I was asleep
and I woke up...

163
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,900
and Daddy...

164
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,370
- What?
- Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux.

165
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,010
What about Daddy
and Mrs. Mereaux?

166
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,980
I saw them kissing.

167
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,780
Don't be stupid.

168
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,020
Daddy wouldn't touch that cow.

169
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,860
It's true, I saw them.

170
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,990
He had his hands on her.
It's true.

171
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,460
He was all up against her,
and her dress was...

172
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,700
- That's a lie!
- I saw them!

173
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,900
He was all up against her
and her dress was up

174
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,100
- and they were rubbing.
- Shh!

175
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,000
Stop it.

176
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,010
Just stop it.

177
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,950
I'm going to tell you
what happened.

178
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,960
- What?
- I can't see a thing.

179
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,230
Just hold on to my hand.

180
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,770
Cisely: They came in to get
some more wine...

181
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,370
and Daddy told her a joke.

182
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,640
And she fell
against him laughing.

183
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,110
- And they woke you up.
- (glass clinking)

184
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,150
You sure?

185
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,090
I'm certain.

186
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,290
What would Daddy want
with Matty Mereaux?

187
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,920
Mama's the most beautiful
woman in the world.

188
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,330
Go to bed.

189
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,300
It's late.

190
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,910
You scared me.

191
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,750
Louis: God damn it,
Harry, wait.

192
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,090
Harry: I'm leaving, I'm driving,
I'm taking my damn wife...

193
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,150
- No, no, no.
- Mozelle.

194
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,220
You'll either let
Mozelle drive...

195
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,390
or you'll stay here tonight,
or I'll whip your ass.

196
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,420
Shit, get your hands off me.

197
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,700
I may be drunk,
but I'll whip your butt.

198
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,600
- Come on!
- Stop it, assholes!

199
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,970
Now, what is your monkey ass
gonna do, huh?

200
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,310
Just because you're a doctor,
you think you know everything?

201
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,120
- You don't know everything.
- God damn it, Harry!

202
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,210
Cisely:
Daddy, Uncle Harry.

203
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,880
Stop it. It's late.
You want to raise the dead?

204
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,550
Go back to bed. You're not dressed
and it's bedtime.

205
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,290
Not till Daddy
comes in.

206
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,990
Toi, t'es un vrai
cochon parfois.

207
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,830
Fuck you, doc,
I'm sick of your shit.

208
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,930
- Come here. Come on!
- Give me the damn keys!

209
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,210
Now get into the goddamn car
before I kill you.

210
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,740
(Louis laughs)

211
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,720
Mozelle:
Dis bonsoir, Harry.

212
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,190
- Good night.
- Good night, slugger.

213
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,450
Bonsoir, Mozelle.

214
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,550
- Nighty, Mozelle.
- Nighty, Mozelle. Night, Harry.

215
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,120
Good night, y'all.
Be good.

216
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,030
Good night, Red.
Good night, Cisely.

217
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,700
- Fuck you, Doc.
- Shut the hell up.

218
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,730
What do I get for this?

219
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,360
Woman: I don't know why
the Lord sees fit...

220
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,470
Good night, Red.

221
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,200
(phone rings in the distance)

222
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,480
Mama: Mozelle, are you...

223
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,460
Oh, my God.
Louis, Louis, wake up!

224
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,290
Red:
God bless Uncle Harry...

225
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,630
May God bless
Uncle Maynard...

226
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,970
and Uncle Anderson.

227
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,750
(knock on door)

228
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,570
(whispering)
Aunt Mozelle, wake up.

229
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,710
What for?

230
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,650
You got clients coming.

231
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,430
Harry's voice: Mozelle.

232
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,870
Eve:
You don't look so bad.

233
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,880
I loved them...

234
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,350
I swear I did.

235
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,450
Eve: I know.

236
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,820
It's not your fault they die.

237
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,170
Which one did you love best?

238
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,740
I don't know, Eve.
They was all different.

239
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,510
Anderson was the handsomest
man I've ever seen.

240
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:08,080
Your uncle Harry,
he was the sweetest.

241
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,490
And Maynard...

242
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,990
Maynard loved me
most of all.

243
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,060
Even when I was your age,
before I ever did the counseling,

244
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,270
I could look at people, complete
strangers, and see their lives.

245
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,300
But I looked at each
of my husbands...

246
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,180
and never saw a thing.

247
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,910
That's the way it always is...

248
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,380
blind to my own life.

249
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,180
(bell ringing)

250
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,950
Eh bien...
now go and...

251
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,960
make yourself invisible
for a while.

252
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,060
If you're quiet...
you'll be able to hear.

253
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,680
I'm so sorry about Harry.

254
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,790
I don't know
why the Lord sees fit...

255
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,020
We're all servants
of divine will.

256
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,970
The Lord giveth
and taketh away.

257
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,030
Oh, well.

258
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,630
Close your eyes.

259
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,000
Lord, lead us in the direction
of righteousness.

260
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,340
Advise us that we may
become wiser in Thy will.

261
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,250
- Amen.
- Amen.

262
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,050
Speak your mind, my friend.

263
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,750
It's my boy.

264
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,690
My boy's ran off
and I don't know where.

265
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,030
My husband and I have been
praying for two months.

266
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,830
And I pray for patience, but...

267
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,310
I can't take it anymore.
I have to know.

268
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,940
(sirens blasting)

269
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,750
He's alive, Hilary.

270
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,450
You'll find him in Detroit,
at St. Michael's Hospital.

271
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,830
Next Tuesday.

272
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,340
Is he sick?

273
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,100
Tell me.

274
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:23,180
Your son's on drugs.
Go home and pray for strength.

275
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,550
You'll need strength
to help you through this.

276
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,540
Mozelle: The money is gone,
Madame Renard.

277
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,550
Your niece spent it all.

278
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,710
I'm sorry.

279
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,420
(sobbing)
Oh, help me.

280
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,720
My God.

281
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,060
How will I live?

282
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,890
Please, help me.

283
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,320
I want you to get a small bag
made of skin of chamois.

284
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,020
In it, place this piece
of moon stone

285
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,030
and John Conqueror root.

286
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,500
Tie it with a piece
of devil shoestring.

287
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,830
And in your right hand,
sprinkle five drops of holy oil.

288
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,610
Thank you, Madame.

289
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,340
I'm in no position
to repay your kindness

290
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,680
- with my money gone.
- C'est rien, ma chére.

291
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,810
Keep the bag
next to your skin.

292
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,890
I'm so sorry
about your husband.

293
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,490
He was such a fine man.

294
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,560
Thank you.

295
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,970
Don't be cute.

296
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,550
You told Daddy you don't
practice no voodoo.

297
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,520
She was desperate.

298
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,290
Does it work?

299
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,230
We'll see.

300
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,820
What if it don't?

301
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,030
I don't think she'll sue me.

302
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,090
(Mozelle chuckles)

303
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,740
Mozelle: Oh Lord.

304
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,800
What is it now?

305
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,970
(faint)
What did you say?

306
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,610
Ros: I said, I've got three
of his damn babies.

307
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,180
I can't stand
that woman called my house!

308
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,250
There is nothing in this world
lower than eavesdropping

309
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,730
- on the conversation of others.
- This is important.

310
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,860
If they wanted you to hear,
they'd have left the door open.

311
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,870
- I'm telling.
- (both gasp)

312
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,310
Women have been lying about this
ever since God invented them.

313
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,980
Daddy.

314
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,710
Hey, Cis.

315
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,320
You're in trouble. Go to Kings
and come back later.

316
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,620
- They're really mad.
- Who's mad, baby?

317
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,920
Who, them?

318
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,490
They're always mad.

319
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,620
People fantasize
about their doctors...

320
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,090
No, don't talk, Louis.

321
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,020
- I feel like I'm falling.
- I'll catch you.

322
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,130
Don't.

323
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,030
- Eve: He's that old?
- Yeah.

324
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,170
Eve:
He seems like he's 100.

325
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,870
Not 100. I think he used
to go out with grand-mére.

326
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,350
H uh? They do seem like
they could make a good couple.

327
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,580
You really think so?

328
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,250
Wait, grand-mére doesn't really
seem like she's that old.

329
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,120
Oh, grand-mére is old,
let me tell you.

330
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,430
You've been taking
your pills. Good girl.

331
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,690
Yes, Doctor,
I'm feeling much better.

332
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,130
Everything will be
just fine.

333
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:20,370
Yes, everything's going
to be just fine.

334
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,810
As long as you keep
taking your pills.

335
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,470
- Good bye, Mrs. Renard.
- Bye.

336
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,850
Yes, Lord...

337
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,920
everything will be
just fine.

338
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,270
Your lungs are clear
as a bell, Stevie.

339
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,170
I think you'll live.

340
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,410
Doctor...

341
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,390
could you give me
something for the pain?

342
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,090
Eve...
go on outside and play.

343
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,400
What pain is that,
Stevie?

344
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,000
What was wrong
with that lady?

345
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,880
Mrs. Hobbs?

346
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,470
Some illnesses are hard
to put a finger on.

347
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,510
- Is she having a baby?
- No. Why do you ask?

348
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,320
Do you ever want other kids?

349
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,290
No, your mother and I are happy
with the three kids we've got.

350
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,630
No, I mean, other kids...

351
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,330
besides us.

352
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,380
Open your mouth
and say, "Aaah."

353
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,280
No, I don't see
anything in there

354
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,910
that would make you say
something so stupid.

355
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,480
I got to go to the hospital.
I have to take you home.

356
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,490
Oh no.

357
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,050
Please, Daddy.

358
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,390
Tell you what,
I'll race you.

359
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,590
- I'll give you a head-start.
- Okay. Bye!

360
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,800
(whistling)

361
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,580
We're supposed to be
cheering each other up.

362
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,960
I know.

363
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,800
I was just wondering
what happened with that woman.

364
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,630
I supposed he fixed it.

365
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,330
He knows how to fix things.

366
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,040
When I first met Louis,
I watched him set this boy's leg

367
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,950
who'd fallen out of a tree.

368
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,350
I said to myself,
"He's a man who can fix things.

369
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,360
He's a healer.
He'll take care of me."

370
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,190
So I leave my family...

371
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,370
and I move to the swamp...

372
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,370
and I find out
he's just a man.

373
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,040
We're two of a kind,
my brother and I.

374
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,750
One day,
he'll turn around...

375
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,020
and he will see you
for the first time.

376
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,290
And then he'll stop looking
for what he already has.

377
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,360
What if it's too late?

378
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,430
Let's eat pomegranates

379
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,600
till our hands turn red...

380
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,550
and all we can think about
is getting the juice off.

381
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,120
Mo, let's get
our fortunes drawn.

382
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,130
Not by her.

383
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,900
Come on, you said
you wanted to cheer me up.

384
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,060
She couldn't predict
heat in August.

385
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,540
Mozelle Batiste...
if I didn't know you better,

386
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,130
I'd say you have a case
of professional jealousy.

387
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,700
Roz, I am a psychic counselor.

388
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,650
Elzora is a sideshow
attraction.

389
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,770
Then there's nothing
to be afraid of.

390
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,720
Which one first?

391
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,220
My sister-in-law's
something of a skeptic.

392
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,060
But I'd very much like
my fortune drawn.

393
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,560
Sit down.

394
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,240
Empty it.

395
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,150
You're in pain,
my daughter.

396
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,200
Yes.

397
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,330
There is an end
to your problem...

398
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,500
though not
one you imagined.

399
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,840
Stay quiet...
and wait.

400
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,710
Wait?

401
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,620
Sometimes a soldier falls
on his own sword.

402
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,120
In three years time,
you will be happy again.

403
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,320
Three years?

404
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,530
Look to your children.

405
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,640
Dollar.

406
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,950
That's it?

407
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,070
Just wait three years
and everything will be fine?

408
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,910
Look to your children.

409
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,520
Thank you.

410
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,330
I feel most enlightened.
Good afternoon.

411
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,970
- You were right. Come on.
- Wait.

412
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,290
Some things are
better left unsaid.

413
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,130
I paid you a dollar,
old woman.

414
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,730
No, tell my fortune.

415
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,500
I don't need no cat bones
to tell your fortune.

416
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,740
You are a curse!
A black widow.

417
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,110
Next man who marries you
is a dead man.

418
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,920
Like the others.
Always be that way.

419
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,620
Sale menteuse!

420
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,830
You're an old lying witch!

421
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,800
Wait a minute.

422
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,870
For heaven's sake,
what did she say?

423
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,480
It's all right, it's just...
I need...

424
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,080
Come on, let's not be
in the street.

425
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,140
Mo.

426
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,870
It's dead.

427
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,640
Are you sure?

428
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,370
It's not moving, is it?

429
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,810
Maybe it's just sick.

430
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,550
It's dead,
you little chicken.

431
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,000
(both scream)

432
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,370
Oh, Cisely,
thank Heavens.

433
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,480
Where are Eve and Poe?

434
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,180
- Mom, I don't know.
- (distant screaming)

435
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,240
Oh, Lord.

436
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,190
Are you all right?

437
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,320
Just go. Don't ask me.
Just go.

438
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,730
You're going to lock
these kids up in the house

439
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,610
for the summer 'cause of what
that fortune teller told you?

440
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,510
She kept saying,
"Look to your children."

441
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,180
And no sooner do we leave,
that Mozelle has this vision

442
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,080
- of a child getting hit.
- (laughs)

443
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,920
Roz, I love my sister,
but she's not unfamiliar

444
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,860
- with mental hospitals.
- Not in front of the children.

445
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,190
- They know.
- Of course, we know.

446
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,750
- Poe: Know what?
- Aunt Mozelle is crazy.

447
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,030
Eve: She is not! She knows things.
People trust her.

448
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,700
Sweetheart, Aunt Mozelle's
a little eccentric.

449
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,710
We let her tell fortunes
to keep her out of trouble.

450
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,840
She may be crazy, but
them visions always come true.

451
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,410
Anyway...
I've made up my mind.

452
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:33,010
- They're staying in the house.
- Till when?

453
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,510
Well, I don't now.
Till Mozelle says it's safe.

454
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,520
- Can't believe I'm hearing this.
- What if we don't play in traffic?

455
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,390
Don't you use that tone
of voice with me.

456
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,060
And don't roll your eyes
at your father behind my back.

457
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,860
You're looking right at us, Mama.

458
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,770
Nothing ever happens
behind your back.

459
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,300
Don't talk back to your mother.

460
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,900
- You're not too big to beat.
- Don't threaten my daughter, Mama.

461
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,500
You let her threaten me.

462
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,250
When I was growing up,
children did not

463
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,580
participate in
a conversation of adults.

464
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,020
You can let them kids back talk
and run wild if you want to.

465
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,960
You won't hear
another word out of me.

466
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:19,260
In my day, we were thankful
for signs and warnings.

467
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,500
Let the little hooligans
get run over.

468
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,330
Ça va plus tranquille
autour d'ici.

469
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,100
Could be much
quieter around here.

470
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,840
I want to thank you
for the delightful family chat.

471
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,750
- I have patients to see.
- Louis...

472
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,620
- it's Sunday.
- When you manage to put sickness

473
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,920
on an eight-hour, five-day
schedule, let me know.

474
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,260
- Why can't they wait a day?
- Are you two gonna fight?

475
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,200
"Some sicknesses are hard
to put a finger on."

476
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,560
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

477
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,910
Which one of your patients
are you going to see?

478
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,170
Woman, go get your palm read,
let me do my work.

479
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,560
You love your daddy,
baby?

480
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,660
- You know I do.
- That's all I need.

481
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,270
Excuse me, darling.

482
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,180
Don't you think you're being
a little immature?

483
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,260
I beg your pardon?

484
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,730
Keeping us in the house
'cause Mozelle's seeing things,

485
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,420
and not wanting Daddy
to go to work.

486
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,430
What's wrong with you?

487
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,970
If you're lucky,
you might live long enough

488
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,310
to one day have
a husband and children.

489
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,610
But until then, this is my house
and you'll do as I say.

490
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,880
Do you understand?

491
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,050
I said, do you understand?

492
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,110
Yes, Ma'am.

493
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,080
Good.

494
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,000
No one leaves this house
until I say so.

495
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,310
"What a man art thou,
that, thus be screened in night,

496
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,550
So stumblest
on my counsel?

497
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,690
"By a name... I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

498
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:08,330
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself

499
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,860
Because it is
an enemy to thee."

500
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,600
(heavy sigh)

501
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,070
What are you
doing in there?!

502
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,280
Cisely: Go away.

503
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,920
Ah!

504
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,550
Ouch!

505
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,260
God damn it!

506
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,230
Ferme ta gueule, hein?

507
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,360
I heard you.
You said, "God damn it."

508
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,000
Eve.

509
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,300
You shouldn't be sneaking up
on people when they're swearing.

510
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,070
- Does it hurt?
- What?

511
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,510
Your finger, Mother.

512
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,720
No, not too much.

513
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,650
You'll cut your finger off
one of these days.

514
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,550
"Tis not so deep as a well...

515
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,290
Nor so wide
as a church door...

516
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,520
But 'tis enough,
'twill serve."

517
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,200
Romeo and Juliet.

518
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,670
What?

519
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,930
We've read most
of the tragedies.

520
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,530
We're starting on
the goddamn comedies.

521
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,100
You are asking to get hit.

522
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,480
- (distant scream)
- Baby?

523
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,710
The Lord have mercy.

524
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,020
What happened, baby?
You all right?

525
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,850
Mozelle:
Hey, everybody.

526
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,880
Hi, Mo.
Poe, are you all right?

527
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,760
Look what I found in the attic...

528
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,200
a Monopoly board
and Chinese checkers.

529
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,220
You could find the czar
of Russia in that attic.

530
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,730
I despise Chinese checkers.

531
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,140
Poe: I hate her!
I wish she was dead!

532
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,730
I feel like I walked
into the middle of a cyclone.

533
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,370
Eve... what did you do
to your brother?

534
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,780
I'll push him out of a window
if I don't get out!

535
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,120
Cisely has been in the goddamn
bathtub for an hour.

536
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,420
She stayed in it
three hours yesterday.

537
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,720
There's more than
one bathroom in this house.

538
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,890
Ain't that much dirt
in all of Louisiana.

539
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,990
Get out of the damn tub!

540
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,230
You watch your language,
young lady.

541
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,600
Mama keeps stabbing herself
in the kitchen.

542
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,070
- Show her your hands.
- You'd better hush.

543
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,010
And where is Daddy?
He's never home.

544
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,640
He's supposed to be
home sometimes.

545
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,700
Listen, you little ingrate.

546
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,940
Your father works hard so we can
have a house with four bathrooms.

547
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,710
He's not working every night.
I know he's not.

548
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,320
- I mean...
- Let me borrow you for a minute.

549
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,430
Poe?

550
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,830
Is that your idea
of being a good daughter?

551
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,340
It's true.

552
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,710
He never comes home,
and it's making her nervous.

553
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,580
She cuts herself.

554
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,810
And you're being helpful
bringing it up?

555
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,680
She's nervous 'cause
he's messing with other women.

556
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,740
What did you say?

557
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,680
Nothing.

558
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,180
Play games with me
and I'll slap you blind.

559
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:32,820
- It's true, I saw them.
- You saw who?

560
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,030
You have five seconds.

561
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,200
Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux.

562
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,810
God.

563
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,930
It was at the party.

564
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,170
I was in the carriage house
and they didn't see me.

565
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,870
And it was worse
than just kissing...

566
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,350
Shh. Let me think
a minute.

567
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,550
Have you told anyone?

568
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,860
- No.
- Well, that's good.

569
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,350
Because if you tell anyone,
anyone at all...

570
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,490
I'm going to kill you.

571
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,270
And if you get callous again
with your mama's feelings,

572
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,860
I swear I'll do you harm.

573
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,670
- You understand me?
- Yes, Ma'am.

574
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,910
Listen...

575
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,350
your daddy loves you,

576
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,180
- and he loves your mama.
- I know.

577
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,660
We are a lot the same,
your father and I.

578
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,430
Except I don't have
no children to catch me.

579
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,640
You all are my children.

580
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,080
That's why Maynard got
tired of me, 'cause I'm barren.

581
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,380
But...

582
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,820
Maynard loved you.

583
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,450
Maynard loved you
most of all.

584
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,790
I think he did.

585
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,390
But I didn't know that
until I met Hosea.

586
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,060
- Tell me about Hosea.
- You're too young to understand.

587
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,600
But when I was with Hosea,

588
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,200
it was like my whole
body was burning.

589
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,680
I'd come home
and have to rub ice

590
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,910
on my face and neck
to cool down.

591
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:36,110
If Maynard knew,
he never said a word.

592
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,490
Then one night, Hosea
showed up at the door.

593
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,090
He said, "Pack your bags.
I've come to take you with me."

594
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,960
And God help me...

595
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,560
I pushed past
my startled husband.

596
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,300
I was going upstairs
to pack my bags,

597
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,270
when I heard Maynard say
in a tone I'd never heard him use,

598
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,470
"I don't care
who you are, sir,

599
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:03,450
but if you don't leave my house
at once, I will hurt you."

600
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,970
And I turned
just in time

601
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:10,180
to see Hosea pull a gun out
and aim it at Maynard.

602
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,190
"I'm in love
with your wife,

603
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,390
and if you try to stop us,
I'll kill you."

604
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,130
Maynard walked right up and pushed
his chest in the barrel of that gun,

605
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,730
and he said,

606
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:31,680
"Well, then, you'll have
to kill me

607
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,240
because my wife ain't
going nowhere."

608
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,980
Oh, Eve...

609
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:44,180
in that moment, I knew
that I loved Maynard.

610
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,350
He was so calm and brave...

611
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,620
and it was Hosea
who was trembling.

612
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,690
Maynard said...

613
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,630
"Mozelle...

614
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,070
tell this man you ain't
going nowhere with him

615
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:06,440
so he can get the hell
out of my house."

616
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,810
Mama was standing in
the doorway of the kitchen

617
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,480
and she was holding
her heart like this.

618
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,890
I walked slowly over...

619
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,670
and I stood
next to my husband...

620
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:42,640
and I looked at my lover...

621
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,180
this man who had lit
this great fire in me, and said,

622
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,320
"Please, leave our house.

623
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,090
I never want
to see you again."

624
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:00,560
Hosea's eyes went another color
and he stopped trembling.

625
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,730
He looked right at me...
and he said...

626
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,430
Hosea: All right, then.

627
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,170
(gunshot)

628
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,610
And he shot Maynard
in the chest.

629
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:20,280
And I was alone...
for a while.

630
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,850
(knock on door)

631
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,770
- Can I help you?
- I need Mozelle Batiste.

632
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,740
I am.

633
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,540
Am I disturbing you?

634
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,300
I don't know yet.

635
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,370
My name is Julian Grayraven.

636
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,580
Folks around here say
you read the future.

637
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,630
Julian: My wife
left me a year ago.

638
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,770
I've been to many cities,
searching for her.

639
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,140
I have no place
to return to anymore.

640
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,420
I'm exhausted.

641
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,410
I cannot continue and yet...

642
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,760
I cannot stop until I know.

643
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,120
Where is my wife?

644
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:50,830
♪ Now, darling ♪

645
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:57,470
♪ I think I really
love you... ♪

646
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,070
- Daddy, it's late.
- What are you doing up?

647
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,570
Waiting for you.
What do you think I'm doing up?

648
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,780
(heavy sigh)

649
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,150
What's your pleasure
this evening, Doctor?

650
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,680
Scotch and water,
bartender.

651
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,160
Where's your mama?

652
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,230
Everybody's asleep, Daddy.

653
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:35,810
Mom was nervous.
So grand-mére gave her a tablet.

654
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,410
That woman's got
every pill in the world.

655
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,580
Speaking of the infirm...

656
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,210
guess I better
check on Tommy.

657
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:47,820
Maybe I'll take him out
for a late-night stroll.

658
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,790
Or should I say, roll.

659
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:53,130
I think you're drunk.

660
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,830
Mmm...

661
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,600
I've delivered
babies drunker...

662
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,830
conceived babies
much drunker.

663
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,300
Daddy!

664
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,470
Did I ever tell you
about the night we made Poe?

665
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,530
No.

666
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,440
I got in a fight with
some knucklehead over at Kings

667
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,810
and came to under
the pool table.

668
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,940
Now, Roz was sore at me
about something,

669
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,920
so she hadn't spoken to me
in about a week.

670
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,080
I thought, " Damn...

671
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,650
the woman finds out
I've been drinking and fighting,

672
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,150
she'll leave me."
Anyway, they take me home,

673
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
and she sees me
all messed up,

674
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,660
and she starts weeping,

675
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,500
and kissing me,
and kissing me,

676
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,100
and weeping,
and nine months later...

677
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,800
Poe.

678
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,570
Do you still love her?

679
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,520
Sweetheart...

680
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,350
let me tell you something.

681
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,990
When I met your mom...

682
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,970
men fought each other for
the privilege of speaking her name.

683
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,840
She was so pretty, it was
painful just to look at her.

684
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,040
And she could dance
almost as good as you.

685
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,410
But not quite.

686
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,350
No, not quite.

687
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,550
But holding Roz

688
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:25,450
was like holding
your favorite feather pillow.

689
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:28,520
The one you just
can't sleep without.

690
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,760
- And now?
- Well...

691
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,960
you know how it is
with feather pillows.

692
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,090
Over the years, they get
lumpy and deflated.

693
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,070
You have to fluff them up
all the time to keep them...

694
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,300
comme un pelochon.

695
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,330
- Daddy!
- (both laugh)

696
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,470
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin head.

697
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,850
Look who's up.

698
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,350
Do you know what time it is?

699
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,860
It's time for
you girls to be in bed.

700
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,120
- No, Daddy.
- Yes.

701
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,530
Your mama would kill me
if she found out I had you up.

702
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,120
I'll just finish my drink,
check on Tommy,

703
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,600
then I'm headed to bed myself.

704
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,900
Night, night owls.

705
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,730
Night, Daddy.

706
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,280

Eve? Where's Cisely?

717
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,970
Officer, I'm afraid
she might be hit by something.

718
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:27,600
Being like it is today,
there's bound to be accidents.

719
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,740
Mama, please!

720
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,210
Cisely! Oh God!

721
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,320
Oh thank God.

722
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,290
Thank God.

723
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,260
Why did you
run off like that?

724
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,690
You almost gave your mama
a heart attack!

725
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,030
Where the hell
did you go?!

726
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,660
I went to visit Daddy.

727
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,230
Then I went
to the beauty parlor.

728
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:54,800
You what?

729
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,680
I walked all the way
to Daddy's office,

730
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,050
and then I caught
the bus to Opal's.

731
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:15,150
I had to cross
the train tracks to get home.

732
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,290
And I'm alive, Mama.

733
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,320
I didn't get hit
by anything.

734
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,790
Roz: Come here, Cisely.

735
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,770
When I was your age,
I was just like you.

736
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,710
I thought I knew everything.

737
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,080
Now, even the things
I'm most familiar with

738
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,090
seem mysterious to me.

739
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,250
But I know I love you.

740
01:05:56,930 --> 01:06:01,460
And it's my job
to protect you as best I can.

741
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,770
If you disobey my orders,

742
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,740
or leave this house again, I swear
I'll lock you in your room.

743
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,840
Yes, Ma'am.

744
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,110
Go back to bed.

745
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:19,480
I'm waiting up
for your father tonight.

746
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,010
I don't want you
waiting up for him anymore.

747
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,540
But, Mama...

748
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,490
I'll say it one more time, Cisely.

749
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:33,920
I know you love your daddy.

750
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,330
And your daddy loves you.

751
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,400
I don't want you
waiting up for him anymore.

752
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,210
Cisely!

753
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,210
Did you hear me?

754
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,680
Yes, Ma'am.

755
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,250
But you don't understand him.

756
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,560
And you'll drive him
away from us!

757
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,160
I'll never forgive you.

758
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,290
If you drive him away...

759
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:17,800
(loud arguing)

760
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,510
Roz: I am sick...

761
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,550
You get yourself straight,
or you're out of here!

762
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,510
Mozelle:
Isn't it beautiful?

763
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,670
Julian:
You're beautiful.

764
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,980
Mozelle...

765
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:04,380
it's time for me to go.

766
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,620
I have to find my wife.

767
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,130
Mr. Grayraven, I told you
she's not coming back.

768
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,830
I have to find my wife
so that I can...

769
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,900
divorce her...

770
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,070
and marry you.

771
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,040
Oh, Julian...

772
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,780
it's enough that
you're here with me.

773
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,580
You have made me
so happy.

774
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,920
But you can't
possibly marry me.

775
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,820
I can't let that happen.

776
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:43,660
- Is it that you don't love me?
- No!

777
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,860
No, it's not that. It's...

778
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,590
bear with me.

779
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:53,800
I'm cursed.

780
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,900
I can't have children.

781
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,600
I'm barren.

782
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:04,250
You're not barren.

783
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,810
You're wounded...

784
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:12,420
here.

785
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,920
And it's here that
I'll plant seeds.

786
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,910
(distant honking,
tires screeching)

787
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,000
- (car crashing)
- (woman screaming)

788
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,890
We're free!

789
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,460
And tonight, we'll barbecue outside

790
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,030
- and have a picnic!
- I'm going outside!

791
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,600
C'est pas juste de fêter quand
I'enfant de quelqu'un est mort.

792
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,380
These children have been
in the house for weeks!

793
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:14,680
Go get Cisely. She hasn't
come down all morning.

794
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,980
I think she's still
mad at me.

795
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,950
Cisely!

796
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:25,120
It is not right to celebrate
when somebody's child is dead.

797
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,860
Well, whose child
was it anyway?

798
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,600
Dickey's boy.

799
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,500
Wake up, we're free!

800
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,510
We can go outside now.
Cisely!

801
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,440
Cisely: Go away.

802
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,910
Cisely!

803
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,070
Some other kid got hit.
We're free!

804
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,170
- Go away!
- Ow!

805
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,950
Oooh...

806
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,850
so that's what's
wrong with you.

807
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:54,420
Look, you think just 'cause
you got blood in your pants

808
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,360
you don't have
to act civilized no more?

809
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:57,360
Shut up!

810
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,260
Cisely's got her period.

811
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,390
I'm gonna tell Daddy.

812
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,330
(Cisely screams)

813
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:08,990
No!

814
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,560
Mama!

815
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,870
Cisely's trying to kill me.

816
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,920
Cisely's trying to kill me.

817
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,480
Help!

818
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,920
Mama!

819
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:34,630
- She's trying to kill me!
- Julian: Come on.

820
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,660
What happened?

821
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,320
I don't know what happened.
It's like she went crazy.

822
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,850
We thought she was having a seizure.
We were so scared.

823
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,590
Is it my fault, you think?
'Cause I hit her.

824
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:08,090
No, Roz. It's not your fault.
Let me look at her.

825
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,930
Louis.

826
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,970
She started her period.

827
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,600
- Did you know that?
- No.

828
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,470
Roz:
She didn't even tell me.

829
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:45,170
Go away, Daddy.
I don't want you here.

830
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,500
I just want to take your pulse
and your temperature, baby.

831
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,370
- Doctor stuff.
- No!

832
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,740
I don't want you
looking at me.

833
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:59,610
Okay.

834
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:03,550
I know a nice lady doctor
we can take you to.

835
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:05,780
Would you like that?

836
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,710
(humming "Amazing Grace")

837
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,900
Excuse me?
How much for this pineapple?

838
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:53,400
I said, how much
for this pineapple?

839
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,460
¢ 25.
You want it?

840
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,870
That's too much.

841
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:00,570
Man:
Hey! Arrê tez-la!

842
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,880
Bad girl.

843
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,580
Méchante fille!

844
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:17,020
Bad girl.

845
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,870
Eve: I'm going to beat you,
'cause you are a chicken!

846
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,980
She blames me for
not making you happy.

847
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,150
She thinks I'm driving you away.

848
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:51,490
She's a child, Roz.
Just give her time.

849
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,190
How much time, Louis?

850
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,070
It's already been two weeks.

851
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,700
She won't eat, she won't speak.

852
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,380
It's like she's sleepwalking.

853
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:14,110
Louis: This...

854
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,520
psychologist fellow
seems to think

855
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,990
you need kind of a...

856
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,890
vacation from us.

857
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,990
It's just a suggestion.

858
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:27,400
We'd never send you away
unless you wanted to go.

859
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,230
Listen...

860
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:39,200
whatever it is, we can
work it out together.

861
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,240
Everything's going to be
fine again. I promise.

862
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,250
I want to go.

863
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,750
What?

864
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,220
What did you say, baby?

865
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,230
I said I want to go.

866
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,370
It's all settled.

867
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,940
I talked to grand-mother...

868
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,740
and she just can't
wait to see you.

869
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,080
If you leave me
alone with them,

870
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,020
I'll die.

871
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,220
I'll die, Cisely.

872
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,050
What's wrong with you?

873
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,890
Why won't you tell me?

874
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,300
Is it me?

875
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,530
Is it something I did?

876
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,910
Why won't you talk to me?

877
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,810
Of course
it's not you, rabbit.

878
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,650
You're my only friend.

879
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,780
Then...

880
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:01,090
what is it?

881
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:04,580
Tell me. I promise
I won't tell anybody.

882
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,160
Do you remember the storm?

883
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:13,440
The day you cut your hair
and Mama hit you?

884
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,970
Did you hear Mama
and Daddy fight that night?

885
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,240
Yeah.

886
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:27,040
Part of it was about me...

887
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,780
and how he let me
visit him that day.

888
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:35,120
The other thing
they were fighting about...

889
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,820
was Matty Mereaux.

890
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,790
Mama knows about
Daddy and Matty?

891
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,400
Everybody knows.

892
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,740
She's been hanging around
his office in front of everyone.

893
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:55,300
You believe me now about
what happened at the party?

894
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,310
I believed you then.

895
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,950
Anyway...

896
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:09,050
I waited until I heard
Mama go upstairs.

897
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,790
I went downstairs.

898
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,270
I was afraid of
what she might have said.

899
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,800
I was afraid he would divorce us.

900
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:37,010
I wanted to make him
feel better.

901
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,990
I sat on his lap...

902
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,930
and I was scared.

903
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,980
I was trying to get away

904
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,360
and he was hugging me
and kissing me,

905
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:18,290
until I finally pushed him
away with my knee.

906
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,160
I must have hurt him
because...

907
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,090
he's never hit me.

908
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,630
Louis: Sorry...

909
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:33,540
Then I ran.

910
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:38,280
I'll kill him, Cisely.

911
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,010
I swear!

912
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,680
I'll kill him
for hurting you.

913
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,100
Bye bye, baby.

914
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:08,480
Roz: I'll be gone a week or so.
I want to get her settled in.

915
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,280
Bye, Poe.

916
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:28,690
Louis: I'll just drop them off.
I'll be back before dinner.

917
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,880
- Maybe he ran into traffic.
- It's Sunday.

918
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,060
He'll be back,

919
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,290
and so will Cisely.
I know she will.

920
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:39,530
Life is filled with goodbyes.
A million goodbyes.

921
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:42,060
And it hurts every time.

922
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:46,470
Sometimes, I feel like
I've lost so much,

923
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:49,970
I have to find
new things to lose.

924
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,920
All I know is, there must be
a divine point to it all,

925
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:56,750
and it's just over my head.

926
01:21:56,790 --> 01:22:01,490
When we die,
it will all come clear,

927
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,960
and we'll say,

928
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:06,960
"So that was
the damn point."

929
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:12,790
And sometimes I think there's no
point at all, and that's the point.

930
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:20,140
All I know is most people's lives
are a great disappointment to them.

931
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:24,610
And no one leaves this earth
without feeling terrible pain.

932
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:30,610
And if there is no divine
explanation at the end of it all,

933
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,760
well, that's sad.

934
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:40,630
How do you kill someone
with voodoo?

935
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,760
(Mozelle chuckles)

936
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,290
I almost forgot you was there.

937
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:52,060
I mean, do you just wish
real hard they were dead?

938
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,340
Or do you have to do
something special?

939
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,780
I suppose you put
some of their hair on a doll

940
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:02,010
and stick pins in it
or something. I don't know.

941
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,950
What makes you ask
a thing like that?

942
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,920
Nothing.

943
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,360
You must have been
thinking something

944
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,790
right before you were
thinking that.

945
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,820
What led you
to that particular thought?

946
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:18,530
I don't know.

947
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:24,210
Is there someone around here
that you're angry with?

948
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,800
Someone that you want dead?

949
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:31,310
- I'm going inside.
- You better tell me

950
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,510
what's on your mind.

951
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,950
You have five seconds.

952
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:44,080
Give me your hands.

953
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,100
Give them to me.

954
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,110
Go on and keep secrets
if you want to.

955
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:07,120
I won't squeeze it
out of you.

956
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:12,090
But you can't kill with voodoo.
That's ridiculous.

957
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,240
Hey, Red. Didn't mean
to startle you.

958
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,580
- Hi, Mr. Mereaux.
- Hi.

959
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:48,210
- How's your family?
- Everybody's fine.

960
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,880
- How's Matty?
- Same as always.

961
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,190
Salty and sweet.

962
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,280
- What are you looking for?
- H umm...

963
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,590
- apples.
- Apples?

964
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,120
You know, you just
walked right past them.

965
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,800
Oh, thanks.

966
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,210
Lord have mercy.

967
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:24,840
- Mr. Mereaux?
- Yes, Eve.

968
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,560
You're still teaching?

969
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:33,150
Sure, darling. Down at Xavier,
in New Orleans.

970
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,630
Been there for years.

971
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,760
- That's a long drive.
- Yeah.

972
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,430
Sometimes if the weather's bad,
I just stay on campus.

973
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:44,000
But usually,
I try to get home,

974
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,970
so Matty don't get
too lonely.

975
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:48,980
Matty don't seem
like the lonely type.

976
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,640
No...

977
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,410
I guess not.

978
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,420
You must get home real late.

979
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,780
Well, when you get home.

980
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,760
Sometimes.

981
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,760
So does my daddy.

982
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:05,780
Every night.
My mama gets real lonely.

983
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:08,760
But then, she is
the lonely type.

984
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,230
Not like Daddy and Matty.

985
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,540
Well...

986
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,910
bye.

987
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,480
Excuse me.

988
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:43,920
Méchante petite fille.

989
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,940
I remember you,
pineapple thief.

990
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:54,010
Hi.

991
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,140
I've been looking for you.

992
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:59,940
Only people who look for me
got a good reason.

993
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,780
- I got a good reason.
- You got money?

994
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,850
- $20.
- 20...

995
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:08,790
let me see.

996
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:12,690
Give me.

997
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:19,430
You stole that money
from your daddy?

998
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:24,070
- Why you think I stole it?
- You didn't get it laying bricks.

999
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,470
Come. Follow me.

1000
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,640
Eve: Where are we going?

1001
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:37,920
My office.

1002
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,260
Are you related
to Mozelle Batiste?

1003
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,240
I'm her niece.

1004
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,800
- And she's the one you want dead.
- No, someone else.

1005
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,000
Mmm... too bad.

1006
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,980
Tant pis.

1007
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,000
Why you want this person dead?

1008
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:39,980
- Pour quoi faire?
- Raison privée.

1009
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,380
Did this person...
harm you?

1010
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,480
Others in my family.

1011
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:52,150
I will give you something
to protect you and your family.

1012
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,790
I want him dead!

1013
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,500
For certain?
You are sure?

1014
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,600
Yes, Ma'am.

1015
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,870
People have a way of dying
at their own speed.

1016
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,710
But I will see
what I can do.

1017
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:13,970
I will need some hair...

1018
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,250
from the head of this person.

1019
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:18,850
I brought you some
from a comb.

1020
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,980
I hope it's enough, though.

1021
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:24,860
Well... eh bien...

1022
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:27,490
woman, don't be
too weak.

1023
01:30:27,530 --> 01:30:29,900
You come back Thursday night,

1024
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:32,830
and we'll see.

1025
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:34,630
We'll see.

1026
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:19,400
Get the hell off my property
before I cook you and eat you!

1027
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:27,550
Is that you, pineapple thief?

1028
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:31,750
Come.

1029
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,670
I thought you was one
of those town kids

1030
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,940
who was bothering me.

1031
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,510
Is he dead yet?

1032
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:00,280
How could he be dead?

1033
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:04,010
- You didn't give me the doll.
- What doll?

1034
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:07,390
I didn't say nothing to you
about no doll.

1035
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,190
The voodoo doll.

1036
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:11,630
I didn't make you
no voodoo doll.

1037
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:14,290
I made you a wax coffin.

1038
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:17,700
I put his hair inside
the mouth of a snake,

1039
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:20,430
and buried it
in the graveyard.

1040
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:25,370
- He should be dead by now.
- I thought I had to do something,

1041
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:27,670
like stick pins in it or...

1042
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,640
You did something!

1043
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,840
You brought me his hair.

1044
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:36,580
- And you paid me $20.
- But...

1045
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:39,610
I wanted it.

1046
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,180
I wanted to have it.
I need it!

1047
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:44,490
Oh God.

1048
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:50,530
Where...

1049
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:53,260
- where did you bury it?
- Down there.

1050
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,860
Where all them Batistes
are buried.

1051
01:33:56,910 --> 01:34:02,370
But I don't think
you'll find it.

1052
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:06,210
You said
you wanted him dead.

1053
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,620
You said you was certain.

1054
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,090
(woman laughs hysterically)

1055
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,080
(loud music plays)

1056
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,930
Daddy!

1057
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:07,370
Oh Daddy, I'm so happy
to see you.

1058
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,040
What are you doing over here
at this time of night?

1059
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,850
What's wrong?
Is it grand-mére?

1060
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,580
H umm...

1061
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:17,610
Daddy, let's go home.

1062
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:20,320
Please, I want you
to come home with me.

1063
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,260
Of course, baby.
You walked all the way over here?

1064
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:28,790
- What's wrong?
- Man: You've been busted, Doc.

1065
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:30,860
The last one's on me.

1066
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,870
Go outside while I say
good night to Miss Mereaux.

1067
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,270
Hurry up.

1068
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:20,610
Oh, hey, Mr. Mereaux.

1069
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:43,440
Hey, baby.

1070
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,840
Hey, just in time to have
a last one with us.

1071
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:53,540
- I don't think so, Louis.
- What's wrong? You crazy?

1072
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:57,450
- You fucking my wife?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1073
01:36:57,490 --> 01:36:59,720
- You're fucking her?
- You're drunk.

1074
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,520
You like her?

1075
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,650
She's very beautiful.

1076
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,920
You fucking her?

1077
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,760
Matty and I are old friends.

1078
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,730
You know that
as well as anyone.

1079
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:13,330
I trusted you, Louis.

1080
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,970
And you've been
fucking Matty.

1081
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:22,540
I loved you, Louis.

1082
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,880
I love you, Lenny.

1083
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,680
Come on, Daddy,
let's go home.

1084
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:30,710
That's right. You're drunk.
Let me take you home.

1085
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,550
Listen...

1086
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:36,150
you so much as speak
to my wife again...

1087
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,420
and I will kill you.

1088
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,660
Do you understand?

1089
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:46,230
Bartender:
Take it outside.

1090
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:48,360
Let's get the hell
out of here.

1091
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:09,850
You go home sleep off
that whiskey, old man.

1092
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,920
You'll apologize
to me tomorrow.

1093
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:16,990
You speak to her again,
you're dead, Louis.

1094
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:20,160
Come on, Daddy, let's go home.

1095
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,970
Please.

1096
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,030
Okay, baby.
Night, Matty.

1097
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,670
No!

1098
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:52,500
Eve: Daddy!

1099
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:54,160
No!

1100
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:15,080
All: "Our Father,
Who art in Heaven,

1101
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,750
hallowed be Thy name.

1102
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:19,850
Thy kingdom come,

1103
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,160
thy will be done

1104
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,830
on Earth as it is
in Heaven..."

1105
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,160
No!

1106
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:36,600
"...as we forgive those
who trespassed against us.

1107
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:39,810
And lead us not
into temptation,

1108
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:42,550
but deliver us from evil,

1109
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:44,520
for Thine is the kingdom,

1110
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:47,490
and the power,
and the glory

1111
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,460
forever and ever."
Amen.

1112
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:35,130
(Roz softly hums)

1113
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,870
Last night, I had a dream
that I was flying.

1114
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,580
It was such a fine feeling.

1115
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:32,150
But in the corner of my eye,
I saw a woman drowning

1116
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:36,190
in the very same air
that was keeping me afloat.

1117
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:39,500
And I knew, without looking,
it was me.

1118
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,200
Should I save her?

1119
01:41:43,410 --> 01:41:46,000
And then I heard
Louis' voice saying,

1120
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:47,980
"Don't look back."

1121
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,800
So I kept on flying...

1122
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,320
and I let her drown.

1123
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:02,380
When I woke up...

1124
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:06,880
I told Julian
I would marry him.

1125
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,900
He wouldn't have it
any other way.

1126
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:17,430
Maybe God will be kind
and allow me to go with him.

1127
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:20,340
I'm so tired of being
left alone.

1128
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,020
Your daddy gave me
a message for you.

1129
01:42:33,090 --> 01:42:37,150
"Tell Eve I still
owe her a dance."

1130
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:59,800
"To Mozelle."

1131
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:11,720
"Mozelle, it's been two hours
since we spoke

1132
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:15,050
and finally, I feel
calm enough to write this.

1133
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:19,460
I realize that your accusations,
however shocking and cruel,

1134
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,660
stem from some
weakness in myself

1135
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:25,060
that allows you to believe
the worst of me.

1136
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,130
As you and I know,

1137
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:31,200
I'm just a small-town doctor
pushing aspirin to the elderly.

1138
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:35,440
But to a certain type
of woman, I'm a hero.

1139
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,970
I need to be a hero
sometimes.

1140
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:42,380
That's my weakness.
That much is true.

1141
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:46,380
But how, Mozelle, could I have
sunken your estimation

1142
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:49,120
to the leechy depths
where you would accuse me

1143
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:53,190
of deliberately abusing
my most beloved child?

1144
01:44:53,230 --> 01:44:56,490
I am guilty in the sense
that I adore her,

1145
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:59,700
and I allowed her
to adore me.

1146
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:02,100
It was a sweet
indulgence,

1147
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:04,070
but nothing
in her behavior

1148
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:07,100
prepared me for what happened
the night of the storm.

1149
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,410
Roz and I had
a terrible fight

1150
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:13,240
and I guess
it was inevitable.

1151
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:18,920
I knew Cisely could never sleep
through a fight like that.

1152
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:22,220
So, I wasn't surprised
when she came downstairs.

1153
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:25,020
Maybe I was even
waiting for her.

1154
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:28,360
I let myself wallow
and feel comforted.

1155
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,590
Mozelle, I swear...

1156
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,440
the first kiss was
the sweetest kiss

1157
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:41,740
a daughter could give
her drunk, guilt-ridden father.

1158
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,080
A kiss of redemption.

1159
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:50,010
And the next moment,
it had gone wrong.

1160
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:54,350
From my scotch haze,
it took me a second to realize

1161
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,480
that my daughter was
kissing me like a woman.

1162
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:59,860
This is where
I blame myself.

1163
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,430
I was so startled
that I hit her

1164
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:05,300
and she fell to the floor.

1165
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:09,400
The look she gave me
almost stopped my heart.

1166
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,640
And I knew I had lost her.

1167
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:16,870
Mozelle, I would give my life
to have that moment back.

1168
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:19,850
I would hold her and comfort her.

1169
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,340
We would talk through her confusion
and I'd put her to bed,

1170
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:26,250
with the boundaries
between us intact.

1171
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:29,850
I love her
more than my life.

1172
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:33,330
I hope that one day,
she can forgive me.

1173
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,130
I felt I could not
betray her again

1174
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:39,070
by telling you or Roz.

1175
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,690
Forgive me."

1176
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,470
Eve: Liar!

1177
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,800
Red?

1178
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,810
You lied to me about Daddy.

1179
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:51,570
You lied!

1180
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:54,840
Daddy wrote Mozelle
a letter!

1181
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,220
- You lied!
- I wasn't lying.

1182
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:00,880
I believed you...

1183
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:03,620
and I hated him.

1184
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:07,660
I hated him
for you.

1185
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:19,200
He hurt me, Eve.

1186
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:23,770
He hurt me so badly...

1187
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:27,210
I wanted to die.

1188
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:37,520
Tell me what happened.

1189
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,490
Please.

1190
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:44,120
I have to know.

1191
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:46,190
I can't.

1192
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:55,900
Please.

1193
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:38,810
I don't know what happened.

1194
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:42,350
I don't know.

1195
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:49,100
- It's okay.
- I can't.

1196
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:55,090
- I can't.
- It's okay.

1197
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,540
Adult Eve: Memory
is a selection of images,

1198
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:46,780
some elusive...

1199
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:50,160
others printed
indelibly on the brain.

1200
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:53,650
Each image
is like a thread,

1201
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:55,790
each thread woven together

1202
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:59,030
to make a tapestry
of intricate texture.

1203
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:01,370
And the tapestry
tells a story...

1204
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,870
and the story is our past.
