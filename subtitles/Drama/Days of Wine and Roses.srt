1
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,884
Wait a minute!
I got another idea.

2
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,886
- Pete's two brings it to six. Not enough.
- This one.

3
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:29,125
- She's a big dame, but in proportion.
- Has she got class?

4
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,965
In every way.

5
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,731
- Seven ought to do it. I'll try it.
- Do it.

6
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,565
Excuse me.

7
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,843
Louie, hit me again?

8
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,729
Hello? Is this Betty...?

9
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,770
Is this Betty?

10
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:02,211
Oh, well, I tell you, my name is Joe Clay.

11
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:06,241
My name is Joe Clay, a friend of
Abe Quine's. We're in the executive suite.

12
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,244
It's kind of-
Yeah, Abe Quine.

13
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:12,042
It's kind of noisy, but he told me
you are a very lovely girl, Betty.

14
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:13,692
And you...

15
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:17,129
And he suggested that...
Well, you know...

16
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,330
...you like to have a good time.

17
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,643
Anyway, my agency
is throwing a party...

18
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:25,532
...or rather we're inviting people
for a party...

19
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:28,127
...on Prince Harun Badul's yacht...

20
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:32,286
...and Abe suggested that you might be
a very welcome addition.

21
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,292
What, honey?

22
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:38,651
No, not Abe Badul, it's Prince Harun Badul.

23
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,929
It's his party on his yacht.

24
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,922
Yes, he's a real prince, dear.

25
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,811
Yeah.

26
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,486
I thought you would. Fine.

27
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:53,044
Well, it's berth 23,
Saint Francis Yacht Club, 6:30.

28
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:56,091
Right?
Okay, and we'll have a launch there.

29
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,608
All right, bye-bye now.

30
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,412
Magic time.

31
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:15,686
Here comes number seven.
Let's cast off.

32
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,491
You're late.

33
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:35,492
You're dressed wrong.

34
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,009
It's supposed to be a cocktail dress.
You know, something peekaboo.

35
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,051
To, you know, sparkle a little.
You call that peekaboo?

36
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:43,646
Let's go.

37
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,252
Hey, you, wait a minute.

38
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,369
Hey, you!
Wait a-

39
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:38,093
Dumb broad.
Come on, girls, come on.

40
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,686
Hey, you.

41
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,366
Listen, who-?

42
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,569
You must be the new man
from the agency.

43
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,724
Yes, sir, Joe Clay.
You're Mr. -?

44
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,246
Mr. Trayner.

45
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,564
- I see you've already met my secretary.
- Well, not officially.

46
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,611
- He was much too busy.
- Say, these are fine.

47
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:57,083
- Thank you.
- Just fine and dandy.

48
00:05:57,253 --> 00:06:00,370
Well, hello there.

49
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:41,290
Can I buy you a drink?

50
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:43,768
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't drink.

51
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:47,852
Look...

52
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:51,210
...I'm sorry about mistaking you
for one of the other girls.

53
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:53,364
So you're the new public relations man.

54
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,091
- Yeah.
- What happened to Eddie?

55
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,411
Eddie quit.

56
00:06:57,573 --> 00:07:00,485
We liked him.
Why'd he quit?

57
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:06,809
Well, a little matter of personal integrity.

58
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:14,327
Eddie didn't feel that getting dates
for potentates was part of public relations.

59
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,364
But isn't it?

60
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,530
Well, there's a name for it,
but it's not public relations.

61
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:25,242
Well, whatever it is,
you seem to do it very well.

62
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,171
One.

63
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,965
- Four.
- You counted twice here!

64
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,852
Wait a minute,
there's only four girls. We had seven!

65
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:49,892
Six- Wait a- Hey, don't move out,
we've got two girls missing here.

66
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,850
Wait a minute, there's two-

67
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,447
Two of my girls are missing up there!

68
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:58,483
Two of the young ladies
are not quite ready to leave.

69
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:01,292
- Not quite ready.
- I guess I'm to be congratulated...

70
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:04,604
- ... on a job well done, huh?
- Well done, well done.

71
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,523
Everybody here?

72
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,605
Hi.

73
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,492
Mr. Trayner isn't here.

74
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,928
That's luck.
You're the one I came to see.

75
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,051
Look, I felt we should be friends, so...

76
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,692
- Hello there?
- Excuse me.

77
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,923
I have to meet Mr. Trayner at a meeting.

78
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:30,245
We sort of got started on the wrong foot.
It was sort of my...

79
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:36,171
- Anyway, I brought a peace offering.
- Why?

80
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:40,328
Why? Well, because...

81
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:49,927
Now, look, we're gonna be working
together, sort of, huh?

82
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:53,881
I mean, from- I'll be up
to see the boss from time to time.

83
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,613
Look, Mr. Clay-
That is your name, isn't it?

84
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:59,082
Mr. Trayner is the one you have to please.

85
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:02,006
He seems very happy
with what you've done so far.

86
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:05,927
- Supposing I wanted to please you?
- There's no reason for you to please me.

87
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,044
Peanut brittle.

88
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:15,162
Look, you're forcing me to be rude.
I hate peanut brittle.

89
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,527
Excuse me.

90
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:19,924
- Good night, Gladys.
- Good night, Miss Arnesen.

91
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:27,889
You like peanut brittle?

92
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,971
Down?

93
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:26,009
Getting back to what people do
for a living, can I ask a question...

94
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:27,765
...that might embarrass you?

95
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:30,648
What spec...?

96
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:34,966
What qualifications do you have for a job
that allows you to sit around all day...

97
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,931
...and chat with the boss?
I heard about your job.

98
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,288
Maybe answer a few personal letters
for him...

99
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,250
...and accompany him to parties?

100
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,484
Spend half your working day reading...

101
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,850
...while typists who get less money
than you do all the work?

102
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:51,287
That reminds me, I forgot my book.

103
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,848
She always carries that book.

104
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:08,763
I'll tell you what special qualifications
you have. You're pretty.

105
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:12,130
That's what you have.
That old lech loves to have you around...

106
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:15,365
...to look at and lean on.
When he's drunk, like last night.

107
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:20,243
And who knows what else. That's
what special qualifications you have.

108
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,411
Listen.

109
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,447
I am sorry, and I shouldn't have said that.

110
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:49,446
I came up here to try and be friends.

111
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:52,491
I was gonna ask you
to have dinner with me.

112
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,291
Peanut brittle?

113
00:12:56,453 --> 00:13:00,969
I think you must be the silliest man
I've ever met. Peanut brittle?

114
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:03,887
Well, I guess you're right.
Let's forget it.

115
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,004
- Night.
- Good night.

116
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,325
Mr. Clay?

117
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:48,163
I thought you were going to
ask me to dinner.

118
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,689
- Well, I was-
- Well, why don't you?

119
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,843
I mean, my board meeting
won't be over till 7:30...

120
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:59,210
...so I wouldn't have time to change
or anything, but-

121
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,092
It would have to be someplace
kind of casual.

122
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:09,611
I know just the spot. Place Pigalle.
I'll meet you there at 7:30, you'll love it.

123
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:13,127
- Okay.
-7:30.

124
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:29,446
At a board meeting!Can you imagine,
with all those old jowly men staring at me?

125
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,286
Mr. Trayner says,
"I couldn't get along without her.

126
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:36,162
She's there when I need her, especially
when I've had a couple too many.

127
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,210
Takes care of me like a mother. "

128
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:43,401
And then he gives me one of those
special proprietary hugs of his...

129
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:46,532
And I suddenly realized
I owe you an apology.

130
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,770
Oh, I'm just as bad as you are.

131
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:53,529
I guess everybody swallows his pride
once in a while, on account of his job.

132
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:58,285
I had no business saying that to you
in the first place.

133
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,728
Hit me again.
Not you.

134
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:05,532
- Anything for the lady?
- No, nothing.

135
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:11,486
- What do you got against booze, anyway?
- I just don't much see the point in it.

136
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,604
Point?
Well, it makes you feel good.

137
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:16,082
I already feel good.
I don't like the taste.

138
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,925
- What do you like?
- Chocolate.

139
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:19,606
- Chocolate?
- Chocolate.

140
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,003
I'm practically nutty about it.

141
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,129
Wait a minute, hold everything.

142
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,448
- What did you do?
- Oh, you'll see.

143
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,889
- I think we should order, don't you?
- In a few minutes.

144
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,125
Kirsten Arnesen.

145
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:42,410
No wonder you're tough to get along with.
You're not even American.

146
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,728
Ever drive down the peninsula
toward San Mateo?

147
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,451
Arnesen Nursery.
That's us. That was us.

148
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,683
I just couldn't take it.

149
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:55,050
Oh, my father's a wonderful man,
good man.

150
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:57,727
But I kept thinking to myself:

151
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:00,805
"You're pretty. You're pretty,
and here you are. "

152
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,282
Oh, girls know when they're pretty.

153
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:07,810
There I was, blushing unseen,
wasting my sweetness on the desert air.

154
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,085
Gray's "Elegy. "

155
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,692
- Did you get that out of this book?
- Not this one.

156
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:17,926
That's volume Je-La.
Gray's out of volume Go-Ja.

157
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:27,082
World Library of Great Literature.
Volume 5, Je to La-

158
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,572
Je to La. Je-La.

159
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,962
Father gave me those
for high school graduation.

160
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,328
He said if I read from Ab-Bu to Ya-Zu...

161
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,927
...it'd be the equivalent
of a college education.

162
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:41,285
Je-La, that puts you about the middle
of your sophomore year.

163
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,841
- Oh, no, thank you, I-
- No, that's all right.

164
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:49,608
- But I-
- It's special, for you. It's chocolate. Try it.

165
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,642
It's good. It is.

166
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,882
- Very.
- Yeah. See what I mean?

167
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,362
Brandy Alexander, they call that.

168
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:08,085
Say, now.

169
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,451
Would you wait a minute?

170
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,650
Oh, look, Joe.
It's more beautiful than ever tonight.

171
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,132
- Yeah.
- You know something?

172
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:31,523
You were right about that brandy thing.

173
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,888
- Alexander.
- About it making me feel good.

174
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,408
- Oh, yeah it would, you chicken.
- I feel wonderful.

175
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:39,406
You don't feel like asking me up
for a cup of coffee, or-

176
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,928
Some other time, Joe, do you mind?

177
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,931
I'm not ready to go up yet.
Wanna walk down to the Bay?

178
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,612
Why not?

179
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,649
You do very good work.

180
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:06,010
Well, there goes another boatload
out to the prince's yacht.

181
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:09,404
Another load of actresses.

182
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:12,764
I don't see how
you can drink like that...

183
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,208
...right out of the bottle.
It must taste awful.

184
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:20,208
Well, anything worth having
is worth suffering for. Isn't it?

185
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:21,932
I guess so.

186
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:27,604
Oh, I like to watch the water.

187
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:31,009
If you look close, it's filthy...

188
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,850
...but I like to look further out,
where it's clean.

189
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,445
You know what I think?

190
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:41,321
I think I watch the water because...

191
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:45,125
...I expect a sea monster to come up
out of there someday...

192
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:48,569
...and carry me down to the ocean caves.

193
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,367
Mom and Dad are a club act.

194
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,285
You know, I mean songs and dances...

195
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:58,571
...and snappy patter.

196
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:03,692
Old-time vaudeville. They're in some
loud joint in Vegas, right this minute.

197
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,332
Are they good?

198
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:11,201
You know, they were on Ed Sullivan
a couple years ago.

199
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,126
But you didn't like that kind of life.

200
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:21,121
No, I wanted something steady.
Something with a little class.

201
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,046
Like the Trayner Drilling account. Class.

202
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,727
Don't hate yourself.
It's something you've gotta do.

203
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:30,123
It's part of your job.

204
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,084
I wanna be a public relations man,
not a pimp.

205
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:42,564
My job is supposed to be to advise people
how to relate to the public, you know?

206
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:47,488
How to make the good
that my client does known...

207
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,851
...and how to help him
find ways to do good...

208
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:56,131
...and benefit others as well as himself.

209
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:01,730
Be a garbage man,
or some eunuch in a harem.

210
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,206
I'm gonna tell the agency, I tell you.

211
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,331
So I burden you with it.
Well, that's great.

212
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,890
I don't mind.

213
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,965
Short story.

214
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,449
Man meets girl.

215
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,331
Beautiful.

216
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:27,449
Sweet.

217
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,452
Nice.

218
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:33,126
Much too nice for him,
I'll tell you.

219
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:36,842
Only kind of girl
you really should bother about.

220
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,087
Finally, after...

221
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,651
...numerous strategical blunders...

222
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,647
...he manages to get a date.

223
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,725
And he walks her down to the Bay,
under the stars...

224
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,886
...and he gets himself loaded
and he cries on her shoulder like a baby.

225
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,884
Some lover, huh?

226
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:59,692
Joe, I'm enjoying being here with you.

227
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:03,846
After all, you've helped me avoid my
apartment for the longest possible time.

228
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,368
That's an accomplishment in itself,
you know.

229
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,843
The roach kingdom.
The whole building, the whole block.

230
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:13,210
If you don't leave food out
for the roaches, you can't get in.

231
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,889
They just pick you up and carry you out
into the street and change the lock.

232
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:20,005
Roach kingdom.

233
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:26,124
You know, sometimes I come down here
at night alone...

234
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:31,242
...and look at the water,
just to keep from going home.

235
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:32,687
Yeah.

236
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:35,728
Well, you can't come down here
alone at night!

237
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:39,124
This place,
it's crawling with all kinds of oddballs.

238
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:42,490
Oh, they walk by me
real slow sometimes and stare...

239
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:45,850
...but they don't do anything.
I don't know why.

240
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,810
That's- You're-

241
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,331
You know something...

242
00:21:52,493 --> 00:21:54,882
...I dreamt one time they murdered me.

243
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:59,373
Over there, behind those pilings.

244
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:02,766
And my father came all the way in
from the peninsula...

245
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:06,243
...in his pickup truck
to take my body home.

246
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,686
And all the way home, he talked.

247
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:14,128
Talked a blue streak, all the way home.

248
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,248
But I was dead and I couldn't hear him.
Couldn't answer him.

249
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,410
The strange thing is...

250
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:25,566
...my father doesn't talk.

251
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,008
Oh, he used to talk to my mother.

252
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:31,809
When I was a little girl he'd talk to her
in a low, low voice...

253
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,964
...after I'd gone to bed at night.

254
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:39,964
But in the daytime
they hardly talked at all. They had a...

255
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:44,763
...very private love affair.

256
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:47,841
Their favorite toast to each other was:

257
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:52,807
In Norwegian, that means
"Together in heaven. "

258
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,445
Get the lilt.

259
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,011
"Together in heaven. "

260
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,086
They meant it too.

261
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,931
After Mama died,
he was more silent than ever.

262
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:15,373
Almost as though he'd gone with her.

263
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,290
Oh, well.

264
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:22,444
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. "

265
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:29,330
Little coop-
Coup de gräce.

266
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,287
Would you believe it's 2:00?

267
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:41,765
- Time does not exist in the ocean.
- Well, it will in the office tomorrow.

268
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:45,407
I commend thee to the deep.

269
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:55,128
They are not long,
the days of wine and roses:

270
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,212
Out of a misty dream
our path emerges for a while...

271
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:03,253
...then closes within a dream.

272
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:21,688
I guess we should be getting back, huh?

273
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,684
- He come in?
- Yes, sir.

274
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:43,371
Rad, come in.

275
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:46,288
Trayner's been trying
to get you all morning.

276
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,092
This is one of those mornings
I couldn't make it.

277
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:51,847
Those things happen.
He's praising you to the skies.

278
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:54,129
- Thanks.
- That prince what's-his-name...

279
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:58,047
...was so pleased Trayner wants to throw
another party tomorrow night.

280
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:00,643
- Tomorrow night?
- Better call him.

281
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,850
- Congrats on a very happy client.
- Look, Rad, I better-

282
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:06,971
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Shoot.

283
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,405
I don't know how to start it.

284
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:12,962
I know the Trayner thing has to be done...

285
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,727
...arrangements like this
have to be made, but-

286
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:18,123
But you'd rather not.

287
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:21,046
- I realize it's part of my job-
- Makes you feel dirty.

288
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:24,808
I don't blame you for a minute,
but I don't know what I can do about it.

289
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,168
Unless we put another man on there.

290
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,530
Could do that.

291
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,604
Some of the boys don't mind that.

292
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,162
Wait. I don't mean I can't do it.
I can do it.

293
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,211
That isn't what I meant.
It isn't that. I just, I...

294
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:42,082
You'd rather not.
Well, let's see now.

295
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:44,164
Look, not that I won't do it.

296
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,803
This is the first account of any size
that you guys have given me.

297
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:50,612
I think I've got a flash.

298
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,852
Nell. Get me Roger Acton, will you?

299
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:57,845
That's right.

300
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:02,322
If Roger goes along with this,
we've got your problem solved...

301
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:06,372
- ... to everyone's advantage.
- I don't want this to look like...

302
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,206
...complaining or-
I just started on the account.

303
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,443
- Roger may take a dim view of this-
- No, no.

304
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,764
He'll admire your integrity, if anything.
Believe me-

305
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:18,813
Yes?
Thanks, Nell.

306
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:21,646
Rog.
Got a little prob here with Joe.

307
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,486
You know, we put him
on that Trayner Drilling account.

308
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:27,531
Yeah. Says he heard
Trayner was delighted with you.

309
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,763
Well, here's the prob, Rog.

310
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:34,249
That's it exactly.
Says, "Same deal as Eddie, huh?"

311
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,325
He knows someone's got to, Rog...

312
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:40,008
...but let me pull something out of a hat
and we'll see if it hops.

313
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:41,970
- Joe?
- Yeah?

314
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,452
- Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:45,888
- Come on up.
- Yeah.

316
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:49,807
- What in the world are you carrying?
- It's a few things to go with dinner.

317
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:51,645
Here, I'll help you.

318
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:54,811
- I was afraid you'd forgotten.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

319
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:57,282
I was busy having a couple
with my new client.

320
00:26:57,453 --> 00:26:59,648
- Your new- You didn't!
- Yeah.

321
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:02,646
- You're off the Trayner Drilling account?
- Yeah, I am.

322
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,804
- You're a man of principle.
- Yeah.

323
00:27:06,253 --> 00:27:07,845
Of course, I... Well.

324
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:11,289
I may wish I was back
getting girls for Trayner before it's over.

325
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,290
This new guy, Ballefoy? Murder.

326
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:16,684
Drinks with both hands. Can't keep up
or communicate. Thank you.

327
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:18,252
- Hey, this is it, huh?
- Yeah.

328
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:20,131
This is the roach kingdom?

329
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:23,046
- You're feeling pretty good tonight.
- You'll catch up.

330
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,283
Brandy Alexander.
I got all the makings.

331
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,284
The brandy and the crème de cacao.

332
00:27:27,453 --> 00:27:30,570
We got all the natural accouterments
to a home-cooked meal.

333
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:36,651
- You know what's in there?
- No.

334
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:41,371
A chocolate cake.

335
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,888
With chocolate icing.

336
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:47,407
And we have champagne
to go with the meal.

337
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:51,691
And for me, plain, unassuming,
solid citizen-type man...

338
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,765
...of principle that I am,
the holy comforts of soda...

339
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:57,128
...and where is it?
Scotch.

340
00:27:58,293 --> 00:28:00,409
This is the roach kingdom, huh?

341
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:04,123
This is the place where
the roaches reign supreme?

342
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:07,888
- Yes.
- Well, we'll just see about that.

343
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,647
- This is war.
- You really are too much.

344
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:13,247
I just don't believe...

345
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:15,722
...in letting subversive elements
take over.

346
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,531
Man of principle, I salute you.

347
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:20,207
Salute me with that stuff.
Go easy on the soda.

348
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:22,523
Cockroaches.
Come out, wherever you are.

349
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:25,082
Here we go.
You're gonna go to cockroach heaven.

350
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,963
- You know something funny?
- What?

351
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:36,284
I didn't really quit the Trayner account.

352
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,570
- But I-
- Oh, I'm off it, all right.

353
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:43,329
I just hinted that it was a little distasteful
and they took me right off, but-

354
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,413
- Well?
- Well, what bothers me is...

355
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:50,009
...that I didn't demand to be taken off it...

356
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:53,245
...or even ask to be taken off it,
I just hinted, you know.

357
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:57,930
I mean, I practically apologized for even
hinting. What do you think of that?

358
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:03,051
Well... Well, Joe, at least you hinted.

359
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:06,842
Most people in your position wouldn't
even hint. They'd be too insecure.

360
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,731
Here.

361
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:13,289
To men of principle,
wherever they may be.

362
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,886
- Oh, hi, Dottie.
- What, are you spraying in there?

363
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,891
Spray- Oh, yes. We are.

364
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,283
Oh, well, now, you ought
not to do that.

365
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:26,809
You get them all stirred up,
and what's the good? You made a mess.

366
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,533
You've gotta think
about other people, you know.

367
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:33,811
Well, I mean, look- I don't like to
complain, but, I mean, this is ridiculous.

368
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:37,204
They don't bother anybody.
They don't destroy anything.

369
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:39,443
You leave them alone,
they leave you alone.

370
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,410
Lock up what you don't want
crawled over.

371
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:44,804
But you start spraying stuff
on the walls, and look at the mess.

372
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:48,329
- What are you trying to do up there?
- Somebody spraying up there?

373
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:51,212
- You know what you're doing?
- I'm choking to death.

374
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,126
- What are you doing?
- You just come in off the prairie?

375
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,968
People living in apartment buildings
gotta learn to leave roaches alone.

376
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,409
Well, look, you should see
what they're doing to us up here.

377
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:04,724
- This is ridiculous.
- What's the matter with you people?

378
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:11,690
Now what am I supposed to do?

379
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,413
I mean, you've got them all mad.

380
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:18,407
- They're all going crazy, you know?
- I don't know.

381
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:20,609
I'm sorry.

382
00:30:29,973 --> 00:30:31,929
Didn't I tell you?

383
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:37,809
You've undermined the whole
base of metabolism of the building.

384
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,970
I'm warning you, Joe, you better-

385
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:44,124
What-?

386
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:46,249
You better- You-

387
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,131
What?

388
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:51,126
You better grow a beard
and move out of town...

389
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:55,525
...because those roaches saw you...

390
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:57,763
...and the word-

391
00:30:57,933 --> 00:30:59,810
What?

392
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:08,373
The word- The word'll spread,
and if they ever track you down-

393
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:12,525
What?

394
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,533
You'll be a goner.

395
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:55,850
Oh, darling.

396
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:37,005
- How do I look?
- Gorgeous.

397
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:38,925
And guilty?

398
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:50,447
- Kirsty.
- Daddy, I brought somebody to meet you.

399
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,047
I know it's late,
and I'm sorry to wake you up...

400
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,488
...but it was so important
it couldn't wait.

401
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:57,211
Come in.

402
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:03,689
- Daddy, this is Joe Clay.
- Sir.

403
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:07,289
Sorry we woke you up, Mr. Arnesen.

404
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:10,412
Let's go sit in the kitchen, Kirsty.

405
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,362
The kitchen is Daddy's favorite room.

406
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,888
I know this is kind
of a funny time of night...

407
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:20,012
...to be introducing people, Daddy,
but Joe and I...

408
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:24,325
Well, I was anxious for him to meet you,
and we were out driving and-

409
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,087
You know how I do things
on the spur of the moment.

410
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:29,813
- I hope you don't mind us waking you.
- Have a seat.

411
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,804
Oh, thank you.

412
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,725
How have you been, Kirsty?

413
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:38,329
That's Daddy's way of letting me know
I haven't called him this week.

414
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:40,802
I've been very busy, Daddy.

415
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:47,052
- What kind of work you do?
- Public relations, sir.

416
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,408
Public relations?

417
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:52,167
You know, Daddy, it's-
Well, it's hard to explain.

418
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:56,326
Well, I suppose you might say my job is...

419
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:01,613
...to sort of help my client
create a public image.

420
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:05,363
Well, for an example...

421
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:08,412
...let's say my client, Corporation x...

422
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,883
...does some good.
Something of benefit to the public...

423
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:16,843
...or something that could
conceivably be conceived as...

424
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:22,721
...a benefit to the- Well, my job
is to see that the public knows it.

425
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:27,924
And what if this x Corporation
does something bad?

426
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,451
Well...

427
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:35,568
Well, theoretically, they don't.

428
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,845
Theoretically.

429
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:40,732
Well, part of my job is...

430
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:44,203
...to help my client...

431
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,729
...to think of ways to operate in a way...

432
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:50,646
...that the public would,
you know, approve.

433
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:55,090
But if your x Corporation
makes a mistake...

434
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:57,687
...and the thing turns out bad?

435
00:34:58,053 --> 00:34:59,452
Well...

436
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:06,243
I guess then I try to make it look
not quite so bad.

437
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:10,725
- Well, there's more to it than that, sir.
- It's terrifically complicated, Daddy.

438
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:14,613
I don't understand that kind of work.

439
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,608
You love my girl?

440
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:29,247
Yes, sir, very much.

441
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:32,163
Your mama and daddy
live in San Francisco?

442
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,847
- No, sir, they-
- No, Joe's mother and father...

443
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:38,528
...are in show business, Daddy.
They have a wonderful act.

444
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:41,685
I mean, I've never seen it,
but from what Joe tells me-

445
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:44,890
They were on Ed Sullivan once.
You might have seen them.

446
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:49,251
This girl had a fine mama.

447
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:54,041
Her mama taught her how to be good.
Come home early.

448
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:57,285
I know she remembers those things.

449
00:35:57,453 --> 00:36:00,809
These days, girls think
they have to live in town.

450
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,972
But still, she remembers those things.

451
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:08,012
Well, she's the finest girl
I ever met, Mr. Arnesen.

452
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:13,528
- Look, Mr. Arnesen, we were-
- Daddy, Joe and I have to go.

453
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:16,651
We both have to work tomorrow.

454
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:18,807
Sure.

455
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:22,409
We hated to wake you up.

456
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:26,087
I'm glad you came by, Kirsty.

457
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,962
Daddy, I hope you like him.

458
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:34,888
- Don't put him on the spot.
- Takes time to find that out, Kirsty.

459
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:38,572
- Nice to have met you, sir.
- Same here, Joe.

460
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,770
Maybe I could take Joe out
and show him the greenhouse.

461
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,163
I'll put on the big light.

462
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,682
Gee, I never knew there
were so many flowers.

463
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,491
- Good night.
- Good night, Kirsty.

464
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,008
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Joe.

465
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:16,684
- Oh, brother, did I goof that one.
- Oh, he made me so nervous, I-

466
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:40,688
Mr. Arnesen, Kirsten and I
were married about two hours ago.

467
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:03,082
You know what I'd like to do?

468
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:07,330
I'd like to go some nice place
and have a drink.

469
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:39,499
- Where's my little gal? Where is she?
- In here.

470
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,414
Okay.

471
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:46,700
- There she is. I got the groceries.
- You saved me a trip.

472
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:49,422
And how are you today?
I got you some crazy lotion.

473
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,777
She says, "I'm nice and dry. " Temporarily.

474
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:54,251
For the skin you love to bite.

475
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,460
- You're something.
- Yes, she is.

476
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:59,341
You are really something.
I gotta get to work.

477
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:02,380
Ballefoy's having a bash tonight
for some of the new guys.

478
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,294
- You want to go?
- I'd love to...

479
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:07,340
- ... but I gotta get up early.
- I thought you'd want to.

480
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:09,777
- You've been stuck so long...
- I would, but...

481
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:12,615
- It doesn't matter. I have to be there.
- Call me.

482
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:14,135
Yep.

483
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:21,261
Hi.

484
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:45,580
Well, I see you got that dame
from Harper's Bazaar to show up.

485
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:47,698
I could get her
to use Covington Farms-

486
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:50,581
- Hi, Joe. Hi, Mr. Ballefoy.
- Hi, honey.

487
00:39:50,742 --> 00:39:53,256
We could use Covington Farms
for a fashion layout.

488
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:55,811
That country living we were talking about.

489
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:58,815
We'll furnish anything they need.
Cooperate fully.

490
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:01,098
- Get in there as solid as you can.
- Wait.

491
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:03,412
If we even get a mention
of Covington Farms-

492
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:05,413
- I know, it'll be an accident.
- Yeah.

493
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:08,540
Still, I confess to you,
I had an ulterior motive...

494
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:11,819
...for making the suggestion.
Frankly...

495
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,692
- Where was I?
- "Frankly. "

496
00:40:20,862 --> 00:40:24,821
Oh, yes. Frankly, you know how
Mr. Covington loves personal publicity.

497
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:26,574
- Not again.
- You haven't heard-

498
00:40:26,742 --> 00:40:28,619
Covington has got to face...

499
00:40:28,782 --> 00:40:31,979
...that a man does not automatically
become a public figure...

500
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:34,656
...because he builds an empire
out of chicken fat.

501
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:36,733
Do you know, I got this guy into...

502
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,177
...the Poultry Annual, with a close-up...

503
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:42,573
...and I got him into the Dairyland News.
And there they care.

504
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:46,530
I even finagled a feature story on this man
in Western Feed and Grain...

505
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:50,217
- ... but Harper's Bazaar, now, come on!
- Are you through?

506
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:52,612
It's Mrs. Covington.

507
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:55,615
- That old hayraker?
- Our leader is rich, Joe.

508
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:58,376
- His wife is a rich hayraker.
- She wants her home...

509
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,419
...and her garden and her Picassos-

510
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,971
I should get her elected
"best-dressed cow. "

511
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,610
In full color.

512
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:17,774
Joe, why aren't you dancing with me?

513
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:23,141
Honey, I am dancing with you.
Hey, doll, hit me again.

514
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:11,651
Magic time.

515
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:49,012
She's almost asleep. You'll wake her.

516
00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:51,059
- What's she doing up?
- She was hungry.

517
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:54,055
She's gotta learn some of Mommy's time
belongs to Daddy.

518
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:56,736
It's Daddy's time of night.

519
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:00,702
- Try to keep your voice down.
- What's the matter?

520
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:04,377
I've been working since 10 a. m.
I come home and I get shushed?

521
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,817
Working your elbow
more than anything else.

522
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:09,860
I had a drink with these people.
That's part of the job.

523
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,297
I thought your job was to advise them-

524
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:15,215
If Ballefoy wants me to drink,
what am I gonna do?

525
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:17,816
- Well, if he has confidence in you-
- Confidence?

526
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:20,098
Please.

527
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:24,580
He has confidence that I'll do
what I'm told, regardless. Confidence.

528
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:28,212
He even has confidence,
I think, that to keep my job...

529
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:31,340
...I'd ask the mayor of San Francisco
to give a ticker-tape parade...

530
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,652
...for his chicken fat king.

531
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:38,453
What happened...?

532
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:48,493
Well, now, look.

533
00:44:51,382 --> 00:44:55,455
I come home after a couple of drinks
and you're cold sober.

534
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:58,659
So maybe you're a little tired-
I know I seem loud and-

535
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,938
All right, I am.

536
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,733
Didn't used to think so.

537
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:08,939
I feel your disapproval. I feel it.

538
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:12,855
If you wanna sit up,
if you wanna wait for me...

539
00:45:13,022 --> 00:45:17,891
...is there a law that says you can't have
a couple of blasts while you're waiting?

540
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:21,694
So that maybe we can have
some laughs around here. Is there?

541
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:23,898
- I'm not supposed to.
- I know, your milk.

542
00:45:24,062 --> 00:45:27,179
It's the 20th century.
They invented milk bottles.

543
00:45:27,342 --> 00:45:30,140
And they got milk in cans.
It's as good as that milk!

544
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:32,657
You're gonna ruin your shape.

545
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:41,096
For crying out loud, you'd think you were
the only woman that ever had a ba-

546
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:43,651
I was dragged around
by the scruff of my neck...

547
00:45:43,822 --> 00:45:47,861
...on midnight trains and in freezing
weather and I would- I was eating...

548
00:45:48,022 --> 00:45:51,981
...crackers and peanut-
Don't do that!I was eating peanut butter!

549
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:55,134
Kids have got to learn to be people-
Don't!Look, please...

550
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:59,500
...just get her a bottle and some formula.
I want to have a ball, you and me!See?

551
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:01,254
For God- Don't shush me!

552
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:03,982
If I'm too loud,
then I'll just close the damn door!

553
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:08,260
- No, Joe, please, it's too stuffy-
- At that age, caring about temperature.

554
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:33,575
How could I do a thing like that...

555
00:46:34,422 --> 00:46:36,378
...to a child?

556
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,737
What's the matter with me?

557
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:31,498
You're right. It's kind of stuffy in there.

558
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:20,812
"Po-Ra. " You'll make it yet.

559
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:35,101
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

560
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:37,298
I'm sorry.

561
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:40,772
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

562
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:47,572
Mr. Clay's office.
Oh, no, I'm sorry. He-

563
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,578
Yes, I know it's important.

564
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:53,860
I'll give him the message
as soon as he gets in.

565
00:48:54,022 --> 00:48:56,934
Well, I'm sure
he'll be here any minute.

566
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:58,933
Yes, I will.

567
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:06,016
Coffee.

568
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:09,094
Oh, Mr. Clay.
Mr. Ballefoy says please call.

569
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:11,298
Yeah. Okay, okay.
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

570
00:49:11,462 --> 00:49:14,534
It's heating. I just want to
be sure about the Ballefoy thing.

571
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,262
Okay, you did your duty. You told me.

572
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:20,619
- Just get the coffee.
- It isn't hot.

573
00:49:20,782 --> 00:49:25,731
Did I say hot coffee?
I just said coffee. But just bring it?

574
00:50:07,902 --> 00:50:11,861
- You got a sec, Joe?
- For you, all day, Rad.

575
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:15,617
Oh, the head.

576
00:50:15,782 --> 00:50:20,060
It was Debbie's 1 st birthday
and Kirsten and I celebrated last night.

577
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:22,736
- Really hung one on.
- Yeah, with a capital "hung. "

578
00:50:22,902 --> 00:50:26,212
- If you'd rather not talk just now-
- No, business as usual.

579
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,691
- What- Hey, want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

580
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,932
Well, what's on your mind?

581
00:50:31,622 --> 00:50:35,661
I'd like to chat with you about
the Covington Farms account.

582
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:38,052
- Shoot.
- Well, it's a long story...

583
00:50:38,222 --> 00:50:42,454
...but the point is, I think it would be
best if we took you off the account.

584
00:50:43,182 --> 00:50:45,491
You took-? What-?

585
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:49,095
What is-? Ballefoy and I get along.

586
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:52,538
Well, the truth is,
they're letting Ballefoy out.

587
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:56,820
Frankly, for drinking too much.
And the new man...

588
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:58,893
Well, I could adjust to a new man.

589
00:50:59,062 --> 00:51:02,657
Well, actually, Joe, we sort of had
other plans for you anyhow.

590
00:51:02,822 --> 00:51:05,620
We're putting you on the
Campbell Cherokee Tool account.

591
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:08,899
Campbell Cherokee-
I'd be in Houston half the time.

592
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:11,895
- Houston's a refreshing town.
- I've got a wife and a kid.

593
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:14,212
- Joe, we feel-
- It's a demotion, isn't it?

594
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:16,691
- I wouldn't call it that.
- You wouldn't?

595
00:51:16,862 --> 00:51:19,820
Smaller, less sensitive account,
miles away from home.

596
00:51:19,982 --> 00:51:21,415
- What would you call it?
- Well-

597
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:24,460
Well, never mind, I think I understand.

598
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:31,417
I hope you do, Joe.

599
00:51:35,422 --> 00:51:38,141
Don't feel bad, honey.

600
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:41,738
I wouldn't be surprised if Rad Leland
wanted you out of town...

601
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:44,336
...for fear you'd get his job.

602
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:47,340
Not his decision.

603
00:51:47,502 --> 00:51:51,973
Well, somebody's making the decisions.
There's politics down there.

604
00:51:52,662 --> 00:51:55,495
You want the rest of this?
I'll get some more, honey.

605
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:03,730
I don't know. I've tried to be
honest with myself.

606
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:06,696
Ask myself, "Was it my fault?"

607
00:52:07,062 --> 00:52:08,973
You know it's not.

608
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:11,982
That's funny, there's only
two bottles down there.

609
00:52:12,142 --> 00:52:14,133
I thought I had three.

610
00:52:15,142 --> 00:52:16,894
Funny.

611
00:52:29,582 --> 00:52:34,576
- You do your job, honey.
- Yeah, I do. I know I do.

612
00:52:35,582 --> 00:52:38,540
The main point is, you do your job.

613
00:52:39,662 --> 00:52:43,337
Yeah, I swore I had three
bottles in there.

614
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,176
You do your job fine.

615
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:52,974
You know, you gotta remember
not everybody's honest.

616
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:55,497
Things are going on down there.

617
00:52:57,982 --> 00:52:59,813
Bums.

618
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:20,462
- Howdy, Landry.
- Charlie, shake hands with Joe Clay.

619
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:23,136
Joe's the new PR man from D.D.J.A.
Charlie Dean.

620
00:53:23,302 --> 00:53:24,655
- Good to see you.
- Pleasure.

621
00:53:24,822 --> 00:53:27,939
- Charlie's a vice president.
- I look forward to working with you.

622
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:30,821
We're having a little barbecue
out at my place Sunday.

623
00:53:30,982 --> 00:53:35,100
- Why don't you come out and join us?
- You'll get all the barbecue you can eat.

624
00:53:35,262 --> 00:53:38,220
- And all the bourbon you can drink too.
- Thank you.

625
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:41,734
- How's she doing, Landry?
- She's doing great.

626
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,541
Mama Bear...

627
00:53:43,942 --> 00:53:47,332
...and Baby Bear.

628
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:51,412
Oh, goody, goody! Toast and honey!

629
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:20,934
Mommy?

630
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:23,898
Mommy?

631
00:54:24,702 --> 00:54:28,217
Mommy? Mommy?

632
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:31,260
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, it's too noisy.

633
00:54:31,422 --> 00:54:34,698
Just lie down. It's all those people
coming home from work.

634
00:54:34,862 --> 00:54:37,535
You go to sleep.
I'll close the window.

635
00:54:44,062 --> 00:54:47,498
Well, snuggle-bug,
snuggle down, okay? Sleep.

636
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:49,175
Sleep.

637
00:55:27,342 --> 00:55:31,096
Are they all right, Pop? You sure?

638
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:36,173
Well, I knew she was having
a couple now and then...

639
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:38,697
...but nothing like this.

640
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:41,659
Yeah.

641
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:44,177
Okay, Pop. Well-

642
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:50,497
Take good care of them, Pop.
Tell them I'll get there as quick as I can.

643
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:11,816
Waiter? Waiter, would you
hit me again, please?

644
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:36,418
I...

645
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:41,419
I've gotta get the 11-
I've gotta go home on the 11:30 plane.

646
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:43,459
My...

647
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:48,339
My wife got drunk
and set the apartment on fire.

648
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:13,741
Couldn't this be rebuilt?

649
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:17,251
Frame's burned through.

650
00:57:18,222 --> 00:57:22,454
Well, if you didn't spend most of your time
in Houston, it wouldn't have happened.

651
00:57:22,622 --> 00:57:24,453
Don't worry.

652
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,139
I won't be going to Houston anymore.
They fired me.

653
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:24,221
Debbie, you run outside and play for
a while. I want to speak to your mother.

654
00:58:24,382 --> 00:58:25,974
Come on, honey.

655
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:30,976
- What's wrong?
- We gotta talk about something.

656
00:58:31,142 --> 00:58:33,337
- Have a beer-
- No!Sorry.

657
00:58:33,502 --> 00:58:35,777
- You drunk?
- I haven't had a drop!

658
00:58:35,942 --> 00:58:38,217
Well, then, what's the matter with you?

659
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,577
I walked by the Union Square Bar.
I was gonna go in and I saw myself...

660
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:47,213
...my reflection in the window. And I
thought, "I wonder who that bum is. "

661
00:58:47,382 --> 00:58:48,895
And then I saw it was me.

662
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:53,300
Now, look at me, I'm a bum. Look at me,
look at you. You're a bum!Look at you.

663
00:58:53,462 --> 00:58:55,532
And look at us. Look at us, come on!

664
00:58:55,782 --> 00:59:00,219
Look at us. See? A couple of bums.
Now, look!You've gotta listen to me.

665
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:03,419
It came to me. I saw it all.
You know why I've been fired...

666
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,301
...from five jobs in four years.
It's not politics.

667
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:10,057
It's not office politics or jealousy
or any of that stuff. It's booze!

668
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:13,100
- It's booze!
- A couple of drinks-

669
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,093
We have more
than a couple of drinks...

670
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,457
...we get drunk!
We stay drunk most of the time.

671
00:59:17,822 --> 00:59:21,701
Look at the dump that we live in,
the clothes that we wear-

672
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:24,422
We send that child
off to school like she's...

673
00:59:24,622 --> 00:59:28,012
Look at me. I'm a drunk
and I don't do my job and that's it!

674
00:59:28,182 --> 00:59:31,174
I'm a drunk and I don't do my job
and I get fired...

675
00:59:31,342 --> 00:59:33,572
...and I can't get a job now!And I...

676
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:39,058
We should've looked at ourselves long ago
and realized we've turned into bums!

677
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:40,860
Honey, honey, I love you!

678
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:44,856
I love you too, and I don't mean
that I didn't. But we gotta face this.

679
00:59:45,062 --> 00:59:46,654
Please!

680
00:59:46,862 --> 00:59:48,853
All right, we just won't drink so much.

681
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:53,174
No!Not so- I got a plan and we got
to do it, honey. We gotta make it work.

682
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:57,176
We're gonna get sober, but we'll stay
sober. We don't take a drop. Nothing.

683
00:59:57,342 --> 01:00:01,494
And then- I thought this out. We'll go to
your father and convince him we mean it.

684
01:00:01,662 --> 01:00:04,335
And he'll give us enough money
to get off the ground.

685
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:08,939
Then I'll go to the old places and they'll
see I'm sober and they'll take me back.

686
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:13,096
Are you with me? We gotta do it now
or it's too late. We gotta make it work.

687
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:15,378
- Are you with me?
- I'm always with you.

688
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:18,534
Good. We gotta do it, honey,
we gotta make it work.

689
01:00:30,022 --> 01:00:31,580
Hey, Pop.

690
01:00:31,742 --> 01:00:34,859
- You sure that Vic Tanny started this way?
- Who?

691
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:37,092
Bernarr McFadden.

692
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:39,373
- One more, Joe.
- Yeah. "One more, Joe. "

693
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:41,100
Anything you say, warden.

694
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:44,299
Hey, warden?
Gotta ask you one question.

695
01:00:44,462 --> 01:00:46,054
Are you-?

696
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:50,614
You sure that out there
there is a highway...

697
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:53,376
...and down that highway
there is a town?

698
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:57,057
A town with people,
with people just like us?

699
01:00:57,222 --> 01:01:00,578
- One more tree, Joe.
- "One more tree, Joe," I know.

700
01:01:04,942 --> 01:01:07,820
"One more tree, Joe.
One more tree, Joe. "

701
01:01:10,102 --> 01:01:12,491
- Are you in for life?
- It looks like it.

702
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:14,937
- How long you been here?
- Almost a month.

703
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:18,617
- Well, I feel like I've been here 10 years.
- Seems to agree with you.

704
01:01:19,502 --> 01:01:21,299
- Do you like boys?
- I love them.

705
01:01:21,462 --> 01:01:23,180
Yeah?

706
01:01:23,782 --> 01:01:26,694
Come with me.
There's something I wanna try.

707
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:42,852
- All my life I've wanted to do that.
- Oh, poor little city boy.

708
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:45,894
Hey, you know something?

709
01:01:46,062 --> 01:01:47,973
I never really understood...

710
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:50,858
- ... the reason for haystacks before.
- Yeah.

711
01:01:51,022 --> 01:01:53,980
That crazy smell gives us
all those problems we hear about.

712
01:01:54,142 --> 01:01:56,133
- And the softness.
- Yeah.

713
01:01:57,982 --> 01:02:02,533
You know, I can't remember us
ever feeling like this before.

714
01:02:02,902 --> 01:02:05,735
- Except after a couple of drinks.
- Yeah.

715
01:02:05,942 --> 01:02:07,898
Was the other better?

716
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:11,378
Can't see how it would be.

717
01:02:22,862 --> 01:02:24,773
Caught you drinking.

718
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:28,452
No harm in one beer, Joe.
Or two or three.

719
01:02:28,622 --> 01:02:30,533
Matter of how much, huh?

720
01:02:31,942 --> 01:02:35,378
- Sanders says he'll pay you Monday.
- With Sanders it's always Monday.

721
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:36,816
- And then Friday.
- Yeah.

722
01:02:36,982 --> 01:02:38,210
Hey.

723
01:02:38,382 --> 01:02:42,057
Remember Mrs. Michel, where you
delivered those roses about a month ago?

724
01:02:42,222 --> 01:02:45,771
Two months ago exactly.
My second day as a trusty.

725
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:48,137
She phoned in a big order
this afternoon.

726
01:02:48,302 --> 01:02:51,772
Said she remembered us because of
the nice man who delivered the roses.

727
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:55,252
All part of public relations, Pop.
Kirs upstairs?

728
01:02:56,062 --> 01:02:57,734
Joe.

729
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:00,498
You want a beer?

730
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:04,052
You're starting to trust me again.

731
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:08,460
Well, thanks anyway, Pop.

732
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:17,940
Hi-ho!

733
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:24,772
A tasty little neck.

734
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:27,820
- I'm glad you like it. Have some more.
- No, not right now.

735
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:31,099
My, we have been good the last couple
of months. Just perfect.

736
01:03:31,262 --> 01:03:32,934
- We sure have.
- Much too good.

737
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:37,732
Because you are much too beautiful
to be so good, and I was thinking...

738
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:40,211
...being good is better
than being bad, yes?

739
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:43,135
But being too good
is worse than death.

740
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:47,580
- There are times when I agree with you.
- Well, how would you like to spice up...

741
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:52,458
...your exemplary life by just
slipping a teeny-weeny bit?

742
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:56,934
- A teeny-weeny bit?
- Just a modicum, a jot, a minim.

743
01:03:57,302 --> 01:03:59,020
A drop?

744
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:02,811
- Where is it?
- No, it all starts with a striptease.

745
01:04:05,702 --> 01:04:09,490
Oh, well, I thought you were talking
about something more tangible.

746
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:12,222
Please, you're interrupting a performance.

747
01:04:26,302 --> 01:04:28,020
Joe!

748
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:32,613
Oh, you're a genius!

749
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:34,215
Nothing at all, my dear.

750
01:04:34,382 --> 01:04:38,500
Of course, getting this tape off
is gonna be a major operation.

751
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:40,937
Okay, now, here we go. Fast, right?

752
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:48,253
Next time I do this...

753
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:50,378
...I'm gonna shave my legs.

754
01:04:53,262 --> 01:04:55,218
- No, Joe, we can't.
- What do you mean?

755
01:04:55,382 --> 01:04:58,738
- It'll ruin everything.
- Now, just a darn minute, lady.

756
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:01,097
I'm not suggesting an all-out orgy.

757
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:04,299
I think we've learned better than that,
I hope and trust.

758
01:05:04,502 --> 01:05:06,857
We've been working hard.

759
01:05:07,022 --> 01:05:11,379
Behaving ourselves. Just a wee little drop
in the privacy of our own little room...

760
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:14,215
...isn't gonna hurt us.
Who's to know?

761
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:18,091
We just lie back in bed like civilized people
and sip it through a straw.

762
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:20,332
May I expect your cooperation?

763
01:05:20,502 --> 01:05:25,178
Well, now, how could I not vote
for someone who dances so divinely?

764
01:05:26,862 --> 01:05:28,295
Hold on.

765
01:05:31,142 --> 01:05:32,416
Twinsies.

766
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:36,097
And there is another.
In the greenhouse.

767
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:40,619
It is in the fourth pot
and the fifth table-

768
01:05:41,382 --> 01:05:44,738
Fourth pot, third table,
fifth row. Yeah, that's it.

769
01:05:44,902 --> 01:05:47,655
Fourth pot, third table,
fifth row. Four, five, three.

770
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:52,816
Now, remember the combination, because
if I die before I wake, that's your legacy.

771
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:02,575
- You are depraved.
- Yeah, flattery will get you everywhere.

772
01:06:02,742 --> 01:06:04,460
Magic time.

773
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:29,734
Here.

774
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,778
- Step on it.
- What?

775
01:06:41,302 --> 01:06:42,940
Here.

776
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:13,020
Kirsty.

777
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:16,093
Kirsty?

778
01:07:20,182 --> 01:07:22,537
Must have had a nightmare.

779
01:07:24,142 --> 01:07:26,019
You all right?

780
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:30,056
I'm fine, Daddy, just go back to bed.

781
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:47,058
Come up now.

782
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:50,452
We ain't fighting.

783
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:04,215
Gulp.

784
01:08:04,742 --> 01:08:06,778
It's all gone.

785
01:08:08,102 --> 01:08:10,980
- Oh, it's all gone.
- Four thirty-five.

786
01:08:11,142 --> 01:08:14,179
Get the other one. Get the other one.

787
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:19,097
You'll wake up Daddy.
He'll hear you.

788
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:29,095
- What?
- I'm gonna go out the window...

789
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:33,777
...and down the tree,
as silent as a squirrel.

790
01:08:34,382 --> 01:08:37,055
- Don't fall, then. Hurry up.
- Four, three, five.

791
01:08:37,702 --> 01:08:40,296
- No, no. Wait a second, Joe.
- What?

792
01:08:40,462 --> 01:08:42,851
- You said-
- I'll be quiet as a squirrel.

793
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:46,014
- Three, five, four.
- No.

794
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:49,572
- Yes.
- No. Four, three, five. Hold that.

795
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,095
Hurry back.

796
01:09:08,902 --> 01:09:10,733
Four, five, three.

797
01:10:03,422 --> 01:10:05,253
Here we go!

798
01:10:06,062 --> 01:10:07,620
What was it?

799
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:12,373
Fourth, was it? One. Two. Three.

800
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,136
Fourth row!Third table.

801
01:10:15,302 --> 01:10:20,057
Two. Fifth pot.
One, two, three, four, five...

802
01:10:20,222 --> 01:10:22,417
...and come to Papa!

803
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:43,780
What-?

804
01:10:50,062 --> 01:10:52,018
Five, four, three.

805
01:10:52,462 --> 01:10:55,977
Fourth, fifth row.
Third table, fourth pot.

806
01:10:56,142 --> 01:10:59,691
One, two, three, four.

807
01:11:03,022 --> 01:11:05,217
Wait a minute. What-?

808
01:11:09,822 --> 01:11:11,494
What happened?

809
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,140
Wait a minute.

810
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:16,338
Don't get excited.
Wait a minute.

811
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,661
Start it all over. Wait a minute.
One.

812
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:24,134
Two. One. Five, four, three...

813
01:11:24,302 --> 01:11:27,180
One. It's the fifth pot!

814
01:11:27,342 --> 01:11:30,220
One more. Third.

815
01:11:38,302 --> 01:11:40,054
Where is it?

816
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,060
What?

817
01:11:48,742 --> 01:11:50,494
Who took it?

818
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:01,860
Where is it? Red flower!

819
01:12:02,022 --> 01:12:03,933
It's a red flower!

820
01:12:05,222 --> 01:12:08,259
Lights!Where are the lights?

821
01:12:21,022 --> 01:12:24,492
Who took it? Who took it?

822
01:12:24,662 --> 01:12:27,460
Who took it? Who took it?

823
01:12:27,622 --> 01:12:31,012
Where? Where? Where is it?

824
01:12:31,182 --> 01:12:34,618
Who took it? Who took it?

825
01:12:35,342 --> 01:12:40,541
Somebody stole it!
They stole it!They stole it!

826
01:12:41,702 --> 01:12:43,693
Who took it?

827
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:52,651
They took it!

828
01:12:52,822 --> 01:12:56,576
Took it!They took it!

829
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:49,174
Daddy?

830
01:13:50,582 --> 01:13:52,140
Daddy?

831
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:55,221
- I'm drunk as a skunk.
- Kirsty!

832
01:13:55,742 --> 01:13:58,700
I'm plastered and lonely.
I want you to kiss me good night.

833
01:13:58,862 --> 01:14:01,296
- Dirty Joe brought whiskey.
- Kiss me good night.

834
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:04,181
- You get back to your room.
- What's the matter, Daddy?

835
01:14:04,342 --> 01:14:06,617
I just want you to kiss...

836
01:14:08,822 --> 01:14:10,540
Granddaddy?

837
01:14:11,022 --> 01:14:14,298
- Go to bed, Debbie!
- You get out of here!Get out of here!

838
01:14:15,182 --> 01:14:18,697
- Leave my daddy alone, leave him alone!
- Debbie!Go ahead!

839
01:14:18,862 --> 01:14:21,422
- You come along with me, now.
- I'm not a kid.

840
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:29,413
- Get in the tub.
- No, I don't wanna.

841
01:14:29,582 --> 01:14:32,142
- Get in the tub!
- Daddy!

842
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,054
Get in there!

843
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:35,974
What are you doing?

844
01:14:51,382 --> 01:14:53,498
One-sixty-eight, Ed.

845
01:15:44,062 --> 01:15:46,053
Ed, give me a hand!

846
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:07,373
How you feeling, fella?

847
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:09,821
Rotten.

848
01:17:14,582 --> 01:17:18,018
- Who are you?
- I'm Jim Hungerford.

849
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:20,691
Nurse says you want help.

850
01:17:23,662 --> 01:17:25,698
I'm from Alcoholics Anonymous.

851
01:17:28,582 --> 01:17:30,891
- Honey, please read the book.
- No.

852
01:17:31,062 --> 01:17:33,576
Hungerford says the AA meetings
are terrific.

853
01:17:33,742 --> 01:17:37,052
Just a bunch of alcoholics
keeping each other sober, and it works.

854
01:17:37,222 --> 01:17:40,453
- Please read the book. It makes sense.
- No!

855
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,659
I don't know why you took it.
They must think you're a bum.

856
01:17:43,822 --> 01:17:47,974
I asked for it. I must have needed help,
I was in the hospital.

857
01:17:48,142 --> 01:17:51,179
- You didn't belong there.
- I was there. Nobody belongs there.

858
01:17:51,342 --> 01:17:54,857
I passed out on Mission Street.
I didn't belong there, but-

859
01:17:55,022 --> 01:17:58,219
All right, you had too much.
Doesn't mean you're an alcoholic.

860
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:02,500
Look, dear. What's wrong with just going
to a meeting? Now, what could we lose?

861
01:18:02,662 --> 01:18:05,574
You can go if you want,
I don't care, but I'm not gonna go.

862
01:18:05,742 --> 01:18:09,098
I am not an alcoholic
and I refuse to say I am.

863
01:18:09,302 --> 01:18:11,816
I refuse to ask for help in something...

864
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:15,816
...that is just a matter
of self-respect and willpower.

865
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:19,861
I refuse to get up in front of a bunch
of people and degrade myself.

866
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:24,137
I know I can't drink,
because it gets the best of me, so I...

867
01:18:24,462 --> 01:18:28,501
I will just use my willpower and not drink,
and that's the end of it.

868
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:47,739
- We got time for a cigarette.
- You nervous?

869
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:49,381
No, I...

870
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:51,772
- Button came off my jacket.
- Leave it open.

871
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:54,695
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Here.

872
01:18:56,822 --> 01:18:59,131
I used to be a pretty fancy dresser.

873
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:02,055
I wouldn't have been caught dead
with a button off me.

874
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:07,733
- You're scared?
- No, this is natural complexion. Pale green.

875
01:19:07,902 --> 01:19:12,771
- Nobody will notice. Come on.
- Well, wait a minute. Just, you know...

876
01:19:12,942 --> 01:19:16,457
You know, you are turning pale green.
Now, will you come on?

877
01:19:17,422 --> 01:19:19,333
It's facing all the people.

878
01:19:19,662 --> 01:19:21,732
- You sure?
- What do you mean?

879
01:19:21,902 --> 01:19:25,053
- It's facing yourself, isn't it?
- I don't mind sharing my life.

880
01:19:25,222 --> 01:19:28,976
Even the most embarrassing parts of it.
That's not what bothers me.

881
01:19:29,742 --> 01:19:32,620
The idea of standing in front
of everyone and saying:

882
01:19:32,782 --> 01:19:35,091
- "I am an alcoholic. "
- Are you?

883
01:19:35,262 --> 01:19:37,492
- Yes, I-
- So are we!Now, you've heard us...

884
01:19:37,662 --> 01:19:41,450
...night after night saying, "I am an
alcoholic. " It's a big step forward.

885
01:19:41,622 --> 01:19:45,092
But it's funny that four months ago
you saw me in the violent ward...

886
01:19:45,262 --> 01:19:48,652
...and you told me about AA.
I went to the meetings, I listened...

887
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:53,612
...and I've been sober ever since. Kirs
has been sober too, just as sober as I am.

888
01:19:53,782 --> 01:19:58,617
She has never said, "I am an alcoholic. "
She hasn't been near a meeting.

889
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:01,057
She claims she
can do it on willpower alone.

890
01:20:01,222 --> 01:20:02,860
Can you?

891
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:07,617
My name is Jim Hungerford.

892
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:09,693
And I'm an alcoholic.

893
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:11,375
I'm your chairman for tonight.

894
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:15,251
Now, all I have to do to qualify myself
is to say that I drank too much...

895
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:17,982
...too often over too long
a period of time.

896
01:20:18,382 --> 01:20:22,580
Welcome to the meeting of the Mason
Street group of Alcoholics Anonymous.

897
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:30,259
"Alcoholics Anonymous is a group of men
and women who share their experience...

898
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:33,778
...strength and hopes that they may
solve their common problem...

899
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:36,376
...and help others
to recover from alcoholism.

900
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:40,137
The only requirement for membership
is a desire to stop drinking.

901
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:42,851
There are no dues or fees
for AA membership.

902
01:20:43,022 --> 01:20:46,697
We are self-supporting through our own
contributions. AA is not allied...

903
01:20:46,862 --> 01:20:50,980
...with any sect, denomination, politics,
organization or institution.

904
01:20:51,142 --> 01:20:56,057
Does not wish to engage in controversy,
neither endorses nor opposes any causes.

905
01:20:56,222 --> 01:21:01,296
Our primary purpose is to stay sober and
help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety. "

906
01:21:02,622 --> 01:21:06,376
Now, we got a couple of speakers tonight
I know you're gonna enjoy hearing.

907
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:09,978
To start, we're gonna hear from a man
who came just four months ago.

908
01:21:10,142 --> 01:21:12,815
Now, this will be his first talk
at an AA meeting.

909
01:21:13,022 --> 01:21:14,660
Joe.

910
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:34,212
My name...

911
01:21:35,862 --> 01:21:39,013
My name is Joe Clay.

912
01:21:42,342 --> 01:21:44,492
I'm an alcoholic.

913
01:22:02,582 --> 01:22:04,334
Honey?

914
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:08,220
Debbie?

915
01:22:21,342 --> 01:22:22,695
Come in.

916
01:22:22,902 --> 01:22:24,893
Oh, hi, Jim.

917
01:22:25,222 --> 01:22:27,736
- I'm sorry to-
- No, you should've called sooner.

918
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,176
Any word?

919
01:22:29,342 --> 01:22:33,221
Two days and two nights and I-
I had to call you. I was afraid I might-

920
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:36,294
- Yeah, I know. Did you tell the police?
- Yeah.

921
01:22:36,782 --> 01:22:40,218
I just- I can't see how
this could be happening to us.

922
01:22:40,382 --> 01:22:43,260
- You drank too much.
- A lot of people drink as much...

923
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:46,573
- ... as Kirs and I and they're not alcoholics.
- Yet.

924
01:22:46,742 --> 01:22:48,698
A lot of them never are.

925
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,338
It's a lottery, Joe.

926
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:54,256
- And you lost.
- Yeah. Well, how?

927
01:22:54,422 --> 01:22:57,016
No way to find out before it's too late.

928
01:22:57,982 --> 01:23:01,372
Joe, you remember how you told us
about Kirsten's obsession...

929
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:03,692
...with chocolate candy
when you first met?

930
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:07,377
A psychologist might have told you
then she was a potential alcoholic.

931
01:23:07,542 --> 01:23:10,693
You wouldn't have believed him.
And he might have been wrong.

932
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:13,581
How many strawberries does it take
to start an allergy?

933
01:23:13,742 --> 01:23:15,539
And which one gives you hives?

934
01:23:15,702 --> 01:23:20,173
Alcoholism is an illness. It's pretty hard
to diagnose an illness until you've got it.

935
01:23:20,382 --> 01:23:24,614
- Come on, Joe. She'll turn up, honest.
- Why did she do it, why did she leave?

936
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:27,455
- That's...
- She wanted a drink.

937
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:31,013
She had to drink, she could drink
right here, and she knows it.

938
01:23:31,182 --> 01:23:34,379
You're sober.
It's no fun to drink around you.

939
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:37,415
It's worse!Your sobriety would be
an accusation to her.

940
01:23:37,582 --> 01:23:40,540
She'd be miserable.
She's lost her playmate.

941
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:42,659
And Joe...

942
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:48,176
Listen, don't be too surprised
if she finds another one.

943
01:23:55,342 --> 01:23:59,017
She loves me. You just don't understand,
there's no trouble between us.

944
01:23:59,182 --> 01:24:01,571
There wasn't any trouble.
Joe, don't forget.

945
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:05,576
For a long time, booze has been
an integral part of your relationship.

946
01:24:05,742 --> 01:24:08,893
If she drinks and you don't,
you gotta find a new meeting ground...

947
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:12,054
...a different basis for a relationship.
It takes adjusting.

948
01:24:12,222 --> 01:24:15,373
I find it hard to believe this.
There was one thing about us...

949
01:24:15,542 --> 01:24:19,171
...we always knew we were in love.
There was no doubt about it. We knew.

950
01:24:19,342 --> 01:24:21,902
Do you understand what I'm saying?
We had something.

951
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,292
Things like that don't just evaporate.

952
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:27,454
Joe, the night you tore up your
father-in-law's flowers...

953
01:24:27,622 --> 01:24:28,941
...looking for the bottle?

954
01:24:29,102 --> 01:24:31,013
- What'd you do with it?
- I drank it.

955
01:24:31,182 --> 01:24:33,742
You didn't take it back
and drink it with Kirsten?

956
01:24:36,742 --> 01:24:37,936
No.

957
01:24:38,102 --> 01:24:41,219
There comes a time for every alcoholic
when the bottle is God.

958
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:43,976
Nothing matters but the next drink.
You know that.

959
01:24:44,142 --> 01:24:46,019
I know I know it, I just-

960
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:49,060
I can't believe that this
is happening to me, that's all!

961
01:24:50,022 --> 01:24:52,092
Two people. Seven years.

962
01:24:52,262 --> 01:24:55,140
Booze, no booze, drunk, sober.

963
01:24:55,302 --> 01:24:57,611
Isn't love... love?

964
01:24:58,782 --> 01:25:00,295
I don't know.

965
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,454
I was drunk for 12 years,
I've been sober the last 14.

966
01:25:03,622 --> 01:25:07,410
All I know is the drunk world is one world
and the sober world is another.

967
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:13,331
Such a lonely person.

968
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:16,378
Oh, God, keep her safe.

969
01:25:17,302 --> 01:25:21,136
- Is your little girl all right?
- Yeah, she's...

970
01:25:21,302 --> 01:25:24,100
...on the peninsula
with her grandfather.

971
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:28,096
Hello?

972
01:25:28,262 --> 01:25:29,934
Yes, this is Mr. Clay.

973
01:25:30,102 --> 01:25:32,013
Yes, Kirsten Clay, that's right, yes.

974
01:25:32,182 --> 01:25:33,171
- Where?
- Police?

975
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:36,618
Where is-?
Shore Motel, where is that?

976
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:40,981
I see- Who is-? Mr. Turning?
Is she all right?

977
01:25:43,582 --> 01:25:45,220
She alone?

978
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:48,855
I'll be there as fast as possible.
Thanks for calling.

979
01:25:49,022 --> 01:25:51,377
She's in a motel.
Mr. Turning owns the motel.

980
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:54,534
He said that she came in a cab
and checked in drunk...

981
01:25:54,702 --> 01:25:56,613
...and she's been drunk ever since.

982
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,977
- Want me to go with you?
- I better go alone.

983
01:25:59,142 --> 01:26:00,973
- Here, take my car.
- Thanks.

984
01:26:01,142 --> 01:26:03,861
Joe, listen, listen.
At the risk of sounding preachy-

985
01:26:04,022 --> 01:26:07,537
- I know. Easy does it, first things first-
- No, no. Something else.

986
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:10,899
She may resent your being sober.
It separates you.

987
01:26:11,062 --> 01:26:13,132
- I know that.
- But Joe!

988
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:17,900
If you're not sober, you're not worth
a damn to her or anybody else, are you?

989
01:26:18,062 --> 01:26:19,541
No.

990
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:30,178
- Yes, sir?
- Hello, I'm Mr. Clay.

991
01:26:30,342 --> 01:26:34,017
- She's in the last bungalow, Mr. Clay.
- Thank you.

992
01:26:56,222 --> 01:27:00,932
One sliced turnip, two stalks of celery,
add pepper and salt...

993
01:27:01,102 --> 01:27:03,741
...and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.

994
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:08,737
My, my, what nobility has to put up with
just to have dinner.

995
01:27:08,902 --> 01:27:12,178
- I'm glad I'm a rabbit.
- Now place rabbit into oven...

996
01:27:12,342 --> 01:27:15,459
...and heat oven to 350 degrees.

997
01:27:15,622 --> 01:27:19,297
Three hundred and fifty degrees?
Too hot for me.

998
01:27:19,462 --> 01:27:23,137
I just remembered another commitment.
Give my regrets to His Majesty.

999
01:27:23,302 --> 01:27:27,420
I bid you farewell, arrivederci, sayonara
and all that sort of jazz.

1000
01:27:27,582 --> 01:27:30,813
Oh, no, you're not.
You're staying.

1001
01:27:30,982 --> 01:27:35,021
- I insist.
- Okay, okay. If it's that important.

1002
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:40,620
Cook! Cook!
Where's my hasenpfeffer?

1003
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:45,374
Coming right up, Royal Highness.

1004
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:50,252
Bon appétit, O gracious Majesty.

1005
01:27:53,422 --> 01:27:55,856
You bonehead, that-

1006
01:28:18,222 --> 01:28:20,178
Have about a drink, honey?

1007
01:28:20,782 --> 01:28:22,534
- Not now.
- Come on, have a drink.

1008
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,613
No, I don't want one.

1009
01:28:24,822 --> 01:28:26,335
I do.

1010
01:28:27,942 --> 01:28:29,580
You think...?

1011
01:28:32,382 --> 01:28:35,021
Honey, do you think you're about
ready to come home?

1012
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:44,614
It's you.

1013
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:48,814
- What do you want?
- I want my wife.

1014
01:28:51,622 --> 01:28:53,613
Sober Joe.

1015
01:28:54,102 --> 01:28:56,297
Milkman's friend.

1016
01:28:57,422 --> 01:29:01,654
Well, now you got me,
what do you want to do?

1017
01:29:02,102 --> 01:29:04,297
I was hoping to take you home.

1018
01:29:09,702 --> 01:29:11,533
I like it here.

1019
01:29:13,742 --> 01:29:16,779
My friends are here.

1020
01:29:18,022 --> 01:29:20,411
You have your friends, I have mine.

1021
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:23,374
Have a drink.

1022
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:30,179
Excuse me, I forgot.

1023
01:29:30,742 --> 01:29:32,812
Shame, I'm all out of...

1024
01:29:35,142 --> 01:29:36,780
...milk...

1025
01:29:38,062 --> 01:29:40,860
...coffee, tea and orange juice, those...

1026
01:29:41,662 --> 01:29:44,051
...non-alcoholic beverages.

1027
01:29:46,022 --> 01:29:49,094
- Honey, if you'd just come home.
- No!

1028
01:29:56,382 --> 01:29:58,691
Well, you laid in a good supply.

1029
01:29:58,862 --> 01:30:01,501
- We could take it home and have a-
- No!

1030
01:30:04,422 --> 01:30:07,971
- You've your friends, you don't need me.
- Oh, honey.

1031
01:30:09,262 --> 01:30:12,459
Joe. Kiss me, Joe.

1032
01:30:19,222 --> 01:30:21,497
I taste like gin.

1033
01:30:22,302 --> 01:30:26,056
You never did like gin,
so I didn't drink it, but...

1034
01:30:26,222 --> 01:30:29,498
...now I'm alone,
so I drink it because I like gin.

1035
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:40,978
Together in heaven.

1036
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:43,133
Likely story.

1037
01:30:45,102 --> 01:30:47,172
Now he doesn't even like...

1038
01:30:48,302 --> 01:30:50,770
...the taste of me anymore.

1039
01:31:00,782 --> 01:31:02,261
Honey...

1040
01:31:04,182 --> 01:31:05,854
- Let me get you some food.
- No.

1041
01:31:06,022 --> 01:31:08,411
- You're gonna get sick, you know-
- I don't care!

1042
01:31:08,582 --> 01:31:13,975
I don't care, just go away and leave me
alone. I don't care about anything.

1043
01:31:19,342 --> 01:31:20,695
I'll be back.

1044
01:31:20,862 --> 01:31:22,420
Don't bother.

1045
01:31:29,702 --> 01:31:31,021
Joe.

1046
01:31:33,502 --> 01:31:34,776
I'm lonely, Joe.

1047
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,454
Have a drink with me, please.

1048
01:31:42,942 --> 01:31:44,455
I can't.

1049
01:31:44,822 --> 01:31:47,575
- I'm lonely!
- I'll stay with you, but I can't.

1050
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:49,733
Don't do me any favors!

1051
01:31:49,902 --> 01:31:52,735
Can't have a drink,
too good to have a drink with me.

1052
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:55,976
What'd they do to you down
at that AA place, anyway?

1053
01:31:56,142 --> 01:31:59,179
Aren't you a man anymore?
Can't you hear a woman calling you?

1054
01:31:59,342 --> 01:32:01,139
I'm a woman, can't you hear me?

1055
01:32:01,702 --> 01:32:03,852
- I hear you.
- What're you gonna do about it?

1056
01:32:04,022 --> 01:32:07,776
- But we've got our own little apartment-
- No, we haven't.

1057
01:32:07,942 --> 01:32:10,775
I'm not going back there.
Never, never.

1058
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,900
I want to be where people live.
I don't want any of your...

1059
01:32:15,182 --> 01:32:17,252
...mealy-mouthed...

1060
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:21,691
...holier-than-thou, do-gooder
Boy Scouts with their...

1061
01:32:22,222 --> 01:32:26,101
...with their hot coffee and their cold feet.

1062
01:32:26,422 --> 01:32:31,132
I don't want anybody who doesn't have
the guts to take a drink. Now, go away.

1063
01:32:37,062 --> 01:32:38,541
I want a cigarette.

1064
01:33:22,702 --> 01:33:24,374
Keep the pack.

1065
01:33:26,502 --> 01:33:28,618
You're not giving me anything.

1066
01:33:28,782 --> 01:33:30,818
They're community property.

1067
01:33:30,982 --> 01:33:33,974
So's the gin, 50-50. Here.

1068
01:33:39,422 --> 01:33:42,539
I'm not coming back, Joe.
You're too good.

1069
01:33:43,102 --> 01:33:47,220
And there's no bore in the world
like a goody-good.

1070
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,657
Want some of mine, honey?

1071
01:36:55,462 --> 01:36:57,180
Hello!

1072
01:37:05,422 --> 01:37:07,413
We're closed, buddy.

1073
01:37:07,942 --> 01:37:10,615
- I said, we're closed.
- No, come on, please!

1074
01:37:10,782 --> 01:37:14,570
- We close at 11. Go on home.
- Oh, please.

1075
01:37:15,222 --> 01:37:18,897
Now look, you. Get out of here before
I call the cops. Now, beat it.

1076
01:37:19,062 --> 01:37:22,338
No, please, please...

1077
01:37:23,582 --> 01:37:25,300
Please.

1078
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:55,896
Oh, please.

1079
01:37:56,062 --> 01:37:57,541
What is it, what's happening?

1080
01:37:57,702 --> 01:38:01,536
Go on inside, I'll take care of this.
Go on!

1081
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:04,054
So you like booze, hey, buddy?

1082
01:38:07,302 --> 01:38:09,372
I didn't know you wanted it that bad.

1083
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:11,373
Why didn't you ask?

1084
01:38:11,822 --> 01:38:14,859
I'll give you all the booze you want.

1085
01:38:41,142 --> 01:38:42,495
Why?

1086
01:38:42,942 --> 01:38:44,660
Joe, who am I?

1087
01:38:45,102 --> 01:38:46,694
- Joe.
- What?

1088
01:38:46,862 --> 01:38:48,375
Who am I?

1089
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:51,055
Who am I?

1090
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:54,662
- You're...
- Say it. Come on.

1091
01:38:55,942 --> 01:38:57,341
Jim.

1092
01:38:59,022 --> 01:39:01,980
- What happened?
- What happened? You took a drink.

1093
01:39:02,302 --> 01:39:03,701
You're drying out now.

1094
01:39:03,862 --> 01:39:08,811
For two days there was a little green man
chasing you around with pruning shears.

1095
01:39:09,942 --> 01:39:12,297
No, no, no, no, no.

1096
01:39:16,982 --> 01:39:18,335
Gotta...

1097
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:24,019
- Gotta get my wife.
- No, let her stay with her dad for a while.

1098
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,980
I want...

1099
01:39:31,022 --> 01:39:32,978
I want her with me.

1100
01:39:35,022 --> 01:39:36,535
Joe.

1101
01:39:39,462 --> 01:39:41,817
Joe, you gotta stay sober.

1102
01:39:42,182 --> 01:39:44,776
Even if it means keeping away from her.

1103
01:39:48,262 --> 01:39:49,980
I can't hear you, Joe.

1104
01:39:51,662 --> 01:39:54,051
I love her!

1105
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:58,218
Joe, if you really love her,
I mean if you really love her...

1106
01:39:58,382 --> 01:40:00,134
...then you help her.

1107
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:03,332
- How?
- You set an example.

1108
01:40:03,502 --> 01:40:06,938
Show her that an alky can beat the rap.
Give her something to aim at.

1109
01:40:07,102 --> 01:40:09,093
Come on, will you do that?

1110
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:19,097
Oh, boy. I should have never told you
about that guy with the pruning shears.

1111
01:40:31,062 --> 01:40:32,780
Hello, Pop.

1112
01:40:35,342 --> 01:40:37,651
I told you before, Joe.

1113
01:40:38,302 --> 01:40:40,054
Don't come here.

1114
01:40:40,782 --> 01:40:44,616
I've got something important, Pop,
something I have to talk to you about.

1115
01:40:46,422 --> 01:40:48,617
Really, this means a lot to me.

1116
01:40:55,662 --> 01:40:58,893
- Kirs gone out someplace, or-?
- She's gone to the movies.

1117
01:41:00,142 --> 01:41:01,370
She okay?

1118
01:41:01,542 --> 01:41:04,739
- You come here to talk about Kirsty?
- No, I didn't.

1119
01:41:05,582 --> 01:41:07,971
Tell you what I came to talk about, Pop.

1120
01:41:08,742 --> 01:41:10,858
I've come to square accounts with you.

1121
01:41:14,302 --> 01:41:16,054
First of all...

1122
01:41:16,222 --> 01:41:22,013
...the $500 that you lent us that time
to try and get started again.

1123
01:41:22,822 --> 01:41:27,338
We spent it, most of it,
on a couple of benders.

1124
01:41:28,902 --> 01:41:31,860
Really didn't make much effort
to get straightened out.

1125
01:41:32,142 --> 01:41:35,020
I just stayed drunk as long
as the money lasted.

1126
01:41:35,862 --> 01:41:38,137
We lied to you about that.

1127
01:41:38,822 --> 01:41:42,371
- I know you worked hard for that.
- You started my daughter drinking.

1128
01:41:42,542 --> 01:41:46,535
- Pop, please listen, I'm-
- You started my daughter drinking.

1129
01:41:46,822 --> 01:41:49,655
When she lived here with her mama
and me she never drank.

1130
01:41:49,822 --> 01:41:52,177
We never gave her even one beer.

1131
01:41:52,342 --> 01:41:55,459
- You started her!
- Pop, what are you-?

1132
01:41:55,622 --> 01:42:00,616
Pop!Don't!Are you nuts?
Now, what are you trying to do?

1133
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:08,095
Pop?

1134
01:42:09,422 --> 01:42:11,492
Sure, we drank together.

1135
01:42:11,662 --> 01:42:13,618
And we did right from the start, but-

1136
01:42:13,782 --> 01:42:15,340
Where is she?

1137
01:42:16,462 --> 01:42:18,612
She's been gone three days!

1138
01:42:19,622 --> 01:42:21,294
My girl.

1139
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:24,132
- My girl.
- Pop...

1140
01:42:25,822 --> 01:42:28,290
She went off with another bum.

1141
01:42:29,062 --> 01:42:31,371
Not the same one, another one.

1142
01:42:31,542 --> 01:42:34,056
It's always another bum.

1143
01:42:34,702 --> 01:42:36,294
It's always:

1144
01:42:36,462 --> 01:42:40,137
"Good night, Dad. I'll be home early. "

1145
01:42:40,302 --> 01:42:44,898
"Good night, Kirsty.
I'll leave the light on in the kitchen. "

1146
01:42:46,222 --> 01:42:49,294
I always turn it off in the morning, Joe.

1147
01:42:51,262 --> 01:42:53,537
I thought you told me
she was getting better.

1148
01:42:53,702 --> 01:42:58,378
Two weeks ago she was in the hospital
three days. Sick to death from drinking.

1149
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:00,692
Can't you tell her that...?

1150
01:43:00,862 --> 01:43:04,218
Tell her how well I'm doing.
Tell her all about the new apartment.

1151
01:43:04,382 --> 01:43:07,738
- Tell her I'll take her back any time.
- She wouldn't have listened.

1152
01:43:07,902 --> 01:43:11,451
Well, tell her... Debbie cries for her.

1153
01:43:11,622 --> 01:43:13,692
Then she'd get drunk for sure.

1154
01:43:13,862 --> 01:43:15,932
I don't know what to do.

1155
01:43:16,102 --> 01:43:18,252
I don't know what to tell Debbie.

1156
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:23,016
Well, Pop...

1157
01:43:23,182 --> 01:43:26,379
...there's some things we can be
thankful for. Now...

1158
01:43:26,542 --> 01:43:31,377
...I'm working steady and I'm sober.
And I'm starting to pay you back, Pop.

1159
01:43:31,542 --> 01:43:35,376
The $500, there's the first installment.
I'll pay for her hospital bill too.

1160
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:36,770
- No.
- Yes, I am.

1161
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:41,970
I'll pay you board as long as she stays
here and for the plants I ruined that time.

1162
01:43:42,142 --> 01:43:44,781
I don't need for you to do that, Joe.

1163
01:43:44,942 --> 01:43:47,012
Pop, you don't understand.

1164
01:43:48,022 --> 01:43:50,217
I need for me to do it.

1165
01:45:04,502 --> 01:45:06,094
Kirs.

1166
01:45:06,742 --> 01:45:08,539
Debbie asleep?

1167
01:45:09,422 --> 01:45:11,458
Yes, it's after 11.

1168
01:45:12,662 --> 01:45:14,937
I didn't want her to see me.

1169
01:45:17,742 --> 01:45:19,972
- You don't look so-
- So bad?

1170
01:45:20,142 --> 01:45:22,656
Not as bad as you imagined I would.

1171
01:45:22,822 --> 01:45:25,131
Well, thanks for trying,
but I know how I look.

1172
01:45:25,302 --> 01:45:27,816
This is the way I look when I'm sober.

1173
01:45:28,142 --> 01:45:31,179
That's enough to make a person drink,
wouldn't you say?

1174
01:45:40,022 --> 01:45:41,421
Joe...

1175
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:44,142
...I haven't had a drink in two days.

1176
01:45:44,982 --> 01:45:47,098
Well, that's wonderful.

1177
01:45:47,702 --> 01:45:49,420
It wasn't easy.

1178
01:45:49,582 --> 01:45:52,016
But I wanted to talk to you, so I...

1179
01:45:52,182 --> 01:45:56,539
I thought I'd try and deserve it, at least
a little. Sort of a penance, you might say.

1180
01:45:56,782 --> 01:46:01,219
You'd be surprised how much fun you can
have sober, when you get the hang of it.

1181
01:46:01,382 --> 01:46:03,373
And you've got the hang of it?

1182
01:46:03,542 --> 01:46:05,100
Think so.

1183
01:46:06,182 --> 01:46:07,695
Believe me, it's the greatest.

1184
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:10,171
Joe, wouldn't it be wonderful
to begin again?

1185
01:46:10,342 --> 01:46:13,061
Just erase everything in between,
start all over?

1186
01:46:13,222 --> 01:46:15,213
Getting excited over a chocolate bar?

1187
01:46:19,422 --> 01:46:20,901
I wanna come home.

1188
01:46:28,742 --> 01:46:31,210
I know what you're thinking about.

1189
01:46:33,382 --> 01:46:35,942
A lot's happened, lots of...

1190
01:46:36,462 --> 01:46:38,054
...detours.

1191
01:46:39,062 --> 01:46:42,737
There were plenty of them, but they
were nothing. I never looked at them.

1192
01:46:42,902 --> 01:46:46,611
They had no identity. I never gave
anything out of myself to them.

1193
01:46:46,782 --> 01:46:50,616
I thought they'd help me
from being so lonely.

1194
01:46:50,782 --> 01:46:55,333
But love is the only thing that keeps you
from being lonely and I didn't have that.

1195
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:57,941
Kirs...

1196
01:46:59,222 --> 01:47:03,659
There's a little girl asleep in there that
would love to wake up and see you here.

1197
01:47:03,822 --> 01:47:06,017
All you've gotta do
is say the right words.

1198
01:47:06,382 --> 01:47:10,660
I don't know if I have the right words,
that's why it took me so long to get here.

1199
01:47:13,462 --> 01:47:16,659
You see, the world looks so dirty
to me when I'm not drinking.

1200
01:47:16,822 --> 01:47:20,098
Remember Fisherman's Wharf?
The water when you look too close?

1201
01:47:20,262 --> 01:47:22,901
That's the way the world looks
when I'm not drinking.

1202
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:26,372
I don't think I could ever stop drinking
completely, not like you.

1203
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:28,373
- You could!
- If I really wanted to?

1204
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:30,851
Well, I don't. I know that now.

1205
01:47:31,902 --> 01:47:34,621
I want things to look prettier
than they are.

1206
01:47:35,822 --> 01:47:39,497
But I know I could be all right,
if you'd help me. I know I could.

1207
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:42,699
If we were together and things
were like they used to be...

1208
01:47:42,862 --> 01:47:44,898
...and I wasn't so nervous.

1209
01:47:45,062 --> 01:47:48,771
I need to be loved. I get so lonely
from not being loved I can't stand it.

1210
01:47:49,142 --> 01:47:50,939
I love you.

1211
01:47:51,502 --> 01:47:52,776
I'm afraid of you.

1212
01:47:52,942 --> 01:47:56,298
I'm an alcoholic, I can't take a drink.
I'm afraid of what we'd do.

1213
01:47:56,462 --> 01:47:58,134
If you'd just say that you'd try.

1214
01:47:58,702 --> 01:48:01,739
But I can't face the idea
of never having another drink.

1215
01:48:01,902 --> 01:48:05,019
- Just one day at a time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't!

1216
01:48:05,182 --> 01:48:09,460
Doesn't it impress you that I have been
sober for almost a year and I'm happy?

1217
01:48:09,622 --> 01:48:11,340
I'm working steady.
I feel great.

1218
01:48:11,502 --> 01:48:15,051
Debbie and I are living in a decent
place again, all because I'm sober.

1219
01:48:15,622 --> 01:48:16,816
Yes.

1220
01:48:16,982 --> 01:48:20,611
- There's plenty of room.
- You're strong. I know you can help me.

1221
01:48:20,782 --> 01:48:23,660
- If we only had it back like it was.
- Back like it-?

1222
01:48:23,822 --> 01:48:25,574
Do you remember how it really was?

1223
01:48:25,742 --> 01:48:28,620
You and me and booze.
A threesome, do you remember?

1224
01:48:28,782 --> 01:48:32,297
- Not that it wasn't great.
- We can have it back that way again, if...

1225
01:48:32,462 --> 01:48:36,216
If I'll drink with you. But I'm not
gonna drink with you. It's finished!

1226
01:48:36,382 --> 01:48:39,340
I wouldn't ask you to drink with me.
I'd control myself.

1227
01:48:39,502 --> 01:48:42,972
You can't control yourself,
you're an alcoholic, the same as I am.

1228
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,177
No, no.

1229
01:48:44,342 --> 01:48:48,017
You and I were a couple of drunks
on the sea of booze, and the boat sank.

1230
01:48:48,182 --> 01:48:51,970
I got ahold of something that kept me
from going under. I'm not letting go.

1231
01:48:52,142 --> 01:48:53,575
Not for you, not for anyone.

1232
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,932
If you want to grab on, grab on.

1233
01:48:57,262 --> 01:49:00,254
But there's just room for you and me,
no threesome.

1234
01:49:13,662 --> 01:49:16,495
I can't get over how dirty
everything looks.

1235
01:49:16,662 --> 01:49:19,335
Try it one more day.

1236
01:49:20,702 --> 01:49:23,375
- Why?
- For her.

1237
01:49:24,262 --> 01:49:25,900
Come and look at her.

1238
01:49:37,062 --> 01:49:38,700
I can't.

1239
01:49:39,022 --> 01:49:40,421
I can't.

1240
01:49:45,462 --> 01:49:47,020
You better give up on me.

1241
01:49:48,302 --> 01:49:49,496
Not yet.

1242
01:49:51,462 --> 01:49:52,975
Thanks.

1243
01:49:54,862 --> 01:49:56,341
Good night.

1244
01:49:58,062 --> 01:49:59,575
Kirs?

1245
01:50:05,622 --> 01:50:07,101
Take care of yourself?

1246
01:50:17,942 --> 01:50:19,614
Kirs!

1247
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:56,774
Daddy?

1248
01:51:05,982 --> 01:51:08,655
I thought I heard you call Mommy.

1249
01:51:09,982 --> 01:51:12,291
You must have been dreaming, honey.

1250
01:51:12,462 --> 01:51:14,418
Let's go back to bed.

1251
01:51:19,622 --> 01:51:22,011
When is Mommy coming home?

1252
01:51:25,222 --> 01:51:27,019
Honey, Mommy's sick.

1253
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:29,650
And she has to get well
before she can come home.

1254
01:51:30,862 --> 01:51:32,818
Is she going to get well?

1255
01:51:35,422 --> 01:51:37,174
I did, didn't I?

1256
01:51:41,662 --> 01:51:43,254
Go to sleep.

1257
01:51:43,662 --> 01:51:44,936
Okay.

1258
01:51:45,662 --> 01:51:47,300
Night-night.

1259
01:51:47,462 --> 01:51:49,293
Good night, honey.
