1
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:27,328
- Hi, Lennart, it's Pelle.
- Hi, Pelle.

2
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:30,232
- This bloody cough!
- Terrible!

3
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:32,634
It was good of you to come.

4
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:37,936
- Sorry, Lennart, didn't catch that.
- It was good of you to come!

5
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:43,580
Well sure, you asked me to,
but I can wait outside.

6
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:47,311
No, no, no. Stay here.
I'm flying to Barcelona at 3.

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,989
Right then.

8
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,750
You're not pleased, so l hear.

9
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:55,725
No, actually I'm not, Lennart.
I think it's a shame.

10
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:59,326
This is no fun.
We'll soon be up to 700.

11
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:00,626
Who said anything about fun!

12
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,771
You know very well
we have to make it to a thousand.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,906
You really mean that, Lennart!

14
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:08,167
I do.

15
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,111
Everything has its day, Pelle.

16
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:16,147
Yes, but...

17
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,886
The pyramids had their day.

18
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:20,645
Of course they did.

19
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:23,222
- Steam engines had their day.
- Sorry...didn't quite catch that.

20
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:26,724
Steam engines had their day.

21
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,829
That's true.

22
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:39,002
This is a new day and age, Pelle.
You have to realize that.

23
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:41,766
True enough, but still...

24
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:46,277
If this keeps up
we'll have to shut down entirely.

25
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,073
That would be a disaster
for a lot of people.

26
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,478
What's that got to do with us!

27
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:54,449
- You have a point...
- Then we will not be here, Pelle.

28
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:56,449
Sorry, Lennart, what do you mean!

29
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:59,822
I mean, what's the point of staying
where there is only misery!

30
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:04,730
No, there's no point.

31
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,595
When that day comes
I'll be long gone...

32
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,198
...and so should you!

33
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:33,975
Beloved be the one who sits down.

34
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,273
SONGS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR

35
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:10,795
Very nice!

36
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:13,763
Oh yes, the old boy
must look his best.

37
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:17,037
Pelle Wigert wants to
meet me today.

38
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:21,364
- And what does he want!
- We'll have to wait and see.

39
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,312
Lasse...

40
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,411
It would be nice if you could
stay home today-

41
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,085
-when I have my day off.

42
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:33,584
Sure, but how would it look!

43
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:36,882
I haven't missed a day in 14 years.

44
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:40,150
It would be nice all the same.

45
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,160
Everything has its day, dear.

46
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:49,170
There's a time for work,
There's a time for everything else.

47
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:58,235
No, no, no!

48
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:00,641
Everything has its day, dear.

49
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,441
You old dullard!

50
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:09,686
Bye.

51
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,323
Goodbye, you traitor!

52
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:28,774
- Would you please let go!
- No, no, no, no!

53
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:34,414
- Pull yourself together, Lasse.
- No, no, no, no!

54
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,641
Pull yourself together!

55
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,285
I've been here for 30 years!

56
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,546
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

57
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:45,692
- I've been here for 30 years!
- There's nothing I can do.

58
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:48,624
I've been here for 30 years!

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,961
There's nothing I can do.

60
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,871
There's nothing I can do!

61
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:02,840
- But I've been here for 30 years!
- There's nothing I can do.

62
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,685
I've been here for 30 years, Pelle!

63
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:29,059
I've been here for 30 years!

64
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,151
Yes?

65
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,330
Is there an Allan Svensson here!

66
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,799
No, there isn't.

67
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,468
He's not here!

68
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,775
Close the door!

69
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:53,378
Excuse me, is Allan Svensson here!

70
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,912
What are you doing here!

71
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,085
What the hell are you doing here!

72
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,226
- He's talking to you.
- What do you want!

73
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,990
- I look for man, he not here.
- Speak clearly!

74
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,527
- What did you say!
- I look for man, he not here.

75
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,465
What's up?

76
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:48,266
- Who are you looking for!
- Allan Svensson.

77
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,307
What the hell are you doing here!

78
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:41,318
Lasse... Yoo-hoo!

79
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,524
What happened?

80
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,789
Such heavy traffic!

81
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,733
Even though it's so late...

82
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,707
What's wrong, Pelle?

83
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:31,035
We'll buy a new golf club.

84
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,607
We'll buy a new one!

85
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,259
Could I have a volunteer?

86
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,228
Over here!

87
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:55,561
There's one there!
- Welcome up on stage!

88
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,283
- Could I take that for you!
- Sure.

89
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,599
When are you going to
get a divorce!

90
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,571
When will you do it!

91
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:24,636
Answer me!

92
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,769
Let's move along a bit then,
shall we!

93
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,308
Move! Oh. Right.

94
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,362
There we go.

95
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:11,677
You have to believe me, Krister.

96
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:14,745
You have to believe me!

97
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:17,377
I'm stuck here!

98
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:22,746
I haven't advanced more than
a few hundred yards in four hours!

99
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,929
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,865
Krister, I swear...

101
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,371
- Hi.
- Hiya.

102
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,905
Darling, what shall I do?

103
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,680
How are you?

104
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:55,380
What can I say?

105
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,685
It's not easy being human.

106
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:02,794
I agree.

107
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:08,961
- You noticed your boy's here.
- Yes.

108
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,968
He's been sitting and waiting
for hours.

109
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:17,075
You think I look like this
for no reason?

110
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,810
No.

111
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,913
Dare I ask what you've done?

112
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:27,281
Done! I'm ruined. The entire
business has gone up in smoke.

113
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:28,318
What's that?

114
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,013
I said, the entire business
has gone up in smoke!

115
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:40,825
Hi.

116
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,066
What have you done?

117
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:47,470
I'm ruined.

118
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,599
Don't you see?

119
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:53,103
The whole firm
has gone up in smoke.

120
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:57,774
Look at this...

121
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:00,283
The books!

122
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:04,348
Nothing could be saved.

123
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,815
It's a fortune!

124
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,432
Maybe it's just as well...

125
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:16,960
Is that what you have to say to
your father, when he's in trouble?

126
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,167
I've been waiting for you.

127
00:18:20,662 --> 00:18:22,801
I want to talk to you.

128
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:24,910
About what?

129
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,637
You know - the future.

130
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:31,648
How everything's going to...be.

131
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:35,452
What we're going to do.

132
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,592
How we're going to get by.

133
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:42,752
How we're going to put
food on the table.

134
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:45,223
Enjoy ourselves.

135
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:52,034
Does anyone know
how to get out of here?

136
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:54,073
No.

137
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,473
You could have called.

138
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:25,482
Something terrible has happened.

139
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:30,993
The entire business
has burnt down.

140
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,404
Nothing but ashes...

141
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:42,998
I'm the one who set fire to it-

142
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:46,071
-and I think
I'm going to be found out.

143
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:48,145
- Don't you see!
- Dear God!

144
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:50,442
I'm the one who set fire to it!

145
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,683
I think I'm going to be found out.

146
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:45,562
Some traffic jam over there,
don't you think?

147
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:51,105
It's been at a standstill for more
than 8 hours. No one knows why.

148
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:54,876
The whole town
seems to be going somewhere.

149
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,175
Everyone in the same direction.

150
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,778
Makes you wonder
where they're headed.

151
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,488
The people...

152
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:07,527
Do you know where they're headed?
Where they are going?

153
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,394
Well...

154
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:15,458
- Do you want some bread?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

155
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:19,264
- It's good. There's mustard on it.
- No, thanks.

156
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:25,941
You live around here?

157
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,271
Not any more.

158
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:30,514
What the hell are you doing here,
then!

159
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:32,513
I was just passing by.

160
00:23:36,578 --> 00:23:38,489
I used to live up there.

161
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,128
At the top,
to the left of the drainpipe.

162
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:43,557
Really?

163
00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:46,733
- I got thrown out.
- Thrown out?

164
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,700
Yeah, she didn't want me any more.

165
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:55,507
Gee, that makes me sad.
I'm really sorry to hear that.

166
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,872
Bloody hell...

167
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,069
Ask me, I know.

168
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,141
What was her name?

169
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:05,945
Susanne.

170
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:11,382
Susanne, don't be so cruel!

171
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,925
Open your door to a man
who hungers and thirsts.

172
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:20,231
Don't be so cruel, Susanne!

173
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:23,597
Bloody hell, what beasts!

174
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,970
Maybe there's more...

175
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:39,543
Susanne!

176
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:44,581
Don't be so cruel, Susanne!

177
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,684
Open your door to a man
who hungers and thirsts.

178
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:50,420
Who the hell is that?
How come you know him?

179
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,630
I don't know who it is.

180
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:03,300
You've got to believe me, Micke.

181
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:07,908
It's true...
I don't know who it is.

182
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:25,529
Yes, well naturally,
I tried to put it out.

183
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:28,532
But I couldn't.

184
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,767
I almost caught fire myself.

185
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:38,072
You see before you
a fortune turned to ashes.

186
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,340
Everything happens to me!

187
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:45,345
One catastrophe after the other.

188
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,381
Has there been a fire
anywhere else!

189
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:49,487
No, there hasn't.

190
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:53,957
There are other catastrophes
besides fires.

191
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,321
That are much worse.

192
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,454
I have two sons.

193
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:01,662
The oldest...

194
00:26:02,724 --> 00:26:06,103
- ...he's seriously ill.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

195
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:11,607
Yeah, he's lost his mind.
He wrote poetry until he went nuts.

196
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,040
Oh dear!

197
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:16,079
Yes, it's terrible.

198
00:26:16,872 --> 00:26:20,445
What's a few charred pieces of
furniture compared with that?

199
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:22,315
Nothing!

200
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:26,418
Of course, they were expensive.

201
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,418
Well...not this one.

202
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:35,728
But there was a Chippendale suite
over there.

203
00:26:41,263 --> 00:26:42,970
A sofa.

204
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,645
Two armchairs.

205
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,377
Top quality!

206
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:56,314
78,000.

207
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:01,559
Do you have that on paper?

208
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,388
Paper?

209
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:06,128
Obviously,
they've gone up in smoke.

210
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:09,865
But a Chippendale is a Chippendale.

211
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:13,096
Even if it's not on paper...

212
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:16,306
You, for example.

213
00:27:16,498 --> 00:27:20,412
You are who you are, whether or not
anybody's written it down.

214
00:27:20,602 --> 00:27:22,275
- Aren't you?
- Quite, quite.

215
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,314
Well, then we'll have to
count on that.

216
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,247
This, this is my youngest son.

217
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:33,320
They're from the insurance company-

218
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:35,688
-or so they say...

219
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:39,022
So, we'll just...have to take
their word on that.

220
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:52,535
In case you have trouble
understanding this-

221
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:57,114
-you may as well join the crowd
and do some good!

222
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,913
Stock prices are falling.

223
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,386
The bottom's falling out all over.

224
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:09,295
They're fighting for better times-

225
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:16,265
-and here you stand and quibble
over a sofa and a few armchairs.

226
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,199
Hi, Thomas.

227
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:28,965
Here we go again...

228
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:34,270
What have I done, Thomas?
What have I done wrong?!

229
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:39,317
He doesn't answer.
He doesn't answer today either.

230
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:43,217
Can't even say "hi"
to his own father!

231
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:47,417
He wrote poetry until he went nuts.

232
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,959
It's okay, Thomas.

233
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,301
The kids are fine.

234
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:00,495
Elisabeth too.

235
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:06,538
I drop by now and then.
You don't have to worry about them.

236
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:09,213
Or about the car.
I drive as much as I can.

237
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:12,112
Good thing someone cares!

238
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:17,951
He left his taxi and family
to fend for themselves.

239
00:30:18,313 --> 00:30:21,317
Wrote poetry until he went nuts.

240
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:25,396
It's awful! It's just awful!

241
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:34,566
Beloved be the unknown man
and his wife.

242
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:42,540
My fellow man with sleeves,
neck and eyes.

243
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:47,677
Beloved be the one
who sleeps on his back.

244
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:52,818
The one who wears
a torn shoe in the rain.

245
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:59,656
Beloved be the bald man
without hat.

246
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,033
Beloved be the one who
catches a finger in a door.

247
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:07,900
Catches a finger...
What's so special about that?

248
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:12,511
It's happened to everyone.
He wrote poetry until he went nuts.

249
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:18,482
Beloved be the one who sweats
out of pain or out of shame.

250
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:21,847
What kind of nonsense is this?
Give me my smock.

251
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:26,550
The smock!

252
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,933
The one who pays with
what he does not have...

253
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:39,830
There was a wallet here too.
Where is it?

254
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:49,943
Beloved be the people who sit down.

255
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:52,118
Sit down?!

256
00:31:52,373 --> 00:31:54,353
- What's with that?!
- Calm down now!

257
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,681
Beloved be the one who sits down!

258
00:31:56,878 --> 00:31:57,788
Take it easy!

259
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:00,357
Why should you love him, eh!

260
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:02,787
- Look at that brother of yours.
- Take it easy!

261
00:32:02,984 --> 00:32:05,021
He sits where he sits.

262
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,166
No yelling in here. Calm down now.

263
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:14,067
He sits where he sits!

264
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:19,705
Who's going to come along
and love him, then!

265
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:23,576
Can no one help him?!

266
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:43,524
It's good of the vicar to let me
come and talk to him.

267
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,428
See, it's like this...

268
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:03,209
My entire business
has gone up in smoke.

269
00:34:03,971 --> 00:34:06,247
It's nothing but ashes.

270
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:13,520
And I have a son who's gone mad.

271
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:17,422
Makes you wonder
where you've gone wrong.

272
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:21,661
You can't talk to him.

273
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,195
He doesn't respond.

274
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:30,843
I'm at my wits end.

275
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:35,208
At the end of your wits...
So, who isn't?

276
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:39,282
I've been trying to get
my house sold for four years.

277
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:41,653
No luck.

278
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,918
I'm going to lose 200 thousand -
at least.

279
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:49,760
That's a shame.

280
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:52,830
A shame. A real shame.

281
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:58,459
What about me, then? I paid for
a trip and then the travel agency-

282
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:00,195
-went bankrupt, the money's gone.

283
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:02,773
It's all because of
the stock prices.

284
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:06,241
They...they go up and down.

285
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:09,506
- It's frightful!
- I quite agree.

286
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:13,746
Beloved be the one who sits down.

287
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:15,585
I beg your pardon?

288
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,986
Beloved be the one who sits down.

289
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,258
When are you going to do it?

290
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,893
You could answer at least.

291
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,920
It's nice to sit down for a bit.

292
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,991
I've walked all the way
from the Station.

293
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:51,598
I thought...

294
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:54,395
"It'll be quicker to walk",
I thought to myself.

295
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:56,807
In chaos like this,
that just keeps up-

296
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:59,308
-without anyone being able to give
a reasonable explanation.

297
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:02,680
But it was along way.

298
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,043
Longer than I thought.

299
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm in a hurry. I'm late.

300
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,122
I overslept.

301
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:17,125
- I had nightmares.
- Oh dear.

302
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:19,798
Where are we going?

303
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:22,160
I'm going to visit our former
Commander-in-chief-

304
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:24,233
-who has a birthday today.

305
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:27,968
- He's turned a hundred.
- I see...

306
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:30,138
Where does he live?

307
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:34,871
Where do you think someone lives
who's reached such a venerable age-

308
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:37,276
-and who doesn't have to
count his pennies.

309
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:41,548
- St George's rest home.
- St George's.

310
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,785
A lot of people will be paying
their respects.

311
00:39:47,982 --> 00:39:50,826
Admiral Bengtsson
is going to make a speech.

312
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:55,026
And can you guess
who wrote the speech.

313
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:56,701
No.

314
00:39:58,025 --> 00:39:59,663
I did.

315
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:03,703
That's my main job these days -
writing speeches...

316
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:08,513
But it still makes me nervous
every time.

317
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:10,912
Terribly nervous.

318
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:18,356
Fact is, I had to nip into
the Grand Hotel and have a drink.

319
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:20,590
I needed one.

320
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,857
Well, three...
to be perfectly honest.

321
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:30,792
So now I'm actually quite
pleased with what I've written.

322
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:38,408
My approach was a rather
philosophical one.

323
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:41,873
About being human -
year after year...

324
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,281
This is how l see it...

325
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,818
Life is time and
time is a stretch of road.

326
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,017
That makes life a journey, a trip.

327
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:58,187
- Don't you think so?
- Yes.

328
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:00,664
I guess you could
look at it that way.

329
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,771
And to be able to travel you have
to have a map and a compass.

330
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:08,370
Otherwise you don't know
where you are.

331
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:11,202
- Do you?
- No.

332
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,707
And our map and compass...

333
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:17,077
...are our traditions.

334
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,751
Our heritage, our history.

335
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,712
- Aren't they?
- Yeah, sure.

336
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:25,582
If we don't understand this...

337
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,592
Before we know it,
we're fumbling around in the dark.

338
00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:34,388
Where are we?

339
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:37,595
Well, actually we haven't moved
more than a few yards.

340
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,204
- We haven't?
- No.

341
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,554
They keep delivering more flowers!

342
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,721
Sure they do - when someone
celebrates his 100th birthday.

343
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:11,595
And been so clever. Become both
general and millionaire.

344
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:15,069
Millionaire?
To put it mildly.

345
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:18,473
He's one of the largest landowners
in the country.

346
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:22,910
20,000 acres of cultivated land
and twice as much woodland.

347
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:26,375
How much is that?
60,000 acres.

348
00:42:26,941 --> 00:42:28,887
How many square metres is that?

349
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:32,780
-240 million, isn't it?
- Exactly!

350
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,018
Two hundred and forty million
square metres of land.

351
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:39,855
And eight lakes on his property.

352
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:45,960
- Fantastic!
Unbelievable!

353
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,798
Really.

354
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:50,936
Uh-oh. I think it's time
for the bed-pan.

355
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:54,237
- Anna, the bed-pan!
- It's on the way...

356
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,314
They're here now.

357
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:06,115
They're here now.

358
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:48,931
Right honorable general and
Commander-in-chief Emeritus.

359
00:43:49,556 --> 00:43:51,661
It is man's fate to grow older.

360
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:56,274
Year is added to year,
experience to experience-

361
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:59,444
-during our never-ending journey
around the sun.

362
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,312
Honored general and, if I may
say so, dear colleague.

363
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:06,475
Few people are privileged to-

364
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:09,553
-have made such a
large number of circuits-

365
00:44:09,743 --> 00:44:11,916
-around the sun
as you, sir, have done.

366
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:18,252
When you now begin a new circuit,
your 101st-

367
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:21,198
-is in my capacity on-

368
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:22,833
-the headquarters joint staff-

369
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:25,799
-have the task, pleasure
and honor to-

370
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:28,968
-on behalf of all branches of
the armed forces-

371
00:44:29,163 --> 00:44:31,666
-extend our hearty congratulations
to you, sir-

372
00:44:32,032 --> 00:44:33,807
-as a person and as a human being-

373
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:36,880
-and as a representative of-

374
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:40,644
-the safeguarding of our country,
our traditions-

375
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:44,311
-our distinctive character
and our history.

376
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:46,991
My best to Goering.

377
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:50,185
- I beg your pardon?
- My best to Goering.

378
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:58,058
Sound the regiment's
recognition signal.

379
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,903
Hoist the flags!

380
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:07,804
- Where have you been?
- Sorry...

381
00:46:07,995 --> 00:46:09,565
Hi!

382
00:46:11,498 --> 00:46:15,071
What do you mean, "been"?
I've been all over.

383
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:21,242
I've driven all over town -
around and around...

384
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:25,155
...and listened to people
with problems.

385
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:27,955
I asked where you've been.

386
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:30,359
Yeah...and then...

387
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:35,255
Well, then I felt like
having a beer.

388
00:46:35,622 --> 00:46:38,501
At least three, to be honest.

389
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:48,012
At least six, to be honest.

390
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:49,237
You could have called.

391
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:52,645
Seven, to be perfectly honest.

392
00:46:53,107 --> 00:46:55,178
You didn't have to come.

393
00:46:58,312 --> 00:47:03,318
Damn it, should just sell
that bloody car-

394
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:05,658
-this minute.

395
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,660
Thomas can't drive a taxi.

396
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,103
He's too soft.

397
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:16,301
He takes everything to heart.

398
00:47:18,932 --> 00:47:20,138
What?!

399
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:23,542
I'm not allowed here?

400
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:26,946
- Why not?
- You don't love me.

401
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,190
Beloved be the one who sits down.

402
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:47,562
Beloved be the one who sits down!

403
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:57,429
...who sits down.

404
00:48:00,507 --> 00:48:02,646
Beloved be the one...

405
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:13,362
Rune...

406
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:20,194
"Do unto others"-

407
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:27,137
-"as you would have them do
unto you."

408
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:30,839
In other words...

409
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:35,342
If you want me to make you happy-

410
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:39,915
-you have to make me happy.

411
00:48:40,113 --> 00:48:41,558
Right?

412
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:45,657
But you haven't done that. You've
made me damned disappointed.

413
00:48:46,787 --> 00:48:48,926
Have you seen the nails?

414
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:52,499
You come here, you sit down
and start talking business-

415
00:48:52,693 --> 00:48:55,606
-without any dough.
Who the hell do you think you are!

416
00:48:55,796 --> 00:49:00,142
I was thinking you could give me
them on credit, Uffe. 30 days?

417
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:04,708
30 days?! Who the hell knows
what's happened to you in 30 days?

418
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,745
I'm really in a bind, Uffe.

419
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:11,684
Kalle! Well, I'll be damned!

420
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:13,949
- You're here this year too!
- Yeah, so they say...

421
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:17,560
Alive and kicking! And here was me
thinking you'd been burnt to death.

422
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:19,059
How're you doing?

423
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:22,393
Oh, you know how it is, Uffe,
in times like these.

424
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:25,626
You have to struggle for
every crumb.

425
00:49:26,693 --> 00:49:30,835
Try to find something you can sell
- with an extra zero on the end...

426
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:33,602
In that case you've come to the
right place, Kalle. Take a seat!

427
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:45,553
- Hi, Kalle.
- Hiya.

428
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:50,451
- Sit down.
- Sure.

429
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:53,154
I see, so you're tackling that
this year.

430
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:56,163
Yes, I have to survive too.

431
00:49:56,857 --> 00:50:00,669
Here is the product you can put
two extra zeros on.

432
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:03,398
- You think so?
- Think?!

433
00:50:03,597 --> 00:50:07,135
We're heading for the year 2,000.
Two thousand, Kalle!

434
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:09,245
And here's the one
whose birthday it is.

435
00:50:09,436 --> 00:50:12,645
You only get a chance like this
once in a lifetime.

436
00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:14,775
It'll be another thousand years-

437
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:16,750
-before this man
is so important again.

438
00:50:16,943 --> 00:50:19,514
I won't be around then.

439
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:23,554
This, this suits you, Kalle.

440
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:26,830
It suits an old furniture salesman.

441
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:29,997
Come here. Between you and me...
check it out.

442
00:50:30,357 --> 00:50:32,997
There are already too many in on-

443
00:50:33,193 --> 00:50:36,072
-the champagne and fireworks.

444
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:38,402
Choose three sizes.

445
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:43,114
Take along an order-book.
Get out there and make some money!

446
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,179
Gee, I don't know, Uffe.
I'm so tired.

447
00:50:47,574 --> 00:50:49,986
I already have a cross to bear.

448
00:50:51,078 --> 00:50:53,786
The insurance company
is giving me a hard time.

449
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:56,218
And I also have a son
who's gone mad.

450
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:57,053
You what?

451
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,992
Yeah, he wrote poetry
until he went nuts.

452
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,364
Well, there won't be any money
but that'll blow over.

453
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:05,503
It'll blow over, Kalle.

454
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:09,070
- You think so?
- You shouldn't think so damn much.

455
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:11,037
It's not good.

456
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:45,909
- What happened?
- That's a good question.

457
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:48,602
He's stuck.
He's stuck in the door.

458
00:51:48,802 --> 00:51:51,578
Well obviously, I can see that.
But how did it happen?

459
00:51:51,772 --> 00:51:53,683
He slipped, I guess.

460
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:56,079
Slipped?
- Yes.

461
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,548
- How clumsy can you get?
- It could happen to anyone.

462
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:05,254
He slipped and fell backwards and
hit his other arm against the door.

463
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:09,264
- And it shut.
- Well, it's clumsy all the same.

464
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:14,230
Try to take it easy.
We'll help you in a minute.

465
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:20,535
My colleague will come and open
the door carefully from the inside.

466
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:26,511
Here he is now.
He's opening the door now.

467
00:52:43,457 --> 00:52:45,869
- That's not so bad.
- It wasn't so bad, was it?

468
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:46,867
It wasn't so bad.

469
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,006
It wasn't so bad, was it?

470
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:13,161
Poor man!
It could happen to the best of us.

471
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,262
Our son got himself stuck
in a deckchair last year.

472
00:53:16,456 --> 00:53:19,027
- No, it was three years ago.
- Wasn't it last year?

473
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:21,432
No, it was three years ago.

474
00:53:22,229 --> 00:53:24,607
What about me? I got my finger
caught in a dresser drawer-

475
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:25,606
-and it really hurt.

476
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:27,005
And that was ten years ago.

477
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,703
And look,
you can still see the gash.

478
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,843
- Hi.
- Hi.

479
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,589
- It's been ages...
- Yes, it has.

480
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:02,604
It got empty all of a sudden.

481
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:09,613
- You really scared me, Sven.
- I did?

482
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,282
Yes, you did.

483
00:55:12,505 --> 00:55:15,281
I suddenly felt really guilty.

484
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:18,013
When I caught sight of you, Sven.

485
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:21,392
You understand, I guess.

486
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:29,456
- You know what I thought?
- No.

487
00:55:30,357 --> 00:55:32,667
As a matter of fact,
I thought you were dead, Sven.

488
00:55:34,194 --> 00:55:36,367
I heard you'd committed suicide.

489
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:38,133
Yes, that's right.

490
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:48,317
But for God's sake, Sven,
why did you do that!

491
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:50,784
I had no choice.

492
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:56,858
Sven, am I to blame?

493
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,360
- Is it my fault?
- I didn't say that.

494
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:05,768
He's so unhappy, the poor boy.

495
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:09,497
- What does he want?
- He's gone astray, got lost.

496
00:56:09,696 --> 00:56:12,506
- Are you looking for me?
- He's looking for his sister.

497
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:15,339
- Sister?
- Yes, his sister.

498
00:56:15,702 --> 00:56:18,842
The Germans hanged her-
over in Russia...

499
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:23,280
Then they hanged him too.

500
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:27,555
He's so very unhappy,
because he didn't have time to-

501
00:56:27,747 --> 00:56:29,385
-apologize to her.

502
00:56:29,582 --> 00:56:32,028
- If I've understood correctly.
- Apologize, for what!

503
00:56:32,218 --> 00:56:34,425
He'd done something mean.

504
00:56:34,621 --> 00:56:36,430
Hurt her, I think-

505
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:40,298
-and regretted it, but he didn't
get a chance to make it up to her.

506
00:57:47,556 --> 00:57:50,093
- Please!
- That's awful.

507
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,431
I can't bear to listen.

508
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:56,072
What had they done.
Why did they hang them?

509
00:57:56,732 --> 00:57:59,235
Something to do with being from
the wrong race, I think.

510
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,472
They belonged to the wrong race.

511
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,911
It's terrible...

512
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,780
What happens now?
What's he going to do now?

513
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,421
- Who?
- The boy.

514
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,649
What do you mean, "do"?
He can't do anything.

515
00:58:12,848 --> 00:58:15,158
That's why he's so unhappy.

516
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,653
Don't you see?

517
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:20,857
He didn't get a chance to make it
up to his sister before he died-

518
00:58:21,056 --> 00:58:22,694
-while she was still alive.

519
00:58:24,426 --> 00:58:27,896
Then he was hanging there himself-
from the rope...

520
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:32,571
That's why it's so tragic.

521
00:58:33,368 --> 00:58:37,282
Because he can't do anything -
can't even try...

522
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:39,480
He's dead.

523
00:58:40,742 --> 00:58:42,517
They both are.

524
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:51,591
Sven, how much
did I borrow from you?

525
00:58:52,788 --> 00:58:54,825
Was it 280,000?

526
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:58,537
No, I know, it was 287...

527
00:59:00,062 --> 00:59:02,838
Excuse me for saying so, Sven-

528
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:09,038
- I'm only being honest with you-

529
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:13,309
-but I was relieved
when I heard you were dead.

530
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:18,021
"Now I don't have to pay back
the money," I thought to myself.

531
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:23,123
There wasn't any papers.
I was free from my debt...

532
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:28,233
Good God, Sven, what should I do?

533
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:32,134
I can't very well pay back
the money now, can I?

534
00:59:32,427 --> 00:59:34,464
To me? That would be difficult.

535
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:42,480
I'm only human, Sven.

536
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:47,116
A man does what he can -
struggles to get a bit...

537
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:49,118
...of food on the table.

538
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:52,557
And enjoy himself.

539
01:00:16,805 --> 01:00:18,409
Jesus...

540
01:00:19,474 --> 01:00:21,750
He wasn't the son of God.

541
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:25,654
He was just a nice guy.

542
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,363
That's why he was crucified.

543
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:36,999
- He was tormented and killed.
- What?

544
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:38,899
He was tormented and killed.

545
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,506
- Who?
- Jesus.

546
01:00:41,697 --> 01:00:45,509
- He was crucified.
- Of course he was.

547
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,215
Because he was a nice guy.

548
01:00:58,013 --> 01:01:00,857
Hi, Thomas.

549
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:03,660
Hello.

550
01:01:06,088 --> 01:01:09,092
You could at least say "hi"!

551
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:13,000
- When your granny's here and all!
- Take it easy.

552
01:01:19,668 --> 01:01:21,739
Forgive me, Thomas.

553
01:01:22,671 --> 01:01:25,151
I had something fun to tell you.

554
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:29,687
- I've got a new business concept.
- Me too.

555
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:34,587
I've got a business concept too,
but it's secret.

556
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:41,367
Imagine, Thomas...

557
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:45,629
The insurance company gave in.

558
01:01:46,228 --> 01:01:49,209
And why do you think they did that?

559
01:01:50,232 --> 01:01:53,111
You've got to be able
to speak up for yourself.

560
01:01:53,635 --> 01:01:57,777
Speak plainly
and you'll get results...

561
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:03,523
You can write poems with words too.

562
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:05,857
It's not that.

563
01:02:07,716 --> 01:02:10,219
Why complicate things, Thomas?

564
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:16,899
Life is a market.
It's as simple as that.

565
01:02:18,393 --> 01:02:22,000
It's all about buying something
so you can sell it later-

566
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,642
-with an extra zero.

567
01:02:23,832 --> 01:02:25,277
Or two.

568
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:31,106
The whole world knows that-
everyone but you, it seems.

569
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:35,615
Is there no one who can help you?

570
01:02:35,944 --> 01:02:39,915
- Is there no one who can help you?!
- Take it easy!

571
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,822
You wrote poems until
you went nuts, didn't you?!

572
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:45,555
Easy does it.

573
01:02:45,754 --> 01:02:48,030
It's awful!

574
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,463
Is there no one who can help him?!

575
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,239
...that's why he was crucified.

576
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:58,968
...who can help him?!

577
01:03:02,104 --> 01:03:06,519
Is there no one who can help him?!

578
01:03:25,026 --> 01:03:27,006
It would of course
be an advantage if-

579
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:31,507
-the chairman of the Economic
Faculty's council of experts-

580
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,705
-could at this point present
at least the main features-

581
01:03:35,904 --> 01:03:39,215
-of the long-term perspectives
and strategies-

582
01:03:39,408 --> 01:03:42,321
-which the council would like
to propose to the government.

583
01:03:42,878 --> 01:03:47,725
Long-term... I don't know if
I have those with me here today-

584
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:51,363
-but the short-term ones
should be here somewhere...

585
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:53,396
A moment, please.

586
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:06,705
Strange. I'm sure I had them
this morning.

587
01:04:23,218 --> 01:04:25,459
This is obviously not good.

588
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:30,334
It would appear that we shall
have to skip the strategies-

589
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:33,734
-and concentrate
on tactics instead.

590
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,174
But before we do so, we should
perhaps attempt to summarize-

591
01:04:37,365 --> 01:04:40,903
-what we've discussed here today.

592
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:45,217
It's difficult, I know.

593
01:04:45,874 --> 01:04:48,377
Our discussion has lasted
over eight hours-

594
01:04:49,544 --> 01:04:53,856
-but is there anyone who feels
they'd like to have a try?

595
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,058
Anyone?

596
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,032
Professor Frank, for example-

597
01:05:01,223 --> 01:05:03,635
-hasn't said anything
for along time.

598
01:05:05,494 --> 01:05:09,135
Well, I agree with what-

599
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:13,074
-most of the others
have had to say today.

600
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:17,610
All we can do is hope.

601
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,585
Would Dr. Wendt
care to comment on that?

602
01:05:21,776 --> 01:05:24,723
The house on the other side
of the street - it's moving.

603
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:29,127
- I don't follow you.
- It's moving.

604
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:31,490
That house over there.

605
01:05:31,853 --> 01:05:35,027
- What do you mean, "moving"?
- It's moving!

606
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,298
That's right, it is!

607
01:05:41,496 --> 01:05:43,772
What kind of nonsense is that?

608
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:45,338
Hell...

609
01:05:46,434 --> 01:05:47,777
It's moving...

610
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:51,143
- It is moving!
- It really is!

611
01:06:20,835 --> 01:06:22,781
Take it easy! Take it easy!

612
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:24,177
Get back, get back,
the doors open inwards.

613
01:06:24,372 --> 01:06:27,353
Get back! Otherwise we won't
be able to get the doors open!

614
01:06:29,544 --> 01:06:31,421
Get back!

615
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:45,199
It's very important
we don't lose control.

616
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:49,971
Very...important!

617
01:07:31,973 --> 01:07:34,146
What papers are you looking for?

618
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:35,980
What papers?

619
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,415
An official report.

620
01:07:38,613 --> 01:07:41,184
A very troublesome report-

621
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:46,298
-which is supposed to clarify
why we can't afford to work.

622
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,101
You'll just have to write
a new one.

623
01:07:54,429 --> 01:07:56,909
Try to remember what was in it.

624
01:07:57,098 --> 01:07:58,702
Write a new one.

625
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,743
What was in it?

626
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:03,908
There wasn't very much in it.

627
01:08:04,105 --> 01:08:09,111
It's hard,
it's very hard to explain-

628
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,848
-why we can't afford to work.

629
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,191
It's impossible.

630
01:08:22,023 --> 01:08:25,869
It's not us who decide
that sort of thing.

631
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:29,608
We're not the ones who decide.

632
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:31,971
You've got to understand that.

633
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:36,305
It's fate that decides.

634
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:39,485
Not us. Fate.

635
01:08:39,674 --> 01:08:42,587
Who can decide over fate?

636
01:08:42,777 --> 01:08:45,314
Not us anyway.

637
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:51,019
All we can do
is try to appeal to fate.

638
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:54,799
That's all we can do.

639
01:09:36,865 --> 01:09:39,471
You'll have to forgive me,
but I'm afraid I can't help you-

640
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:42,113
-because I can't understand
what you're saying.

641
01:09:46,741 --> 01:09:49,779
Like I said, I can't help you.

642
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,915
Help!

643
01:10:36,624 --> 01:10:39,503
Ow! I'm stuck!

644
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:44,367
Enough is enough. Get out of here.

645
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:15,795
Well now, Anna. From what
we've heard you're just fine-

646
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,526
-not sick or anything...

647
01:12:17,725 --> 01:12:21,036
- She's completely healthy.
- She is, is she?

648
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,235
And you're doing well in school.

649
01:12:24,432 --> 01:12:28,175
You're good at reading and writing
from what your mom and dad tell us.

650
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:29,677
I see.

651
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:33,176
- Have you read many books?
- Yes, a few.

652
01:12:33,374 --> 01:12:34,512
I see.

653
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:39,749
You see, these ladies and gentlemen
sitting here...

654
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:43,395
-...they've read all the books.
- That's right! An awful lot!

655
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:46,565
- Yes, most of them!
- Yes.

656
01:12:46,754 --> 01:12:48,427
And when you've read that much-

657
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:51,035
-well, then you also know
an awful lot.

658
01:12:51,225 --> 01:12:54,729
Yes, and we also have
the benefit of experience.

659
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:56,101
Quite right.

660
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:59,904
- Long experience, I might add.
- Yes, indeed.

661
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:05,141
Then you know how
and what you should do.

662
01:13:06,107 --> 01:13:11,989
And, Anna, there's one more thing
you know if you've read that much.

663
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:16,620
Then you know what can't be done,
what's impossible.

664
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:18,195
Exactly!

665
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:20,388
Because you can't do just anything.

666
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:22,033
Certainly not.

667
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:27,838
An ant, for example, can't eat up
an elephant. It's impossible.

668
01:13:28,496 --> 01:13:30,100
Right.

669
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:32,107
And when it's your birthday-

670
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,042
-well, not everyone
can come to the party.

671
01:13:35,236 --> 01:13:39,616
If they did, then no one would get
a bigger piece of cake than this.

672
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:43,812
- No bigger than a crumb.
- So small you could hardly see it!

673
01:13:44,012 --> 01:13:47,789
- That wouldn't be such a fun party.
- No, darn it!

674
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,493
I can see you understand that.

675
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:57,034
But there are other things, Anna,
that are impossible-

676
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,398
-and that can't be done.

677
01:13:59,594 --> 01:14:02,632
That you can't really understand
when you're small-

678
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:04,503
-only when you're big-

679
01:14:04,699 --> 01:14:07,145
-and have read many, many books.

680
01:14:07,335 --> 01:14:11,613
And then there's also experience.
You mustn't forget that!

681
01:14:11,806 --> 01:14:14,685
- No, absolutely not.
- No...

682
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:16,094
I can't get up.

683
01:17:19,527 --> 01:17:22,667
Help! I can't get up!

684
01:17:37,044 --> 01:17:41,459
We have sacrificed
the bloom of youth.

685
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:44,887
What more can we do!

686
01:17:45,086 --> 01:17:46,565
Nothing.

687
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:52,426
- What?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing

688
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:55,469
What more can we do?

689
01:18:03,504 --> 01:18:07,111
- Where are we?
- Huh?

690
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,151
Where are we?!

691
01:18:12,346 --> 01:18:15,225
At the Grand Hotel,
for Christ's sake!

692
01:18:17,585 --> 01:18:19,428
Oh...

693
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,464
What more can we do?

694
01:18:23,924 --> 01:18:25,597
What?

695
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:29,502
- But, where are we?
- I can't get up.

696
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:39,182
- Where are we?!
- I can't get up.

697
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:53,392
- Where are we?!
- I can't get up.

698
01:18:57,258 --> 01:18:59,033
Where are we?!

699
01:19:50,978 --> 01:19:52,651
What's wrong now, then, Robert?

700
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,953
It's heavy, Pelle.
I can't take it any more.

701
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:59,962
You have to, Robert.
You have to try!

702
01:20:03,524 --> 01:20:05,197
Come on!

703
01:20:15,136 --> 01:20:18,549
Hang in there, Pelle!
You've got to hang on!

704
01:20:18,739 --> 01:20:21,117
Yes, I know. I know.

705
01:20:24,745 --> 01:20:28,124
- There's a time for everything.
- Sure, right.

706
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,820
Pelle!

707
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,788
There's a time for misery.

708
01:20:34,054 --> 01:20:34,998
Sure, I know there is.

709
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:37,499
But it'll soon be over.

710
01:20:37,992 --> 01:20:38,936
Only a few more yards-

711
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,902
-and we'll have left this damned
dump under the clouds for good.

712
01:20:42,096 --> 01:20:43,939
Yes. Let's hope so.

713
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,543
- As free men, Pelle.
- Sure, right. Sure...

714
01:20:46,734 --> 01:20:49,180
- Free at last!
- Yes!

715
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:51,475
And then we'll only have ourselves
to think about.

716
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:52,946
Right, sure, that'll be nice.

717
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:59,421
- And do what we feel like!
- Sure. Sounds good.

718
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,959
Do we not deserve that, Pelle?

719
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:07,894
Aren't we worth it,
when we've worked so hard!

720
01:21:08,088 --> 01:21:10,329
Only a few more yards!

721
01:21:12,026 --> 01:21:14,506
A new day is dawning!

722
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:20,645
Yes.

723
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,344
Come on then!

724
01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:43,702
There's a time for everything,
Thomas.

725
01:21:47,828 --> 01:21:50,069
There's a time for everything.

726
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:55,177
Your time will come, Thomas.

727
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,611
It will... I know that.

728
01:22:03,844 --> 01:22:07,018
It's not true that
no one cares about poetry.

729
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,691
They just pretend they don't.

730
01:22:12,486 --> 01:22:14,022
Right now...

731
01:22:14,288 --> 01:22:16,268
They're just pretending.

732
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:19,867
That's how it is. I know.

733
01:22:35,342 --> 01:22:38,050
Beloved be the one who works-

734
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:43,494
-by the day, by the month,
by the hour.

735
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:52,136
Beloved be the one who sweats
out of pain or out of shame.

736
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:56,741
The person who goes, at the order
of his hands, to the movies.

737
01:23:00,634 --> 01:23:03,274
The one who pays with
what he does not have...

738
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:06,276
The one who sleeps on his back.

739
01:23:09,577 --> 01:23:11,523
The one who no longer remembers
his childhood.

740
01:23:11,712 --> 01:23:14,556
Stop it, Stefan.
You'll only make him unhappy.

741
01:23:15,382 --> 01:23:19,023
You mustn't be unhappy, Thomas.
You mustn't cry.

742
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:29,534
Take it easy, Thomas,
it doesn't matter.

743
01:23:30,664 --> 01:23:32,541
Beloved be the one who sits down.

744
01:23:32,733 --> 01:23:34,906
It's okay to cry.

745
01:23:35,102 --> 01:23:38,015
That's what you should do
when you're unhappy.

746
01:23:38,739 --> 01:23:42,209
- Jesus did.
- What?

747
01:23:42,743 --> 01:23:47,920
Jesus cried when he was
on the cross. He hurt so much.

748
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:51,418
He was crucified...

749
01:23:51,619 --> 01:23:53,997
...because he was a kind person.

750
01:23:54,188 --> 01:23:55,861
Kind?

751
01:23:56,256 --> 01:23:58,702
Thomas is kind, too...

752
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,236
...but he's got no head
for business.

753
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:05,370
Of course you're unhappy.

754
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,705
Jesus didn't either.
He just hurt.

755
01:24:10,904 --> 01:24:12,212
Yeah, sure.

756
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:16,183
He was tormented to death
because he was kind.

757
01:24:17,978 --> 01:24:19,855
He wasn't the son of God.

758
01:24:20,414 --> 01:24:22,155
He was just a kind person.

759
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,794
Sure.

760
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:32,426
Beloved be the just man
without thorns.

761
01:24:38,499 --> 01:24:41,105
The bald man without hat.

762
01:24:42,169 --> 01:24:44,206
The thief without roses.

763
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:51,815
The one who wears a watch
and has seen God.

764
01:24:55,115 --> 01:24:57,755
The one who has honor
and does not die.

765
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:56,810
Are you here, Uffe?

766
01:26:02,249 --> 01:26:04,559
It's been along time.

767
01:26:16,697 --> 01:26:18,734
I'm ashamed, Kalle.

768
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:22,842
I'm ashamed.

769
01:26:25,072 --> 01:26:27,313
- It was a bad idea.
- Yeah...

770
01:26:28,342 --> 01:26:30,583
The worst I ever had.

771
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:33,757
Shit!

772
01:26:33,947 --> 01:26:36,052
Fucking hell!

773
01:26:37,384 --> 01:26:39,227
How could I be so stupid?

774
01:26:40,053 --> 01:26:42,090
Out of my mind.

775
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:46,604
How can you make money on
a crucified loser?

776
01:26:47,094 --> 01:26:49,700
I bloody well blush
to think about it.

777
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:53,340
What a fucking idiotic product.

778
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,479
I haven't kept up with the times.

779
01:27:00,207 --> 01:27:02,187
That's the bitter truth.

780
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:08,160
But I'm going to get
my act together, Kalle.

781
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:13,487
We'll have to find something else
to sell-

782
01:27:15,155 --> 01:27:17,135
-with a few extra zeros on it...

783
01:27:22,262 --> 01:27:24,037
If I think of something-

784
01:27:26,934 --> 01:27:29,312
- I'll call. Bye, Kalle.

785
01:28:26,126 --> 01:28:28,072
Is that Sven!

786
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:44,856
Is that you, Sven?

787
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:50,356
Why are you chasing me, Sven?!

788
01:28:51,385 --> 01:28:53,695
Why are you tormenting me?!

789
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,829
I can't make it up to you.

790
01:28:58,091 --> 01:29:00,002
How could I do that?!

791
01:29:02,396 --> 01:29:04,569
You have no relatives.

792
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:08,043
What can I do?

793
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:11,913
Sven!

794
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,819
Can we not treat each other
decently?!

795
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:19,520
Forget it all.

796
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:23,557
The past...
Just look ahead!

797
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:28,862
I'd be really happy
if we could do that, Sven.

798
01:29:31,258 --> 01:29:33,636
You have to understand me as well.

799
01:29:34,895 --> 01:29:36,897
I can't take it any more.

800
01:29:37,564 --> 01:29:40,306
I can't take it any more!

801
01:29:45,405 --> 01:29:48,614
I just can't take it any more!

802
01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:19,310
What the hell is this?

803
01:30:21,475 --> 01:30:23,921
How much can you ask of a person?

804
01:30:32,486 --> 01:30:34,693
You do what you can.

805
01:30:35,789 --> 01:30:37,268
You struggle...

806
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,999
...to get a bit of food
on the table.

807
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:49,714
And enjoy yourself.
