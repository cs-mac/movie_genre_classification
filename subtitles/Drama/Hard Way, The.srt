1
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,708
Well?

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,086
I'm sending you the code.

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,212
Yes, I see that. Thank you.

4
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,636
What about my account?

5
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,305
Delivering.

6
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,412
I've just sent it;
you should have it.

7
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,747
- Yes, thank you.
- Hey, hey,

8
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,248
are you sure this is legal?

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,001
We're just running a test
on our security system, sir.

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,253
- It's fine.
- You have a sexy voice.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,713
Uh, is there anything else

12
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,340
I can do for you? To you?

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,758
We have what we need.

14
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,520
We're ready.

15
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,699
Yo, guess who just
made 50 g's today.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,332
What'd you do to my drive, man?

17
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,417
- Shut up. I didn't touch it.
- This isn't cool.

18
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,336
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

19
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,991
Diagnostics show no damage, but we're 
certain this was an intentional breach.

20
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,492
You're saying we were hacked?

21
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,453
It wasn't denial of service level,

22
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,121
but they definitely cracked our door.

23
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,625
Okay, open the black hat files.

24
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,543
I want every hacker
in the country

25
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,837
who could've done this
interviewed now.

26
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,422
Sir, that's close
to a thousand names.

27
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,007
With the holiday weekend,
we're short-staffed

28
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,133
- as it is.
- Listen,

29
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,551
we're the ones
that are supposed

30
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,012
to keep this from happening,
and it just happened to us.

31
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,597
- Get it done.
- Sir, it's the middle

32
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,224
of the night;
they're scattered all over

33
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,266
the country.

34
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,726
Fine - get local law
enforcement to help.

35
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,561
Somebody out there thinks
they can screw with us.

36
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,939
I want to find out who.

37
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,840
Jim! I said no.

38
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,343
Lucy, you're killing me, all right?

39
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,804
- Get out of the car.
- What?

40
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,806
- Get out of the car now!
- Don't touch me!

41
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,349
- No means no, jerk-off.
- What are you doing?

42
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,518
- John, stop it!
- Oh, don't call me that.

43
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,311
- I hate it when you call me that.
- No,

44
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,105
- whoa, you know this guy?
- Shut up. Just shut your mouth

45
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,148
- right now.
- Dad!

46
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,441
Stop it! I mean it!

47
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,151
Dad? You said your dad was dead.

48
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,903
What?

49
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,281
You told this jerk-off I was dead?

50
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,032
You actually said that?

51
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,702
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

52
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,705
A-And this guy's what,
your-your-your boyfriend?

53
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,623
- No.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,792
I don't know, okay?

55
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,461
I'm sorry.
Just ...  we'll see.

56
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,255
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,173
You don't answer your phone.

58
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,383
You don't return my calls.

59
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,051
That's because
I'm not talking to you.

60
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,554
And why aren't you talking
to me this time, Lucy?

61
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,597
Why not?
What, you want a list?

62
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,309
How about stuff like this:
you spy on me.

63
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,228
- I'm not spying.
- You come down here, drag
my boyfriend out of the car.

64
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,771
- Thought he wasn't your boyfriend.
- He's not!

65
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,231
- Thought you said I was.
- God ... 

66
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,858
Shut up.

67
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,237
You are such an asshole.

68
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,656
Okay.

69
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,118
I'm sorry I pulled your
not-boyfriend out of the car.

70
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,911
Okay?

71
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,456
Hey, Lucy, babe ... 

72
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,167
- Come on, get in the car. Let's just go.
- No, no.

73
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,127
Will both of you just go away?

74
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,712
Just talk to me for a minute,
Lucy ... 

75
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,964
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed. Alone.

76
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,342
You're damn right
you're going to bed alone.

77
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,220
Lucy, honey, wait a minute,
just wait, honey.

78
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,514
- I want to talk to you. Just wait.
- Dad ... 

79
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,641
when I want
to talk to you,

80
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,103
if I want to talk to you ... 

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,897
I'll call you.

82
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,398
Lucy ... 

83
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,609
Wait, Lucy ...  Lucy!

84
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,860
Lucy McClane!

85
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,905
It's not McClane; it's Gennero.

86
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,159
Chicks, right?

87
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.

88
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,696
John? John?

89
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,408
It's Scalvino.

90
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,742
Go for McClane.

91
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,327
What are you doing

92
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,370
at Rutgers?

93
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,539
How do you know where I am?

94
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,916
We had all the cars "lo-jacked"
4 years ago, remember?

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,543
I'm staring at exactly
where you are.

96
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,962
So that's not something
I would turn on?

97
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,255
Yeah, we did that.

98
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,257
John, we ...  turned them on.

99
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,676
Listen, the feds
have called in a favor.

100
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
They're doing a sweep.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,262
They want us to pick up

102
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,763
some computer hacker in Camden.

103
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,974
Last name Farrell,

104
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,434
first name Matthew.

105
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,310
Whoa, whoa. Camden?

106
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,687
What are you telling me this for?

107
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,480
You know, it's, like,
3:00 in the morning.

108
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,857
I was on my way home.

109
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,400
Just send one of the jugheads
from the academy.

110
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,943
They'll be happy
to go pick this kid up.

111
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,611
I can't just send any uniform.

112
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,156
The feds demanded
a senior detective.

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,700
The kid's a high-value subject.
l don't know.

114
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,618
Just pick him up,

115
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,829
escort him
to the Hoover Building in D.C.

116
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,539
They had some kind
of a computer breach

117
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,791
there this morning.

118
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,834
Great.

119
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,211
Give me that information.

120
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,464
All right, give me that name again.

121
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,965
What is it?

122
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,050
You owe me one, Jack.

123
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,939
What?

124
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,075
Come on.

125
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,668
Goddamn it.

126
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,277
Who is it?

127
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,363
N.Y.P.D. Open the door, please.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,495
Hi.

129
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,956
N.Y.P.D.? Okay.

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,624
Oh, I get it.
Um, I'll help you out.

131
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,334
Don't worry about it.
Everyone gets lost around here.

132
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,461
- Glad to help. Take ... 
- Hey. I'm not lost.

133
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,131
Are you Matt Farrell?
Matthew Farrell?

134
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,467
No. He, uh, actually does
not live here anymore.

135
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,177
Course not. Who are you?

136
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,221
My name is Daisy Duke.

137
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,307
Got a lot of shit for
it when I was a kid.

138
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,558
Please don't add to it.

139
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,021
Can I see some
identification, please?

140
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,106
Yeah, sure.

141
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,319
Detective!

142
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,112
Yeah, that looks real.
Where'd you get that?

143
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,114
Toys "R" Us?
That looks great.

144
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,699
- And, of course ... 
- Yeah.

145
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,869
That ...  that actually
looks pretty good.

146
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,954
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Farrell.

147
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,248
Sully just P.D.L.'d
a new copy of the Kill Zone 9,

148
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,044
- the one that ain't out yet.
You wanna come check it out?
- No. Thanks, though, man.

149
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,714
- And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.
- Open the door.

150
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,550
Shit.

151
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,849
Can I get you something?

152
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,351
Coffee? A warrant?

153
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,102
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

154
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,729
Some kind of computer thing.

155
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,606
D.C. feds want to talk to you, so ... 

156
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,774
let's go.

157
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,442
Feds, huh?

158
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,277
Yeah. The feds.

159
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,161
Been white hat for 4 years.

160
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,664
Once you're on that goddamn list ... 

161
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,832
It's such a pain in the ass.

162
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,001
- You play with dolls?
- Huh?

163
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,504
Uh, c-could you please
not touch that?

164
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,964
- Like a G.I. Joe.
- No, no, it's not, it's not.

165
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,508
- It's a limited edition ... 
- Ooh.

166
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,385
- And ... 
- That supposed to come off?

167
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,928
No, it's not supposed to, but ... 

168
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,389
it's a lot more valuable when
it's broken, so thanks for that.

169
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,725
- Yeah. Krazy Glue. 
I'm sure it's very important.
- I got some other cool shit

170
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,435
in here if you want to break that.

171
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,439
- Let's go, okay? Come on.
- I got to power down my gear, okay?

172
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,193
More dolls.

173
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,612
Not spending a whole lot of
time with the girls, huh?

174
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,198
Hey.

175
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,783
Are you really trying to escape?

176
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,787
- Jesus! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hey! Get down!

177
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,213
- Jesus!
- Keep your head down.

178
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,975
Shit.

179
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:12,981
Go! Go!

180
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,315
Let's go! Come on!

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,902
Low, low! Stay down!
Come on!

182
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,038
Stay low, all right?

183
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,081
Stay down.

184
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,041
- You stay with me, all right?
- Okay.

185
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,835
- Here we go.
- Okay.

186
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,358
That's gonna wake the neighbors.

187
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,445
Get down! Get inside! Get down!

188
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,368
They're back in the room!

189
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,873
Are you nuts?!

190
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,167
Get out of there right now!

191
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,835
Now!

192
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,714
Take the right!

193
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,375
Are you okay?

194
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,085
Get back there!

195
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
That's it.

196
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,051
Get ready to run.

197
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,584
What the -

198
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,589
What the hell was that?!

199
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,591
- What?
- Did you do that?

200
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,885
No.

201
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,554
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

202
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,680
Shit.

203
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,891
Stay close.

204
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,517
The whole apartment's on fire.

205
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,603
Come on.

206
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,812
Let's go.

207
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,564
Come on. Let's go.
Damn it!

208
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,691
Come on.

209
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,278
Watch it.
Just hold it down.

210
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,364
Oh, my God.

211
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,950
Hey.

212
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,785
- Come on.
- Okay.

213
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,912
Come on. Come on.

214
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,372
Stay close.

215
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,220
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

216
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,140
- Come on, let's go. Stay close.
- Okay.

217
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,311
Get in the car.

218
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,854
Go, go. Now.

219
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,487
Can you reload a gun?

220
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,656
- Uh, me? Uh, yeah.
- Can you reload a gun?!

221
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,618
Open the glove box
and get a magazine

222
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,328
out of the thing right now!

223
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,959
Grab the gun

224
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,085
on the backseat!

225
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,005
Quick!

226
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,283
Get your head down!

227
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,456
Jesus!
Is the circus in town?

228
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,672
Whoo!

229
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,717
Did you see that?

230
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,052
Yeah, I saw it.
I did it.

231
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,681
Camden Base,
one double-oh-seven-seven.

232
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,807
Come back, Camden Base.

233
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,392
One-double-oh-seven-seven.

234
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,852
Camden Base. Go ahead.

235
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,938
I need to speak to your chief
of detectives: police emergency.

236
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,190
- ASAP .
- Stand by.

237
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,067
This is Chief Detective Weisman.

238
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,862
Chief Detective, this is
Detective John McClane, N.Y.P.D.

239
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,323
Police emergency -
I want to report ... 

240
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,408
a police shooting
in your jurisdiction.

241
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,262
Yeah.

242
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,056
What's the status?

243
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,146
Wait one.

244
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,795
Thomas. We had a problem
in New Jersey.

245
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,213
Farrell's still alive.

246
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,008
So he got away.

247
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,593
Yeah.

248
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,594
I did send

249
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,846
five of you, is that right?

250
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,724
I'm sending a chopper.
Just get airborne.

251
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,560
We'll track him down.
Think you can handle that?

252
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,316
Oh, my God ... 

253
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,485
Just breathe.

254
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,321
I am breathing.
I'm, l'm, I'm, l'm ... 

255
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,157
- Can't stop shaking.
- It's the adrenaline.

256
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,867
You're just scared.
It'll pass.

257
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,201
Yeah, I'm scared.

258
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,163
Weren't you scared back there?

259
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,248
Yeah.

260
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,541
I was scared.

261
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,209
Really? This is you being scared?

262
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,296
'Cause you seem really calm.

263
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,631
Have you done stuff
like that before?

264
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,800
Stuff like what?

265
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,343
Like killing people.

266
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,181
Yeah.

267
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,599
But not for a long time.

268
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,393
So who were those guys?
Huh?

269
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,936
Why were they trying to kill you?

270
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,189
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

271
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,983
They were there to kill you.

272
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,903
Why would they want to kill me?

273
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,988
You tell me, kid.

274
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,698
You're the criminal.

275
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,215
l got seven
dead hackers so far,

276
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,717
none of whom were high on our list.

277
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,719
Collect the hard drives,
start sweeping 'em.

278
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,471
Yes, sir.

279
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,684
Trey ... 

280
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,354
Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

281
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,231
On it.

282
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,735
What's with all the guns?

283
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,529
Operational prudence.

284
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,491
Think of them as hardware
to your software.

285
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,797
Good morning, D.C.!

286
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,548
Well, it's shaping up
to be another beautiful

287
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,175
Fourth of July weekend.

288
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,719
if you've got any big plans,
better get started early,

289
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,763
'cause it looks like
the traffic is ramping up.

290
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,433
So, here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

291
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,103
What ... ?!

292
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,230
What? What?

293
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,482
What are you doing?
What is that?

294
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,609
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?!

295
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,361
Creedence.
Creedence Clearwater Revival.

296
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,238
Classic rock.

297
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,572
I know who it is.

298
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,200
It's old rock; that
doesn't make it classic.

299
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,994
What sucked back then
still sucks now.

300
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,245
You don't like Creedence?

301
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,039
This is like having a pinecone
shoved in my ass.

302
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,419
Okay. Really?
Wow, that's mature.

303
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,504
FARRELL
Come on, man. I'm cooperating with you.

304
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,967
We're at a heading of zero-six-zero.

305
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,343
Making another pass.

306
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,889
Listen up, everyone.

307
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,474
Are we ready?

308
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,436
Transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

309
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,397
Begin stage one.

310
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,843
 ... with six and a half innings in game ... 

311
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,180
 ... this weekend for two shows only ... 

312
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,723

When's the last time you remember

313
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,641
turning on the radio and
listening to popular music?

314
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,144
Just give me a decade.

315
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,687
The '70s?

316
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,773
l'm guessing ...  was
Michael Jackson still black?

317
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,900
Pearl Jam - I'll
go back ten years

318
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,818
with you ...  ten years.

319
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,987
20 years ... 
The Cure? Nothing?

320
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,364
It's called news radio.

321
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,200
I was trying to see if any
of your friends from Camden

322
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,242
made the headlines.

323
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,203
Hold on ... 
you listen to the news.

324
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,746
You got a problem with the news now?

325
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,749
Yeah, I got a big

326
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,085
goddamn problem with the news.
You ready for this?

327
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,629
The news is completely manipulated.

328
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,339
Everything you hear,

329
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,092
every single day,

330
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,010
is designed by corporate media
to do one thing,

331
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,804
- and one thing only:
- Jesus ... 

332
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,888
to keep you living in fear.

333
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,473
Oh, fear?

334
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,016
Total fear!
Fear so you'll go out

335
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,184
and you'll spend money
on things -

336
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,310
things you probably don't even need.

337
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,770
Things you probably
already have six of

338
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,814
so that their advertisers keep
buying ads on their stations.

339
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,649
Tell you one more thing -
you ready for this?

340
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,651
I'll do this all day.
I got days of data at home.

341
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,568
- You don't believe me.
- Hey ... 

342
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,736
I'll drop a bomb on you bigger ... 

343
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,904
- Hey!
- What? What?

344
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,030
Shut ...  up.

345
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,031
That's good. That's good.

346
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,533
Be dismissive ... 

347
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,128
You all right?

348
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,880
No, l'm not all right!

349
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,424
Just stay in the car.
You'll be all right.

350
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,263
Hey, man ...  hey.

351
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,806
How you doing?
You all right?

352
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,641
Don't move. Just call
911, all right?

353
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,101
Okay ... 

354
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,646
Jesus Christ.

355
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,377
All the lights are green.

356
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,504
Huh?

357
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,922
All the lights are green.
Let's go.

358
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:08,923
Let's go, right now.

359
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,965
- We gotta go?
- Let's go.

360
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,343
Get your bag, hack boy.
Let's go.

361
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,387
- Jesus Christ.
- Let's go.

362
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,598
- I've never been in a car accident.
- Come on. You all right? Well ... 

363
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,350
Very exciting.
Here we go, this way, come on.

364
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,519
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Ever been in a car acc ... 

365
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,312
- Yeah, I've been in a car accident.
- What are we doing?

366
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,648
It's a little thing
they invented back in the '60s

367
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,525
called "jogging."
You're gonna love it. Come on.

368
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,661
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a system crash

369
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,996
on their el train network.

370
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,045
Amtrak is flashing a level-one
crash in their comm system.

371
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,713
F.A.A. just issued a critical alert.

372
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,465
Their A.T.C. net just went down.

373
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,510
We're under attack.

374
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,847
Okay, let's get 'em outside
for a little fresh air.

375
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,152
That's the anthrax alarm.

376
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,823
All right, everyone out, now!

377
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,157
Now!

378
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,705
Taylor, move, go! Move!

379
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,431
All personnel must evacuate and proceed

380
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,891
to the transportation shuttles
immediately.

381
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,935
This is not a drill.

382
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,646
All personnel must evacuate
and proceed

383
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,025
to the transportation shuttles
immediately.

384
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,207
No, l'm telling you,
protocol says ... 

385
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,837
We need you inside.

386
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,472
Take the team. I want men on the
fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

387
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,185
Got to know what's there, okay?

388
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,228
Why don't you run a search
on these data crashes?

389
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,064
See if we can I.D.
the point of origin.

390
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,069
Begin stage two.

391
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,826
- Hey, what's going on?
- Whoa!

392
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,286
- Hey, what's going on?!
- No!

393
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,419
They're already starting to panic.

394
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,175
Of course they are.

395
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,803
They think that someone's
taking their money.

396
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,056
All those nickels and dimes
they saved have meaning.

397
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,226
Useful idiots, as Lenin would say.

398
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,688
Prep the video package.

399
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,577
D.C. transportation
system's crashing,

400
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,329
and they just hit
the entire financial sector-

401
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,789
everything, all of it.

402
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,541
Get me the Secretary
of Trans and Treasury

403
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,043
on the line and the chairman
for the S.E.C.

404
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,294
Let's go, people!

405
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,672
Somewhere, somebody
left a digital fingerprint.

406
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,840
Find it!

407
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,633
Is Deputy Director Bowman in here?

408
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,802
Not now. lt'll have to wait.

409
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,761
Not today, waxworks.

410
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,138
This is Matthew Farrell.

411
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,014
I brought him here
on direct orders from Bowman.

412
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,183
So if you don't know
what the hell's going on,

413
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,226
go find me somebody that does.

414
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,477
I'm Bowman.

415
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,985
Video package is ready for upload.

416
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,031
Thanks.

417
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,033
Listen, John, appreciate 
you bringing Farrell here,

418
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,243
but everything's changed
this morning.

419
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,661
We are neck-deep in damage control.

420
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,705
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.

421
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,831
Do you have
anything, uh,

422
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,624
to eat, any kind of snacks around?

423
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,293
I would love, um ... 
really low blood sugar,

424
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,836
- and ... 
- Sir.

425
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,337
No?

426
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,009
As if the nationwide

427
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,344
transportation breakdown
and anthrax scares

428
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,929
weren't enough for one day,

429
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,141
the stock market found itself in
a selling frenzy this afternoon.

430
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,351
The Federal Trade Commission
believes this panic

431
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,228
might have been triggered
by a computer malfunction

432
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,354
in the stock exchange.

433
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,564
What were thought to be
unrelated events ... 

434
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,483
Oh, man, that is all bad.

435
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,776
 ... a terrorist attack.

436
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,068
Not as bad as it looks.

437
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,029
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

438
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,783
- These your suspects?
- Were.

439
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,034
All seven were killed

440
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,535
in the last 24 hours.

441
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,080
Recognize any of these people?

442
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,793
No.

443
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,252
Not one?

444
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,295
Sir.

445
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,589
Got a system error.

446
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,685
My fellow Americans ... 

447
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,686
It is time to ... 

448
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,729
- strike
- fear

449
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,898
- into
- the hearts of citizenry.

450
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,860
- Ask not ... 
- It's an unauthorized broadcast.

451
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,487
-  ... what your country can do
- to avert

452
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,488
- this
- crisis.

453
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,366
- The answer is
- nothing whatsoever.

454
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,909
- Our military
- strength

455

456

457

We will not falter.

475
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,196
And we will not fail.

476
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,990
I don't know how they're getting in.

477
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,992
Thank you.

478

-And a -happy

- Independence Day
- to everyone.

480
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,625
That was creepy.

481
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,377
I tried to find more Nixon.

482
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,171
Think they bought it?

483
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,257
Absolutely.

484
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,179
Okay, I want telecom,
transportation, any and every ... 

485
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,973
Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.

486
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,016
What?

487
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,768
It's a fire sale.

488
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,020
Hey!

489
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,229
We don't know that yet.

490
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,689
Yeah, it's a myth, anyway.
Can't be done.

491
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,274
Oh, it's a myth? Really?

492
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,610
Please tell me she's only here
for show and she's actually not

493
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,403
- in charge of anything.
- What's a fire sale?

494
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,114
It's a three-step ... 
it's a three-step

495
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,074
systematic attack on the entire
national infrastructure.

496
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,910
Okay, step one:

497
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,578
take out all the transportation.

498
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,246
Step two: the financial base
and telecoms.

499
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,123
Step three: you get rid
of all the utilities --

500
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,417
gas, water, electric, nuclear.

501
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,085
Pretty much anything
that's run by computers,

502
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,379
which, which, today
is almost everything.

503
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,547
So that's why they

504
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,591
call it a fire sale,
because everything must go.

505
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,134
Hey, l-listen, listen.

506
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,594
What's your name?
Farrell?

507
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,596
Keep your voice down, okay?

508
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,514
No one here's talking
about a fire sale.

509
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,476
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

510
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,021
What? No, man, I'm just
saying ...  to explain ... 

511
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,397
Appreciate your concern.

512
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,274
We know what we're doing;
we're on it. Thank you.

513
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,526
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What?

514
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,611
- Bang ... 
- What?

515
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,696
Nothing. I get ... 
I said I understand.

516
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,031
Hey.

517
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,951
They didn't send the Girl Scouts
out to get this kid.

518
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,536
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear.

519
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,871
They blew the whole joint up.

520
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,456
Now, look, I don't know this kid.

521
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,375
And frankly, I don't
give a shit. No offense.

522
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,710
But somebody wants this kid dead.

523
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,004
And obviously,
it's got something to do

524
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,131
with whatever is going on here.

525
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,841
Okay.

526
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,970
Homeland's taking over the interrogation
of the hackers we're bringing in.

527
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,513
I'll get you an escort over there.

528
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,181
All right? Molina,

529
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,141
get this kid
to the front of the line.

530
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,476
I want to know what he knows.

531
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,978
Right.

532
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,437
If that guy knew
half the shit

533
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,106
that I know, his fuzzy
little head would explode.

534
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,150
Special Agent Johnson.
We'll take the sedan.

535
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,568
Agent Johnson?

536
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,987
That's right.

537
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,154
Right this way.

538
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,198
Great.

539
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,951
So, is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

540
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,203
Is it possible? Here, look,
I'm gonna tell you again.

541
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,039
You take out any one thing,
the system can recover, right?

542
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,167
if you take it all down at once,
the system crashes and ... 

543
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,544
Look around, man!

544
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,546
Come on.
Government's got to have

545
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,548
dozens of departments
dedicated to that shit.

546
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,510
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

547
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,453
How long till we get to D.H.S.?

548
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,038
Laughlin.

549
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,831
Get on the D.C. police band,

550
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,667
and get 'em to clear
a route to D.H.S. for us.

551
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,169
D.C. Metro, this is the F.B.I.,

552
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,295
requesting you to clear a route ... 

553
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,301
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

554
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,261
Feds are taking him to Homeland.

555
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,221
Good. Close that loop now.

556
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,057
Isolate the frequency.

557
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,059
Get us a location
on the vehicles

558
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,810
and pull me up a file
on this John McClane.

559
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,022
Rand, we just found Farrell.

560
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,190
Stand by for a location.

561
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,112
Look, I don't mean
to harp, guys,

562
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,406
but we just passed another
Arby's and l'm starving.

563
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,658
- I-I could eat a wrapper.
- Later. Shut up.

564
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,243
- You don't even have to order anything.
- Shut up.

565
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,912
- Just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

566
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,248
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me back there.

567
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,250
Lied to you?
What are you talking about?

568
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,377
The pictures on the wall,
you knew those guys, right?

569
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,464
- I don't ...  I ... 
- Kid, don't lie to me.

570
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,174
I'm a cop; I can tell you're lying.

571
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,759
Who were they?

572
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,263
Okay.

573
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,223
Okay, okay.

574
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,686
They were my competition.

575
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,107
Make the next right

576
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,525
onto Concord.

577
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,610
They said they were a software firm
that had developed

578
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,029
a mutating encryption algorithm,
and they just wanted

579
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,614
to see if it could be cracked.

580
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,992
That's what I do. I do ... 
I-l do math-based security.

581
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,706

Here's the thing: the thing that I've been

582
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,916
thinking about is,
if you're gonna pull

583
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,001
something as-as massive
and crazy as a fire sale,

584
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,129
you'd need tons of start-up guys
to write the programs,

585
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,172
but only a few black hats
to actually implement it,

586
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,507
so then at
that point,

587
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,967
the start-up guys,

588
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,885
the guys who haven't really
done anything wrong, like me ... 

589
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,429
Would end up as pictures
on some guy's wall.

590
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,098
I swear to God, McClane ... 

591
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,266
I swear to you,

592
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,893
I had no idea I was gonna be ... 

593
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,980
an accessory to-to-to Armageddon.

594
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,273
Take the next left at Lexington.

595
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,402
Man, that's a sexy voice.

596
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,862
What's she taking us this way for?

597
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,613
- Unit 510, this is dispatch.
- Oh, my God.

598
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,991
Clear a route for two F.B.I.
vehicles approaching on Concord.

599
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,118
Copy, Dispatch.

600
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,703
- F.B.I., we've cleared a path.
- That's her.

601
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,788
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

602
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,083
lt's them.

603
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,334
You're saying it's them them?

604
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,712

I swear to you, I know her.

605
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,255
I would know her voice anywhere.

606
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Don't say anything, don't ... 

607
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,760
Just keep your mouth
shut for a minute.

608
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,887
Hey, Metro,

609
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,513
how's your day going over there?

610
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,974
Yeah, got to be pretty, 
uh, crazy over there, what,

611
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,767
with all those 587s, huh?

612
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,810
Yes, sir.

613
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,187
We've had to dispatch all units.

614
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,690
Yeah, you had
to dispatch all units

615
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,816
for all the naked people

616
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,401
walking around?

617
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,903
Cut the bullshit, honey,

618
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,946
and just put your boss on.

619
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,574
Laughlin,

620
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,783
we're getting off this route.

621
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,535
Make a left here on 14th Street.

622
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,004
Officer McClane.

623
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,547
It's Detective McClane, asshole.

624
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,132
But don't worry,
we're gonna have

625
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,384
plenty of time
to get to know each other

626
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,220
when I come visit you in prison.

627
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:07,057
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

628
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,183
Your address in Brooklyn,

629
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,310
the payments on your mortgage,

630
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:14,064
how long you've been
a member of the N.Y.P.D.

631
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,899
And how's Holly?

632
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,193
Oh, that's sad.
You're divorced.

633
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,153
Was that tough
on little Jack and Lucy?

634
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,532
Now, this is sad -
after 30 years, I thought

635
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,202
you'd have a better pension plan
annuity than what I see here.

636
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,286
Oh.

637
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,371
And it gets worse.

638
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,959
Your 401k

639
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,877
no longer exists.

640
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,837
Tell you what.
Let me make it up to you.

641
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,382
Box them in at that intersection.

642
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,758
Shoot Mr. Farrell

643
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,551
in the head and drive away,

644
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,887
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block,

645
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,932
all your debts
will be wiped clean,

646
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,309
and your children
will be set for life.

647
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,811
Now, that

648
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,689
really is tempting,
especially that last part.

649
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,565
But I think I'm gonna have
to pass, jerk-off.

650
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,361
John ... 

651
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,239
you're a Timex watch
in a digital age.

652
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,490
You're gonna lose.

653
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,701
Yeah, well ...  the other thing

654
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,120
that could happen is,
I could come and find you,

655
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,330
kick your ass and throw you
out of your own party.

656
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,748
What do you think
about that, dickhead?

657
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,209
Hold your position.

658
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,504
He's not responding.

659
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,177
Get down! Get down! Get down!

660
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,725
Just stay down!

661
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,731
Officers down,

662
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,024
the corner of Main and Constitution!

663
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,275
I repeat: Officers down!

664
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,086
Come on! Come on! Get out!
Let's go! Let's go!

665
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,466
Goddamn it!

666
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,634
Just stay down!

667
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,058
Get down!

668
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,976
Just hang on!

669
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,278
We've got a squad car under fire!

670
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,279
We need backup!

671
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,781
I repeat: We need backup!

672
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,533
This is base.
We're sending backup.

673
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,956
Brace yourself.

674
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,640
Hang on. Hang on.

675
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,991
Hang on.

676
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,336
Yeah!

677
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,301
- We lost Del.
- Stay with them.

678
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,730
- They're back.
- I know.

679
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,527
Take the tunnel, left, left, left.

680
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,588
Bring up the schematics
on that tunnel.

681
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,214
The tunnel!

682
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,267
Open the gates
on the north side entrance.

683
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,277
Redirect traffic.
Occupy all lanes.

684
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,421
- Open the other side.
- What?

685
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,590
Move!

686
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,137
Just hang on to something!

687
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,802
Hey! Hey!
Don't get out of the car! Hey!

688
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,811
Just stay there! Stand still!

689
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,031
Run!

690
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,082
Oh, God.

691
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,423
Don't ever hesitate like that again.

692
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,967
Are you all right?

693
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,844
Yeah. Yeah.

694
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,763
- Are you okay?
- I can't move my arm!

695
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,891
Just stay here.
Stay right here

696
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,268
- for a minute, all right?
- What?

697
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,021
"Can't be a uniform, John. No."

698
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,607
Get over to the wall, sir!

699
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,650
"Feds called in a favor!"

700
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,571
Yeah. "All you got to do
is go pick up a kid

701
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,991
in Jersey and drive him down to D.C."

702
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,492
How hard can that be, huh?

703
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,578
Can't be that hard, no, can it?

704
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,456
No, gotta be a senior detective.

705
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,838
A thing like a traffic jam,

706
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,674
throwing a car at me's
gonna stop me, huh?

707
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,885
Rand, get in there, get it done.

708
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,360
This is not a good idea.

709
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,717
Ha-ha.

710
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,011
Oh ... 

711
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,481
Oh ... 

712
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,317
- Don't touch! Don't touch me.
- Oh, okay. Sorry, sorry.

713
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,652
Are you okay?

714
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,695
Oh, my God.

715
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,782
Pretty lucky shot, huh?

716
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,033
Yeah, lucky.

717
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,537
That was - You just killed
a helicopter with a car.

718
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,664
I was out of bullets.

719
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,793
How you doing?

720
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,878
I-I skinned my knee,
and my asthma's acting up

721
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,714
a little bit, but ... 

722
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,216
Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.

723
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,636
I'm getting too old
to jump out of cars.

724
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,231
Rand, check in.

725
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,569
What about Farrell and McClane?

726
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,031
Come back in.

727
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,284
Okay, we're moving on.
Begin stage three.

728
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,910
I just spoke to Emerson.

729
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,870
The team's arriving

730
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,956
- at Woodlawn now.
- Very good.

731
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,417
Mai, get ready for the downloads.

732
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,049
I.D., sir.

733
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,886
Park behind the transpo.

734
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,012
We'll lead you in.

735
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,180
Man the gate.

736
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,681
You're with me.

737
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,982
Anthrax alarms only went off
on five floors.

738
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,943
Below that, you'll
need D.O.D. clearance.

739
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,070
I don't know why you'd
need to go any further.

740
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,072
There's nothing down there
but servers.

741
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,333
Go again. Rodriguez?
Please copy.

742
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,765
Gate secured.

743
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,891
Copy.

744
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,819
Okay, we are in.

745
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,647
This is insane. Hey.

746
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,566
Hey, this is absurd.

747
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,193
Man, there's tough
and there's stupid.

748
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,196
You got to go to a
hospital. Look at you.

749
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,866
I'm not a doctor, but you
look like you're hurt.

750
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,034
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No.

751
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,286
Come on.

752
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,997
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

753
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,359
He's in.

754
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,237
Get out of the way!
Look out!

755
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,614
Make a hole, please! Come on.

756
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,325
Watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me!

757
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,285
Come on. N.Y.P.D.

758
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,995
All right?
I got this kid.

759
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,413
Come on, let's go, kid.

760
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,878
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

761
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,255
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
N.Y.P.D.

762
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,674
You all right?

763
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,009
Sergeant.

764
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,928
Sergeant!

765
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,763
I need to speak to you.

766
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,140
- The medic's in the back.
- l'm all right.

767
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,683
N.Y.P.D.
I got to talk to you.

768
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,603
Just give me a minute.

769
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,689
Sergeant.

770
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,236
Oh, my God.

771
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,327
Let's get out of here.

772
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,753
Pronto. Open, open.

773
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,134
We're a go.

774
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,178
Launch the downloads.

775
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,941
Nothing's happening.

776
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,735
Be patient.

777
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,612
I don't know.
It's not responding.

778
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,406
Wait for it.

779
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,286
See?

780
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,913
There you go.

781
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,626
- Let me know when the download reaches 20%.
- Okay.

782
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,089
Please remain calm.

783
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,926
Excuse me.

784
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,596
Excuse me! Thank you!

785
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,849
Holy shit.

786
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,852
- Kid? Kid. Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,062
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

788
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,190
Come on. Let's go.

789
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,403
And here you go, Agent ...  Tovarek.

790
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,530
Guess that's you.

791
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,511
Download's at 20%.

792
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,346
Time to move.

793
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,475
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

794
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,241
Due to recent activity,

795
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,286
law enforcement agencies
are being extremely cautious.

796
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,915
They are telling drivers
to abandon their vehicles

797
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,750
until they are searched.

798
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,753
And as you can see, canine units
are checking each vehicle.

799
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,547
Now, whether this is
connected to the anthrax reports

800
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,093
we heard earlier or for
some new terrorist threat ... 

801
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,719
F.A.A. just grounded all flights.

802
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,097
- Good.
- Sir, we have complete access

803
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,307
over system networks:
the phones, power grids,

804
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,350
water, nuclear.

805
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,519
Hey, excuse me ... 

806
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,853
Jack Parry, N.S.A.

807
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,815
Chuck Summer, D.H.S. liaison.
White House made the call.

808
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,483
Anything you need,

809
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,068
- we're here to help.
- Help.

810
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,195
Wow, that's ...  that's great.

811
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,447
We're gonna need some
work space for our people.

812
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,449
What can you do for us?

813
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,660
Well, as you can see,
we're using the space.

814
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,620
So you guys can stand
in the corner,

815
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,663
and, uh, liaise.

816
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,664
If I need something,

817
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,208
I'll just wave to you.

818
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,273
Wait.

819
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,858
- No, no. Don't-don't-don't call.
- Why?

820
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,985
- What are you talking about?
- They probably cracked that hours ago.

821
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,821
You use it, they might be able to trace us.
Just put it in your pocket.

822
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,906
- You sure?
- Yes.

823
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,075
Or ...  smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

824
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,453
- Excuse me. Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
- Hey!

825
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,164
He'll call you right back.

826
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,333
Here. Right in here.
Come here.

827
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,336
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

828
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,006
- Yeah?
- This is John McClane

829
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,299
for Agent Bowman.

830
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:02,344
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

831
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,097
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to D.H.S.

832
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,807
They came after the kid again.

833
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,017
All your men are down.

834
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,312
What about Farrell?

835
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,855
Yeah, I got him with me

836
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,649
- right now.
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

837
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,359
Yeah, I'll hold on.

838
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,033
Another day in paradise.

839
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,118
They just swarmed into everything.

840
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,536
The whole telecom system: phones,

841
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,288
cells, broadcast satellites.

842
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,927
They're blanketing every station.

843
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,705
Can you put the news back on?

844
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,332
This is the news.

845
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,750
It's on every channel.

846
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,963
Been this way for a few minutes now.

847
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,604
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

848
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,649


849
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,864
McClane.

850
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,701
Look out! Look out!

851
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,454
Look out!

852
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,790
Bowman.

853
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,208
- Bowman, do you see that?
- McClane.

854
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,669
Bowman, it's a fake.

855
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,425
I see it.

856
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,343
Thank God.

857
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,388
Oh, shit.

858
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,557
McClane?

859
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,100
Bowman?

860
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,315
Satellite's down.

861
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,607
Get me a landline.

862
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,819
Shit.

863
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,499
Wrote one little piece of code

864
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,335
and the world falls apart.

865
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,462
This is virtual terrorism.

866
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,547
- What?
- You know, it's crazy,

867
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,175
first I time I heard
of the concept of a fire sale,

868
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,177
I actually thought
it would be cool

869
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,720
if anyone ever really did it.

870
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:53,557
Just ...  hit the reset button.

871
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,851
Melt the system just for fun.

872
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,354
Hey, it's not a system.

873
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,855
It's a country.

874
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,981
You're talking about people.

875
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,775
All right? A whole
country full of people.

876
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,984
Sitting at home,

877
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,819
alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

878
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,197
So if you're done with
your little nostalgic moment,

879
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,823
maybe you can think a little bit

880
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,160
and help me catch these guys.

881
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,495
Just help me.

882
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,206
Just put yourself in their shoes.

883
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,376
- Come on. If this were your fire sale,
- Okay, okay.

884
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,712
- you were running this thing,
what would be your next move?
- Okay, uh ... 

885
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,798
Well, the whole point
of a fire sale

886
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,883
is that it-it's mostly
done by remote, right?

887
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:33,389
But ...  but not everything is run completely online.
Uh, uh, major utilities aren't.

888
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:38,185
They're run by closed-circuit, so you could
breach the security up to a certain point, but, um,

889
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,479
to shut it down,
you would have to physically go there.

890
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,398
You'd have to show up,
right, and-and, uh ... 

891
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,067
You know what?
Give me that guy's P.D.A.

892
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,735
The phones don't work.
They're all dead.

893
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,904
No, the phones are fine;
it's the network that's dead.

894
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,864
I've just got to reprogram it

895
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,408
and link it into the old SATCOMs.

896
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,409
Hackers surf'em

897
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,868
all the time -
that's probably

898
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,036
what these guys are using

899
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,037
to talk to each other.

900
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,247
How do you know all this stuff?

901
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,957
Dude, I don't know.

902
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,000
There's a lot rattling around
up there.

903
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,335
I couldn't tell you.

904
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,213
Okay. National power grid - uh,

905
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,215
gas and electric is divided
into three zones, right?

906
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,385
Eastern, central and western,
each with a primary hub.

907
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,513
Here it is.

908
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,098
What is that?

909
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,600
- What are we looking at?
- That is the eastern hub.

910
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,686
Now, they take this out ... 

911
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,148
wipes out all the power for
the entire eastern corridor.

912
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,108
But again, you'd have
to do it manually.

913
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,486
Okay ... 
Come on. Let's go.

914
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,904
What, to West Virginia?

915
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,406
Hey, l-I honestly don't think

916
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,700
I can handle any more people
trying to kill me.

917
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,826
McClane? McClane?

918
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,952
Well, you get used to it.

919
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,245
McClane ...  Oh, shit.

920
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,788
Sir, wireless
networks are down,

921
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,124
and I think they're hitting
the landlines, too.

922
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:46,086
l don't care how.
You find me a line.

923
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,796
Come on. Whatcha got?

924
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,424
We swept the whole building.
Seems clean. We can sweep it again.

925
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,635
- I don't think we're gonna find anything.
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

926
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,512
It's a fake.

927
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,222
This guy's playing us.

928
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,350
Okay, get everyone back inside
the crisis center now.

929
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,227
Okay. Let's open it up!

930
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,315
Come on. Get in.

931
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,484
Door's locked,

932
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,986
unless you have an extra gun
l can use to unlock it.

933
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:16,950
Hey, hey, don't do that.
Hey! You're gonna disable it.

934
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,661
Jesus Christ!

935
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,997
Oh! That was crazy.
Did you see that?

936
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,499
Sorry about that, man.

937
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,251
I didn't know
it would come out so fast.

938
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,547
Uh ...  man..

939
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,007
How'd you do yours?

940
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,677
You all right?

941
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,681
What'd you ... ? What, it hit you
a little bit? Sorry.

942
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,019
Oh, no, listen, do-do not ... 

943
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,939
Please don't touch those, okay?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

944
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,233
I mean, I-I've read about it.

945
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:53,070
Road assist, we've detected 
an air bag deployment.

946
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,614
Yes, um ... 
Please, we just hit a tree,

947
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,866
and my-my my dad is having
a heart attack.

948
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,118
And I think he's gonna die!
You need to help us.

949
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,080
Hold while we contact 
emergency services.

950
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,207
No, no, no, he's ...  he's dying.

951
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,459
Please, listen to me.
I-I can get him to a hospital.

952
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,835
I can drive. l'm fine.

953
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,295
But I can't really turn the key.

954
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,548
The key won't start,
so you gotta start

955
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,216
the car for us, okay? Please, Dad ... 

956
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,384
Your name, please?

957
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,677
Uh ... 

958
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,346

my name is-is ... 

959
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,681
Frank ... 

960
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,058
and my dad's name is,

961
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,434
um ... 

962
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,728

is ... 

963
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,023
"Dvorak Tsarjenski."

964
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,276
Please ... 

965
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,653
Please just help us, okay?
We need your help, please!

966
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,489
Emergency services are on their way.

967
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,907
No, no, h-hold on.
Listen to me.

968
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,534
Listen to me, ma'am.
What is your name?

969
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,244
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

970
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,581
Okay, Dolores, uh, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

971
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,208
and I want to be able to say
that a year from now, okay?

972
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,751
Because my dad
is my hero,

973
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,087
and right now
he is in my arms dying.

974
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,465
A-And his only hope i-is to get
to a hospital right now.

975
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,719
And we can't wait, so please
start the goddamn car!

976
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,058
Thank you, Dolores.

977
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,519
Pass me the P.D.A.
I gotta call the Warlock.

978
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,854
- The what?
- The Warlock.

979
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,231
He's a digital Jedi.
He's amazing.

980
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,417
Ma'am, you're not
authorized to be here.

981
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,211
F.B.I. We suspect there's
been a security breach.

982
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,714
No, you can't land here
without authoriza ... 

983
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,777
That was pretty good
back there, kid.

984
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,613
Thanks.

985
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:03,325
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

986
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,994
No. Just ... 

987
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,162
What?
What's the matter with you?

988
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,580
It's not funny.
I'm not like you.

989
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,749
I can't ...  I can't do this shit.

990
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,751
What do you mean?
What's that mean? Like what?

991
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,672
I'm not, like ...  like heroic
and everything, I'm ... 

992
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,256
not brave like you are.

993
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,466
I'm not that guy.

994
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,051
I'm nobody's hero, kid.

995
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,720
You saved my life, like, ten
times in the last six hours.

996
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,555
Just doing my job, that's all.

997
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,015
Ah ... 

998
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,478
Know what you get
for being a hero? Nothing.

999
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,063
You get shot at.

1000
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,357
You get a little pat
on the back, blah-blah-blah.

1001
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,609
That-a-boy!

1002
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,531
Get divorced.

1003
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,616
A wife that can't remember
your last name.

1004
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,121
Kids don't want to talk to you.

1005
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:52,624
Get to eat a lot of meals
by yourself.

1006
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,168
Trust me, kid.
Nobody wants to be that guy.

1007
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,004
Then why you doing this?

1008
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,799
Because there's nobody else
to do it right now, that's why.

1009
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,509
Believe me, if there was
somebody else to do it,

1010
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,261
I would let them do it,
but there's not,

1011
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,846
so we're doing it.

1012
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:11,184
Ah ...  and that's what
makes you that guy.

1013
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,361
Thing's flying now.

1014
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:25,115
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

1015
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,374
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted access.

1016
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,693
Stay here.

1017
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,682
All right, come on.

1018
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,975
Okay.

1019
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,619
We're in.

1020
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,745
Good. Shut it down.

1021
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,051
Guess you were right, kid.

1022
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,095
Okay, that's ...  awful.

1023
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,890
We got company.

1024
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,442
So, how would they shut down

1025
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,485
the power grid?

1026
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,486
What?

1027
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,487
Come on!

1028
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,822
Uh ...  central control room.

1029
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,115
Okay.

1030
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,909
Uh ...  fourth floor.

1031
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,953
- Fourth floor!
- Come on!

1032
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,957
- Take the right.
- Right.

1033
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,838
Oh ... 

1034
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,299
Shh!

1035
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,427
- I'm gonna stop here for ... 
- Just try to keep up.

1036
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:53,930
I am keeping up. I just want to stop
for two seconds to catch a breath.

1037
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,891
You know, they have these
things called gymnasiums.

1038
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,684
It's not like they're ... 

1039
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,332
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go!

1040
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,798
Right.

1041
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,138
Intel's fairly certain that
the terrorists are mobile.

1042
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:38,600
It's the only way
to consistently avoid signal triangulation,

1043
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,519
and judging by the amount
of hardware they're running,

1044
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,605
we're probably looking
for a large vehicle,

1045
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,441
most likely a semitrailer rig.

1046
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,235
All right, tell the guys at
Homeland Security we need every

1047
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,656
agent, satellite and functioning
network they got - now.

1048
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,718
Playtime's over, sweetheart.

1049
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,055
Don't.
Take your hand off the gun.

1050
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,557
Hands up.
Stand up.

1051
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,607
Go on, now!

1052
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:31,778
Let's go, kid.
You're up.

1053
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:32,862
Okay.

1054
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,741
As fast as you can. Hey!

1055
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:40,870
Jesus!

1056
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,247
Oh!

1057
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,806
That's enough of this Kung-Fu shit.

1058
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,225
I've known
some bitches in my day,

1059
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:04,519
but you are the biggest ... 

1060
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,063
Okay, uh ... 

1061
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:09,357
Uh ... 

1062
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,401
Still awake, huh?

1063
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,278
Just keep doing what you're doing.

1064
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,238
- Okay.
- How much time do you need?

1065
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,406
Um, um ...  not much.

1066
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,916
Whoo!

1067
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,336
Are you done?

1068
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,338
I ... 

1069
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,339
Are you done?

1070
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,050
- No, no, not quite.
- What?

1071
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,469
I'm not exactly checking
my e-mail here, you know?

1072
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,930
They ran this hack in V.M.O.,
so I'm isolating their A.P.l.,

1073
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,807
- and just booting the host.
- What?!

1074
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,727
It means about 30 seconds, okay?

1075
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:48,688
Not the easiest thing to do when ... 

1076
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,453
Okay!

1077
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,205
Undo everything you just did ...  now!

1078
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:08,208
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1079
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,085
I'm a righty. I'm a righty.

1080
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:13,046
I'm a righty. I need my
other hand. I really do.

1081
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,423
I'm a righty.

1082
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,874
One last door to open.

1083
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,128
Do you know what you're doing?

1084
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,755
I mean, do you realize what
this'll do to the country?

1085
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,757
Yes, I do.

1086
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,509
Now open the door.

1087
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,219
Okay, good.

1088
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,513
Glad we're on the same page.

1089
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,897
You do? I'm glad you know.

1090
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,786
Ooh!

1091
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,707
How you doing?

1092
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,426
Hang on!

1093
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,043
Listen ...  let's just talk
about this for one ... 

1094
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,509
How you doing?

1095
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,344
That's not too tight,
is it? Huh? Huh?

1096
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,306
Damn it!

1097
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:13,559
Smile pretty!

1098
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,304
McClane!

1099
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,933
Oh, shit.

1100
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,977
McClane, get outta there!

1101
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:58,938
Come on, man. Come on!

1102
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,569
Come on, man!

1103
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,785
Oh, God.

1104
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,884
Did you see that?

1105
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,847
So, you stopped it, right?

1106
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,849
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
actually, having a gun

1107
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,352
to your head makes it harder
to do this kind of work.

1108
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,312
- What?!
- I know that comes as a surprise.

1109
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,608
Shit.

1110
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,069
You can't just turn it
off? Just lock 'em out?

1111
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,153
I'm not sure.

1112
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,283
I ...  might be able
to slow them down, though.

1113
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,244
Western and central hubs are ours.

1114
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,080
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

1115
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,999
Hang on.
Something's up.

1116
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,168
All the security's reactivating.

1117
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:04,212
I think someone might be

1118
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,672
in the market for some cheap Viagra.

1119
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,801
Why don't you take some of that?
Now that your girlfriend's dead,

1120
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,221
why don't you check out our sexy
singles that you can chat with?

1121
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,848
It's an e-bomb.

1122
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,815
Hey, h-hey ... 

1123
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:30,863
All right, all right, wait,
wait, wait.

1124
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,826
Mai, talk to me.
What's going on?

1125
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:35,910
Mai?

1126
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,995
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,915
Little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

1128
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,166
I don't think she's gonna

1129
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,085
be talking to anybody
for a really long time.

1130
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:48,005
Last time I saw her, she was at
the bottom of an elevator shaft

1131
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,341
with an S.U.V.
rammed up her ass.

1132
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,303
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1133
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:57,932
Listen, jackass,
your fire sale's over.

1134
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,602
So pack up your little circus,

1135
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,981
or l'm gonna come
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

1136
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:10,445
You have no idea who I am
or what I am capable of.

1137
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,156
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

1138
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:17,034
I will focus
all my attention on you.

1139
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,247
You want to make things
personal, fine.

1140
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,811
Reroute every cubic foot
of natural gas in the pipelines

1141
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,730
to that station.

1142
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,816
Can you get Bowman on this thing?

1143
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,569
Sure.
I can get anyone.

1144
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,570
Do it.

1145
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:53,946
Now?

1146
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,072
Yeah. Now.

1147
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,827
Please, no ... 

1148
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:02,788
It's Thomas Gabriel.

1149
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:03,581
Shit.

1150
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,335
You know this guy?!

1151
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:10,671
l worked with him.
He was D.O.D.'s chief programmer

1152
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,215
for infrastructure security.

1153
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,842
After 9/11, he's the guy
that told Joint Chiefs

1154
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,636
the system was vulnerable.

1155
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,763
He was pushing for total overhaul,
but they wouldn't listen.

1156
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,556
Gabriel's not exactly
people-friendly.

1157
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,266
You think so?

1158
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,518
When he tried to go public,

1159
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,561
they crucified him ... 

1160
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,313
destroyed his reputation.

1161
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:28,981
- Froze assets. After that,
- Uh ... 

1162
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:29,857
he disappeared.

1163
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,360
We got a pretty serious problem.

1164
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:34,654
Wh ...  hold on one minute. What?

1165
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:38,783
I think we need to get
out of here right now.

1166
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,159
They're sending the gas lines here.

1167
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,911
Gas lines? What gas lines?

1168
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:43,579
Christ.

1169
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,289
Oh ... 

1170
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,042
all of them. See that?

1171
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:49,335
Those flashing arrows?
That's not good.

1172
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:50,461
All that's coming here?

1173
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,005
Yeah, I think we gotta go.

1174
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,132
He-Hey, listen,
I gotta go, I gotta go.

1175
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,509
Just find Thomas Gabriel.

1176
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:59,011
McClane? McClane?

1177
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,389
Let's go.
Let's go. Finish this up!

1178
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,564
Right now. Finish it up.
Come on. Let's go!

1179
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,002
Get in there!

1180
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,007
You okay?

1181
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,640
Let's go, come on.
Got to get out of here.

1182
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,683
Oh, what's the point?
Man, what is the point?

1183
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,518
Hey. Knock that off.
Come on.

1184
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:32,688
This has something to do with that code
you wrote for them. All right? Now think.

1185
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,273
Come on.
Help us win.

1186
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,859
Win?

1187
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:39,612
When do we start winning? Huh?

1188
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,530
Take a look around.
Are you out of your mind?

1189
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,324
Does it look like
we're even close to winning?

1190
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,076
We just got the shit
kicked out of us.

1191
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,203
What, do you think
I'm holding out on you,

1192
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:48,746
there's something I'm
just not telling you?

1193
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,332
If I knew what they
wanted, I would tell you.

1194
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,833
I would happily tell you.

1195
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,628
Jesus.

1196
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,250
The Warlock.

1197
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,127
Oh, great. Ah!

1198
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,670
There goes the cell phone.

1199
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:39,380
They knock the satellites
out of the skies now?

1200
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,382
No, your battery ran out.

1201
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:42,925
- Listen, we should go see him.
- Who?

1202
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:45,386
The Warlock, we should drive to his house.
He's not that far away.

1203
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,388
- He's in Baltimore.
- Can't go to Warlock's house.

1204
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:49,014
Hey, hey, hey,
you want me to help you.

1205
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,057
This is me helping you.

1206
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,434
Okay? Trust me.

1207
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:52,893
We got to go see the Warlock.

1208
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,186
It's our only hope.

1209
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,235
How do you feel about flying?

1210
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:02,570
Uh, about what?

1211
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:03,863
You mean like with a pilot?

1212
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,747
Just stick it in the round thing.

1213
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,206
What brown thing?

1214
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:17,084
Here, put these on.

1215
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,586
Just stick it in there.

1216
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,754
That'll work.

1217
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,046
You okay?

1218
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:24,592
Uh, yeah, I'm just
kind of afraid of flying ... 

1219
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,343
Yeah, I used to be terrified
of flying.

1220
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,094
Really?

1221
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,387
Yeah. Took some lessons.

1222
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:29,930
You know, face your fears,
that kind of thing.

1223
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,223
Yeah? Did it help?

1224
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,933
Not really.

1225
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,103
Is it ... 

1226
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,148
Is it supposed to make that sound?

1227
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:40,775
Yeah.

1228
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:43,903
Maybe we should just drive.

1229
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:45,279
It'll be fun, it'll
be like a road trip.

1230
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:47,323
Just take it easy. They say
taking off is the hardest part.

1231
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,532
Really? I ...  I heard ... 

1232
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,409
To be honest,
I missed a couple of classes.

1233
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,120
Ha-ha-ha.
You did, really?

1234
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:56,540
But you have your license, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these, right?

1235
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,668
- Oh ... 
- Hey! Here we go.

1236
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,295
- Hey.
- We're up.

1237
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:03,339
Oh, God.

1238
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:08,594
Okay. That's good.
That's pretty good.

1239
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,807
Jesus, look at that.

1240
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,809
This whole area is blacked out.

1241
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,104
How we going
to find Warlock's house?

1242
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:22,566
Um, it's probably gonna be the
one with the lights still on.

1243
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,492
Power outage keeps spreading.

1244
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:34,286
About half the East Coast
has already gone down.

1245
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,205
All right.

1246
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,707
Put everything
on emergency generators.

1247
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,877
How the hell
are they getting past us?

1248
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,340
Uh, okay.

1249
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,800
Uh, down there, down there,
I see it.

1250
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,593
- Down there?
- Left, left, down.

1251
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:56,433
We're gonna land there?
We're gonna land down there?

1252
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,145
- All right, hang on.
- Okay, okay.

1253
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,355
Oh ... 

1254
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:03,899
Fence.

1255
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,234
Fence, fence.

1256
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,487
Fence, fence!

1257
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:09,989
I see ... 

1258
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,448
Watch ... !

1259
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,249
Whoo!

1260
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,584
Oh ... 

1261
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,128
Oh. Jesus.

1262
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,379
Come on.

1263
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:28,507
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, taking
off is the hardest part.

1264
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,967
Let's go.

1265
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:35,055
Now, there's something
you need to know about Warlock.

1266
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,892
He, he hates cops.
I mean, he hates them, okay?

1267
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,311
So just let me do all the talking.

1268
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:50,946
Shit.

1269
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,491
Hey, Mrs. Kaludis.

1270
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,201
Um, is Freddy home?

1271
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,874
l'm Matt Farrell
and this is, uh ...  Billy.

1272
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,170
We're friends from space camp.

1273
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,088
We went to space camp with Freddy.

1274
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,674
Freddy!

1275
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:12,927
Freddy?

1276
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,345
You got company.

1277
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:23,979
Frederick, didn't you hear me?

1278
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,106
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

1279
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,942
Your friends are here.

1280
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,401
Friends? What ...  what the ... ?

1281
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,111
Come on, Ma!

1282
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,613
How many times I got to tell you

1283
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:34,114
don't bring people down here, man?

1284
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,575
I can't see too good. Is that
a young bearded Han Solo?

1285
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,161
What happened, man?
You lost so much weight.

1286
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,621
No, dude, I gained 30 pounds.
Who is that?

1287
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:42,456
- Oh, that's ... 
- You know what? Doesn't matter.

1288
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,541
Dude, what are you even doing here?
'Cause of you, I am rockin'

1289
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,294
five generators just
so I can stay online.

1290
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:48,963
And since you're being
hunted by assassins,

1291
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,799
it doesn't really make me
think, like, this visit

1292
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:54,385
is a very productive or
healthy use of my time, and ... 

1293
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,886
Hey, hey, don't
touch that, all right?

1294
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,846
C.B. radio?

1295
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,932
A little low-tech for you guys,
isn't it?

1296
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:03,894
Low-tech - dude, that, my friend,
is an end-of-the-world insurance system, okay?

1297
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,562
So when the last
microchip goes down,

1298
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,815
I'm gonna be able to stay in touch
with whoever's out there,

1299
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:10,192
whether they be zombies or not,
I'll tell you that right now.

1300
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:12,528
What'd you bring your dad here for?!

1301
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:16,740
- He's cool; he's into the whole gaming culture ... 
- Nice poster.

1302
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,826
What, like,
you a big fan of the Fett?

1303
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,577
- Oh, God.
- No.

1304
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,205
I was always more
of a "Star Wars" guy.

1305
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,832
- "Star Wars" guy.
- Oh, he's kidding.

1306
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,667
- Who is this man?!
- He's my ... 

1307
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:28,335
Hey, dump truck, I'm not his dad.

1308
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,629
I'm a cop.
How about that?

1309
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,298
Oh, a cop, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

1310
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,510
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command center?!

1311
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,012
Command center.

1312
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,722
- It's a basement.
- It's a command center.

1313
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,515
Don't help, McClane.
I can explain.

1314
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:43,809
Just tell us what you know
about Thomas Gabriel, all right?

1315
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,436
That's why we came here.

1316
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,771
Thomas Gabriel. That's cool.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1317
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,356
Get out - I want you out right now!

1318
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,899
- Why?
- Hey, hey.

1319
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,402
- 'Cause!
- Just calm down, big boy.

1320
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:55,279
You calm down!
This is my house.

1321
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,364
You're going to tell me
what I want to know,

1322
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:00,617
or I'm going to beat you
to death in your own house.

1323
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,717
Four years ago, the D.O.D.

1324
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,553
recruits Thomas Gabriel to be
a cyber-spook for them, okay?

1325
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:21,555
First day on the job,
goes in to his bosses

1326
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:25,392
and tells them this nation's security
infrastructure is wide open to compromise,

1327
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,853
and what do they say?
"We'll take it under advisement."

1328
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:30,647
But this dude don't ease up,
'cause he's committed, like you read about,

1329
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,692
so he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, okay?

1330
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,737
And using just a laptop,
hacks into NORAD

1331
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:38,655
and shuts down our
entire defense network,

1332
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,824
till they put a gun
to the man's head

1333
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,618
and forced him to stop the hack.

1334
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:46,080
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

1335
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,249
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Just tell us how to find the guy, that's all.

1336
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,419
How do I know how to find the guy?
He's a ghost, man; he just fell off the grid.

1337
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,420
Another dead-end.

1338
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:54,797
- Come on.
- Hold on, wait, McClane.

1339
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,591
Listen, Warlock, a couple
of weeks ago, I wrote ... 

1340
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,551
I know, dude, you
wrote a mutating

1341
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,095
algorithmic security code

1342
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:04,014
that's probably being used
by Thomas Gabriel right now.

1343
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,599
No, we know that, yes.

1344
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:06,975
Can you tell us
what he's using it for?

1345
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,936
I don't know. l've been
trying to figure that out.

1346
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,230
Here, look.

1347
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,483
The only security system
in the country that I can find

1348
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,902
currently employing
that particular template

1349
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:19,071
is the Social Security
Administration, okay?

1350
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,323
But they don't even use it
in the main facility. Look.

1351
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:23,408
They use it in this building.

1352
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,493
Over here in Woodlawn.

1353
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:27,704
- Ooh. What the hell? God.
- I know, right?

1354
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,457
"Right," what?
What the hell are you guys talking about?

1355
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,376
- The power consumption is off the charts.
- It's hot.

1356
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,711
- Why would there be chilling towers there?
- That's what I thought.

1357
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,755
Ho.

1358
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,590
What's a chilling tower?

1359
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:41,844
See what l've been dealing with?

1360
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:45,514
Large server farms generate
a lot of heat and need to be cooled.

1361
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:47,015
But why there?

1362
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,351
Tell you what, guys.
I don't know what's in that building,

1363
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:52,020
but I assure you it's not
Social Security numbers.

1364
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,986
I got a red flag over here.

1365
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,573
Someone's hacking into Woodlawn.

1366
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,409
Honing in on the host server right now.

1367
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,954
Frederick Kaludis.

1368
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:10,497
Let's have a look at him.

1369
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,790
Fat bastard.

1370
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:18,130
McClane.

1371
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:19,882
Where is his daughter?

1372
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,842
We just got a trace on her cell.

1373
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:24,344
You're going to love this.

1374
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:31,268
All right, let's get
a better look at you.

1375
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,240
- Freddy.
- What?

1376
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:48,952
What the hell are you doing
dicking around inside my network?

1377
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,333
McClane?

1378
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,501
I thought I killed you already.

1379
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:59,796
I get that sometimes.

1380
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:05,427
You think you can, uh,
find a track where he is?

1381
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:06,595
- Two minutes.
- Detective,

1382
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:08,889
covering the camera
with your hand

1383
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,808
does not turn off the microphone.

1384
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:15,270
Yeah ...  I know l'm not
as smart as you guys

1385
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:18,023
at all this computer shit.

1386
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:19,399
But, hey ... 

1387
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,110
I'm still alive, ain't I?

1388
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:27,241
I mean, you've got to be running
out of bad guys by now, right?

1389
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,617
Huh?

1390
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,537
Gabriel?

1391
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:35,999
Honestly, you can tell me.

1392
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,293
I mean, how does that work?

1393
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:40,504
Got some kind
of service or something?

1394
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,215
Some kind of 800 number?
1-800-HENCHMEN?

1395
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:45,300
Oh, you know what?
I bet you're still on hold

1396
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,928
with "Can I get another dead
Asian hooker bitch

1397
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:50,430
over here right away?"

1398
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,642
Huh? But seriously,
all that kicking aside,

1399
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:57,312
that skinny little ninja chick,
she was smokin' hot.

1400
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:00,107
A new one of those gonna be
real hard to come by, right?

1401
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:02,818
You're very impressed
with yourself, aren't you?

1402
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:04,444
I have my moments.

1403
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:07,239
Yeah?

1404
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,117
Is this one of them?

1405
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,080
Hello?

1406
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:18,917
- Yes, this is emergency services calling.
- Oh, thank God.

1407
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,503
- Can she hear me?
- My name is Lucy Gennero.
l've been stuck for hours.

1408
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,422
- I've been trying to call ... 
- Hey.

1409
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:26,174
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone.

1410
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:27,676
Yes. Calm down, miss.

1411
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,845
We know exactly where you are.

1412
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:31,305
Everything is going to be all right.

1413
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,015
Lucy, hang up the phone!

1414
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:37,060
Please, John, I'm trying
to have a conversation.

1415
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,107
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

1416
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:45,444
but I assure you, we're going
to get you out of there,

1417
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,904
even if I have to come down
there and get you myself.

1418
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,823
Thank you.

1419
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:51,616
In the meantime, Miss Gennero,
is there anyone

1420
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,535
you would like us
to contact for you?

1421
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:55,287
Yeah.

1422
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:58,165
My dad.

1423
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:00,000
His name is John McClane.

1424
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:02,169
He's a New York City cop.

1425
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,296
We'll find him.

1426
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,630
Just hang in there, miss.

1427
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:08,550
We'll get to you ...  very soon.

1428
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:13,638
Thank you.

1429
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:16,850
Wow. That's a great girl
you got there.

1430
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,518
Can't wait to meet her.

1431
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:19,895
What's the matter?

1432
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:21,521
Cat got your tongue?

1433
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:24,524
Come on, John.

1434
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,860
Make a joke.

1435
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:30,614
Say something funny.

1436
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:37,287
Where are you go ... 
Wh-wh ... 

1437
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,039
Where are you going? Hey.

1438
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:40,874

McClane! Hey!

1439
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,000
Hold up. Hold on.

1440
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,044
Where you going?
What are you gonna do?

1441
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:45,837
What do you think I'm going to do?

1442
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:48,298
I'm going to go kill this guy
and get my daughter.

1443
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,092
- But she could be anywhere.
- Listen to me.

1444
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,468
It's going to get messy.

1445
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:52,469
You should just stay here.

1446
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:53,929
I think I ... 

1447
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:56,223
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

1448
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:57,766
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

1449
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,435
I'll take it from here.

1450
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,188
Thanks for your help.

1451
01:30:09,695 --> 01:30:13,281
I wouldn't bet on you, either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

1452
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,576
Buckle up.

1453
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,730
F.B.I., ma'am, Jersey field office.

1454
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,524
Mind if I see your I.D.?

1455
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,609
Not at all.

1456
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,454
My dad's a cop.

1457
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:01,705
Force of habit.

1458
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,876
Your father sounds like
a very smart man.

1459
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,631
Kid, can you get Bowman?

1460
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,383
Uh, yeah.

1461
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,812
It's completely dead.

1462
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,606
Gabriel must have shut down

1463
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:28,815
all the satellite links.

1464
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,233
Shit.

1465
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,574
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1466
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:42,829
About all of it.

1467
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,372
It's my fault you got into this.

1468
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:45,832
This wasn't your fight.

1469
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,459
You got nothing to be sorry about.

1470
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,049
Let go of me, you bastard.

1471
01:31:54,133 --> 01:31:56,259
This bitch is a handful.

1472
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,099
Are you gonna be all right?

1473
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:07,354
Hey ...  behave ... 

1474
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:08,522
or I will hurt you.

1475
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:09,981
Oh, yeah?

1476
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,942
Let's step outside, just you and me.

1477
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,735
We'll see who hurts who.

1478
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,697
You really are his daughter.

1479
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,741
Tie her wrists.

1480
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:27,916
Trey.

1481
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,125
Gabriel wants to see you.

1482
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,377
Is it that time already?

1483
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,836
Yeah.

1484
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:34,464
Okay.

1485
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:37,842
I'll be back in a second.

1486
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:45,016
No, no, no, please, please!

1487
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,937
We're showing a breach

1488
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:33,023
on an exterior vent.

1489
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,654
Go take a look.

1490
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:42,532
Don't be long.
We're packing up soon.

1491
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,629
Hey, McClane.

1492
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,881
Do we have anything resembling
a plan or anything?

1493
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,966
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1494
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,386
I mean more like a plan,
like a way to do that.

1495
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,807
Come on.

1496
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:10,935
Okay, according to the layout,

1497
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,271
uh, the chilling towers
are kept on the bottom level.

1498
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,737
I think mine's locked.

1499
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:28,953
Okay, now it looks like
we're getting somewhere.

1500
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:37,045
Uh ... 

1501
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:41,341
Okay, this looks like

1502
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:43,343
it controls the cooling system
for the mainframe,

1503
01:34:43,427 --> 01:34:46,304
which should be ... 

1504
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:50,392
If I can just hack in ... 

1505
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:53,353
 ... trip the alarm,
it might alert Bowman.

1506
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,862
Someone set off the alarms.

1507
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,698
Yes. Thank you, detective.

1508
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:05,907
I can hear that.

1509
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:07,826
Find a way to turn it off.

1510
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:13,873
What do you got?

1511
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,084
We got a problem.

1512
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:18,545
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1513
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:21,047
It's got to be him.

1514
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,008
And what's Woodlawn?

1515
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,431
It's N.S.A.,

1516
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,267
a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

1517
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:34,561
It's a fail-safe
we built after 9/11

1518
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:36,438
to back up
all financial information.

1519
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:38,398
The moment the networks
were hit,

1520
01:35:38,482 --> 01:35:39,899
all the financial data

1521
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,067
automatically
began downloading

1522
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:42,861
to those servers.

1523
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:44,988
Banks, Wall Street,
corporate records,

1524
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:46,239
government funds,

1525
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:48,450
all of it, basically,
a backup

1526
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:51,286
for the accumulated wealth
of America.

1527
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:52,829
All in one location?

1528
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:56,583
What could Gabriel do with it?

1529
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:59,002
Well, if he could get in, he
might try to transfer the data

1530
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:00,628
to a portable hard drive;

1531
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:03,715
then he could have access to
those accounts from anywhere,

1532
01:36:03,799 --> 01:36:06,301
siphon off billions for himself.

1533
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:08,261
We'd have no way to trace it.

1534
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:11,014
Or knowing him,
he could erase it all

1535
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,141
and send us all
back to the Stone Age.

1536
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:16,269
Why the hell
wasn't I told about this?

1537
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:18,104
Frankly, uh,

1538
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,773
it's above your pay grade.

1539
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,941
My pay grade?

1540
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:24,986
How the hell
did Gabriel

1541
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,155
find out about this, when
even I didn't know about it?

1542
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:34,037
He designed it.

1543
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,332
It was his program.

1544
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,626
He knew that hacking
your system last night

1545
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,461
would trigger the download.

1546
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:44,380
That's brilliant.

1547
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:48,343
You two geniuses stay out of my way.

1548
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,934
Let me see if I can get a floor plan of this place.

1549
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:58,812
- Okay ... 
- Don't move!

1550
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:02,482
You - get away from the bag.
Now!

1551
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:04,651
Okay. Okay.

1552
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,236
We've been waiting for you.

1553
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,446
Yeah?

1554
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:10,740
I've been waiting for you, too.

1555
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:42,856
McClane!

1556
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:46,860
Kid!

1557
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:48,319
Matt!

1558
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:49,529
Kid?!

1559
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:05,086
Emerson.

1560
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:08,464
We seem to have a problem
in one of the cooling towers.

1561
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:09,924
- Tower Seven.
- Tower Seven.

1562
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:12,719
- Find out what's going on.
- Okay.

1563
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:23,855
- Sir?
- Get the H.R. team to stand by.

1564
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,398
We need to get to Woodlawn now.

1565
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:27,734
The roads out are completely blocked.
D.C. is in total gridlock.

1566
01:38:27,818 --> 01:38:30,236
Well, get us some helicopters.

1567
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:33,907
Sir, they've all been pulled
by the Pentagon for search and rescue.

1568
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:37,285
Molina, find me some goddamn
helicopters immediately.

1569
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:41,581
Look, the Pentagon has jets flying CAP over D.C.
Have them send one over to Woodlawn

1570
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:44,000
and keep an eye on things
till we get there.

1571
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:45,418
Let's go.

1572
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:58,431
Where's my daughter?

1573
01:38:58,515 --> 01:39:01,059
Russo, check in.

1574
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:05,855
Yeah, I think, uh ... 

1575
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,440
Russo's on his way down

1576
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:09,943
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1577
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,194
Hold on a minute.

1578
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,446
Looks like he's coming around.

1579
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,615
It's McClane. He's on the
third floor and the kid is ... 

1580
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:21,788
Get all that?

1581
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:23,539
That's right.

1582
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:27,210
I'm on the third floor,
but I'm coming to get you.

1583
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:38,262
Don't move now.
I'll send a doctor.

1584
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,935
Kill this guy and I'll
give you Mai's cut.

1585
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,279
Shit.

1586
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:32,275
My algorithm.

1587
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:39,407
Okay, please get in.

1588
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:43,327
Oh, please. God.

1589
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:22,241
Oh, Jesus, they're going
after the money.

1590
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:47,600
You coming to get me, John?

1591
01:41:47,684 --> 01:41:48,768
Is that the plan?

1592
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:50,645
Yep. That's my plan.

1593
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,231
What makes you think I won't put
a bullet in your daughter's head

1594
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:54,482
right now?

1595
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:56,150
- 'Cause you're scared of me.
- Is that right?

1596
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:57,443
You think I'm afraid of you?

1597
01:41:57,528 --> 01:42:00,154
'Cause otherwise
she'd be dead already.

1598
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,489
You need a bargaining chip.

1599
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:10,915
Stop there.
Hands up.

1600
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:13,751
if you kill me, you'll
never get it open.

1601
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:17,421
Move away.

1602
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:18,631
Move!

1603
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:27,140
You know, John,

1604
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:29,142
I feel like we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

1605
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:31,477
And because of that,

1606
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:34,814
you think I'm the bad guy,
and nothing could be

1607
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:36,816
further from the truth:
I'm the good guy here.

1608
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,402
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1609
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,903
Did I get a thank-you?

1610
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:42,238
No, I got crucified.

1611
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:43,781
But they wouldn't listen.

1612
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:45,324
You got their attention now,

1613
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:47,326
- don't you?
- That's right.

1614
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,913
I am doing the country a favor.

1615
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,374
By tearing it apart.

1616
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,667
Better me than some outsider,

1617
01:42:54,751 --> 01:42:58,629
some religious nut-job
bent on Armageddon.

1618
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:00,673
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1619
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:03,843
Everything I've broken
can be fixed ... 

1620
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:06,846
if the country is willing
to pay for it.

1621
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,222
Ah, bullshit.

1622
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,933
It's always been about the money.

1623
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,894
What, I shouldn't get paid
for my work?

1624
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:14,687
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1625
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:17,940
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a check for you.

1626
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:22,361
I can't talk to this guy.

1627
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:24,780
You talk to him, see if
you can get him to focus.

1628
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,450
Dad?

1629
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:32,163
Hi, baby.

1630
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:34,165
Now there are only five of them.

1631
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:40,004
Hang on, Lucy. I'm coming.

1632
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:53,392
Would somebody please
kill this son of a bitch?

1633
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:57,271
We have a problem.

1634
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:58,439
No, there's ... 

1635
01:43:58,523 --> 01:43:59,732
there's actually no problem.

1636
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:02,026
I think I just got off
on the wrong floor.

1637
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:05,696
This is a mess.

1638
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:10,785
Wow, l'm ...  l'm truly
impressed, man.

1639
01:44:10,869 --> 01:44:12,203
Hacking every byte

1640
01:44:12,287 --> 01:44:14,372
of financial data for the
entire country would take weeks

1641
01:44:14,456 --> 01:44:15,831
unless you eliminated
the congestion.

1642
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:19,669
That's what this
fire sale's about, isn't it?

1643
01:44:19,753 --> 01:44:21,671
That's brilliant.

1644
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:23,798
Yes, it is.
Please be quiet.

1645
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:25,216
Asshole.

1646
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,342
Who are you?

1647
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,552
Matt Farrell.

1648
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,429
Lucy McClane.

1649
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:33,099
I thought your name was Gennero.

1650
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:35,434
Lucy Gennero.

1651
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:37,144
Not today.

1652
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:38,771
Can you crack the code?

1653
01:44:38,855 --> 01:44:41,232
Maybe, I mean, if I had enough time.

1654
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:43,359
That's encouraging.

1655
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:46,237
Take them with us.

1656
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:49,699
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1657
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,453
Gabriel, Pentagon just
sent an F-35 towards us.

1658
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:56,205
Keep an eye on it.

1659
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,584
Pulling down the go codes now.

1660
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,604
You might want to start thinking about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1661
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:28,988
Christ.

1662
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:30,614
Goddamn hamster.

1663
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:32,742
Here you go.

1664
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:35,286
Stay still, spider boy.

1665
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:41,083
That's right.

1666
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:11,447
Goddamn it!

1667
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,375
Oh-ho-ho, no.

1668
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:26,587
Seriously, you probably
shouldn't antagonize them

1669
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:29,298
since they have all
the loaded guns and whatnot.

1670
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:30,716
Listen, will you
just take a minute

1671
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:32,551
and dig deep for
a bigger set of balls,

1672
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,220
'cause you're gonna need
them before we're through.

1673
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:35,638
Wow, I know that tone.

1674
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:38,974
It's just weird hearing it
come from someone ...  with hair.

1675
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:15,803
Sir.

1676
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:19,557
E.T.A.: 15 minutes.

1677
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,527
Fix it.

1678
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:17,239
Oh, why? You're just going to
kill me if I fix it. I know that.

1679
01:48:24,456 --> 01:48:26,499
Shit.

1680
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:31,128
I'm not gonna do it.

1681
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:38,260
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

1682
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:41,514
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.
- I'm sorry. What?

1683
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:43,599
Something's wrong.
Robinson is coming too fast.

1684
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:50,272
It's not Robinson.

1685
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:52,816
That would be my dad.

1686
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:06,038
Freddy.

1687
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:08,457
Freddy!

1688
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:12,336
lt's John McClane.
Look, I know you can hear me.

1689
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:15,381
This is your frequency, right?
666.

1690
01:49:15,465 --> 01:49:17,258
Come on.
Pick up the mike, Freddy.

1691
01:49:20,303 --> 01:49:22,930
Uh, nobody here by that name, sorry.

1692
01:49:23,014 --> 01:49:25,057
Hacker jerk-off?

1693
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:31,522
Warlock ... 

1694
01:49:31,606 --> 01:49:33,232
I need you to do

1695
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:36,569
whatever it is you do to
patch me through to the F.B.I.,

1696
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:38,904
to Deputy Director Bowman.

1697
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:40,155
You hear me?

1698
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,574
Are you serious?

1699
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:43,701
You want me to intentionally
open up a comm line

1700
01:49:43,785 --> 01:49:46,620
to the head of the F.B.I. cyber
division? I don't think so.

1701
01:49:48,164 --> 01:49:50,749
Freddy, goddamn it.
They have my daughter.

1702
01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:58,257
I can do that. Hold on.

1703
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:00,634
Thank you.

1704
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:11,395
This is Central. We have
a patch for Director Bowman.

1705
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:14,857
Sir, Central's trying to reach you.

1706
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:17,234
Go.

1707
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,736
Bowman, it's McClane.

1708
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:21,113
- McClane.
- Listen to me.

1709
01:50:21,197 --> 01:50:23,741
Gabriel is on the 695 headed
north in a hazmat truck.

1710
01:50:23,825 --> 01:50:26,035
Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?

1711
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:27,703
We're headed there right now.

1712
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:29,747
And, Bowman, he's got my daughter.

1713
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:33,334
Listen, this hazmat truck

1714
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:36,003
is a government vehicle,
so it should be "lo-jacked", right?

1715
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:38,547
Track that down, it should
take you right to them.

1716
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:39,673
Give me the tag number.

1717
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:40,924
All right, hang on.

1718
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:41,967
Here it comes.

1719
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:44,970
Golf-Tango ... 

1720
01:50:45,055 --> 01:50:50,100
five-niner-two-November.

1721
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:52,811
Yeah, got it.
McClane, where is Farrell?

1722
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:54,438
He's with them.

1723
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:56,815
Listen to me.

1724
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,485
I'm going to go in there
and get Lucy out,

1725
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:01,403
but if something happens to me,

1726
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:03,447
you got to send the cavalry in,
you hear me?

1727
01:51:03,531 --> 01:51:05,491
I mean everybody.

1728
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:08,285
Don't let that maniac get
my daughter, you hear me?

1729
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:09,953
John, don't worry.

1730
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:11,789
I want your word, Bowman.

1731
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah, you have it.

1732
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:18,420
McClane out.

1733
01:51:25,637 --> 01:51:26,762
There's the F-35.

1734
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:31,225
Did you get the go codes?

1735
01:51:31,309 --> 01:51:34,186
- Trey! Did you get the go codes?
- Yes, yeah, I got the go codes.

1736
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:35,813
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1737
01:51:35,897 --> 01:51:36,939
Uh ... 

1738
01:51:38,066 --> 01:51:38,816
Uh ...  uh ... 

1739
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:55,040
Isolating his radio.

1740
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:02,464
Sending him the go codes.

1741
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:11,098
AV-81.

1742
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:15,185
AV-81, this is marine
airwing A.T.C.

1743
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:17,271
Go for AV-81.

1744
01:52:17,355 --> 01:52:18,731
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
has been located

1745
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:20,274
in your sector: big rig truck.

1746
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,068
Currently in pursuit 
of a hazmat vehicle.

1747
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:24,611
I see them, A.T.C.

1748
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,531
You are authorized
to engage and destroy.

1749
01:52:27,615 --> 01:52:29,992
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1750
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:39,418
What?

1751
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:49,511
Jesus Christ!

1752
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:50,554
Goddamn it!

1753
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:55,517
You're shooting at the wrong guy!

1754
01:53:03,526 --> 01:53:05,861
I don't think daddy's coming, honey.

1755
01:53:17,832 --> 01:53:20,584
Hey! Jackass!

1756
01:54:08,049 --> 01:54:10,843
Is that it?! Huh?!

1757
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:15,055
Is that your best shot?!

1758
01:54:58,474 --> 01:55:00,017
Come on!

1759
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,003
Come on!

1760
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,398
Whew.

1761
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:02,472
Let's go! Come on!

1762
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:05,600
- Got two more to go.
- That way. That way. Go.

1763
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:08,103
Let's go. Move it.

1764
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:17,362
We are leaving in three minutes.

1765
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:22,868
You have one.

1766
01:57:22,952 --> 01:57:24,077
The rules haven't changed, man.

1767
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,704
You're gonna kill me
the minute I unlock it.

1768
01:57:30,334 --> 01:57:34,254
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit ... 
- Matthew? Matthew!

1769
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:36,214
I really need you to pay attention.

1770
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,342
The rules can always change.

1771
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:40,343
Okay, wait.

1772
01:57:40,428 --> 01:57:42,054
I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.

1773
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:43,513
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1774
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:46,558
- Nine ... 
- I can't.

1775
01:57:46,642 --> 01:57:48,060
eight ... 

1776
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:51,563
I can't.

1777
01:57:51,647 --> 01:57:53,231
Oh, God ... 

1778
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:57,444
 Yaah! Okay!

1779
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:00,822
Okay, okay, okay.

1780
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:01,907
Six ... 

1781
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:04,409
Okay, just stop. Stop, stop.

1782
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:06,495
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

1783
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:07,913
Oh, God.

1784
01:58:07,997 --> 01:58:09,206
Oh, my God.

1785
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:24,346
Feds are headed this way.

1786
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:26,556
Get everything on the plane.

1787
01:58:35,858 --> 01:58:37,526
- Dad!
- Careful.

1788
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:38,819
Don't worry, baby.

1789
01:58:38,903 --> 01:58:41,113
Everything's gonna be all right.

1790
01:58:43,074 --> 01:58:44,658
Daddy!

1791
01:58:51,916 --> 01:58:53,208
Hold this.

1792
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:16,731
No!

1793
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:20,735
Jesus Christ.

1794
01:59:21,696 --> 01:59:23,905
You got her?

1795
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:25,031
You're sure?

1796
01:59:27,869 --> 01:59:29,911
It's a nice effort, though.

1797
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,496
Matthew!

1798
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:32,455
Oh, shit!

1799
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:33,665
All right, okay!

1800
01:59:33,749 --> 01:59:35,584
Okay, I'm doing it. I know.

1801
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:44,342
McClane.

1802
01:59:45,553 --> 01:59:48,471
Would you do me a favor?

1803
01:59:49,765 --> 01:59:52,267
I know the lights
are beginning to dim,

1804
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:53,852
but if you could just hang on

1805
01:59:53,936 --> 01:59:56,188
for a second, as soon
as Matt's finished,

1806
01:59:56,272 --> 01:59:58,023
I'm gonna kill him
and your daughter,

1807
01:59:58,107 --> 02:00:01,026
and I would love
for you to see that.

1808
02:00:02,111 --> 02:00:03,987
Goddamn it. Matthew?

1809
02:00:04,071 --> 02:00:07,199
Ten seconds, okay, ten seconds
you'll have all your money.

1810
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:09,326
You just leave.
No one has to get hurt, okay?

1811
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:10,827
A few seconds.

1812
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:11,828
Stay with me.

1813
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,997
McClane!

1814
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:18,210
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

1815
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:20,170
On your tombstone,
it should read:

1816
02:00:20,254 --> 02:00:23,465
"Always in the wrong place
at the wrong time."

1817
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:27,469
How about ...  "Yippee-ki-yay,

1818
02:00:27,553 --> 02:00:28,970
motherfu ... "

1819
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,400
Daddy ... 

1820
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:43,652
Daddy ... 

1821
02:00:43,736 --> 02:00:45,654
Are you okay?

1822
02:00:45,738 --> 02:00:47,530
Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1823
02:00:47,615 --> 02:00:51,201
I knew you would come for me.

1824
02:00:51,285 --> 02:00:52,744
Of course I'd come for you.

1825
02:00:52,828 --> 02:00:55,997
Sorry it took me so long. It's okay.

1826
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:04,506
Move, move!

1827
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:12,180
Freeze!

1828
02:01:12,265 --> 02:01:13,306
Hold, hold!

1829
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:15,141
He's okay.

1830
02:01:17,144 --> 02:01:19,145
Move around. Come around!

1831
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:22,023
- Here, help Daddy up.
- Okay.

1832
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:23,608
Wait, wait. Oh, wait.

1833
02:01:23,693 --> 02:01:25,443
I think I'll
just stay here

1834
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:26,861
for a minute.

1835
02:01:26,946 --> 02:01:29,531
Okay. Daddy, you're
out of your mind.

1836
02:01:29,615 --> 02:01:31,116
What are you talking about?

1837
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,784
You shot yourself!

1838
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:35,203
It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

1839
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:37,414
Don't tell these guys
that I did that.

1840
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:53,263
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1841
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:56,141
Is he okay?

1842
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:00,979
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1843
02:02:01,063 --> 02:02:02,772
- Put 'em down farther?
- Yeah.

1844
02:02:02,857 --> 02:02:05,859
He might die of shock on
the way to the hospital.

1845
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:12,157
All right.

1846
02:02:14,535 --> 02:02:16,453
I'll be right back.

1847
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:19,122
Hey.

1848
02:02:19,206 --> 02:02:20,332
Oh, hey.

1849
02:02:20,416 --> 02:02:21,333
How's it feel to be shot?

1850
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:22,667
It actually feels great.

1851
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:24,669
Uh, he gave me some ... 
what is it called? Mor ... 

1852
02:02:24,754 --> 02:02:26,546
- Morphine.
- Morphine.

1853
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:28,798
Wow, you got your merit badge now.

1854
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:30,633
Yeah ...  Hey, I don't
know what that means.

1855
02:02:31,927 --> 02:02:33,845
Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.

1856
02:02:33,929 --> 02:02:36,431
Really? Hm.

1857
02:02:37,558 --> 02:02:39,225
Not that one.

1858
02:02:39,310 --> 02:02:40,518
What?

1859
02:02:40,603 --> 02:02:41,770
Don't even think about it.

1860
02:02:41,854 --> 02:02:43,730
How did you know
what I was thinking?

1861
02:02:43,814 --> 02:02:45,565
Why? Did she say something to you?

1862
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:47,067
I felt like we had a, um ... 

1863
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:48,485
- kind of a vibe.
- Take it easy.

1864
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:49,694
That's just the morphine kicking in.

1865
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,363
Yeah.

1866
02:02:51,447 --> 02:02:52,864
Besides,

1867
02:02:52,948 --> 02:02:54,366
after all we've
been through,

1868
02:02:54,450 --> 02:02:56,868
I'd hate to have to
beat you to death.

1869
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:00,663
That would suck.

1870
02:03:00,748 --> 02:03:02,874
Good to go?

1871
02:03:02,958 --> 02:03:04,125
Yeah, we're all set.

1872
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:05,794
Take care of yourself.

1873
02:03:05,878 --> 02:03:09,089
I'll see you at the hospital.

1874
02:03:10,633 --> 02:03:12,133
Hey.

1875
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:16,137
Thanks for saving
my daughter's life.

1876
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:18,473
Hey ... 

1877
02:03:18,557 --> 02:03:20,558
what was I gonna do?

1878
02:03:22,728 --> 02:03:25,021
That's what makes you that guy.

1879
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:30,276
Yeah.

1880
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:38,660
So, uh, did he say
anything about me?

1881
02:03:40,162 --> 02:03:42,747
Jesus, Lucy!

1882
02:03:42,832 --> 02:03:44,958
What? I-I'm sorry.
I'm just asking.

1883
02:03:46,001 --> 02:03:48,503
I'm in enough pain already.

1884
02:03:48,587 --> 02:03:50,839
Hospital.
