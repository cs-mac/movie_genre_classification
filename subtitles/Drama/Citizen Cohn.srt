15
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,671
YOU WERE DRIVING IT

16
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:23,174
AND YOU HAD TO ARGUE
THE LAW WITH THE OFFICER.

17
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:25,177
HE WAS RUDE.

18
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:26,178
HE WAS RUDE

19
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:29,180
AND HE USED LANGUAGE
THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE USED

TO THE WIFE
OF A JUDGE.

I CAN'T EAT THIS.
SEND IT BACK.

YES.

25
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,442
HE HAS HIS OWN

26
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,228
HE CAN'T EAT THIS.

BRING HIM A BREAST OF VEAL.

29

HOW WAS THE

THAT YOU WERE
THE WIFE OF A JUDGE ?

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,826
SHE TOLD HIM.

32
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,079
YOU TOLD THE COP
THAT I WAS A JUDGE ?

33
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,581
I AM YOUR WIFE.

34
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,084
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE
GIVEN ME A TICKET.

OH, AL, MAKE A CALL.

37
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,006
DORA, LISTEN TO ME.

38
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:16,011
IT IS A VIOLATION OF JUDICIAL
ETHICS FOR ME TO INTERFERE.

39
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,479
IT'S DISHONEST.

I AM FIRM
ABOUT THIS.

LOOK AT THE WAY YOU
TALKED TO THAT WAITER. HMM ?

43
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,273
IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS
INSTEAD OF ENEMIES,

44

YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT YOUR BACK.

45

GET THE POINT ?

46
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:33,111
YOU'RE A MAN
WITH POWER

47
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,197
WHO WON'T EVEN USE IT
TO PROTECT HIS OWN.

48

LOYALTY.

49

MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU ?

50

YOU'RE TELLING THIS BOY

DON'T.

53

HE'S MINE.

THIS IS ONE BOY THEY'RE
NEVER GOING TO FORGET.

156
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:21,092
AAH !

157
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:23,044
FUCK YOU !

158
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:28,600
I DON'T NEED YOU.
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY.

159
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:32,221
ROY COHN CAN
TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

160
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:35,524
I TOOK CARE OF
THE FUCKING ROSENBERGS.

161
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:42,030
ALL RISE.

162
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:44,533
THE JUDGE IS THE
HONORABLE IRVING KAUFMAN.

163
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:49,287
BE SEATED.

164
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:55,210
JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG,
APPROACH THE BENCH.

165
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,222
( judge )
YOU STAND CONVICTED IN THIS COURT

166
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:12,393
OF GIVING TO RUSSIA
AMERICA'S ATOMIC SECRETS.

167
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,896
IT IS NOT IN MY POWER,
JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG,

168
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:16,398
TO FORGIVE YOU.

169
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:20,151
ONLY THE LORD CAN FIND MERCY
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

170
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:22,988
THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT UPON
JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG

171
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:24,439
IS THAT FOR THEIR CRIME,

172
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:32,664
THEY ARE SENTENCED
TO DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION.

173
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:34,500
ORDER IN THIS COURT !

174
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,003
I LOVE YOU. WE MUST BE STRONG
FOR THE CHILDREN, ALL RIGHT ?

175
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,505
ORDER! ORDER IN THIS COURT !

176
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:45,177
BAILIFF, TAKE THAT MAN OUT !

177
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:48,346
SILENCE OR I'LL
HAVE YOU REMOVED.

178
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,348
BAILIFF !

179
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,049
SILENCE !

180
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:58,273
SILENCE !

181
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:04,445
( slow instrumental music )

182
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:26,502
( bang, screaming )

183
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:30,221
OH, GOD.

184
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,223
PETER.

185
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:36,177
GOOD MORNING.

186
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:38,179
DID WE SLEEP WELL
LAST NIGHT ?

187
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,181
AAH.

188
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,683
( chuckling )

189
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:47,689
I BEAT THEM AGAIN.

190
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,190
AAH.

191
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:50,692
AAH.

192
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,944
( Peter )
HAVE WE BEEN BEHAVING OURSELVES TODAY?

193
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:53,745
HUH.

194
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,280
PETER, WHERE WERE YOU ?

195
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,282
PETER, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ?

196
00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:59,167
I BROUGHT YOUR
FAVORITE FROG.

197
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,172
THEY TRIED IT AGAIN
LAST NIGHT, TO KILL ME.

198
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:05,174
THE BASTARDS DIDN'T
MAKE IT, THOUGH.

199
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,675
WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE ?

200
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:09,678
YOU SEE THE SUN !

201
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:13,181
THEY HAVE THIS ONE DOCTOR.
THEY PAID HIM TO KILL ME.

202
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,683
THEY COULDN'T DO IT--

203
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:15,684
I DON'T THINK SO, ROY.

204
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:18,186
THEY GOT HIM TO DO IT.
YOU DON'T THINK SO ?

205
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,688
YOU HATE ME NOW, TOO ?

206
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,189
MY FRIENDS AND
MY ENEMIES HATE ME,

207
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,691
YOU HATE ME,
EVERYBODY.

208
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,693
YOU KNOCKED OFF
YOUR ENEMIES LONG AGO.

209
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:26,194
YOUR FRIENDS LOVE YOU,
YOU KNOW THAT.

210
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,146
ARE YOU TRYING TO
MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY ?

211
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,148
I GAVE UP ON THAT ONE, DEAR.

212
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,119
WHAT IS THIS--

213
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:36,871
NO, NO. IF YOU LOVE ME,
YOU'LL HELP ME FIND MY CLOTHES.

214
00:10:36,872 --> 00:10:40,125
YOU'LL GO A LONG WAY
TO FIND A BETTER FRIEND THAN ME. GET BACK.

215
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,659
WE'LL FLY BACK.
WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

216
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:46,165
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

217
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:49,168
( nurse )
PLEASE, MR. COHN. PLEASE GET BACK INTO BED.

218
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,170
( Peter )
JUST GO BACK TO BED.

219
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,174
OH...PETER.

220
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,676
ROY.

221
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:01,179
AAH...AAH.

222
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,681
PLEASE.

223
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:03,682
PLEASE.

224
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:05,717
PLEASE.

225
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,719
IT'S ONLY GOING TO HURT
MORE THIS WAY.

226
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,605
HELP ME !
HELP, PLEASE !

227
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,107
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

228
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,109
YOU'RE NOT ON MY LIST
OF VISITORS. GET AWAY !

229
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:16,111
I DO THIS AT HOME.
I'M GOOD AT IT.

230
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,612
I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE.

231
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:20,616
YOU'RE THE ANGEL OF DEATH,
BUT YOU'RE NO FUCKING ANGEL !

232
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:22,901
YOU'RE DEATH !
GET AWAY FROM ME !

233
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:23,868
NO...NO !

234
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,120
ROY.

235
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,622
YOU KNOW
WHO I AM.

236
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:31,126
YOU KNOW I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

237
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,127
ROY !

238
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:35,130
YOU CAN'T KEEP ALIENATING
EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO HELP YOU.

239
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:38,634
EVENTUALLY, A PERSON JUST
SAYS TO THEMSELVES:

240
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:42,137
"I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS,
NOT EVEN FROM ROY COHN."

241
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,638
ROY.

242
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,643
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP
ALL ALONE, LOVE.

243
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:48,644
PLEASE--

244
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:49,645
ANGEL OF DEATH.

245
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:53,148
JUST RELAX. RELAX AND TRY
AND STAY STRONG.

246
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:54,399
AAH...STRONG ?

247
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,820
I NEED TO FIGHT SOMEBODY
TO STAY STRONG. GET OUT !

248
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,822
FIGHT THE DISEASE,
NOT YOUR FRIENDS.

249
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:04,325
WHAT DISEASE ?
I DON'T HAVE A DISEASE.

250
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:08,830
OH, PETER...

251
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,334
DON'T LET THEM DO TO ME
WHAT THEY DID LAST NIGHT.

252
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:14,336
OKAY ?

253
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,338
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

254
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,842
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

255
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:26,764
I'LL FIGHT THIS
THING ALONE

256
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:30,602
NO HELP.

257
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:34,105
I DON'T NEED
THEIR HELP.

258
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,608
IF I DIE,
I DIE.

259
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,610
BUT I WON'T.

260
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,063
RIGHT ?

261
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:48,236
RIGHT, LOVE.

262
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:06,254
SLOW DOWN.
STOP EATING ME.

263
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:12,260
( slow instrumental music )

264
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:25,774
SO HELP ME GOD.

265
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:43,090
I REMEMBER.

266
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,092
DEAD.

267
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,593
HOW COULD
I FORGET ?

268
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:47,596
I KILLED YOU, SPY.

269
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,097
WAS I ?

270
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,099
YOU'RE NOT REAL.
WHY AM I TALKING TO YOU ?

271
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:52,600
PETER ? SPY.

272
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,102
WAS I ?

273
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:58,106
OR DID YOU JUST MAKE IT UP ?
HERE'S A SECRET, BOYCHICK.

274
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:01,109
THE ELECTRICITY MAKES
EVERYTHING BRIGHTER.

275
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:03,111
I COULD SEE.

276
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,612
ALL THE JEWS
WERE AFRAID,

277
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,616
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
IF YOU KILLED ME,

278
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:13,622
ALL THE JEWS
WOULD DIE.

279
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,058
( Cohn )
WE DON'T WANT TO BE DISTRUBED, OKAY ?

280
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,528
( man )
YES, SIR.

281
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:37,814
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED TO SEE ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ?

282
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:41,617
I DIDN'T ASK TO SEE YOU.
I WAS SUBPOENAED.

283
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:43,620
WE'LL STOP RIGHT NOW
WITH THE LAWYER TERMS

284
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,121
AND THE WEASEL WORDS.
ALL RIGHT ?

285
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:47,157
YOU'RE UNITED NATIONS'
CHIEF COUNSEL.

286
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,158
IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHO
THE REDS AND PINKOS ARE,

287
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,661
IT'D BE YOU,
OR IT SHOULD BE.

288
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:53,663
I'VE ALREADY BEEN ASKED THIS--

289
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:56,882
WHY ARE YOU HAVING A HARD
TIME ANSWERING THIS ?

290
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:59,385
I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S PERSONAL, RIGHT ?

291
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,388
TALKING ABOUT
YOUR FRIENDS.

292
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,889
NOBODY LIKES TO TALK
ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS.

293
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,391
NATIONAL SECURITY
CAN'T BE ENDANGERED

294
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:07,811
BECAUSE OF FEELINGS
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

295
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:10,313
UNDERSTAND ME ?

296
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:13,149
ASK ME ANYTHING
ABOUT MYSELF.

297
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,021
YOU SEE THAT ?

298
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,023
SEE THAT FLAG ?

299
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,524
THERE'S A WAR
GOING ON RIGHT NOW

300
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,527
BETWEEN AMERICANISM
AND COMMUNISM.

301
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,028
IF YOU'RE A FRIEND OF
AMERICA'S ENEMIES,

302
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:27,030
THEN YOU'RE AN ENEMY, TOO.

303
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,532
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

304
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:33,036
I KNOW YOUR FATHER,
ROY, YOU KNOW THAT ?

305
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:34,537
YOU'RE LIKE  <i>MESHPUCHA</i>  TO ME.

306
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:35,539
NOTHING TO HIDE ?

307
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,541
I SAW YOU WHEN
YOU WERE A KID.

308
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,544
YOU CERTAINLY GOT NOTHING
TO HIDE FROM ME.

309
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:42,462
WHY DID YOU
CHOOSE TO HIDE

310
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,547
BEHIND YOUR
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE ?

311
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,766
IT'S NOT A PRIVILEGE, ROY.
IT'S A RIGHT.

312
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,384
YOU MUST HAVE A SECRET,

313
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,186
OR YOU WOULDN'T
INVOKE YOUR PRIVILEGE.

314
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:53,106
IT'S NOT A PRIVILEGE.
IT'S A RIGHT.

315
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,807
OKAY.

316
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,810
GIVE ME THAT.

317
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,313
NOT UNDER OATH, OKAY ?

318
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:02,815
YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN SUBPOENAED.

319
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:05,318
YOU CAN STOP
HOCKING ME.

320
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,319
HERE WE ARE:

321
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,322
A COUPLE OF JEWS SITTING
IN A ROOM TALKING.

322
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:11,324
OKAY ?

323
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,825
HEY.

324
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:17,831
WANT SOME COFFEE ?
LET'S HAVE SOME COFFEE.

325
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:19,632
THE FBI KNOWS
THESE PEOPLE.

326
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,500
HOW DO YOU THINK
WE GOT YOUR NAME ?

327
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:25,388
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
BETRAYING ANYBODY.

328
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,473
ROY, I....

329
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:32,479
ROY, I DIDN'T BECOME
CHIEF COUNSEL AT THE UN

330
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:37,484
TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIONER
OF MY FELLOW MAN.

331
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:39,819
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MY WORK
AT THE UNITED NATIONS

332
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,772
IS TO HELP CREATE A
WORLD FREE OF STATES

333
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:45,775
THAT HAVE INHUMAN
INTERROGATIONS LIKE THIS.

334
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,326
YOU TAKE CREAM ?

335
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:53,333
I DON'T WANT
YOUR COFFEE.

336
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:07,347
OH, GOD. GOD. GOD.
GOD. GOD. GOD.

337
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,862
WHAT WILL YOU
DO TO THEM ?

338
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:25,865
WELL...

339
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:30,369
NOTHING.

340
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,238
WHAT WILL YOU
DO TO THEM ?

341
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:34,708
NOTHING.

342
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:39,212
YOU COULD, THOUGH.
YOU COULD FIRE THEM.

343
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:45,301
THAT WOULD SHOW
YOUR LOYALTY.

344
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,184
OR

345
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:07,190
YOU CAN JUST
GIVE ME THE NAMES.

346
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,704
( reporter )
<i>SEN. McCARTHY,</i>

347
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:22,706
( McCarthy )
HAND WRINGING ABOUT THESE TRAITORS

348
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,625
<i>INFILTRATING OUR GOVERNMENT.</i>

349
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,126
THEY WANT THE COMMUNISTS--

350
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,129
THEY WANT THE
BRUTALITARIAN COMMUNIST

351
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,131
NETWORKS EXPOSED.

352
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,132
THEY'RE SWINE.

353
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,634
I'M NOT AFRAID TO POINT
THEM OUT AND GET THEM OUT.

354
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:37,136
I'LL GET THEM OUT OF
THE STATE DEPARTMENT,

355
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,638
OUT OF THE COLLEGES
AND UNIVERSITIES.

356
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,640
DON'T GET ME STARTED.

357
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,643
WHEN WILL YOU ACTUALLY
RELEASE THOSE NAMES ?

358
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:46,646
THIS ISN'T A PRESS CONFERENCE.
IT'S FOR CHRISTMAS.

359
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:49,065
YOU'LL GET THE NAMES.
SORRY.

360
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,066
EXCUSE ME.

361
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:50,566
ROY COHN.

362
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,068
WITH THE...

363
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:54,570
UNITED NATIONS, YES.

364
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,573
CAN WE HAVE
A PRIVATE MOMENT ?

365
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:58,575
A LOT OF HANDS TO SHAKE,
BUT LATER.

366
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,576
JUST A MINUTE.

367
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,077
DON'T WORRY.
LATER.

368
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:02,578
HI, I'M ROBERT KENNEDY.

369
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,580
I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE.

370
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,582
WELL, YOU...

371
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:06,583
YOU KNOW ME ?

372
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,585
YOU BETTER
CATCH HIM EARLY.

373
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:09,586
OH, OH.

374
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:12,589
I'LL CATCH HIM RIGHT NOW.
THANKS, I OWE YOU ONE.

375
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,058
HOW ARE YOU ?

376
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:17,060
YOU'RE A LITTLE WET
BEHIND THE EARS.

377
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,561
I GOT THE ROSENBERG
CONVICTIONS

378
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,596
AND THE DEATH PENALTIES.

379
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:24,100
SAYPOL GOT THOSE. YOU
WERE A PAPER PUSHER, KID.

380
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,602
BUT CREDIT WHERE
CREDIT IS DUE:

381
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,322
YOU DID WELL ON THAT THING
FOR PAT McCARRAN.

382
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,323
THANK YOU, SIR.

383
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:33,276
I'M MOVING FROM RANKING
MINORITY TO CHAIRMAN.

384
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:35,077
IT'LL BE MY SUBCOMMITTEE.

385
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:36,579
WANT TO COME ON OVER ?

386
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,696
YOU'VE GOT BOBBY KENNEDY.

387
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:40,666
AS CHIEF COUNSEL PROBABLY,
BUT NOT APPOINTED YET.

388
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:44,837
I CAN'T SIT BEHIND HIM AND
WATCH HIM DESTROY YOUR WORK.

389
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,840
DESTROY MY WORK,
HOW DO YOU MEAN ?

390
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,959
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH NAMES
WORKING FOR PAT McCARRAN.

391
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,961
YOU'LL BE HAULING UP
JEW AFTER JEW,

392
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,462
ALL THOSE
EUROPEAN NAMES.

393
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:55,465
WITH McCARTHY AND
KENNEDY TOGETHER,

394
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,467
IT'LL LOOK LIKE AN
IRISH-CATHOLIC RUN POGROM.

395
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,469
THAT WILL DISCREDIT
EVERYTHING YOU DO.

396
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,970
I KNOW.

397
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,971
BECAUSE I'M A JEW.

398
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:03,472
BUT THEY'RE COMMUNISTS.

399
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,475
THEY BETRAYED THE FAITH
OF THE FATHERS

400
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:07,527
FOR THIS SOCIALIST
GOD OF IRON.

401
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:10,279
THAT'S THE ISSUE,
NOT ANTI-SEMITISM.

402
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,565
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR
OPPOSITION WILL SAY.

403
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,066
IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES

404
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,569
TO CONTROL WHAT
AN ISSUE REALLY IS.

405
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:19,071
IF YOUR ENEMIES CAN FIND
A WAY TO TWIST YOUR MOTIVES,

406
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,074
BELIEVE ME,
THEY'LL DO IT.

407
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:23,576
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
PEOPLE PUSHING YOU,

408
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:26,078
BUT IF IT WERE
ME CHOOSING, SIR,

409
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,081
THAT KENNEDY WOULD
BE MORE AT HOME

410
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:31,084
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.

411
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,885
MAYBE HE COULD BE
MINORITY COUNSEL,

412
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,170
IN MY ESTIMATION.

413
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,671
YOU MAKE UP
YOUR OWN MIND.

414
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:40,593
YOUR FATHER IS
A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT.

415
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:41,594
SENATOR,

416
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:45,598
IF I THOUGHT THAT MY FATHER
WERE DISLOYAL TO THIS COUNTRY,

417
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:47,099
I'D PUT HIS NAME
ON THE LIST.

418
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,352
I'D PUT HIM IN A WITNESS CHAIR
AND TEAR HIM TO PIECES.

419
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:55,858
YOU THINK BOBBY KENNEDY
WILL DO THAT WITH JOE SR. ?

420
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,361
WHY AREN'T
YOU DRINKING ?

421
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:05,000
WHY ? DO I HAVE SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE ?

422
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,952
YOU'VE GOT
A MOUTH.

423
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:08,455
TO THE BIRTH
OF JESUS.

424
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,456
RIGHT.

425
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:13,460
ANOTHER TOUGH JEW.

426
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,845
I THINK I LIKE IT.

427
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:20,717
GOOD EVENING, AMERICA.
LET'S GO TO PRESS.

428
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:22,218
FLASH! WASHINGTON, D.C.

429
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:24,220
WEDDING BELLS BECOME
WARNING BELLS.

430
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,721
THE NEW ALLIANCE BETWEEN

431
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:27,106
SUPER RED HUNTER
JOSEPH McCARTHY

432
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,108
AND WONDER-BOY
COMMIE-CATCHING

433
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,609
U.S. ATTORNEY ROY COHN

434
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,612
WILL WHEEDLE OUT ALL
THOSE AMERICAN-SKIS

435
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:35,114
SECRETLY ON MISSIONS
FROM MOSCOW.

436
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:41,236
MUSIC TO MINE EARS.

437
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:47,243
( Dora )
ROY !

438
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:50,797
HA !

439
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:52,798
A MAID COMES IN
TWICE A DAY.

440
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,800
YEAH.

441
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,418
ROOM SERVICE,
I PICK UP THE PHONE.

442
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:58,888
WORKING WITH McCARTHY,
I OWN THE TOWN.

443
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:00,890
OWN THE TOWN.

444
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,381
THAT'S WONDERFUL STUFF.

445
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:06,384
THESE ARE ALL IN PREPARATION.
LOOK AT THIS.

446
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,386
THIS ONE?

447
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:11,889
FBI INVESTIGATION,
ARMY, G2 SUMMARIES.

448
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,895
VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS, ALL VERY
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS.

449
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:18,897
I WORKED
VERY HARD.

450
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,899
HALF A PAGE !
OH !

451
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,400
YOU LISTEN
TO WINCHELL ?

452
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,234
OF COURSE I DO !

453
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:25,186
DOES HE LOVE ME ?

454
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:31,026
ABE FELLER IS A COMMUNIST
LIKE YOU'RE A COMMUNIST.

455
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:32,527
I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW, SIR.

456
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:34,278
A FRIEND OF MINE
CALLED ME TODAY.

457
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,781
ABE FELLER'S STAFF
HAS BEEN FIRED

458
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:38,866
BECAUSE HE GAVE
THEM THE NAMES.

459
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,369
THEN THEY FIRED
ABE FELLER.

460
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,170
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND, DAD ?

461
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:46,675
ABE FELLER IS A JEW.
ABE FELLER IS A LIBERAL.

462
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,677
ABE FELLER
IS A VISIONARY.

463
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:51,680
FOR THOSE THINGS,
HE DOES NOT DESERVE THIS.

464
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,682
I JUST GOT THE HOTTEST
JOB IN WASHINGTON.

465
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:56,217
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
BE PROUD OF ME ?

466
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:58,220
WHY YOU HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE

467
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,222
IS A PROFOUND
MYSTERY TO ME.

468
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:04,726
WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO GET A NOD FROM YOU ?

469
00:23:04,726 --> 00:23:08,062
YOU THINK COMMUNISM'S A JOKE ?
HITLER WASN'T A JOKE.

470
00:23:08,063 --> 00:23:10,949
WELL, TO ME,
A COMMIE JEW

471
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:14,452
IS AS DISGUSTING TO YOU
AS A NAZI JEW WOULD BE.

472
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:15,453
YOU SHOULD BE SAYING,

473
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:18,823
"GOOD WORK, SON.
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU."

474
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,792
HAVE THOSE WORDS EVER
COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH ?

475
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,295
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING NICE
TO SAY, SAY IT OR GO.

476
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:26,214
THE BOY IS HOME
FOR THE WEEKEND,

477
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:28,216
SO JUST LET IT BE.

478
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:32,253
I AM TRYING TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT.

479
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:34,256
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT ?

480
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:36,174
WHAT'S RIGHT CHANGES
EVERY 10 MINUTES.

481
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:40,678
WHAT IS RIGHT
NEVER CHANGES.

482
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,150
I AM ASHAMED.

483
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,435
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ?
NO, FORGET IT.

484
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:47,902
( Dora )
ROY !

485
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,404
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ?

486
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:50,822
ROY ! ROY !

487
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:51,823
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ?

488
00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:52,824
ROY !

489
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:53,825
DAD.

490
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,827
HE DOES NOT GRASP THINGS
THE WAY WE DO.

491
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:58,830
HE HAS NO GRASP
OF THINGS.

492
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,331
HE, HE, HE, JUST...

493
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,834
THEY'RE CLUBHOUSE BOYS.
THEY STICK TOGETHER.

494
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:08,840
I AM PROUD OF YOU--
ALWAYS.

495
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,343
SO, UM...

496
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:12,844
YOU LIKE THIS GIRL ?

497
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:15,347
YOU MET HER BEFORE.
SHE'S A FRIEND.

498
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:17,849
WITH A HAIRDO
LIKE THIS ?

499
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:19,350
YEAH, I LIKE HER.
YEAH.

500
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:22,354
SHE'S NOT FOR US, IS SHE ?

501
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:25,690
WE CAN DO BETTER.

502
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:33,064
WE CAN DO BETTER.

503
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,450
IT IS NOT THE
LESS FORTUNATE

504
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,952
OR MEMBERS OF THE
MINORITY GROUPS

505
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:39,955
WHO HAVE BEEN SELLING
THIS NATION OUT,

506
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:44,075
BUT RATHER THOSE WHO
HAVE HAD ALL THE BENEFITS

507
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:48,212
THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON
EARTH HAS TO PROVIDE.

508
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:51,216
I HAVE THEIR NAMES.

509
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:54,919
THESE NAMES WILL BE
CALLED TO ACCOUNT:

510
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,421
<i>THE BRIGHTEST AND</i>
<i>THE MOST PRIVILEGED</i> ,

511
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:59,924
<i>WHO SWORE TO PROTECT</i>
<i>THE CONSTITUTION</i>

512
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:02,927
<i>AND DEFEND THE</i>
<i>SAME AMERICA</i>

513
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:06,263
<i>THEY NOW PLOT</i>
<i>TO BRING LOW.</i>

514
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,765
<i>I WANT IT TO</i>
<i>LIGHT THE SPARK</i>

515
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,768
<i>OF A MORAL UPRISING</i>
<i>THAT WILL END</i>

516
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:12,270
<i>ONLY WHEN THE WHOLE</i>
<i>MESS OF TWISTED</i> ,

517
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,823
<i>WARPED THINKERS ARE SWEPT</i>
<i>FROM THE NATIONAL SCENE</i>

518
00:25:16,324 --> 00:25:20,578
<i>AND WE HAVE A REBIRTH OF</i>
<i>NATIONAL HONESTY AND DECENCY.</i>

519
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:26,584
( applauding and cheering )

520
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,599
<i>THE LAST TIME WE MET</i>
<i>WITH ABE FELLER,</i>

521
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,851
<i>HE CONFIDED RATHER</i>
<i>OPENLY ABOUT</i>

522
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,854
THE PRESSURES FROM
SPECIAL INTERESTS

523
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:48,356
WITHIN HIS OWN
ORGANIZATION.

524
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:52,861
APPARENTLY, SADLY,
TRAGICALLY,

525
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:55,530
THEY OVERWHELMED HIM.

526
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,815
TO GIVE ABE FELLER'S
DEATH MEANING,

527
00:25:57,816 --> 00:25:59,818
WE OWE IT TO HIM
AND TO OURSELVES

528
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:03,821
TO CONTINUE TO ROOT
OUT THIS CONSPIRACY,

529
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:08,827
TO BRING IT TO LIGHT,
AND TO BRING IT TO AN END.

530
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:11,329
THAT WAY, THERE WILL
NEVER HAVE TO BE

531
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:13,331
ANY MORE
ABE FELLERS.

532
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:15,750
( McCarthy )
MR. PRESIDENT, I...I...I...

533
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,751
I DON'T CARE

534
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,753
WHAT THE BUREAUCRATS
THINK OF YOUR WORK.

535
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:20,755
IT'S SICKENING TO ME.

536
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:22,056
AMERICANS ARE FED UP.

537
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:23,558
I WAS TOLD I COULD
READ MY STATEMENT.

538
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,644
I'VE NO DOUBT YOU WERE,
MR. KAPLAN.

539
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:30,731
WE CAN DO IT. WE'LL JUST INSERT
A STATEMENT INTO THE RECORD.

540
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:33,234
WINCHELL'S MY MAN,
SO JUST LET ME DO IT.

541
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,769
SENATOR, I INSIST
ON THE PROMISE

542
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,522
THAT I BE ALLOWED
TO READ MY STATEMENT.

543
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:41,075
I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE MY STATEMENT

544
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:43,078
IMPUGNING UN-AMERICAN
MOTIVES...

545
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:45,580
CHECK MY MAIL.

546
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,581
NOW, PLEASE.

547
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:48,583
AT THE CONSENT
OF THE COMMITTEE,

548
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,586
YOUR STATEMENT WILL BE
MADE PART OF THE RECORD.

549
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:55,923
CHIEF COUNSEL WILL
BEGIN THE QUESTIONING.

550
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:58,760
IF YOU'LL GIVE YOUR
STATEMENT TO THE CLERK.

551
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:02,096
( Cohn )
STATE YOUR NAME AND THE NATURE OF YOUR WORK.

552
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,598
STATE YOUR NAME--

553
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:05,099
RAYMOND KAPLAN.

554
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,602
I'M AN ENGINEER WITH
THE  <i>VOICE OF AMERICA.</i>

555
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:10,104
I'VE BEEN IN THEIR
EMPLOY SINCE, SINCE...

556
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:13,024
SINCE, IT'S BEEN AROUND,
ABOUT 10 YEARS.

557
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,026
I THOUGHT THAT TO
BE A GOOD ENGINEER,

558
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:16,360
YOU'D HAVE TO
BE INTELLIGENT.

559
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:17,729
WOULD YOU AGREE ?

560
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,031
THERE ARE ALL KINDS,
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

561
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:21,532
LET ME REPHRASE IT:

562
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,034
A "C" STUDENT ISN'T
GOING TO MAKE IT,

563
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,036
A "B" STUDENT
MIGHT SQUEAK BY.

564
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:25,903
YOU MUST BE SMART.

565
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:27,372
IT HELPS.

566
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:29,407
AN EYE FOR DETAIL,
AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

567
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:31,742
THE RECEIVING, THE TRANSMITTING
OF RADIO WAVES, ETC.

568
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,211
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THAT DOWN PAT.

569
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:34,712
YES, SIR.

570
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:35,713
AND YOU DO,

571
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:38,215
OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT
MAKE A MISTAKE.

572
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:39,550
YES, SIR.

573
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:42,053
SINCE WE HAVE ELIMINATED
INCOMPETENCE,

574
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,055
WOULDN'T IT BE
FAIR TO SAY

575
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:46,557
WHEN YOU ORDERED
TRANSMISSION TOWERS ERECTED

576
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,644
WHERE THEY COULDN'T SIGNAL
COUNTRIES WE'D LIKE TO REACH,

577
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,646
IT MUST'VE BEEN
DONE ON PURPOSE.

578
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:52,146
I'M SORRY.

579
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:53,431
WHY--

580
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:56,066
I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME.
DID I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY ?

581
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,601
DID I...

582
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,103
DID I SAY
SOMETHING...

583
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:00,604
I DON'T THINK
IT'S FUNNY.

584
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:02,106
...TO EMBARRASS MYSELF ?

585
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:02,940
WHY WOULD WE ?

586
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:05,360
WHY? BECAUSE THERE
ARE DISLOYAL PEOPLE

587
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,861
WORKING FOR THE
VOICE OF AMERICA.

588
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,362
WE KNOW AND
YOU KNOW.

589
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:09,364
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

590
00:28:09,364 --> 00:28:11,366
THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU JUST SAID.

591
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,868
YOU ADMITTED THE TOWERS
WERE INTENTIONALLY PLACED--

592
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:16,170
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

593
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:19,791
FOR EXAMPLE, SUNSPOTS:
THEY AFFECT THE TRANSMISSION.

594
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:26,130
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
CLEAR HOW...

595
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,184
SUNSPOTS ?

596
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:33,805
( laughing )

597
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:37,308
DID HE SAY
SUNSPOTS ?

598
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:40,978
PERHAPS DISLOYAL AMERICANS
SELLING OUT OUR COUNTRY.

599
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:42,480
YOU KNOW
WHO WE MEAN.

600
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,482
NO.

601
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,984
NO, SIR, I SIMPLY DISAGREE.

602
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:49,287
MR. KAPLAN, SIR.

603
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,072
IF YOU WANT TO HELP
THE  <i>VOICE OF AMERICA</i> ,

604
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,573
GET BACK TO WORK,

605
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:55,577
AND WE ALL WANT TO HELP
THE  <i>VOICE OF AMERICA</i> ,

606
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:59,547
THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHO MADE THESE STUPID MISTAKES,

607
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,047
AS YOU SAID.

608
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:01,049
I DIDN'T.

609
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:03,551
BUT AS YOU SAY NOW,
THEY DID MAKE MISTAKES.

610
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:06,053
THEY PLACED,
<i>VOA</i>  TOWERS

611
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:08,556
WHERE THE AMERICAN MESSAGE
COULDN'T GET OUT--

612
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,558
WHERE IT WAS INAUDIBLE
IN THE COUNTRIES

613
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,561
THAT WE WANTED
IT TO REACH.

614
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:19,316
YOU KNOW WHO
WE MEAN.

615
00:29:19,817 --> 00:29:22,653
NAMES, RAY ?

616
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,689
IF THEY'RE DISLOYAL,
WE'LL FIND OUT.

617
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:26,691
IF YOU ARE DISLOYAL,
WE CAN UNDERSTAND

618
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:28,776
WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL US.

619
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:29,777
MR. KAPLAN,

620
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:32,079
YOU'RE TRYING THE PATIENCE
OF THIS COMMITTEE

621
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,916
AND WASTING
VALUABLE TIME.

622
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,417
YOU'RE UNDER
SUBPOENA.

623
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,918
( Cohn )
YOU COULD BE HELD IN CONTEMPT.

624
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,420
( McCarthy )
AND JAILED.

625
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,921
( Cohn )
COULD WE HAVE THOSE NAMES, PLEASE ?

626
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,423
( McCarthy )
NAMES TELL THE TRUTH.

627
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:49,513
( Cohn )
MR. KAPLAN, GIVE US THE NAMES, PLEASE !

628
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:52,016
( Kennedy )
YOU PUT ME IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.

629
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:53,017
I'M NOT THE POSTMAN.

630
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:54,885
( Cohn )
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE.

631
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,721
I ASKED YOU
A SIMPLE FAVOR.

632
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,222
I'M IN THE STUDIO
EVERY DAY.

633
00:29:58,222 --> 00:29:59,723
CAN WE TALK
TOMORROW ?

634
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:01,358
CALL ME THERE.
DICTATE TO MY SECRETARY,

635
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,860
I'LL PUT IT
ON THE AIR.

636
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,862
ANY SUNDAY,
ANY ITEM.

637
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:05,863
I ONLY WANT
EXCLUSIVES.

638
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:07,365
THANK YOU.

639
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:08,866
NO GANGBANGS.

640
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,450
NAMES FROM
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS,

641
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,453
I'VE GOT TO SPREAD AROUND.
THANK YOU.

642
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:15,239
I'VE GOT TO SPREAD AROUND,
SOKOLSKY, LYONS, AND SO ON.

643
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,491
YOU'LL GET ALL
THE EXTRAS.

644
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:20,795
GOOD. I'LL MAKE
YOU A STAR.

645
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,797
I USED TO BE
A TAP DANCER.

646
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:23,297
NICE WORK.

647
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:25,299
THANK YOU,
APPRECIATE IT.

648
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,301
WALTER WINCHELL,
THE  <i>VOICE OF AMERICA</i> .

649
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:28,803
YOU BET YOUR ASS.

650
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:32,807
HEY, HEY !

651
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:34,308
HOW WOULD THE
SUPER JEW BOY

652
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:40,651
LIKE TO MEET THE ACE
CATHOLIC MICK IN NEW YORK ?

653
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:43,570
( Winchell )
THERE WAS THIS TEXAN AND THIS JEW ON THE MOON

654
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,372
( Cohn )
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A  <i>GOYISH</i>  JOKE.

655
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,241
A JEWISH JOKE THEY
WOULDN'T BE ON THE MOON.

656
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,242
WHERE WOULD THEY BE ?

657
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:50,743
MIAMI.

658
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:52,245
( Winchell )
MIAMI BEACH, THEY WOULDN'T GO TO MIAMI.

659
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:55,748
( Cohn )
THAT'S A JEWISH JOKE. A JEWISH TRAGEDY IS TAMPA.

660
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:56,750
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
CARDINAL.

661
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,751
WALTER.

662
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:58,251
CARDINAL.

663
00:30:58,251 --> 00:30:59,252
JOE.

664
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,254
THIS IS HIS CHIEF
LEGAL COUNSEL.

665
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:03,256
ROY COHN,
FRANCIS CARDINAL SPELLMAN.

666
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:04,257
YOUR EMINENCE.

667
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,258
MR. COHN.

668
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:07,760
GENTLEMEN,
A GOOD GROUP.

669
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:08,762
ROY.

670
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:11,264
ALWAYS ENJOY MEETING
A FELLOW PRIEST.

671
00:31:11,264 --> 00:31:14,267
IN HEBREW, "COHN"
MEANS "PRIEST."

672
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:20,273
THEN CARDINAL SPELLMAN,
YOU WILL HAVE TO BE MY RABBI.

673
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:28,782
FAIR IS FAIR.

674
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:32,285
EVIL EXISTS. IT'S AROUND
US ALL THE TIME.

675
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:35,789
IT'S SO PERVASIVE
THAT WE DON'T SEE IT,

676
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:39,876
LIKE THE PATTERN
IN THE WALLPAPER.

677
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:42,378
PEOPLE LIVE IN AN EVIL WORLD
LIKE FISH IN THE SEA.

678
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,380
THEY SWIM IN IT.

679
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,764
WALLOW IN IT.

680
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:51,021
FUCK IN IT.

681
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:58,027
THEY DON'T THINK
OR TALK ABOUT EVIL,

682
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:01,147
BECAUSE THEY
DON'T SEE EVIL.

683
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:04,651
WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE
YOU AND MR. COHN

684
00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:07,654
TO MAKE THEM SEE.

685
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:10,156
TO FORCE THEM
TO STOP AND LOOK.

686
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:14,161
TO DISCOVER COMMUNISM
FOR WHAT IT IS:

687
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:19,916
THE MARCH OF THE SOLDIER SLAVES
OF CAIN INCARNATE AGAIN.

688
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:23,002
IT'S NOT EVEN SUNDAY.

689
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:25,805
WHAT AMAZES ME IS THE
NUMBER OF HATE LETTERS I GET

690
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:28,675
WHEN I TRY TO UNMASK THE REDS
IN OUR GOVERNMENT.

691
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:31,594
HATE LETTERS FROM
ALL THE BLEEDING HEARTS.

692
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:32,596
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

693
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,597
THANK YOU.

694
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:36,600
DOES THAT MEAN THAT
THE COMMITTEE CAN EXPECT

695
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,101
THE SUPPORT
OF THE CHURCH, CARDINAL ?

696
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:40,103
I'M NOT A CATHOLIC,
OF COURSE,

697
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:42,105
BUT WE BELIEVE
IN THE SAME GOD.

698
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,574
WE BELIEVE IN
THE SAME VALUES.

699
00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:46,576
I DON'T SPEAK
FOR THE CHURCH.

700
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:51,664
THE POPE SPEAKS
FOR THE CHURCH.

701
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:55,669
BUT ANY ENEMY
OF SATAN

702
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:59,172
IS AN ALLY OF THE
ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK.

703
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:02,508
( Cohn )
WELL SAID. WAITER.

704
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,011
WAITER ? MORE WINE
FOR THE SENATOR.

705
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:06,012
AND A BOURBON ?

706
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:12,184
AND A BOURBON.

707
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,553
"MURDERER'S ROW" ?
WHO SAID THAT ?

708
00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:48,555
WHO CALLED US THAT ?

709
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,557
WHO CARES ? IT HAS
A NICE RING TO IT.

710
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:53,059
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYTHING YET, HAVE THEY ?

711
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:54,560
HOW'VE YOU BEEN ?

712
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,563
EXCUSE ME, HONEY.

713
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,064
CAN I BORROW ROY
FOR A SECOND?

714
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:59,065
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

715
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:01,567
WALTER'S GOT SOMEBODY
HE WANTS US TO MEET.

716
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:03,820
HI, SENATOR.
THANK YOU.

717
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,321
MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

718
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:06,323
YOU GOT TO
INTRODUCE ME.

719
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:08,325
SURE.

720
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:10,243
MR. VICE PRESIDENT,
THIS IS ROY COHN.

721
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,245
GOOD WORK.

722
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:16,249
IT'S AN HONOR, SIR.
I'M A GREAT ADMIRER, SIR.

723
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:17,750
THANK YOU, SIR.

724
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:23,289
SEE, EVERYBODY WANTS TO COME
TO THE PARTY. I LOVE THIS.

725
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,842
EXCUSE US.
EXCUSE US, PLEASE.

726
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:27,343
OH, HELLO.

727
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,345
BOBBY ?

728
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:30,347
BOBBY.

729
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:33,850
A LITTLE PISSED
FOR A GOLDEN BOY.

730
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,603
YOUR SHOW WAS FANTASTIC
LAST NIGHT. IT WAS JUST GREAT.

731
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:39,889
THANKS. I THOUGHT IT
WAS DYNAMITE MYSELF.

732
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,893
I WANT YOU TO MEET
A VERY SPECIAL PAL OF MINE.

733
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:45,896
G. DAVID SCHINE, THIS IS ROY
COHN, AND THAT OF COURSE IS--

734
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:47,948
THIS IS A GREAT PLEASURE
AND HONOR FOR ME.

735
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:49,449
THANK YOU.

736
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,284
DAVID'S HERE FOR THE
NORTHEAST SECTION

737
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:53,286
OF HIS FAMILY'S
HOTEL CHAIN.

738
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:55,738
HE ALSO WROTE A BOOK
ON COMMUNISM.

739
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,490
FOR OR AGAINST ?

740
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,492
I PUT IT IN EVERY ROOM

741
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:01,494
IN THE ENTIRE SCHINE
FAMILY CHAIN OF HOTELS

742
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:04,497
RIGHT NEXT TO THE GIDEON BIBLES.
YOU'RE IN IT.

743
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:09,301
AGAINST.

744
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:11,887
I'M SORRY, IT'S FUNNY
BECAUSE--

745
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:13,890
NO, I'M SORRY.

746
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,893
I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.
I ADMIRE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

747
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:19,395
YOU WANT TO BE
A PART OF IT ?

748
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:22,232
ME ? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I COULD DO.

749
00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:24,234
SEN. McCARTHY,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

750
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,235
CAN I GET YOU
ANOTHER DRINK?

751
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:26,736
BOURBON.

752
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:27,737
ANYBODY ELSE?

753
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:28,738
WE'RE FINE,
JUST FINE.

754
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:29,739
EXCUSE ME.

755
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:30,239
THANKS.

756
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,741
YOU HEARD
WHAT HE SAID ?

757
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:35,244
CAN YOU EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND ?
GO POWDER YOUR NOSE.

758
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:36,746
YOU HEARD
WHAT HE SAID?

759
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,247
HE SAID HE HAD
NO SENSE OF HUMOR.

760
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:40,249
NOBODY SAYS THAT.

761
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,752
NOBODY EVER ADMITS TO THAT
OR BEING A LOUSY LOVER.

762
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,871
I'VE NEVER HEARD IT.
BUT LOOK...

763
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:47,373
HE'S AS DEVOTED
AS A PUPPY DOG,

764
00:35:47,374 --> 00:35:48,875
AND RICH AS
A ROCKEFELLER.

765
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,127
I OWE HIS OLD MAN
SOME FAVORS.

766
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:53,129
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND
A SPOT FOR HIM

767
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:56,799
ON THE COMMITTEE
OR SOMETHING.

768
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,803
I SAY, I'D BE
FLATTERED, BUT

769
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:02,889
YOU GO INTO WORK
EVERY DAY. IS IT EARLY ?

770
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,390
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE NOT.

771
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:06,393
HE'S KIDDING, RIGHT ?

772
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:08,395
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

773
00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:10,897
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT
WORKING ON THE COMMITTEE.

774
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:13,399
JOE, I THINK THIS COULD
BE A POSSIBLE ASSET.

775
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,402
THINK OF IT AS A CHARACTER
BUILDER OR JUST,

776
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:17,320
YOU KNOW,
A HOOT.

777
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,989
TO BE PART OF
SOMETHING GREAT--

778
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,991
YOU KNOW THAT--

779
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:24,494
BOY, THAT WOULD BE--

780
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:30,466
WELL, GREAT.

781
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:41,644
I'M BACK.

782
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:43,647
WHERE DID YOU GO ?

783
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:48,151
AAH.

784
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:52,655
BETTER TIMES.

785
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:54,658
FULL OF HOPE.

786
00:36:54,658 --> 00:37:00,664
OH, GOD.
WE WERE SO YOUNG.

787
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:08,171
WHAT'S THE INDICTMENT,
DOCTOR ?

788
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:12,175
THEORETICAL ?
PRINCIPLE ? PERSONAL ?

789
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:13,676
GIVE IT A NAME.

790
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:15,178
I DON'T NAME NAMES.

791
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,182
WE KNOW THEM ALREADY,
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ?

792
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:24,687
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU ?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

793
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:26,690
I HAD AN UNCLE,

794
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,192
A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST,

795
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,694
KIND OF A DREAMER.

796
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:34,197
HE LOST HIS JOB AND
HE NEVER WORKED AGAIN.

797
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:36,199
THE SHIT HIT THE FAN
AND A LITTLE GOT ON YOU.

798
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,701
AMAZING.
WHAT A SMALL WORLD.

799
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:42,205
A LOT OF DREAMS DIED.

800
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,707
NOW YOU'VE GOT ROY COHN
RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT HIM.

801
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,460
NO WONDER YOU'RE
TRYING TO KILL ME.

802
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,215
THAT KIND OF MALICE IS JUST
BEYOND MY STRENGTH.

803
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:59,338
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ?

804
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,342
YOU WON'T TRY
TO HURT ME.

805
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:08,848
YOU WANT TO
KNOW WHY ?

806
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:11,350
BECAUSE YOU'RE
STILL AFRAID OF ME.

807
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:13,936
TAXPAYERS ARE SPENDING
$100 MILLION A YEAR

808
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:15,939
TO MAINTAIN OUR LIBRARIES
ACROSS THE SEAS,

809
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:18,942
TO GET OUT THE
AMERICAN MESSAGE.

810
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:21,444
IS IT RIGHT THAT THOSE
LIBRARIES SHOULD BE

811
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:24,947
STOCKED WITH BOOKS
BY COMMUNISTS ?

812
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:27,951
WE HAVE A LIST OF THOSE BOOKS
AND THOSE AUTHORS.

813
00:38:27,951 --> 00:38:29,953
THAT IS WHAT
G. DAVID SCHINE

814
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:31,955
AND ROY COHN ARE
CRUSADING AGAINST.

815
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:33,957
ANY PROBLEMS
WITH THAT?

816
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,959
( man )
WHAT'S YOUR JURISDICTION ?

817
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,461
OUR JURISDICTION?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

818
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:40,012
THE WHOLE DAMN GOVERNMENT,

819
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:45,351

833

MR. SCHINE IS AN EXPERT ON
THE COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY.

834
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:35,620
HIS BOOK IS READ ALL ACROSS
THE UNITED STATES.

835

YOU'RE NOT HURTING THIS

00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:22,394
YOU'RE ONLY

WHAT THEY TOLD YOU TO WRITE,

OTHERS YOU MAY HAVE
SEEN AT MEETINGS.

861
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:33,488
YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY

THINKING ABOUT,

BUT IT ISN'T SO,
NOHOW.

865
00:41:38,493 --> 00:41:41,028
CONTRARIWISE, IF IT
WAS SO, IT MIGHT BE.

866
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:43,531
IF IT WERE SO, IT WOULD BE,
BUT AS IT ISN'T, IT AIN'T.

867
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:45,449
THAT'S LOGIC.

868
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,951
VERY FUNNY.

MR. HAMMET ?

877
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,943
LET'S HAUL HIM UP
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

878
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,945
AND MAKE HIM
SWEAR THE OATH.

879
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,948
HE PULLS THAT SHIT ON US THERE,
WE STICK HIS ASS IN JAIL.

880
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:22,119
LET'S DO IT.

881
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,905
THEY DRAFTED DAVID.

882
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,540
THE MEDIA FOUND OUT HE WAS
REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA.

883
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,709
THEY TRANSFERRED
HIM TO NEW YORK.

884
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,797
THE BOARD GOT SCARED,
HE'S IN THE ARMY.

885
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:36,083
I ALWAYS LIKED  <i>THE THIN MAN.</i>
<i>HAMMETT'S A GOOD WRITER.</i>

886
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:39,003
COME ON, JOE. WE JUST
NAILED UP A REAL RED.

887
00:42:39,004 --> 00:42:41,756
HE LIVES WITH LILLIAN HELLMAN.
SHE'S PROBABLY A DYKE.

888
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:43,758
SHE WRITES PLAYS
ABOUT THEM.

889
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:46,227
DOES THAT MEAN
AYN RAND IS A DYKE, TOO?

890
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:47,228
PROBABLY.

891
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:48,262
NO.

892
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:54,569
HOOVER'S BEEN WATCHING HELLMAN,
AND SHE DOES IT WITH GUYS.

893
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:55,987
JOE,

894
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:59,023
JUST BECAUSE LILLIAN HELLMAN
LIVES WITH A MAN

895
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:03,028
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN
SHE'S NOT A HOMOSEXUAL.

896
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:06,164
EVERYBODY STARTS
OUT STRAIGHT.

897
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:09,667
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY
BEING BORN HOMOSEXUAL.

898
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:12,170
TIME GOES BY AND...

899
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,672
SOMETIMES, I GUESS...

900
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:21,513
IT HAPPENS TO THEM WITHOUT
THEM EVEN KNOWING IT.

901
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:27,218
HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY
KNOW ABOUT SCHINE?

902
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:30,221
WHAT ABOUT DAVID?

903
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:33,774
JOE...JOE.

904
00:43:33,775 --> 00:43:36,694
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING TO GET YOU.

905
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:39,197
IT WAS HIS WORK FOR US
THAT MADE THE PRESS

906
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:41,699
INVESTIGATE HIS
DRAFT STATUS.

907
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,202
THEY'LL DO ANYTHING
TO UNDERMINE YOU

908
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:46,204
AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN US.

909
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:48,656
YOU'VE LOST CONFIDENCE
IN ME? I'LL RESIGN, SIR.

910
00:43:48,656 --> 00:43:50,157
DON'T GIVE ME
THAT "SIR" SHIT.

911
00:43:50,158 --> 00:43:52,660
JOE, I KNOW YOU LIKE
HAMMETT'S BOOKS.

912
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,879
HE'S A GOOD WRITER,
PROBABLY A GOOD GUY.

913
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,884
MICHELANGELO WAS
A GREAT ARTIST:

914
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:02,469
A PAINTER, INVENTOR, SCULPTOR.

915
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:07,475
AND YET, HE WAS A PERVERT.

916
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:09,477
AND

917
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:13,264
HE WAS DISLOYAL
TO HIS PRINCE.

918
00:44:13,765 --> 00:44:18,936
GO AFTER THAT SUPERCILIOUS
HAMMETT SON OF A BITCH.

919
00:44:18,937 --> 00:44:20,521
I WANT TO HELP DAVID, TOO.

920
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:23,024
OH, YES. GOD FORBID,
G. DAVID SCHINE

921
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:26,077
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO
SLEEP ON THE GROUND.

922
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:29,363
GOD FORBID.

923
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:31,866
( telephone buzzing )

924
00:44:31,866 --> 00:44:33,868
YES ?

925
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:35,369
PUT HIM ON.

926
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,756
MR. COHN ? THIS IS BOB STEVENS.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU ?

927
00:44:38,757 --> 00:44:40,208
THIS IS ROY COHN,

00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:46,714
WILL BE ENTERING
THE ARMY SHORTLY.

932
00:44:46,714 --> 00:44:49,717
THE SENATOR'S REQUESTING
A COMMISSION FOR MR. SCHINE

933
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:51,719
THAT HE BE ATTACHED
TO OUR SENATE COMMITTEE

<i>You can do this.</i>

940
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:03,615
TELL THE SENATOR TO PUT IT
THROUGH REGULAR CHANNELS.

941
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:07,201
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
THEY CAN DEAL WITH IT.

942
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:09,704
WHY DON'T WE JUST MEET
AND YOU GET TO KNOW HIM?

943
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:11,706
COHN, THEY'RE READY FOR US.

944
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:14,709
<i>Put it through the legislative</i>
<i>liaison officer, that's major</i>-

945
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:19,914
BOB, JUST DO IT.

946
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:21,415
ANNIE LEE MOSS.

947
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,917
( Cohn )
ANNIE LEE MOSS.

948
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:24,418
YES, SIR. I JUST SAID IT.

949
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:27,922
YOU KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN AN OATH
TO BE TRUTHFUL IN YOUR ANSWERS.

950
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:28,923
YES ?

951
00:45:28,923 --> 00:45:29,924
YES, SIR.

952
00:45:29,924 --> 00:45:32,426
DO YOU WORK FOR
THE U.S. ARMY SIGNAL CORPS

953
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:37,932
WITH ACCESS TO THE CONFIDENTIAL
AND SECURITY FILES?

954
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:39,934
NO, SIR.

955
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:42,436
NO, SIR. I DON'T.

956
00:45:42,437 --> 00:45:45,940
YOU DON'T WORK IN THE PENTAGON?
YOU'RE SWORN TO TELL THE TRUTH.

957
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,943
I DON'T WORK ANYWHERE.
I'M ON SUSPENSION.

958
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:51,445
( laughing )

959
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:52,947
( McCarthy )
THIS ISN'T FOR LAUGHS.

960
00:45:52,947 --> 00:45:54,949
AND DON'T THINK
A PLEA OF SYMPATHY

961
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:56,450
IS GOING TO DISTRACT US.

962
00:45:56,451 --> 00:45:58,953
PLEASE, ANSWER THIS:

963
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:00,955
ARE YOU NOW OR
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

964
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:04,959
A MEMBER OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY ?

965
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:06,460
NO, SIR, I'M A DEMOCRAT.

966
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:08,880
( laughing )

967
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,550
WE HAVE TESTIMONY
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

968
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,051
THAT YOUR NAME APPEARS

969
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:15,937
ON A LIST OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY.

970
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:21,943
MY JOB WAS IN THE CAFETERIA,
CLEANING UP.

971
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:24,278
I WANT THOSE FILES
FOR THOSE TWO MEN.

972
00:46:24,279 --> 00:46:26,864
DAVID, YOU SCREWED THIS UP.
GO HELP HIM.

973
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:30,785
EVERYTHING IS IN CODE
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY CODE.

974
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:34,260
WHAT? YOU DON'T
KNOW CODE?

975
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,429
NO, SIR. CAN I GET
MY JOB BACK?

976
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,433
( laughing )

977
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:42,935
CHIEF COUNSEL WILL CONTINUE
THE QUESTIONING.

978
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:44,937
THIS AMUSES YOU,
DOESN'T IT?

979
00:46:44,937 --> 00:46:47,439
YOU WON'T GET
YOUR JOB BACK

980
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,442
AND YOU'LL BE IN
PRISON FOR PERJURY.

981
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:50,943
MR. CHAIRMAN,
IF I MAY--

982
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:51,944
THIS CAN WAIT--

983
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:56,949
I UNDERSTAND THAT
MRS. ANNIE LEE MOSS

984
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:00,419
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NAME
BUT NOT BY SIGHT, CORRECT ?

985
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:01,920
WE'VE WITNESSES--

986
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:05,624
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF COUNSEL
SHOULD HAVE THIS INFORMATION.

987
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,927
THERE SEEM TO BE
3 ANNIE LEE MOSSES

988
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:10,930
IN THE DISTRICT
PHONE DIRECTORY.

989
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,933
THIS WOMAN, WHO MAY HAVE
BEEN DONE AN INJUSTICE HERE,

990
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:16,969
COMES OFF
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ME.

991
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,971
I SUGGEST THAT WE'D
BE DOING OUR DUTY

992
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:21,473
RESPONSIBLY TO
EXCUSE THIS WITNESS

993
00:47:21,474 --> 00:47:23,976
AND LOOK TO OUR OWN PROCEDURES
FOR INVESTIGATION.

994
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:26,611
IF IT TAKES A VOTE,
I'D LIKE TO VOTE.

995
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:28,614
UH, MRS. MOSS...

996
00:47:29,115 --> 00:47:34,787
YOU ARE EXCUSED FOR NOW.

997
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:36,789
( Cohn )
WONDERING HOW WE'RE DOING ON

998
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,574
<i>THAT COMMISSION FOR</i>
<i>OUR ASSISTANT COUNSEL.</i>

999
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:40,576
( Stevens )
WE'VE RUN INTO A PROBLEM ON THAT.

1000
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:44,079
<i>I HOPED THAT MR. SCHINE HAD</i>
<i>HAD SOME ROTC THAT WOULD'VE--</i>

1001
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,581
( Cohn )
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS.

1002
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:47,583
( Stevens )
<i>HE DIDN'T, IT APPEARS,</i>

1003
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:51,136
<i>SHORT OF GOING TO</i>
<i>OFFICERS' CANDIDATE SCHOOL...</i>

1004
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:53,506
DAVID SCHINE AND
McCARTHY AGREE

1005
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:56,225
THAT OFFICERS' CANDIDATE
SCHOOL IS JUST THE THING.

1006
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:59,728
EXCELLENT. PVT.
SCHINE CAN APPLY

1007
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:02,481
AS SOON AS HE'S OUT
OF BASIC TRAINING.

1008
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:04,983
HOW LONG IS ALL
THIS GOING TO TAKE:

1009
00:48:04,984 --> 00:48:06,986
APPLICATION, SCHOOL
AND TRAINING ?

1010
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:09,988
<i>A year.</i>

1011
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:11,991
MAYBE I WASN'T CLEAR.

1012
00:48:11,991 --> 00:48:15,995
I SAID SEN. McCARTHY,
McCARTHY, McCARTHY, McCARTHY !

1013
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:18,497
DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THIS
BUREAUCRATIC BULLSHIT

1014
00:48:18,497 --> 00:48:19,998
ABOUT PROCEDURE, OKAY ?

1015
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:23,502
JUST REMEMBER THAT NAME,
AND THIS ONE:

1016
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:25,003
ROY COHN.

1017
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,505
ROY COHN !

1018
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:29,341
YOU DON'T WANT TO
MAKE ROY COHN ANGRY.

1019
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:31,344
( Cohn )
STATE YOUR NAME.

1020
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:35,848
ANNIE LEE MOSS.

1021
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:41,353
( McCarthy )
ARE YOU SURE ?

1022
00:48:41,354 --> 00:48:44,140
THE REAL ANNIE LEE MOSS.

1023
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,141
YES, SIR.

1024
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:47,643
YOU DO, IN FACT, WORK
AT THE PENTAGON ?

1025
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:49,561
YES, SIR.

1026
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:51,063
ARE YOU A COMMUNIST ?

1027
00:48:51,063 --> 00:48:53,565
HAVE YOU EVER ATTENDED,
UH, PARTY MEETINGS

1028
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:56,952
OF A COMMUNIST
PARTY CELL ?

1029
00:48:56,953 --> 00:49:02,458
WHERE AND WHEN
WOULD THAT BE, SIR ?

1030
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,460
DON'T BE EVASIVE
WITH ME, MRS. MOSS,

1031
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,462
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'LL DO.

1032
00:49:06,462 --> 00:49:07,963
WE'VE SUBPOENAED
YOUR GROUP,

1033
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:09,465
INCLUDING ITS
COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP,

1034
00:49:09,966 --> 00:49:12,969
AND WE'LL PARADE THEM FOR
ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE,

1035
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:16,472
INCLUDING TWO LEADERS OF
YOUR CELL WHO'LL COME HERE

1036
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:18,974
AND SWEAR THAT YOU'RE LYING
TO THIS COMMITTEE.

1037
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:22,478
THE COMMITTEE IS TAKING
A BRIEF RECESS. COME ON.

1038
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:24,480
( man )
ROY, ROY, ROY !

1039
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,767
( man )
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE'RE TAKING A RECESS ?

1040
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:34,407
IS THIS NECESSARY ?

1041
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:36,992
WE GOT WORD THE WITNESSES
WON'T BE APPEARING.

1042
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:38,861
THEY DIDN'T GET
THEIR SUBPOENAS ?

1043
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:40,329
WHO SCREWED THAT UP ?
KENNEDY ?

1044
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:41,997
CAN YOU EXCUSE US ?

1045
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:44,083
IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP,
WE'LL LOOK LIKE ASSHOLES.

1046
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,585
THE FBI CALLED AND SAID
THEY CAN'T FIND THEM.

1047
00:49:46,585 --> 00:49:48,286
THE FBI CAN'T
FIND THEM ?

1048
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,538
YES.

1049
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:51,373
WHO CALLED
FROM THE FBI ?

1050
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:53,876
J. EDGAR HOOVER
HIMSELF.

1051
00:49:53,876 --> 00:49:54,376
HOOVER ?

1052
00:49:54,377 --> 00:49:55,678
YES.

1053
00:49:55,678 --> 00:49:58,263
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS ! WE
SHOULD GO AFTER THE FBI NEXT.

1054
00:49:58,264 --> 00:49:58,764
ROY.

1055
00:49:58,764 --> 00:49:59,765
JOHN.

1056
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:02,635
EXCUSE MRS. MOSS
FROM ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY.

1057
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:04,136
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

1058
00:50:04,136 --> 00:50:06,638
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO LET UP,
BUT TO ATTACK.

1059
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,140
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO TO ME ?

1060
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:14,647
I'M TRYING TO MAKE
A GREAT MAN OUT OF YOU.

1061
00:50:17,616 --> 00:50:23,622
TAXI !

1062
00:50:28,627 --> 00:50:32,664
( Hoover )
ROY COHN ?

1063
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:34,166
MR. HOOVER.

1064
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,668
THEY'RE FBI AGENTS, ROY.

1065
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:37,970
I'M SORRY ?

1066
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,972
THOSE COMMUNISTS
YOU SUBPOENAED.

1067
00:50:39,972 --> 00:50:42,975
THEY'RE UNDERCOVER OPERATIVES
OF THE BUREAU.

1068
00:50:42,975 --> 00:50:44,476
WE WANT TO KEEP
THEM UNDERCOVER.

1069
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:46,478
I DON'T WANT
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM.

1070
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:47,680
YOU CAN'T
CALL THEM.

1071
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,065
WE GOT TO THEM THROUGH
ANOTHER FBI AGENT.

1072
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:53,569
LET NOT THE LEFT HAND KNOW
WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING.

1073
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:58,440
THE AGENT YOU MENTIONED HAS NO
KNOWLEDGE THE OTHERS ARE OURS.

1074
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:01,444
I'M CONFIDING IN YOU.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

1075
00:51:01,444 --> 00:51:03,779
BUT THE OTHERS WERE
THE LEADERS OF THE CELL.

1076
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:06,281
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT
THEY HAD THE MONEY

1077
00:51:06,282 --> 00:51:08,284
TO PAY ALL THEIR
PARTY DUES,

1078
00:51:08,284 --> 00:51:12,921
HAD THE TIME TO ATTEND
ALL THE PARTY MEETINGS.

1079
00:51:12,922 --> 00:51:16,091
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AMERICA
OWES YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE

1080
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:18,594
FOR PROTECTING THE
IDENTITY OF MY MEN.

1081
00:51:18,928 --> 00:51:20,846
THERE'LL BE EMBARRASSING
MOMENTS FOR YOU,

1082
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:22,848
IN YOUR HEARINGS,
WITH THE PRESS.

1083
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:25,851
BUT I WILL ALWAYS
BE INDEBTED TO YOU.

1084
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,853
REMEMBER THAT.

1085
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:30,355
AND REMEMBER,

1086
00:51:30,356 --> 00:51:36,395
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

1087
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:45,037
( military music )

1088
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:05,924
AAH, HE IS THE FIGURE
OF A SOLDIER, ISN'T HE ?

1089
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:07,676
-THAT'S WHAT HE IS.
-WOO HOO !

1090
00:52:07,676 --> 00:52:10,178
HE'LL SERVE HIS COUNTRY
IN THE U.S. ARMY

1091
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:11,680
AND HE'S GOING OVERSEAS.

1092
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,683
OVERSEAS ? WAIT A MINUTE.
WE HAD A DEAL. YOU AGREED.

1093
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:18,687
I AGREED TO NOTHING.

1094
00:52:18,687 --> 00:52:22,190
YOU'VE DONE IT. YOU'VE MADE
ROY COHN SORE. SEE ?

1095
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:23,692
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

1096
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:27,195
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

1097
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:28,664
AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED,

1098
00:52:28,664 --> 00:52:32,284
SEND THE KID HALFWAY AROUND
THE WORLD. I'LL BE HAPPY.

1099
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:35,754
HEY, HEY !

1100
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:36,755
LOOK AT YOU.

1101
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:37,255
HOW ARE YOU ?

1102
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:38,257
ALL RIGHT.

1103
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:39,258
FIX YOUR TIE.

1104
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:43,962
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
MEETING. COME WITH ME.

1105
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:45,547
HMM ? AND THAT
CUTE LITTLE HAT.

1106
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:46,966
STOP IT.

1107
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:49,018
SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY, BOB STEVENS,

1108
00:52:49,018 --> 00:52:52,021
IT'S TIME YOU MET
PVT. G. DAVID SCHINE.

1109
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:53,022
HOW DO YOU DO ?

1110
00:52:53,022 --> 00:52:55,024
YOU WITH
THE CAMERA, HERE.

1111
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:58,027
GET A NICE SHOT OF THE
2 OF THEM TOGETHER.

1112
00:52:58,027 --> 00:53:02,031
BOB, RIGHT HERE.
DAVE, SMILE.

1113
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:03,982
( Cohn )
You're holding Dave Schine hostage

1114
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:05,985
<i>to keep us from</i>
<i>investigating the Army</i>

1115
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:08,654
<i>and it won't work</i>
<i>because I'll wreck you.</i>

1116
00:53:09,155 --> 00:53:12,158
<i>The Senator has got names of</i>
<i>a homosexual ring of generals.</i>

1117
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:13,659
<i>We're going public.</i>

1118
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:15,661
<i>You've got a nest of Communists</i>
<i>in Fort Monmouth ?</i>

1119
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:19,665
<i>Why haven't you</i>
<i>gone after them ?</i>

1120
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,168
TAPE AFTER TAPE.

1121
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:23,669
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

1122
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:28,173
34 PAGES OF CALLS AND MEETINGS
PRESSURING THE ARMY.

1123
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:30,676
YOU WERE TRYING TO SET UP
A SOFT TOUCH FOR DAVID SCHINE

1124
00:53:30,676 --> 00:53:34,179
AND IT STINKS LIKE HELL.

1125
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,682
( McCarthy )
SCHINE WAS A VALUABLE MAN.

1126
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:40,569
NOW, ASK YOURSELF WHY THE ARMY
DOESN'T WANT HIM HELPING US.

1127
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:42,571
WHAT ARE THEY HIDING ?

1128
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:44,189
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO HIDE ?

1129
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,691
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1130
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:49,194
CAN WE BE MODERATELY
CIVIL THIS AFTERNOON ?

1131
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:50,696
LIFE IS SHORT,
GENTLEMEN.

1132
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:53,449
WE'RE ALL RESPONSIBLE
TO THE COMMITTEE

1133
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:54,450
AND TO THE LEADERSHIP.

1134
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,454
NO MALODOROUS INFERENCES
ARE TO BE DRAWN.

1135
00:53:58,454 --> 00:54:00,289
WHAT'S YOUR POINT ?

1136
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:04,793
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE AMBUSHED
ON THE WAY TO YOUR OWN AMBUSH.

1137
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:07,295
BUT IF THESE TAPES
GO OUT THERE,

1138
00:54:07,296 --> 00:54:09,798
THE PRESS, AND I DARE
SAY THE PUBLIC,

1139
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:12,801
WILL SURELY MOBILIZE
AGAINST ALL OF US.

1140
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:14,803
THE ARMY ?

1141
00:54:14,803 --> 00:54:17,605
THESE ARE OUR BOYS
FIGHTING IN KOREA.

1142
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:20,108
THEY'RE HEROES.

1143
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:22,111
WHERE DID THESE
TAPES COME FROM ?

1144
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:25,614
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE JUDGE
WHO AUTHORIZED THESE WIRETAPS ?

1145
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:28,533
HAS ANYBODY BOTHERED
TO CHECK INTO HIS BACKGROUND ?

1146
00:54:28,534 --> 00:54:31,537
BOB STEVENS ALWAYS
MONITORS HIS PHONE CALLS.

1147
00:54:31,537 --> 00:54:34,623
COME ON, ROY,
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

1148
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:37,626
THIS IS A TREMULOUS TIME.

1149
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:42,130
I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD
SPEAK PRIVATELY

1150
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:43,515
WITHOUT STAFF.

1151
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:46,937
BUT I FIRST WANT
TO EXPRESS

1152
00:54:46,937 --> 00:54:48,939
MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU,
MR. COHN.

1153
00:54:48,939 --> 00:54:52,976
YOU HAVE THE TALENT
OF RELENTLESS PURSUIT

1154
00:54:52,976 --> 00:54:56,195
AND INCISIVENESS

1155
00:54:56,196 --> 00:55:00,200
AND A SENSE OF MISSION THAT
BOTH INSPIRES AND CHALLENGES.

1156
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,701
ROY,

1157
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:04,704
I KNOW YOU HONOR
THE TRUTH

1158
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:13,130
AND WHILE YOU DO,
I'LL SUPPORT YOU.

1159
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,967
NOW I KNOW HOW A PANCAKE FEELS
HAVING SYRUP POURED OVER IT.

1160
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:19,970
HA, HA.

1161
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:22,973
STAFF...

1162
00:55:22,973 --> 00:55:28,094
WILL LEAVE.

1163
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:32,099
WITH THIS REMINDER
TO EVERYONE HERE:

1164
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:34,100
LOYALTY.

1165
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:40,607
THE ISSUE IS LOYALTY.

1166
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:45,529
LAY IT OUT.

1167
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:48,532
THE ARMY FEELS IT
HAS BEEN WRONGED.

1168
00:55:48,532 --> 00:55:50,834
THEY FEEL THAT MR. COHN
IS HARASSING THEM

1169
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:53,837
BECAUSE OF A SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP TO SCHINE.

1170
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:57,340
THEY WANT A
SOFT CONCLUSION

1171
00:55:57,341 --> 00:56:00,844
TO THE INVESTIGATION
AND THE PRESSURE

1172
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:04,848
OR THE CHRONOLOGY IS
PUT OUT TO THE PUBLIC.

1173
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:07,851
WHAT'S SCHINE DONE ?
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING.

1174
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:09,686
GET RID OF COHN.
HE GOES OUT.

1175
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:12,188
HOW CAN I ?
AND WHY SHOULD I ?

1176
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:14,190
HE'S GOT A GRASP OF THE...

1177
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:17,194
HE'S DEVELOPED
SO MANY CASES, IT...

1178
00:56:17,194 --> 00:56:19,696
THERE'S NO ONE
WHO COULD STEP IN.

1179
00:56:20,197 --> 00:56:23,283
IT WOULD BE A SURRENDER.
A SURRENDER !

1180
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:25,702
I DON'T SURRENDER.

1181
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:27,203
AND HIM. HO, HO.

1182
00:56:27,204 --> 00:56:30,707
HE'D HOLLER. HE'D SCREAM FROM
THE ROOFTOPS, "ANTI-SEMITISM."

1183
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:32,208
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

1184
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:33,659
ALL RIGHT.

1185
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,162
WE'LL LANCE THIS BOIL
ON THE BODY POLITIC

1186
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:38,165
WITH THE CAMERAS ON.

1187
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:40,217
LET IT ALL COME OUT.

1188
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:41,718
( musical beeping )

1189
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:44,721
GOOD EVENING, AMERICA
AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA.

1190
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:46,222
LET'S GO TO PRESS.

1191

and his Commie-cornering
<i>comet, Roy Cohn,</i>

1197
00:56:58,235 --> 00:56:59,569
<i>will be taking on</i>

1200
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:06,242
The bet in this corner ?

1201
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:08,745
<i>McCarthy and Cohn</i>
<i>by a knockout.</i>

1202

<i>America wins.</i>

1203
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:18,455
( gavel banging )

1204
00:57:18,455 --> 00:57:23,009
( Mundt )
IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL THIS HEARING TO ORDER.

1205
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,512
IT IS A DUTY I DO
NOT WELCOME

1206
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:29,516
AND UNDERTAKE WITH
GREAT DISTASTE.

1207
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:32,018
WE ARE HERE TO
HEAR EVIDENCE

1208
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:35,522
RELATED TO A CHARGE BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY

1209

OF HARASSMENT BY SEN. JOSEPH
McCARTHY AND HIS STAFF

1210
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:43,479
AND THAT THEY IMPROPERLY
ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE

1211
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,982
THE ARMY OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA

1212
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:50,070
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ONE
PVT. G. DAVID SCHINE,

1213
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:54,074
A FORMER STAFF MEMBER

DO YOU SOLEMNLY
SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH,

00:58:23,186 --> 00:58:26,072
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,
SO HELP YOU GOD ?

1224
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:26,907
I DO.

1225
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:33,029
BE SEATED.

1226
00:58:34,998 --> 00:58:36,082
AS YOU CAN SEE,

1227
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:38,001
THIS PHOTO ILLUSTRATES
THE GOODWILL

1228
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:41,287
BETWEEN PVT. SCHINE AND
SECRETARY OF THE ARMY STEVENS.

1229
00:58:41,288 --> 00:58:42,922
THERE WAS NO
ANTAGONISM.

1230
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:45,425
AS IN ANY RELATIONSHIP,
THERE'D BE

1231
00:58:45,425 --> 00:58:48,428
OCCASIONAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS
AND TEMPERS WOULD FLARE.

1232
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:50,430
BUT HOWEVER ONE
CHOOSES TO READ

1233
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:53,049
CERTAIN STATEMENTS
OUT OF CONTEXT,

1234
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:56,053
IT WAS ALWAYS A CORDIAL,
COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP

1235
00:58:56,053 --> 00:59:00,307
BETWEEN SECRETARY STEVENS
AND OUR OFFICES.

1236

AS COUNSEL

00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:18,325
SO PLEASE CORRECT
ME IF I'M WRONG.

1242

1244
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:27,884
TO GIVE THE FACTS.

1245
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:32,088
DO WE NOT HAVE BEFORE
THIS COMMITTEE

1246
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:35,392
A LIST OF YOUR ATTEMPTS
TO GAIN SPECIAL TREATMENT

1247
00:59:35,392 --> 00:59:38,344
AND PRIVILEGES
FOR MR. SCHINE--

1248
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:41,931
THE LENGTH OF WHICH IS
JUST AMAZING TO BEHOLD ?

1249
00:59:41,932 --> 00:59:44,567
ARE YOU ASKING
HOW I PLEAD ?

1250
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:50,357
( laughing )

1251
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:54,828
I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY.
THIS IS A HEARING, NOT A TRIAL.

1252
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:56,779
POINT OF ORDER,
MR. CHAIRMAN.

1253
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,282
WHAT IS YOUR
POINT OF ORDER ?

1254
00:59:59,282 --> 01:00:00,783
MY POINT OF ORDER IS THIS:

1255
01:00:00,784 --> 01:00:02,285
WE DON'T HAVE
TO BE ADVISED

1256
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:07,456
ON POINTS OF LAW BY
THE COUNSEL FOR THE ARMY.

1257
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:11,544
WHY, I THINK YOU DO.
I THINK YOU DO.

1258
01:00:11,545 --> 01:00:14,548
I PLEAD "NOT GUILTY" ANYWAY.
JUST FOR YOUR RECORDS.

1259
01:00:14,548 --> 01:00:22,022
( laughing )

1260
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:24,391
MR. COHN,

1261
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:28,395
PERHAPS YOU COULD EXPLAIN
TO THE COMMITTEE, PLEASE, SIR,

1262
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:32,198
WHY YOU SUBMITTED A DOCTORED
PHOTOGRAPH TO THE COMMITTEE.

1263
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:35,202
I DO NOT THINK
THAT PICTURE IS...

1264
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:37,787
I DON'T THINK THIS PICTURE
HAS BEEN CHANGED.

1265
01:00:38,288 --> 01:00:39,789
COME NOW, SIR.

1266
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,909
WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR
DEFINITION OF CHANGE ?

1267
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:44,410
CAN I SEE THAT
UP HERE, PLEASE ?

1268
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,914
NO, SIR,
YOU CANNOT.

1269
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:53,252
MAYBE I'M A LITTLE NEARSIGHTED,
I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE.

1270
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:56,256
YES, I DO BELIEVE
YOU HAVE BETRAYED

1271
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:58,474
A CERTAIN NEARSIGHTEDNESS.

1272
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:04,897
HAVE IT THE WAY YOU WANT.
COME DOWN HERE.

1273
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:12,938
I THINK YOU'LL SEE,
AS DO WE ALL, THAT

1274
01:01:13,356 --> 01:01:14,240
IN THIS ORIGINAL PICTURE,

1275
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:17,110
THERE IS A NEW CHARACTER
IN THE SCENE:

1276
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:20,947
A COL. BRADLEY, AN AIDE TO
SECRETARY STEVENS. CORRECT ?

1277
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:22,949
IF YOU TAKE THESE
2 PICTURES,

1278
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:24,450
YOU WILL SEE
THAT THIS PART

1279
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:28,455
WITH STEVENS AND DAV--
PVT. SCHINE IS THE SAME.

1280
01:01:28,455 --> 01:01:29,456
ANYONE WITH
COMMON SENSE

1281
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:32,675
CAN LOOK AT IT
AND SEE WHAT'S IN IT.

1282
01:01:32,676 --> 01:01:35,962
ARE YOU SAYING THESE
PICTURES ARE IDENTICAL ?

1283
01:01:35,962 --> 01:01:36,963
THE RELATIONSHIP:

1284
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:39,466
SECRETARY STEVENS IS
SMILING AT MR. SCHINE--

1285
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:40,850
AT PVT. SCHINE.

1286
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:41,801
IS HE ?

1287
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:44,937
IS HE INDEED ?
I THINK NOT, SIR.

1288
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:48,441
I DO BELIEVE THERE IS
JUST A TRACE OF A SMILE--

1289
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:53,062
A GRIM SMILE DIRECTED
AT COL. BRADLEY.

1290
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:54,064
DON'T YOU THINK ?

1291
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:56,566
YOU CAN CHARACTERIZE HIS
SMILE ANY WAY YOU WISH.

1292
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:58,568
I SEE HIM SMILING
AT PVT. SCHINE.

1293
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:01,070
IN THIS PICTURE, WHERE
YOU'VE CUT OUT BRADLEY.

1294
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:04,074
BUT IN THE REAL PICTURE
HE'S LOOKING TO HIS RIGHT,

1295
01:02:04,574 --> 01:02:05,575
AT COL. BRADLEY.

1296
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:09,579
DO YOU SEE JUST A TOUCH
OF A SMILE HERE ON BRADLEY

1297
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:13,416
IN RETURN, LOOKING BACK
AT SECRETARY STEVENS? CORRECT ?

1298
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:15,918
I'D SAY THAT I'D KNOW
COL. BRADLEY HAD

1299
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:16,920
A GOOD STEAK DINNER
THAT NIGHT

1300
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:21,424
AND PERHAPS HE WAS
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

1301
01:02:21,424 --> 01:02:23,926
IF BRADLEY WAS
THINKING OF A STEAK,

1302
01:02:24,427 --> 01:02:25,928
SCHINE MUST'VE
BEEN CONSIDERING

1303
01:02:25,929 --> 01:02:28,147
A WHOLE HAUNCH OF BEEF,
WOULDN'T HE ?

1304
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:34,989
( laughing )

1305
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:36,992
I CAN'T REALLY TELL.

1306
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:38,376
WELL...

1307
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:41,829
PERHAPS, MR.COHN, YOU
COULD TELL ME THE SOURCE

1308
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,832
OF THAT DOCTORED
PHOTOGRAPH.

1309
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:46,334
I CAN, BUT I'VE A LOT
TO ATTEND TO.

1310
01:02:46,334 --> 01:02:49,837
IT'S NOT IN MY POSSESSION BUT
THE INFORMATION IS SOMEWHERE.

1311
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:51,840
IT MUST HAVE COME
FROM SOMEWHERE.

1312
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,842
DID YOU THINK THIS
CAME FROM A PIXIE ?

1313
01:02:53,842 --> 01:02:55,343
( laughing )

1314
01:02:55,343 --> 01:02:58,095
( McCarthy )
MAY I HAVE THE LAST QUESTION RE-READ ?

1315
01:02:58,096 --> 01:02:59,597
THE LAST STATEMENT.

1316
01:03:00,098 --> 01:03:01,899
( clerk )
"IT MUST HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

1317
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,652
DID YOU THINK THIS
CAME FROM A PIXIE ?"

1318
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:06,988
WOULD THE COUNSEL,
FOR MY BENEFIT,

1319
01:03:06,988 --> 01:03:11,492
DEFINE, AND I THINK YOU MAY BE
SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT ON THAT,

1320
01:03:11,493 --> 01:03:13,912
WHAT A PIXIE IS ?

1321
01:03:13,912 --> 01:03:16,414
WHY, CERTAINLY.

1322
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:21,168
I SHOULD SAY THAT A PIXIE IS
A CLOSE RELATIVE TO A FAIRY.

1323
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:27,425
( laughing )

1324
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:31,546
MAY I PROCEED HERE ?
HAVE I ENLIGHTENED YOU ?

1325
01:03:32,047 --> 01:03:34,015
I DEMAND A
POINT OF ORDER.

1326
01:03:34,015 --> 01:03:35,800
WHAT'S YOUR
POINT OF ORDER ?

1327
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,803
THE COMMITTEE HAS NO RIGHT
TO CAST THESE ASPERSIONS--

1328
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:41,139
THAT IS NOT A
POINT OF ORDER.

1329
01:03:41,139 --> 01:03:43,441
THE COMMITTEE DID
NOT CAST ASPERSIONS.

1330
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:46,644
IF IT WAS ANYONE,
IT WAS I.

1331
01:03:46,644 --> 01:03:53,450
OR IS IT IN YOUR MIND ?

1332
01:03:53,451 --> 01:03:55,453
NOW, MR. COHN,

1333
01:03:55,453 --> 01:03:57,455
IF I TOLD YOU NOW

1334
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:00,458
THERE WAS A COMMUNIST SPY
AT FORT MONMOUTH

1335
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,960
YOU'D WANT HIM OUT OF THERE
BY SUNDOWN, WOULD YOU NOT ?

1336
01:04:03,461 --> 01:04:04,712
MR. WELCH,

1337
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:07,716
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
COMMUNIST INFILTRATION,

1338
01:04:07,716 --> 01:04:12,220
THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TELL
MR. WELCH HE HAS IN HIS FIRM

1339
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,673
A YOUNG MAN
NAMED FISHER

1340
01:04:15,673 --> 01:04:17,174
WHO HAS, FOR A
NUMBER OF YEARS,

1341
01:04:17,675 --> 01:04:20,678
BEEN A MEMBER OF AN
ORGANIZATION NAMED, OH...

1342
01:04:20,678 --> 01:04:21,979
YEARS AND YEARS
AGO AS THE

1343
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,017
LEGAL BULWARK
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.

1344
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:28,519
I'VE HESITATED
BRINGING THIS UP,

1345
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,021
BUT I HAVE
BEEN BORED

1346
01:04:30,021 --> 01:04:36,077
BY HIS PHONY IMPLICATIONS
ABOUT MR. COHN.

1347
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,084
UNTIL THIS MOMENT,

1348
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:45,586
I NEVER REALLY GAUGED

1349
01:04:45,587 --> 01:04:49,090
YOUR RECKLESSNESS
OR YOUR CRUELTY.

1350
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:52,093
FRED FISHER IS BEGINNING
WHAT LOOKS TO BE

1351
01:04:52,093 --> 01:04:55,096
A BRILLIANT CAREER
WITH US.

1352
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:58,599
WHEN I ASKED HIM TO
COME HERE AND ASSIST US,

1353
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,601
HE TOLD ME
THAT IN COLLEGE

1354
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:02,103
HE BRIEFLY BELONGED
TO THE LAWYERS GUILD--

1355
01:05:02,103 --> 01:05:04,772
THE ORGANIZATION
TO WHICH YOU REFER.

1356
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:07,776
I TOLD HIM, "I JUST DON'T THINK

1357
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:10,645
"I AM GOING TO USE YOU
ON THIS CASE

1358
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:13,147
"BECAUSE IT MIGHT
GO TO THE NETWORKS

1359
01:05:13,148 --> 01:05:16,151
"AND THAT WOULD HURT
LIKE THE DICKENS."

1360
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:20,655
SO, SENATOR, I SENT HIM
BACK TO BOSTON.

1361
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:24,792
LITTLE DID I DREAM,
THAT YOU WOULD BE SO CRUEL

1362
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:26,795
AND SO RECKLESS

1363
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:29,297
AS TO DO INJURY
TO THIS LAD.

1364
01:05:29,297 --> 01:05:31,415
IT'S TRUE HE WORKS FOR US,

1365
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:34,919
IT'S TRUE THAT HE WILL
CONTINUE TO WORK FOR US

1366
01:05:34,919 --> 01:05:36,921
AND IT'S TRUE, I FEAR,
THAT HE WILL ALWAYS

1367
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:41,425
BEAR A SCAR NEEDLESSLY
INFLICTED BY YOU.

1368
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:43,928
LET US NOT ASSASSINATE
THIS LAD ANY FURTHER.

1369
01:05:44,429 --> 01:05:46,931
SENATOR, YOU'VE
DONE ENOUGH.

1370
01:05:47,432 --> 01:05:50,435
HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF
DECENCY, SIR, AT LONG LAST ?

1371
01:05:50,435 --> 01:05:56,441
HAVE YOU NO
SENSE OF DECENCY ?

1372
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:09,753
THIS HEARING WILL
COME TO ORDER.

1373
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:11,338
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY.

1374
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:17,762
THEY'RE TRYING TO SMEAR
THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE.

1375
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:28,022
( Mundt )
YOU WILL COME TO ORDER IN THIS HEARING ROOM !

1376
01:06:28,022 --> 01:06:31,942
( gavel banging )

1377
01:06:32,443 --> 01:06:35,028
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
OF ANY KIND ?

1378
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,949
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
IT'S DISHONEST.

1379
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:43,788
IT'S THE SAME THING
COMMUNISTS DO.

1380
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:47,541
( Mundt )
YOU'LL TAKE YOUR SEATS.

1381
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:53,497
THIS HEARING WILL
COME TO ORDER.

1382
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,506
MR. COHN.

1383
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:04,008
I DON'T NEED IT.

1384
01:07:04,008 --> 01:07:07,511
YOU NEED IT.
YOU'VE BEEN SHOUTING.

1385
01:07:07,512 --> 01:07:09,514
GET USED TO IT.
I'M GETTING STRONGER.

1386
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:15,987
I DON'T FUCKING NEED IT.

1387
01:07:15,987 --> 01:07:16,988
AAH.

1388
01:07:16,988 --> 01:07:22,743
WHY NOT TAKE IT ?

1389
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:29,116
WE'LL HAVE NO DEMONSTRATIONS
OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL.

1390
01:07:29,117 --> 01:07:30,618
WELL...

1391
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:34,171
HOW DID I DO,
MR. COHN ?

1392
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:35,173
( Cohn )
THE TRIAL IS OVER.

1393
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:39,177
YOU GOT McCARTHY,
BUT YOU DIDN'T GET ME.

1394
01:07:39,177 --> 01:07:41,679
YOU THINK YOU'RE
ON TRIAL HERE.

1395
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,181
WHAT WOULD YOU
BE ON TRIAL FOR ?

1396
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:49,020
MIGHT I SAY, THAT FOR
YOUR SEXUAL PREDILECTIONS,

1397
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,522
I BEAR NO GRUDGE, NO MALICE.

1398
01:07:51,522 --> 01:07:55,442
NOR FOR THE SECRET PRACTICES
OF YOUR FRIENDS,

1399
01:07:55,443 --> 01:08:00,448
NOT MR. HOOVER, NOT HIS
EXCELLENCY THE CARDINAL.

1400
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:03,568
BUT SHAME,
MR. COHN,

1401
01:08:03,568 --> 01:08:07,071
FOR PERSECUTING IN PUBLIC
THOSE WHO IN PRIVATE

1402
01:08:07,071 --> 01:08:10,574
ARE NO DIFFERENT
THAN YOU.

1403
01:08:10,575 --> 01:08:12,410
I'M NOT GAY.

1404
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:18,466
SURE, AND YOU'RE
DYING OF MUMPS.

1405
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:33,765
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
WHAT YOU THINK.

1406
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:37,101
( McCarthy )
YOU WERE THE LOUSIEST WITNESS I EVER SAW.

1407
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:40,604
I GOT A LOT OF THE STAFF
OTHER JOBS. I DID THE BEST I COULD.

1408
01:08:40,605 --> 01:08:43,107
I COULDN'T HELP DAVE,
BUT I HELPED THEM.

1409
01:08:43,107 --> 01:08:45,109
THEY'RE HACKING
AT ME ALL AROUND.

1410
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:47,111
LONG KNIVES.

1411
01:08:47,111 --> 01:08:49,613
YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF.
I WARNED YOU.

1412
01:08:49,614 --> 01:08:50,114
I DID ?

1413
01:08:50,615 --> 01:08:51,616
YEAH.

1414
01:08:51,616 --> 01:08:54,118
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM
ABOUT G. DAVID SCHINE ?

1415
01:08:54,118 --> 01:08:56,120
YOU WERE GETTING
INTO SOMETHING.

1416
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,621
I JUST COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT

1417
01:08:57,622 --> 01:09:04,428
WHETHER IT WAS
HIS WALLET OR HIM.

1418
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:07,432
HE'S A FRIEND, JOE,
AND I WAS LOYAL TO HIM,

1419
01:09:07,432 --> 01:09:09,967
AS I WAS TO YOU.

1420
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:12,552
WANT SOME ?

1421
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:15,055
TRY THINKING ABOUT
THAT CONCEPT, JOE,

1422
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:17,858
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE GREATNESS LIES.

1423
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,444
I ALWAYS TRIED TO
DO THE RIGHT THING.

1424
01:09:20,945 --> 01:09:22,446
THE RIGHT THING ?

1425
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:23,948
WHAT A DISASTER !

1426
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:26,450
IF, FOR ONE DAY, EVERYBODY
IN WASHINGTON

1427
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:27,985
TRIED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING,

1428
01:09:27,985 --> 01:09:29,987
YOU'D COME INTO
BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS,

1429
01:09:30,488 --> 01:09:31,989
THERE'D BE
MASS SUICIDE.

1430
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:35,659
YEAH, WELL, IT DIDN'T
USED TO BE THAT WAY.

1431
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,412
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL
ME SOMETHING, JOE ?

1432
01:09:38,413 --> 01:09:41,416
WHAT, THAT I CAUSED THIS ?

1433
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,050
I DIDN'T INVENT
DIRTY TRICKS.

1434
01:09:43,051 --> 01:09:45,553
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

1435
01:09:45,553 --> 01:09:47,555
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

1436
01:09:47,555 --> 01:09:53,260
YOU KIND OF MADE THEM
INTO AN ART FORM.

1437
01:09:53,261 --> 01:09:59,317
LOOK WHAT
YOU DID TO ME.

1438
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:04,739
HEY.

1439
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,240
HMM.

1440
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,744
YOU EVER LISTEN
TO BOB AND RAY...

1441
01:10:10,745 --> 01:10:13,247
MAKING FUN OF ME ?

1442
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:19,703
AWFULLY, AWFULLY FUNNY.

1443
01:10:30,715 --> 01:10:32,717
( boat man )
<i>ONE OF THE GREATEST LUXURIES</i>

1444
01:10:32,717 --> 01:10:34,719
<i>YOU CAN HAVE IN</i>
<i>NEW YORK CITY IS A YACHT</i> .

1445
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,721
<i>THE ONLY PLACE</i>
<i>A MAN STILL PITS</i>

1446
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,723
<i>HIS STRENGTH AGAINST</i>
<i>THE FORCES OF NATURE.</i>

1447
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:40,224
<i>IT'S CLEAN, UNTAINTED.</i>

1448
01:10:40,224 --> 01:10:42,059
( Cohn )
<i>I JUST LOVE IT.</i>

1449
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,464
( boat man )
YOU LOVE "HER." A BOAT IS ALWAYS A WOMAN.

1450
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:45,966
<i>THERE'S A REASON.</i>
<i>DO YOU KNOW IT ?</i>

1451
01:10:46,467 --> 01:10:47,718
( Cohn )
NO.

1452
01:10:47,718 --> 01:10:50,721
I'LL TAKE IT. I'LL GIVE YOU A
CHECK FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT.

1453
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:51,722
WE'LL ARRANGE
THE FINANCING.

1454
01:10:51,722 --> 01:10:53,223
ALL RIGHT.

1455
01:10:53,224 --> 01:10:56,227
IT'S A STRONG BOAT, DESERVES
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

1456
01:10:56,227 --> 01:10:57,728
A LITTLE LOVE
WOULDN'T HURT.

1457
01:10:57,728 --> 01:10:59,730
HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN DANCE
ON THAT FRONT PART ?

1458
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,231
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

1459
01:11:01,232 --> 01:11:02,233
WHAT'S THAT CALLED ?

1460
01:11:02,233 --> 01:11:03,317
THE BOW.

1461
01:11:03,317 --> 01:11:05,319
MY HUSBAND ?
HE WAS A PIG.

1462
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:06,320
NICE.

1463
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,821
HE WAS A PIG.

1464
01:11:08,322 --> 01:11:10,324
BUT I GOT ALL THE CARS
IN THE GARAGE,

1465
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:12,826
THE GARAGE, THE HOUSE
IT WAS ATTACHED TO,

1466
01:11:12,827 --> 01:11:16,330
THE MAIN HOUSE, AND EVERYTHING
IN THAT, THE PICASSOS, THE DOGS,

1467
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:18,832
AND THE IBM STOCK OPTIONS,
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY ?

1468
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,334
WHY ?

1469
01:11:20,334 --> 01:11:23,837
BECAUSE ROY COHN IS THE
BEST LAWYER IN NEW YORK.

1470
01:11:23,838 --> 01:11:25,339
MY DEAR,
HE'S A KILLER.

1471
01:11:25,339 --> 01:11:26,540
SHE KNOWS.

1472
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,541
( Iva )
HE'S MY KILLER.

1473
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,543
( Cohn )
SHE KNOWS AND SHE'S RIGHT.

1474
01:11:29,543 --> 01:11:32,045
( chuckling )

1475
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:34,465
HEY, COHN.

1476
01:11:34,465 --> 01:11:35,966
RESCUE ME ON THIS.

1477
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:37,968
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU,
I HATE TO BRING IT UP.

1478
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:39,970
CARMINE.

1479
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:41,972
YOU'RE LEAVING ?
YOU HATE IT.

1480
01:11:41,972 --> 01:11:43,974
GOT YOUR COAT ON AFTER
THE FIRST ACT. WHY ?

1481
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:46,476
THE TENOR'S VOICE IS
LIKE RUSTY SKATES.

1482
01:11:46,477 --> 01:11:49,480
THE SOPRANO'S SKINNY LIKE A
BONE YOU THROW TO SOME DOG.

1483
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,981
I LIKE MEAT
ON MY BONE.

1484
01:11:50,981 --> 01:11:52,983
IVA SCHLESINGER,
OUR MOST SATISFIED CLIENT,

1485
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:53,984
CARMINE GELANTI.

1486
01:11:53,984 --> 01:11:55,986
I WORK WITH CARMINE'S
ASSOCIATION.

1487
01:11:55,986 --> 01:11:57,487
CAN WE HAVE
A TALK ?

1488
01:11:57,488 --> 01:11:59,990
CALL ME TOMORROW
AT 10:00 AT THE OFFICE--

1489
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,492
CAN WE HAVE A LITTLE
DISCUSSION, NOW ?

1490
01:12:02,493 --> 01:12:03,494
OH...AH.

1491
01:12:03,994 --> 01:12:05,495
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A BIT.

1492
01:12:05,496 --> 01:12:07,498
THIS CAN'T WAIT ?
I'M WITH PEOPLE.

1493
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:10,551
THE PROBLEM'S A LITTLE
COMPLICATED: LEGALITIES.

1494
01:12:10,551 --> 01:12:12,553
LEGALITY-SHMEGALITY.

1495
01:12:12,553 --> 01:12:14,555
TELL ME THE JUDGE'S NAME.
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

1496
01:12:14,555 --> 01:12:15,556
I'LL DO THAT, THEN.

1497
01:12:16,056 --> 01:12:16,556
OKAY.

1498
01:12:17,057 --> 01:12:21,561
HOW MUCH YOUR BOAT
SET YOU BACK ?

1499
01:12:21,562 --> 01:12:23,564
HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE BOAT, CARMINE ?

1500
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:26,066
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME
TO US FOR MONEY.

1501
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:30,070
YOU NEED IT, YOU GOT IT.
WE'RE FAMILY, RIGHT ?

1502
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,072
YOU THINK A SMART
JEWISH BOY'LL GO TO

1503
01:12:32,072 --> 01:12:34,574
AN ITALIAN BONE-BREAKING
ORGANIZATION FOR MONEY ?

1504
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:36,576
ARE YOU  <i>MESHUGENEH ?</i>

1505
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:38,078
LET ME ASK YOU.
FEEL THIS ARM FOR ME.

1506
01:12:38,078 --> 01:12:39,079
DO I HAVE TO ?

1507
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:40,080
GO AHEAD,
FEEL IT.

1508
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,581
MAY I ?

1509
01:12:41,582 --> 01:12:43,584
DO I WANT THIS ARM
AROUND MY NECK GOING,

1510
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:45,586
"HEY, WHERE'S
OUR MONEY ?"

1511
01:12:45,586 --> 01:12:48,589
RELAX. WILL YOU TELL HIM
TO GET A SUIT THAT FITS ?

1512
01:12:48,589 --> 01:12:50,591
HE TAKES CARE OF ME.

1513
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:53,093
ROY.

1514
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:54,878
THE FEE ARRANGEMENT
ON YOUR DIVORCE ?

1515
01:12:54,879 --> 01:12:55,179
YES.

1516
01:12:55,179 --> 01:12:57,181
I'M STICKING BY IT.

1517
01:12:57,181 --> 01:13:00,184
IT WAS A DISASTER FOR US.
WE OVERSPENT VERY BADLY.

1518
01:13:00,184 --> 01:13:03,187
THESE SOUTH AFRICAN DIVORCES
ARE LIKE QUICKSAND FOR CASH.

1519
01:13:03,187 --> 01:13:05,689
MY PARTNERSHIP
IS CASH POOR.

1520
01:13:05,689 --> 01:13:06,690
I WAS WONDERING--

1521
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:07,691
HOW MUCH ?

1522
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:09,193
$100,000.

1523
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:12,195
A LOAN,
JUST A LOAN.

1524
01:13:12,196 --> 01:13:14,198
I CAN DO THAT.

1525
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:17,201
MY DARLING, THAT'S
THE LEAST I CAN DO.

votes out
of 70 million cast.

1549
01:14:34,862 --> 01:14:37,731
That, Mr. and Mrs. North
and South America, is a squeaker.

1550

<i>Opinion here? A rich,</i>

<i>Good luck, America.</i>

1555
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:51,077
A FUCKING PHOTO FINISH !
HOW CLOSE WAS IT ?

1556
01:14:51,078 --> 01:14:53,080
LESS THAN 120,000

1557
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,081
( Cohn )
UNBELIEVABLE.

1558
01:14:54,582 --> 01:14:57,084
SAY THE POPULATION OF A TOWN
ABOUT THE SIZE OF, OF,

1559
01:14:57,084 --> 01:14:59,086
OF PATTERSON SWINGS
THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

1560
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:03,090
I'M ALREADY WORKING UP
LEGISLATION, THINKING MAYBE I'LL GET IT THROUGH.

1561
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,842
COME ON, WE'RE
DEMOCRATS. SMILE.

1562
01:15:05,843 --> 01:15:09,346
I'M SMILING.
THOSE RICH PRICKS.

1563
01:15:09,346 --> 01:15:13,983
ROY COHN CAN WORK WITH ANYONE,
EVEN THE KENNEDYS.  <i>MOLTO BENE</i> .

1564
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:16,486
HOW'S THIS COMPARE
WITH THE REAL THING IN ITALY ?

1565
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:18,489
MUCH BETTER, MUCH
MORE ELEGANT, THIS.

1566
01:15:18,489 --> 01:15:20,991
ELEGANT, YOU BET
YOUR ASS IT IS.

1567
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:21,992
YEAH, SEE.

1568
01:15:21,992 --> 01:15:24,995
I CAN DO BUSINESS WITH HIM,
IF HE'LL DO BUSINESS WITH ME.

1569
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:27,497
IT DEPENDS ON BOBBY.
HEY, WALTER.

WHO ARE
THESE GUYS ?

1573

1581
01:15:52,523 --> 01:15:53,440
SAY, ROY.

1582
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,443
YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR ?

1583
01:15:56,443 --> 01:16:02,899
KENNEDY IS GOING TO NAME
HIS BROTHER ATTORNEY GENERAL.

YOU HAVE NO RIGHT.

1596
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:41,572
MY HUSBAND WAS
A NEW YORK STATE JUDGE.

NOTHING DOWN HERE, SIR.

1603

SHH SHH SHH.

LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

1607
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:17,774
THIS IS ROY COHN.
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

1608
01:17:17,775 --> 01:17:21,278
JUST WAIT. LET ME JUST READ
THIS THING IN THE LIGHT.

1609
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:22,779
HELLO.

1610
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,315
CLYDE TOLSON.

1611
01:17:25,315 --> 01:17:28,818
WE'VE MET. MR. HOOVER ASKED ME
TO COME ALONG THIS MORNING.

1612
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:31,071
MR. HOOVER'S A PERSONAL
FRIEND OF MY SON'S.

1613
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:32,455
HE WOULDN'T APPROVE.

1614
01:17:32,456 --> 01:17:33,957
MOM.

1615
01:17:33,957 --> 01:17:35,959
PLEASE.

1616
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:36,960
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

1617
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,962
MR. HOOVER ASKED ME
TO MAKE SURE

1618
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:41,465
NOTHING BE TAKEN THAT
THE WARRANT DOESN'T CALL FOR.

1619
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:43,967
IT'S WRITTEN IN A WAY
YOU COULD TAKE ANYTHING

1620
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:45,969
AND DOESN'T SPECIFY
A GODDAMN THING.

1621
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:47,253
UH, MONROE...

1622
01:17:47,254 --> 01:17:48,638
OPEN THE OFFICE
AND LET THEM IN.

1623
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:50,590
( Dora )
WAIT A MINUTE.

1624
01:17:50,591 --> 01:17:53,594
MOM, THEY'RE WITHIN THEIR
RIGHTS. THEY HAVE A WARRANT.

1625
01:17:53,594 --> 01:17:57,097
MR. HOOVER ALSO ASKED ME
TO ASK MR. COHN

1626
01:17:57,598 --> 01:17:59,099
IF HE WOULD COME DOWN
TO WASHINGTON.

1627
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:00,600
FOR WHAT ?

1628
01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:03,103
TO JOIN US FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

1629
01:18:03,103 --> 01:18:05,105
THAT'S NICE,
THAT'S BETTER--

1630
01:18:05,105 --> 01:18:06,606
WHY DON'T YOU GO
IN THE KITCHEN,

1631
01:18:06,607 --> 01:18:08,108
MAKE COFFEE
FOR EVERYBODY.

1632
01:18:08,108 --> 01:18:15,415
<i>DIO, DIO.</i>

1633
01:18:15,883 --> 01:18:18,385
AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE,
MR. COHN.

1634
01:18:18,385 --> 01:18:19,386
THANK YOU.

1635
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:21,889
BUT WE WERE FORCED
TO IMPLEMENT

1636
01:18:21,889 --> 01:18:23,891
THE DEMANDS OF
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

1637
01:18:23,891 --> 01:18:27,895
UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME,
WE TAKE OUR MARCHING ORDERS

1638
01:18:27,895 --> 01:18:31,398
FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,
WHETHER WE AGREE OR NOT.

1639
01:18:31,398 --> 01:18:33,900
IT SEEMS THAT YOU

1640
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:36,904
HAVE DISPLEASED
THE PRESIDENT'S BROTHER.

1641
01:18:36,904 --> 01:18:39,907
BOBBY KENNEDY IS
A DANGEROUS MAN.

1642
01:18:39,907 --> 01:18:42,910
HE'S A SPOILED RICH KID THAT
NOBODY'S EVER SAID NO TO.

1643
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:45,913
AND HIS BROTHER.
LOOK, SIR...

1644
01:18:45,913 --> 01:18:48,916
YOU'VE CREATED THE ONLY FEDERAL
AGENCY THAT TRULY WORKS.

1645
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:51,418
IT GIVES THE PEOPLE VALUE
FOR THEIR TAX DOLLARS.

1646
01:18:51,418 --> 01:18:53,920
YOU ARE THE ONLY
FEDERAL EXECUTIVE

1647
01:18:53,921 --> 01:18:56,423
THAT PEOPLE KNOW
AND TRULY RESPECT.

1648
01:18:56,423 --> 01:18:59,978
YOU ARE A HERO, SIR.

1649
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:01,479
THANK YOU.

1650
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,316
I THINK YOU OVERSTATE,
BUT YES, AND CALL ME JOHN.

1651
01:19:04,316 --> 01:19:06,234
MY POINT IS,

1652
01:19:06,234 --> 01:19:07,235
JOHN,

1653
01:19:07,736 --> 01:19:10,739
THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION
WILL RESENT YOUR INDEPENDENCE.

1654
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:13,742
THEY'LL WANT TO, AND I
UNDERSTAND HUMAN NATURE,

1655
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:15,994
PUT YOU UNDER
BOBBY'S HEEL.

1656
01:19:15,994 --> 01:19:16,995
BOBBY WANTS ME OUT.

1657
01:19:17,496 --> 01:19:18,497
( Cohn )
WHICH WOULD BE A

1658
01:19:18,497 --> 01:19:19,998
CATASTROPHE
FOR THIS COUNTRY.

1659
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:21,499
WHAT I NEED
TO KNOW,

1660
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,919
IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT I CAN BE OF HELP--

1661
01:19:23,919 --> 01:19:25,921
THAT I CAN BE...

1662
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:28,506
A SOLDIER IN
YOUR ARMY ?

1663
01:19:29,007 --> 01:19:30,508
DID YOU EVER
HEAR THE WAY

1664
01:19:30,509 --> 01:19:32,344
JIMMY DURANTE SAYS
CATASTROPHE ?

1665
01:19:32,761 --> 01:19:34,262
"A CATASTRASTROKE."

1666
01:19:34,262 --> 01:19:36,264
A GREAT ENTERTAINER.

1667
01:19:36,264 --> 01:19:37,298
MR. COHN,

1668
01:19:37,299 --> 01:19:41,353
WE'D LIKE TO PLAY A SHORT
ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOU.

1669
01:19:41,353 --> 01:19:47,359
( moaning )

1670
01:19:50,812 --> 01:19:56,317
THE SOUND OF MARTIN
LUTHER KING IN A MOTEL.

1671
01:19:56,818 --> 01:19:58,619
YOU NOTICE THAT
COMMUNISTS MAKE

1672
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:04,959
THE SAME TELLTALE
SOUNDS AS PATRIOTS.

1673
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,128
ROBERT KENNEDY
HAS ORDERED US

1674
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:10,632
TO BUG KING'S HOTEL ROOM
WHEREVER HE GOES.

1675
01:20:10,632 --> 01:20:12,750
AND NOT JUST
MR. KING.

1676
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:15,253
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT
AMERICANS WOULD THINK

1677
01:20:15,253 --> 01:20:17,755
IF THEY KNEW THEIR
GOLDEN BOY LIBERAL HERO

1678
01:20:17,756 --> 01:20:20,258
PUT MICROPHONES IN MARTIN
LUTHER KING'S BEDROOM ?

1679
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:22,260
I'M NOT WORRIED.
YOU SEE,

1680
01:20:22,761 --> 01:20:25,764
I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS SINCE 1924.

1681
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:28,767
I'VE SEEN HOTSHOTS
IN THE WHITE HOUSE COME

1682
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:31,903
AND I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN
THEM GO: 6 OF THEM.

1683
01:20:31,903 --> 01:20:35,406
THIS ONE HAS 7
MORE YEARS MAXIMUM,

1684
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:38,276
AND THEN HE'LL
BE GONE, TOO.

1685
01:20:38,276 --> 01:20:41,279
MEANWHILE, MY FILES
ARE A GREAT SOURCE

1686
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:43,781
OF COMFORT
AND PROTECTION.

1687
01:20:43,782 --> 01:20:50,255
THIS PARTICULAR TAPE
I OFFER TO YOU.

1688
01:20:50,589 --> 01:20:56,595
WHAT CAN YOU
DO WITH IT ?

1700
01:21:18,617 --> 01:21:21,620
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO: INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY.

1701
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,706
I'M ONE LITTLE MEMBER
OF CONGRESS. THIS STUFF--

1702
01:21:24,706 --> 01:21:28,876
"IS AN OUTRAGE.
I AM OUTRAGED BY THIS."

1703
01:21:28,877 --> 01:21:30,378
IT ISN'T NEWS.

1704
01:21:30,378 --> 01:21:32,380
HOOVER'S BEEN TAPING EVERYBODY
HE DOESN'T LIKE FOR YEARS.

1705
01:21:32,881 --> 01:21:34,883
HE HAS MORE
TAPE THAN 3M.

1706
01:21:35,383 --> 01:21:37,385
( Cohn )
HOOVER ? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

1707
01:21:37,385 --> 01:21:38,886
HE HAS NOTHING TO DO.
LISTEN, LISTEN.

1708
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:42,390
FORGET HOOVER. I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION--

1709
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,141
DON'T DO THAT.

1710
01:21:44,142 --> 01:21:47,145
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE
PROTECTOR OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ?

1711
01:21:47,145 --> 01:21:49,147
HOOVER PLAYS THESE
TAPES AT PARTIES.

1712
01:21:49,147 --> 01:21:51,649
PRESIDENTS CAN'T STOP HIM.
I CAN'T STOP HIM.

1713
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:55,153
FORGET ABOUT HOOVER.
THE POINT IS, YES, THIS IS THE POINT:

1714
01:21:55,153 --> 01:21:58,156
IF AMERICANS AREN'T
SECURE IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN BEDROOMS

1715
01:21:58,156 --> 01:22:01,159
FROM POLICE-STATE TACTICS
OF THE WHITE HOUSE,

1716
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:03,161
THEN DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT IS DEAD.

1717
01:22:03,161 --> 01:22:05,663
THE CONSTITUTION,
THE BILL OF RIGHTS ARE DEAD.

1718
01:22:05,664 --> 01:22:07,165
NO ONE IS SAFE.

1719
01:22:07,165 --> 01:22:09,167
THE GOVERNMENT
IS OVERTHROWN.

1720
01:22:09,584 --> 01:22:11,085
AND YOU HAVEN'T
STOOD UP

1721
01:22:11,086 --> 01:22:13,588
AND SAID OR DONE A
DAMN THING ABOUT IT.

1722
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:16,591
THIS IS FUNNY, RIGHT ?

1723
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:18,593
OKAY, ROY,
I UNDERSTAND.

1724
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:21,545
YOU DON'T WANT BOBBY KENNEDY
IN YOUR BEDROOM UNINVITED.

1725
01:22:21,546 --> 01:22:22,547
YEAH.

1726
01:22:22,547 --> 01:22:26,767
I DON'T WANT
BOBBY KENNEDY ANYWHERE.

1727
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:30,938
THIS SHIT IS TOO DEEP
FOR ME. FORGET IT.

1728
01:22:30,939 --> 01:22:34,225
NEIL ?

1729
01:22:34,226 --> 01:22:37,229
I SURE HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SKELETONS IN YOUR CLOSET.

1730
01:22:37,229 --> 01:22:41,900
BECAUSE BOY, DO THEY HAVE
A WAY OF COMING OUT.

1731
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,902
OKAY.

1732
01:22:43,902 --> 01:22:44,903
OKAY.

1733
01:22:45,403 --> 01:22:47,905
I ACCEPT THAT AS A THREAT.
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE, PAL.

1734
01:22:47,906 --> 01:22:51,993
IN FACT, YOU STAY AWAY
FROM ME. WE'RE ENDED.

1735
01:22:52,494 --> 01:22:55,630
DON'T !

1736
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:59,050

<i>Yes, sir, a threat.</i>

1741

THE KENNEDYS.

1743

CHARGES I HAVE EVER
HEARD IN THIS COURT.

1851
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:26,814
THANK YOU FOR MAKING YOUR
POINT SO CLEARLY, MR. COHN.

1852
01:28:26,814 --> 01:28:29,600
BAIL RECOMMENDATIONS,
MR. WALPIN ?

1853
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,102
I SUGGEST--

1854
01:28:31,102 --> 01:28:32,603
IN THE MATTER OF BAIL,

1855
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:34,939
THE GOVERNMENT IS
WILLING TO RELEASE

1856
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:37,441
THE DEFENDANT INTO
HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE.

1857
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:40,027
OH, OH. WHAT'S THE CATCH ?

1858
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:42,864
WE WOULD LIKE THE DEFENDANT
FINGERPRINTED, YOUR HONOR.

1859
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:46,284
HE WANTS FINGERPRINTS,
PHOTOGRAPHS, MUG SHOTS.

1860
01:28:46,284 --> 01:28:48,002
( gavel banging )

1861
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:50,371
YOU MAY DO SO.

1862
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:51,171
THANK YOU.

1863
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:52,540
YOU'RE MOST WELCOME.

1864
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:56,544
DID I MENTION SEMEN SAMPLES,
STOOL SPECIMENS, BLOOD COUNTS,

1865
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:58,929
WHITE-BLOOD-CELL COUNTS,
PAP SMEARS,

1866
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,382
<i>IRRIGATION OF THE TONSILS ?</i>

1867
01:29:01,382 --> 01:29:04,885
HOW DID IT FEEL TO HAVE A
WHOLE ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT

1868
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:07,388
REACHING OUT FOR YOUR
THROAT FOR A CHANGE ?

1869
01:29:07,388 --> 01:29:08,889
I LIKED IT.

1870
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:11,893
MAKE SURE THAT GOES IN OUR
LITTLE COURT RECORD HERE TODAY.

1871
01:29:11,893 --> 01:29:14,896
THE CHALLENGE
INVIGORATED ME.

1872
01:29:14,896 --> 01:29:18,399
GAVE ROY
A HARD ON.

1873
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:19,901
( Walpin )
MR. GARFIELD,

1874
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:21,902
DID THERE COME A TIME
WHEN MR. COHN

1875
01:29:21,903 --> 01:29:24,906
INDICATED TO YOU THE PAYMENT
HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE ?

1876
01:29:24,906 --> 01:29:27,241
( Garfield )
HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED ANOTHER $40,000

1877
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,159
FOR PAYMENT
OF BRIBES.

1878
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:32,880
DID HE SPECIFY HOW THE $40,000
WAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED ?

1879
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,883
HE SAID $10,000 EACH
FOR 2 WITNESSES

1880
01:29:35,883 --> 01:29:39,336
AND ANOTHER $20,000
FOR AN ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR.

1881
01:29:39,337 --> 01:29:40,838
OBJECTION.

1882
01:29:40,838 --> 01:29:44,842
I'D NEVER PAY AN ASSISTANT
PROSECUTOR MORE THAN $50.

1883
01:29:44,842 --> 01:29:45,843
ARE YOU NUTS ?

1884
01:29:45,843 --> 01:29:46,343
MR. COHN ?

1885
01:29:46,344 --> 01:29:47,261
YES, SIR ?

1886
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,264
MR. COHN ?

1887
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:51,266
SIT DOWN.

1888
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:53,601
IF YOU ARE LATE
ONE MORE TIME,

1889
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:55,569
I'LL PUT YOU
INTO CUSTODY.

1890
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:57,572
I APOLOGIZE,
YOUR HONOR.

1891
01:29:57,572 --> 01:30:00,575
$20,000 ?
THE GUY'S DREAMING.

1892
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:02,076
HEARSAY.
IT'S ALL HEARSAY.

1893
01:30:02,076 --> 01:30:03,360
JESUS, ROY.

1894
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:04,779
RELAX, WILL YOU ?

1895
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:07,782
( judge )
IS THERE ANY MORE ?

1896
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:08,783
NO.

1897
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:10,785
( Cohn )
SMART MOVE.

1898
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:11,786
MR. RAICHLE,

1899
01:30:11,786 --> 01:30:13,420
FINISH THE REBUTTAL.

1900
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:15,706
SEE THAT BLACK GIRL,
THE JUROR ?

1901
01:30:16,207 --> 01:30:18,459
SHE'S GOING TO SLICE ME UP
AND SERVE ME ON TOAST.

1902
01:30:18,459 --> 01:30:21,962
YOU USED UP YOUR CHALLENGES
TOO FAST. BLACKS HATE ME.

1903
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:23,464
I'LL NEVER DEFEND
ANOTHER LAWYER.

1904
01:30:23,965 --> 01:30:25,466
YOU WON'T DEFEND
ME AGAIN.

1905
01:30:25,466 --> 01:30:26,683
MR. GARFIELD,

1906
01:30:26,684 --> 01:30:28,686
IS IT FAIR TO SAY
THAT BEING SUDDENLY

1907
01:30:29,187 --> 01:30:31,189
CONFRONTED WITH
ADDITIONAL COSTS,

1908
01:30:31,189 --> 01:30:35,276
FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE,
IS UPSETTING ?

1909
01:30:35,276 --> 01:30:36,277
YEAH, IT WAS.

1910
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:37,278
INFURIATING ?

1911
01:30:37,278 --> 01:30:40,281
DID IT MAKE YOU ANGRY
AT THE DEFENDANT ?

1912
01:30:40,281 --> 01:30:41,782
ME ?

1913
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:43,785
NO, I REALLY DO
LOVE THE GUY.

1914
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:48,039
BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.
I'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH.

1915
01:30:48,373 --> 01:30:49,874
( Cohn chuckling )

1916
01:30:49,874 --> 01:30:52,126
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
GARFIELD. MMWA.

1917
01:30:52,126 --> 01:30:52,910
YOUR HONOR.

1918
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:55,245
RELAX.

1919
01:30:55,246 --> 01:30:57,248
I'M SORRY,
I REALLY DO APOLOGIZE.

1920
01:30:57,248 --> 01:31:00,251
IT WAS JUST THE SINCERITY
AND GOODWILL OF THE WITNESS.

1921
01:31:00,251 --> 01:31:04,722
I ALMOST CRIED.
IT BROKE MY HEART.

1922
01:31:04,722 --> 01:31:06,724
MR. COHN,

1923
01:31:06,724 --> 01:31:08,726
WHILE I AM ON
THIS BENCH,

1924
01:31:08,726 --> 01:31:10,728
YOU WILL OBSERVE THE
RULES OF THIS COURT.

1925
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:14,682
BOBBY KENNEDY.
THIS IS KENNEDY'S COURT.

1926
01:31:14,682 --> 01:31:17,151
IT HAS ITS
OWN RULES.

1927
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:24,158
YOU ARE PERILOUSLY
CLOSE TO CONTEMPT.

1928
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:30,280
( dance music playing )

1929
01:31:42,627 --> 01:31:45,129
HI.

1930
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,131
REMEMBER ME ?

1931
01:31:47,131 --> 01:31:52,136
PETER.

1932
01:31:52,136 --> 01:31:58,642
SAY SOMETHING
NICE TO ME.

1933
01:31:58,643 --> 01:32:02,647
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SAD,
YOU'RE VERY EXCITING.

1934
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:06,150
EVEN WHEN
YOU'RE LYING...

1935
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:09,653
SO ARE YOU.

1936
01:32:09,654 --> 01:32:12,156
LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
YOU DANCED WITH ME,

1937
01:32:12,156 --> 01:32:18,629
WITH EVERYONE.
IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT.

1938
01:32:18,629 --> 01:32:23,634
AFTER READING ABOUT
YOUR TRIAL AND TRIBULATIONS,

1939
01:32:23,634 --> 01:32:28,639
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
AN OPTIMISTIC WORD ?

1940
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:33,143
BE AN OPTIMIST
FOR ME TONIGHT.

1941
01:32:33,144 --> 01:32:35,146
I DON'T THINK A FIRST CLASS
BASTARD LIKE YOU

1942
01:32:35,146 --> 01:32:42,520
WILL GET BEAT BY
A BUNCH OF AMATEURS.

1943
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,521
( judge )
MR. COHN,

1944
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:47,024
YOU HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY
AND ARROGANTLY UNPUNCTUAL.

1945
01:32:47,024 --> 01:32:51,528
I AM PREPARED TO CITE YOU
FOR, UH, FAILURE TO, UH...

1946
01:32:51,529 --> 01:32:53,948
MR. RAICHLE,
YOUR CLIENT MAY...

1947
01:32:54,415 --> 01:32:57,418
WOULD YOU LIKE TO REQUEST
POSTPONING THESE PROCEEDINGS ?

1948
01:32:57,418 --> 01:33:00,921
NOT AT ALL, I THINK THIS COURT
HAS PROCEEDED IN A TOUGH,

1949
01:33:01,422 --> 01:33:03,424
HONORABLE, NEW FRONTIER
KIND OF WAY.

1950
01:33:03,424 --> 01:33:04,708
ARE YOU IN PAIN ?

1951
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:07,595
IT'S JUST THESE DRAINAGE
SACS, THE STITCHES.

1952
01:33:07,595 --> 01:33:10,598
IT'S JUST FROM A LITTLE
COSMETIC SURGERY I HAD.

1953
01:33:10,598 --> 01:33:13,601
JUST A LITTLE NIP
AND A TUCK.

1954
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:18,105
BUT IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE,
I'M PREPARED TO DO SO.

1955
01:33:18,105 --> 01:33:21,858
VERY WELL.
PLEASE RESUME THE STAND.

1956
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:23,360
MR. RAICHLE,
ARE YOU PREPARED

1957
01:33:23,361 --> 01:33:25,062
TO CONTINUE WITH
THE QUESTIONING ?

1958
01:33:25,062 --> 01:33:26,063
YES, YOUR HONOR.

1959
01:33:26,564 --> 01:33:27,448
THIS COURT'S
CALLED TO ORDER.

1960
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:32,203
THE WITNESS IS REMINDED
THAT HE IS STILL UNDER OATH.

1961
01:33:32,203 --> 01:33:34,205
MR. COHN,

1962
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:35,539
WHEN WE ADJOURNED,

1963
01:33:35,957 --> 01:33:37,458
YOU WERE DESCRIBING
YOUR DUTIES

1964
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:40,744
AS COUNSEL TO SENATOR
McCARTHY'S COMMITTEE.

1965
01:33:41,245 --> 01:33:44,331
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THAT
COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION ?

1966
01:33:44,332 --> 01:33:46,334
TO UNCOVER
COMMUNIST INFILTRATION

1967
01:33:46,334 --> 01:33:47,835
IN VARIOUS PARTS
OF THE GOVERNMENT,

1968
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:49,920
INCLUDING THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.

1969
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:53,341
WHO WAS THE SECRETARY
OF THE TREASURY AT THAT TIME ?

1970
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:54,842
HENRY MORGENTHAU, JR.

1971
01:33:54,842 --> 01:33:57,845
IS HE THE FATHER
OF THE PRESENT U.S. ATTORNEY

1972
01:33:57,845 --> 01:33:59,847
WHO'S BROUGHT
CHARGES AGAINST YOU ?

1973
01:33:59,847 --> 01:34:00,814
YES.

1974
01:34:00,815 --> 01:34:01,816
HE'S BEEN
CONSPIRING WITH

1975
01:34:01,816 --> 01:34:04,318
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,
ROBERT KENNEDY,

1976
01:34:04,318 --> 01:34:07,821
EVER SINCE I INVESTIGATED
THE TRANSFER OF MONEY PLATES...

1977
01:34:07,822 --> 01:34:08,823
GET INTO IT.

1978
01:34:08,823 --> 01:34:09,907
OBJECTION.

1979
01:34:09,907 --> 01:34:11,909
FOR RUSSIA,
UNDER HIS FATHER.

1980
01:34:11,909 --> 01:34:16,413
THEY ASKED, THEY MUST HAVE
SET A RECORD, LIKE 8,450--

1981
01:34:16,414 --> 01:34:18,532
OBJECTION. THE DEFENDANT
CAN'T KNOW

1982
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,535
WHAT'S IN THE MIND
OF MR. MORGENTHAU

1983
01:34:20,535 --> 01:34:21,786
OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

1984
01:34:22,169 --> 01:34:24,671
QUESTIONS ABOUT MY PERSONAL
AND PRIVATE LIFE.

1985
01:34:24,672 --> 01:34:26,173
THE DATE I HAD
MY ADENOIDS REMOVED.

1986
01:34:26,173 --> 01:34:27,257
SUSTAINED.

1987
01:34:27,258 --> 01:34:30,010
THE OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED.
SUSTAINED.

1988
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:32,179
MY FIRST ERECTION,
ANYTHING TO TRY,

1989
01:34:32,179 --> 01:34:33,346
YOUR HONOR,

1990
01:34:33,347 --> 01:34:36,850
TO TRY TO TRAP ME, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY GOT ? NOTHING.

1991
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:38,135
YOU GOT NOTHING, RIGHT ?

1992
01:34:38,553 --> 01:34:40,054
YOU WANT MY BLOOD ?
HERE, TAKE IT.

1993
01:34:40,054 --> 01:34:42,056
THE OBJECTION
IS SUSTAINED.

1994
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:45,059
IT IS SUSTAINED. YOU KNOW
BETTER. YOU'RE A LAWYER.

1995
01:34:45,059 --> 01:34:46,560
ARE YOU QUITE THROUGH ?

1996
01:34:46,561 --> 01:34:48,563
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
FINISH ME THAT EASILY.

1997
01:34:48,563 --> 01:34:51,032
THESE REMARKS'LL BE
STRICKEN FROM THE RECORD

1998
01:34:51,032 --> 01:34:53,784
AND THE JURY WILL
DISREGARD THEM.

1999
01:34:53,784 --> 01:34:55,786
EVERY SINGLE
PROSECUTION WITNESS

2000
01:34:55,786 --> 01:34:58,288
IS A CONVICTED FELON
GIVEN IMMUNITY.

2001
01:34:58,289 --> 01:35:01,292
DON'T YOU SEE THAT EVEN THE
STUPIDEST JURY IN THE WORLD

2002
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:03,794
WILL KNOW THEY'VE ALL
MADE THEIR DEALS ?

2003
01:35:03,794 --> 01:35:05,796
THEY'D SAY ANYTHING.

2004
01:35:05,796 --> 01:35:10,801
DON'T YOU THINK THE JURY
KNOWS THAT ? DAMN RIGHT.

2005
01:35:10,801 --> 01:35:14,304
EVEN MY FATHER
WOULD FIND FOR ME.

2006
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:15,973
HMM.

2007
01:35:15,973 --> 01:35:17,808
EVEN HIM.

2008
01:35:17,808 --> 01:35:19,696
YOU WANT A CHARACTER
WITNESS NOW ?

2009
01:35:19,697 --> 01:35:22,700
I WAS FOUND GUILTY, ROY,
BUT WAS I GUILTY ?

2010
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,701
THE JURY DETERMINES
THE GUILT.

2011
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:27,705
I PRESENTED THE FACTS.
THEY DECIDED YOU WERE GUILTY.

2012
01:35:27,705 --> 01:35:31,709
DID YOU DO IT ? I DON'T KNOW.
WHO KNOWS ? WHO CARES ?

2013
01:35:31,709 --> 01:35:35,212
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO RIGHT OR WRONG ?

2014
01:35:35,212 --> 01:35:37,714
I DON'T KNOW.

2015
01:35:37,715 --> 01:35:40,718
YOU NEVER DID KNOW.

2016
01:35:40,718 --> 01:35:44,221
( man )
<i>THE JUDGE WANTS</i> <i>TO SEE YOU.</i>

2017
01:35:44,221 --> 01:35:49,726
THE JUDGE ?

2018
01:35:50,227 --> 01:35:52,229
( judge )
THE FATHER OF JUROR NUMBER 9

2019
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,949
WAS KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENT EARLY THIS MORNING.

2020
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:59,453
I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR
NOT SHE SHOULD BE TOLD.

2021
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:01,071
OPINIONS ?

2022
01:36:01,072 --> 01:36:02,573
THE JURY IS CLOSE
TO A VERDICT.

2023
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:05,075
A FEW HOURS MORE, POSSIBLY
LESS. IF THE FATHER WERE ILL,

2024
01:36:05,076 --> 01:36:06,077
WE MIGHT AGREE, BUT--

2025
01:36:06,577 --> 01:36:08,078
IF HE'S DEAD,
STOPPING NOW

2026
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:10,081
WON'T BRING THE
GIRL'S FATHER BACK.

2027
01:36:10,081 --> 01:36:11,582
SHE JUST LOST
HER FATHER !

2028
01:36:11,582 --> 01:36:12,583
LET HIS LAWYER SPEAK.

2029
01:36:13,084 --> 01:36:14,085
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

2030
01:36:14,085 --> 01:36:15,086
STOP IT.

2031
01:36:15,086 --> 01:36:17,588
UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN
LISTENING AT THE DOOR,

2032
01:36:17,588 --> 01:36:20,591
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE VERDICT'S COMING.

2033
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:22,092
9 IS THE BLACK GIRL.

2034
01:36:22,593 --> 01:36:25,095
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL A PERSON
THAT THEIR FATHER DIED.

2035
01:36:25,596 --> 01:36:27,598
OR WHAT ? ROY COHN GOES
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION

2036
01:36:27,598 --> 01:36:28,599
AND TELLS THE WORLD

2037
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:31,819
THAT THESE PRICKS
WANT HIM IN JAIL SO BADLY

2038
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:34,822
THEY'LL PUT A JUROR'S
FATHER IN THE GROUND AND NOT TELL HER ?

2039
01:36:34,822 --> 01:36:37,274
( Walpin )
THAT'S THREATENING THE COURT WITH BLACKMAIL.

2040
01:36:37,274 --> 01:36:40,994
WAIT.

2041
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:44,448
SHOULD I CHOOSE
TO INFORM HER,

2042
01:36:44,448 --> 01:36:45,449
WOULD BOTH
SIDES AGREE

2043
01:36:45,449 --> 01:36:48,368
TO ALLOW 11 JURORS
TO BRING OUT A VERDICT ?

2044
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:51,372
NOT EVEN REMOTELY.

2045
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:54,425
THE DEFENSE
WOULD NOT AGREE.

2046

YOU HAVE.

HOW DARE YOU NOT
RETURN MY CALLS !

YOURSELF ? A FRIEND ?

YOU ARE TO THEM,

BUT YOU DON'T SCARE ME.
I'M SHELTERED.

2089
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,711
I'M SHELTERED ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE THAT I'M RIGHT

WRONG. THAT'LL BE ENOUGH.

WHY DO I FEEL

PRESSURE ON IT.

2128
01:41:11,548 --> 01:41:14,050
NO, IT'S BLEEDING.

01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:16,436
OH, GOD.

01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:22,369
OH, THEY DID.

2161
01:42:22,369 --> 01:42:24,871
WHY WERE YOU
SO NAUGHTY ? WHY ?

2162
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:26,874
WHY DID YOU GET ME, HMM ?

2163
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:27,875
BECAUSE I WAS
A WOMAN ?

2164
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:28,375
NO.

2165
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,376
BECAUSE I WAS A JEW ?

2166
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,877
NO.

2167
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:33,380
I KILLED YOU FOR THE HEADLINES,
FOR THE FUCKING HEADLINES.

2168
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:34,381
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ?

2169
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:35,382
I'VE GOTTA GO.

2170
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:38,936
THE LAST STAGES: IT GETS
IN THE BRAIN, YOU KNOW ?

2171
01:42:38,936 --> 01:42:42,689
( Kennedy )
JUSTICE.

2172
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:46,393
JUSTICE HAS A WAY...

2173
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:47,894
JUSTICE.

2174
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:50,781
THE FACT IS, HE NEVER
FOUND A COMMUNIST.

2175
01:42:50,781 --> 01:42:53,283
HE NEVER FOUND
A COMMUNIST.

2176
01:42:53,283 --> 01:42:54,734
I HAVE A LIST.

2177
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:55,736
YES.

2178
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:57,571
A COMMUNIST,
YOU WERE A COMMUNIST !

2179
01:42:57,988 --> 01:43:02,242
A LIST THE LENGTH OF WHICH
IS JUST AMAZING TO BEHOLD.

2180
01:43:02,646 --> 01:43:05,432
IT'S YOU, PIXIE !

2181
01:43:05,432 --> 01:43:07,434
I KNEW WHAT
YOU WERE.

2182
01:43:07,934 --> 01:43:11,437
YOU WERE A COMMUNIST WITH YOUR
SUNSPOTS. I GOT YOUR SUN...

2183
01:43:11,438 --> 01:43:16,025
AND YOU, YOU DRUNK.
I DON'T NEED ANY DRUNKEN...

2184
01:43:16,026 --> 01:43:17,527
LOOK AT YOU NOW.

2185
01:43:17,527 --> 01:43:21,864
( Black juror )
WHY DON'T YOU HELP HIM ?

2186
01:43:22,365 --> 01:43:24,367
HE'S DEAD.

2187
01:43:24,367 --> 01:43:27,953
HE WILL BE SOON.

2188
01:43:27,954 --> 01:43:30,456
FUCK THAT.

2189
01:43:30,957 --> 01:43:32,458
YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS ?

2190
01:43:32,459 --> 01:43:35,462
THE LITTLE GIRL I DIDN'T
WANT ON THE JURY.

2191
01:43:35,462 --> 01:43:38,965
BUT THEN HER FATHER GOT KILLED,
AND I GOT SAVED.

2192
01:43:38,965 --> 01:43:40,967
MY FATHER DIDN'T
NEED TO DIE, MR. COHN.

2193
01:43:40,967 --> 01:43:42,468
HE DIED FOR MY SINS.

2194
01:43:42,469 --> 01:43:45,522
I WAS THE ONLY JUROR
WHO WOULD'VE SAVED YOU.

2195
01:43:45,522 --> 01:43:47,640
I WOULD'VE SAVED YOU.

2196
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:50,142
I WOULD'VE VOTED FOR YOU.

2197
01:43:50,143 --> 01:43:52,528
YOU WERE ALL ALONE
IN THAT COURT,

2198
01:43:52,529 --> 01:43:55,815
NOBODY ON YOUR SIDE.
THEY WERE ALL AFTER YOU.

2199
01:43:55,815 --> 01:43:58,317
I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS.

2200
01:43:58,818 --> 01:44:01,320
WAIT. WAIT.

2201
01:44:01,321 --> 01:44:05,325
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE THREW
MY ASHES IN ? THE EAST RIVER !

2202
01:44:05,325 --> 01:44:09,078
YOU WOULDN'T LET
YOUR DOG SWIM IN IT.

2203
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:10,547
MA...

2204
01:44:10,547 --> 01:44:12,549
AND YET,
HE'S MINE.

2205
01:44:12,549 --> 01:44:14,384
YOU'RE MINE.

2206
01:44:14,384 --> 01:44:18,971
I DIDN'T MAKE YOU THE
WAY YOU ARE. YOU DID.

2207
01:44:18,972 --> 01:44:21,474
YOU MADE
A MONSTER.

2208
01:44:21,474 --> 01:44:23,976
WHY ?

2209
01:44:23,977 --> 01:44:26,980
LOOKING FOR THE...

2210
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:30,483
WHY ?

2211
01:44:30,483 --> 01:44:33,986
A CONFESSION ?

2212
01:44:33,987 --> 01:44:38,491
WHY I LIVED THE WAY...

2213
01:44:38,491 --> 01:44:43,863
JEW THAT PERSECUTED JEWS.

2214
01:44:43,863 --> 01:44:48,450
GAY THAT CRUCIFIED GAYS.

2215
01:44:48,451 --> 01:44:51,454
I PRACTICED LAW BEFORE
THE GREATEST COURTS

2216
01:44:51,454 --> 01:44:59,462
AND STOLE, CHEATED
FROM EVERYONE.

2217
01:44:59,963 --> 01:45:01,464
I HAD A FULL LIFE.

2218
01:45:01,965 --> 01:45:04,968
( chuckling )

2219
01:45:04,968 --> 01:45:06,469
THAT'S WHY.

2220
01:45:06,469 --> 01:45:08,521
( chuckling )

2221
01:45:08,521 --> 01:45:13,893
I LOVED EVERY
MINUTE OF IT.

2222
01:45:13,893 --> 01:45:18,397
DID WHATEVER
I WANTED TO DO.

2223
01:45:18,398 --> 01:45:22,702
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET ME
GET AWAY WITH IT.

2224
01:45:22,702 --> 01:45:24,704
MR. COHN...

2225
01:45:24,704 --> 01:45:29,208
HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF
MORTALITY, SIR, AT LONG LAST ?

2226
01:45:29,209 --> 01:45:32,161
WILL YOU NOT RID US
OF YOUR PRESENCE ?

2227
01:45:32,162 --> 01:45:37,050
THEY NEED THE ROOM.

2228
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:39,052
( beeping )

2229
01:45:39,052 --> 01:45:44,974
AAH.

2230
01:45:46,976 --> 01:45:50,479
HEY, WHERE ARE
THEY ALL GOING ?

2231
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,983
WE'RE NOT THROUGH YET,
ARE WE ? I NEED...

2232
01:45:53,983 --> 01:45:56,986
I NEED TO FILE

DORA,  <i>MUTTI</i> , MOM ?

DON'T LEAVE ME.
DON'T LET THEM TAKE ME.

2235
01:46:03,993 --> 01:46:06,996
THEY CAN'T CATCH ME.
I'M THE GINGERBREAD BOY.

2236
01:46:06,996 --> 01:46:13,002
ROY, ROY.

( slow instrumental music )

2248
01:47:35,606 --> 01:47:39,109
AT LAST, HE DID
SOMETHING HUMAN.

2249
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:44,614
WHAT WAS HE SAYING ?

2250
01:47:44,615 --> 01:47:49,620
( Peter )
HE SAID, "TELL ME THE NAME OF THE JUDGE."
