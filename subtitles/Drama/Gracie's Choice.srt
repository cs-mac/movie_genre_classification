1
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,557
Mommy?

2
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:05,244
Mommy?

3
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,159
Police!

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,595
-Jake, come on!
-All right, children.

5
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,259
Come on. Come on.

6
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:37,968
What's going on? Oh, my God!
Where are my kids? Where are my kids?

7
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:40,912
What's going on?

8
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,709
Oh, my God! We got kids in here!

9
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,875
-Control that dog!
-l'm trying.

10
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,721
-Where are you taking us?
-lnto that car.

11
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:50,618
What was going on in that garage?

12
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,123
-They was cooking something.
-lt smelled bad.

13
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:55,124
Medicine.

14
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,632
l had nothing to do with it!

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,132
-Do you know who this is?
-That's our mom!

16
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:06,429
-Call welfare for these kids.
-We're already on welfare.

17
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,938
Look, we don't know
who these people are.

18
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:12,044
My mom has nothing to do with them.
We just stayed here.

19
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,746
-Are they gonna put us in jail, Mom?
-What? No.

20
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:20,681
No, they're not gonna put us in jail.
They're just trying to help. Right?

21
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:24,085
Please, l don't want my kids
to see me like this. Please.

22
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:27,158
-You handle this.
-We've got no one to look after them.

23
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:29,955
-We won't cause any trouble.
-Get in the car.

24
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,225
Get those kids out of here now. Now.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,027
-Okay.
-Now!

26
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,999
Come on. Come on.

27
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:40,003
No dog! No dog!

28
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,875
-Get in the car!
-No.

29
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:50,414
-Gracie, are you gonna help me or what?
-Mom!

30
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:54,384
Down, boy, down. Lay down, boy.

31
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,454
Gracie!

32
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:59,786
-Get in the car!
-l love you.

33
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:16,969
Come on, Spike. You can do it.

34
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:20,544
Come on. Don't slow down.
Come on, Spike!

35
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,341
Faster, Spike!

36
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:25,485
-Come on! Come on, Spike!
-Speed up! Don't give up!

37
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:28,120
Come on, boy!

38
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:54,546
Okay, everybody duck.
You too, Rose.

39
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,783
l thought we weren't stopping
until Grandma's.

40
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,113
l am not in the mood.

41
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,115
Let's make this good.

42
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,561
lt's just me and my daughter.

43
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,789
l will have the money for you in the
morning. l swear on a stack of Bibles.

44
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,198
-No credit card?
-Credit card?

45
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,272
l'm lucky to have the clothes on my ba--
These aren't even my clothes.

46
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:24,638
They're my neighbor's.
Oh, God. l must look like hell.

47
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,143
What exactly happened?

48
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:31,477
This crapped-out guy next door
was smoking and burned the place down.

49
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,118
Can you believe?

50
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:37,154
Our grandmother says that she's coming
tomorrow with money and clothes.

51
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,757
How early will she be here?

52
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,655
-Very early.
-Crack of dawn, man.

53
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,261
What time do you get up?

54
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,558
-Why?
-Because we wanna cook you breakfast.

55
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,561
Cook me breakfast?
Why would you do that?

56
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,602
Because you deserve it.

57
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,172
Because you're a sensitive man.

58
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,976
And not many people see that.
But who does?

59
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,010
-We do.
-We do.

60
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,652
l wish l had long hair like you.

61
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,526
My hair used to be longer than this.
lt used to be down to my butt.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,332
When you were young
and lived in Wyoming?

63
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,527
Yeah, when l was young.

64
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, you still are young, Mom.

65
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:32,435
-That's what l like to hear.
-Yeah, Mom. Tell us about Shamire.

66
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,012
Oh, Shamire.

67
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:39,914
Shamire was the most beautiful horse
in the world.

68
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:42,520
-Arabian.
-All white, huh?

69
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,453
Oh, honey, he was pale.
He was a ghost.

70
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,493
-You rode bareback like an lndian.
-Oh, l was wild like an lndian.

71
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,029
l rode him all night long.

72
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,326
My hair flying out...

73
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:58,164
...Shamire snorting, tossing his head.

74
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:02,936
His hooves were galloping,
thunder in that prairie grass.

75
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,402
You forgot the wolves.

76
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:09,844
Oh, no. No, no, because the wolves,
they was a-howling.

77
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:15,452
And the wind, it was a-blowing.

78
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,952
-But you wasn't scared.
-Oh, hell, no. We didn't care.

79
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,026
lt was just him and me
in a dead-out run.

80
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:25,289
Oh, man, my heels were boring
into his belly.

81
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:29,697
l could feel every breath he took.
God, l could feel his heartbeat.

82
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:33,361
We were galloping forever,
never wanting to stop.

83
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:39,177
And we didn't stop until we got
all the way to Montana.

84
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,409
And Grandma Lou had a cow, right?

85
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:45,915
She had so many cows,
she could have had a cow farm.

86
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,693
Hey, hey.
Mom, we're gonna wake up the manager.

87
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,388
Killjoy.

88
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,460
Hey, Mom, when do we
get to go to Wyoming?

89
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,691
Soon, baby. Soon.

90
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:05,031
-ls Shamire still there?
-No, silly.

91
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,366
Shamire's dead like your grandpa.

92
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:11,410
Shamire lives in the barn in Wyoming.

93
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:13,543
We'd better get everybody to bed.

94
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:17,046
Okay, okay. One, four, three.

95
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,048
-One.
-l.

96
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,047
-Four.
-Love.

97
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:24,018
-Three.
-You!

98
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:50,944
All right, come on. Come on.

99
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:52,675
Are we blowing the joint?

100
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,913
Kids, towels, towels. Come on.

101
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:57,447
Got it?

102
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,716
Ready to put it in? Okay, ready?

103
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,886
Count of three. One, two, three.

104
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,291
Go, go, go.

105
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,663
Hey, hey! Hey, you!
Come back. You didn't pay!

106
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,502
Hey!

107
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:31,685
Grandma Lou! Grandma Lou!

108
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:35,726
Looks like we've got some
company, unexpected.

109
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,489
-Grandma!
-Oh, my Lord.

110
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,030
Hi, Grandma.

111
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,792
Oh, yeah!

112
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,962
-Guys, these are for Grandma's guests.
-Rowena, l hope you're not staying...

113
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,007
...because l've got my monthly
Bible meeting happening.

114
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,176
-Put that one back.
-Now, don't touch those.

115
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:55,871
-They're for the Bible ladies.
-Put it back.

116
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:59,610
Don't put it back. Eat it now
that you've got it. Don't put it back.

117
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,584
Nobody wants to touch food
dirty fingers have touched.

118
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:06,919
-Oh, there's sandwiches!
-Ladies, this is my family.

119
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,689
Ladies, go right on with your meeting.

120
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,770
When's the last time
these children had something to eat?

121
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,068
These kids have been through hell...

122
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:27,179
-...but l have so learned my lesson.
-Oh, Rowena. Oh, l've heard that before.

123
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,844
-l mean it.
-All right.

124
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:33,081
All right. l'm gonna do it.
l'm gonna do it.

125
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:36,814
l'm gonna help you. God help me.

126
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,555
But you can't stay here. No, no.

127
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:44,356
Yes, l'll help you find a place,
but that's it.

128
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,966
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi, Gracie.

129
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,625
Hi.

130
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:59,408
This is the last of my dishes.
You have cleaned me out, Rowena.

131
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,843
Of course, you never
take care of anything.

132
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:03,846
Look what we found by the canal.

133
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,383
Mine is Shadow,
and Rose's is Snowball.

134
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:09,316
Look at them.
Oh, they're so tiny and cute.

135
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,014
Well, now, that's all you need
is two stray cats.

136
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,024
l mean, how do you know
that they don't have germs?

137
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:16,718
Can we keep them?

138
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:19,126
Of course you can keep them.

139
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:22,132
They look hungry.
Why don't you go get them some milk?

140
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,001
And pick me up some hamburger...

141
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,938
...and a can of tomatoes and some paprika.
Gotta have paprika if you're gonna cook.

142
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:34,170
-Will you make Rudy's Hungarian goulash?
-l don't know, Rose. You want me to?

143
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,646
-Yes.
-Well, then, hell, yeah. l'm gonna make it.

144
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:40,586
Who's Rudy?

145
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,819
Mama...

146
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,553
...Rudy was a Hungarian friend of mine.

147
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,320
Only now he's in prison.

148
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:56,793
Which commandment did he break,
stealing or murder?

149
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:01,771
What's a commandment?

150
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,435
''What's a commandment?''

151
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:08,937
-The Ten Commandments--
-That God gave Moses, Rose.

152
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:10,742
Don't you know anything?

153
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:15,877
l know you never take the kids to church,
but you should get them back into school.

154
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,421
Tomorrow!

155
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,557
Damn, do l have to write it in blood?
Tomorrow!

156
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,662
Well, don't just stand there gawking.
Go get the milk.

157
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,809
-And the stuff for the goulash?
-Forget the goulash.

158
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:42,578
Yeah. Your mom's gonna be too busy
cleaning up her dishes.

159
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,480
Would you give them some money
for a frozen pizza?

160
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:56,284
''Rom-- Romeo, Romeo...

161
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:01,559
...wherefore art thou, Romeo?''

162
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,498
''Wherefore art thou, Romeo?''

163
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:09,534
She's not asking where he is.
She wants to know why he's called Romeo.

164
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,238
''That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.''

165
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,078
Go on.

166
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,850
''Deny thy father...

167
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,081
...and refuse thy name...

168
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:28,853
...or if thy while--''

169
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,256
Wilt!

170
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:36,158
''Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...

171
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,896
...and l'll no longer be a Capulet.''

172
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:43,270
What's your name again?

173
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:48,136
-Gracie Thompson.
-Okay, Thompson.

174
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,581
You ever heard of Romeo add Juliet?

175
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:53,509
l know what a Romeo is.

176
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:58,980
But the story, the play,
Romeo add Juliet...

177
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:04,221
...Shakespeare, star-crossed lovers,
West Side Story....

178
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,227
They're from two different families
at war with each other.

179
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:14,237
She's willing to give up everything
for him.

180
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:18,235
lmpetuous, passionate!

181
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,776
Do you kids have any passion?

182
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:26,882
Thank you, Mr. Bodell.

183
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,553
-Are you okay?
-Today sucked.

184
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,817
So tell me about it.

185
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,953
-Rose.
-Hi, Gracie.

186
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,961
-Hi, Gracie.
-How was your day?

187
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,066
How are you?

188
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,930
-How you doing?
-Oh, hey, girl.

189
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,795
Hey, honey.

190
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,669
What do you think?

191
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:52,974
l think that's my T-shirt,
and it's too small for you.

192
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:57,708
-Look at the scale Mom got for us.
-Mama, l know what this is.

193
00:13:57,884 --> 00:13:59,818
The police are gonna be back.

194
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:03,012
Do you think my boobs
are too small for it?

195
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,555
Oh, come on.
You're not upset, are you?

196
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,590
-l paid for it, didn't l?
-Whatever.

197
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,523
l want you to meet somebody.

198
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:13,324
Ray, l want you to come out
and meet my little sister, Gracie.

199
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,990
-Mom!
-What? He knows l'm kidding.

200
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,635
Anyway, people do think
we look like sisters, all the time.

201
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,330
-You didn't tell me Gracie was so cute.
-She is.

202
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:25,966
-How you doing?
-You are so cute.

203
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:30,980
Gracie. She's always been jealous of me.

204
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,641
-She should be.
-Yeah.

205
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,727
Gracie, you awake?

206
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,294
l am now.

207
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,961
What do you want?

208
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,974
l'm sorry. Can l talk to you outside
for a second?

209
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:09,553
-What?
-Well, come on.

210
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,053
l'm not gonna bite.

211
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,790
Where's my mom?

212
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:17,557
She passed out in the bedroom.

213
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,758
Come over here. l just wanna talk.

214
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:30,338
Kids have had a hard time.
l can see that.

215
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,244
Your mom, she drinks too much.

216
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,109
l just-- l just wanna be a friend.

217
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:44,286
l'm gonna be living here now.

218
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,322
Good luck.

219
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,586
You're a smart girl.
l could tell that right off.

220
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:53,823
The whole bunch depends on you.

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,161
l'm sorry. Did l scare you?

222
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,468
Hey, little girl, l know.

223
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,575
l know how hard it is for you.

224
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,738
There's no one, no one to help you...

225
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,138
...love you...

226
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:13,613
...there's no one to touch you.

227
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,151
Hey.

228
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:24,857
Oh, yeah, you are one nice, little--

229
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,465
You bitch.

230
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,829
You like that, huh?

231
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,867
You like it rough.

232
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,647
-What is going on?
-She's coming on to me!

233
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:49,117
-You liar!
-Stop it. Go to your room.

234
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:52,485
-Look at my face!
-That's enough of your smart mouth!

235
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:55,525
-l can't believe you're defending him.
-l am so sorry.

236
00:16:55,695 --> 00:17:00,223
-l am sorry she got out of control.
-He is a complete sleaze.

237
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,527
-He could have broke my jaw, Mom.
-Don't mess this up.

238
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,572
He's the one.

239
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:09,536
The one what?

240
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,167
Gracie, l'm young. l like him.

241
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,809
l really like this one a lot.

242
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,514
Please.

243
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,636
What happened to you?

244
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,797
Wait a minute.

245
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:47,305
Who hit you?

246
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,677
-l walked into a door.
-Yeah, right.

247
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,717
Tell me what happened,
or l'll take you to the office.

248
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:57,083
What difference does it make?
l've been hit since l was born.

249
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,087
-Where do you come from?
-All over.

250
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,920
-Where ''all over''?
-All over!

251
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,655
Campgrounds, trailer parks, motels.
We even lived in a car.

252
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,823
l've been to so many schools,
l lost count after 41 .

253
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:15,936
-Did you ever tell anybody about this?
-No.

254
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:19,373
l'm gonna have to report this.

255
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,504
Why?

256
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,984
Oh, hey. Hi, girls.

257
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:38,219
Where are the boys?
Look what we got, doughnuts.

258
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:42,390
-l got doughnuts. Who wants them?
-l do. l'm starving. Can l have two?

259
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:45,059
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:48,269
We're gonna get fat.

261
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,774
-Mom, you're way skinny.
-l am? Am l too skinny?

262
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,172
-No.
-Let me see.

263
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,438
Turn around. Oh, that's cute.

264
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,982
-l got jelly for you.
-You've been gone for three days.

265
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:03,146
We had nothing but cereal.
No money, no milk.

266
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:07,581
But l don't-- l don't deserve a life?
l can't have a little fun?

267
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,194
You kids on my tail all the time.

268
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,648
Thanks.

269
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:47,322
Shadow, you meanie. You bit my finger.

270
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,730
Do you think mom will let us keep them?

271
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,302
lt won't be like Spike, huh?

272
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:55,866
-Remember that dog that my dad got us?
-Yeah.

273
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,532
Remember how he used to kick it?

274
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,279
Come on. Kids, kids, get up! Get up!

275
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,251
-Come on, cops.
-Mom, what's happening?

276
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,583
Get the kids! The cops are here!

277
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,153
You guys, get your stuff together!

278
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,488
Gracie, come on! Yo, yo, yo.

279
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,756
You gotta help me with these kids, man!

280
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:23,390
-The hell with the kids. l'm out of here!
-Gracie!

281
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:32,434
You have the right to remain silent.

282
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,846
-Come on.
-Where are you taking us?

283
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:38,540
Children can't stay with parents
who have drugs.

284
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:42,380
Please don't take my kids!
He showed up last night. l don't know him.

285
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:46,380
l swear to you,
l didn't know he had any drugs!

286
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,050
No! Are they gonna kill Mom?

287
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:53,631
-No, baby, they're not. She'll be back.
-Gracie, do something!

288
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,597
Please, Gracie!

289
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,967
Okay, boys, Ryan and Jonny
in the first van.

290
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,967
-Wait.
-You and your sister, come with me.

291
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,202
No, no, you can't separate us.

292
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,779
Just for a few days
until this gets straightened out.

293
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:14,352
-Gracie, do something!
-No, you don't understand. He's fragile.

294
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,581
-Ladies, don't make this worse than it is!
-Gracie, this is all your fault!

295
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:22,249
-You should have kept your mouth shut!
-Where are you taking him?

296
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,628
-No!
-Let go of him!

297
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:32,895
He's deathly afraid
of people he doesn't know!

298
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:37,099
-Please call my grandma!
-Ryan, Ryan, don't get in the van!

299
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,744
Please call my grandmother!

300
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:43,473
-Don't take him! No, no!
-Please call my grandma!

301
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:47,483
Let me go! Open the door!
Open the door!

302
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:49,743
Stop it!

303
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,322
Open the door!

304
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,264
You can't do this!

305
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,489
Get undressed.
Put your bags on the counter.

306
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:31,255
l put all your stuff in paper bags. You get
everything back when you check out.

307
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,523
This is for your hair. Lice.

308
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,860
-We don't have lice.
-You don't know.

309
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,833
Scrub, or l'm gonna do it for you.
Hit the showers.

310
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:42,169
Did you see her eyes?
Cat-woman.

311
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:45,902
At least this smells better
than that stuff Mom used to spray on us.

312
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,239
Yeah, roach spray.

313
00:22:48,414 --> 00:22:51,679
How many kids in this world
get sprayed with roach poison?

314
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,308
lt probably got into our genes,
and our kids will be deformed.

315
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:59,389
Can you believe Mom's in jail?
They're probably spraying her too.

316
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,085
-That'll show her, huh?
-What goes around comes around.

317
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:07,392
-You could say that again.
-What goes around comes around.

318
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:12,003
Wake time is 6 a.m. Breakfast is at 7.
General clean up at 8.

319
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:14,901
You have to be washed,
combed, beds made.

320
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:19,534
You'll get your assignments for chores:
kitchen, laundry, restrooms, showers.

321
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:23,045
-Okay, you're in here. Not you.
-Wait a sec.

322
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,877
-We wanna be together.
-There are no beds together.

323
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,678
We can sleep in the same bed.

324
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,981
-Don't give me a hard time.
-lt's not a problem. l wanna--

325
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,418
-No, l wanna--
-Take her.

326
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,219
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

327
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,760
-Let go!
-Gracie! Gracie!

328
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,490
-l just wanna--
-No, Rose!

329
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,899
Don't hurt her!

330
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,433
Move it!

331
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,439
Come on! Come on!

332
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:54,170
-Are you okay?
-lt was freezing in that horrible, little room.

333
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:57,281
-And they kept the lights on all night.
-Poor baby.

334
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,542
So cold in her little, padded cell.

335
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:03,176
She's so special, she got
the only single in the hall.

336
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:06,023
l don't think l can handle this, Gracie.

337
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:09,524
-She doesn't think she can handle this.
-lt's all right, Rose.

338
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:11,754
--three. Bigger! Come on, girls.

339
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,229
What about the boys? Do you think
they're going through this?

340
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,961
-Poor little Robbie.
-Poor little Robbie?

341
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:22,198
-Who's he?
-Another sister, probably.

342
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:24,342
Better toughen up, little baby.

343
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,308
-Want your diaper changed, stupid?
-l'm not stupid.

344
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,575
-Hey, Rose, don't.
-Hey, Rose, l heard your mother's in jail.

345
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:34,751
-l heard she's a hooker.
-Oh, well, look who's talking.

346
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,415
Fight!

347
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:41,058
Don't touch her!

348
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,121
Stop it!

349
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,923
Gracie, get off her!

350
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:52,235
Where are my brothers?
l have a right to know!

351
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:56,236
l demand to call my grandmother!

352
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,543
Gram.

353
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:08,516
-Oh, my little Rose. Grace. Girls.
-Why didn't you come for us?

354
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,247
Well, honey, l--
Nobody told me you were here.

355
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:12,913
Nobody ever called me.

356
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:16,322
Every time l called and called,
all l got was recordings.

357
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:21,023
-Oh, my God. All kinds of recordings.
-What about Robbie and Jonny and Ryan?

358
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,567
All of you are going to stay with me
for a while.

359
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,169
We'll see how it works out.

360
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:29,330
Let us try it for a while,
and l think that's good.

361
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:34,070
-Get in the car where it's warm.
-Grandma, you're using a cane.

362
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,680
Grandma Lou, can we please
go get our kittens?

363
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,510
Well, why not?

364
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:42,116
Shadow?

365
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,516
Here, kitties.

366
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,520
Your mother's still in jail.

367
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,424
So, what happens when she gets out?

368
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:54,691
She is not allowed to live with you kids.

369
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:58,132
She can't even see you,
and that's the deal.

370
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:00,100
Else l don't get to keep you.

371
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,832
l can't get the money to keep you.

372
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:06,234
Grace, Grandma's got to have some money
to feed you kids.

373
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,709
l got to have the help.

374
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:13,881
l can't keep cleaning up her messes.

375
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:16,850
My heart just won't take it.

376
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:22,919
l hate my mother for doing this.

377
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,863
-No.
-Snowball!

378
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:29,527
-Shadow?
-Rose.

379
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:34,062
-They're not here.
-l can't find them.

380
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,376
We'll get new ones.

381
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:41,635
Gracie!

382
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,809
-Gracie!
-Oh, my God! You've grown!

383
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,213
-l swear you've grown.
-You didn't call us.

384
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:51,220
-l had no idea where to phone.
-Those mean kids called me a retard. Am l?

385
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,291
-Of course not, Robbie.
-What did you do to your hair?

386
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,519
-Does Grandma have any hair gel?
-Maybe not, but Jell-O.

387
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:58,754
Come on!

388
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,398
-Hi, Grandma.
-Hi, big boy.

389
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:04,296
Oh, it's good to see you.
Get in the kitchen.

390
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:10,737
These kids are driving me nuts. Every time
l turn around, one of them's there.

391
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,901
Yeah, well, Robbie's fine
as long as he can see you.

392
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,606
This morning l went in the bathroom,
and he followed me in there.

393
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:21,344
We have to keep telling them that we're
at Grandma's and we're safe.

394
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:23,919
Yeah, which means more commandments.

395
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:26,717
''Thou shalt go to school.''

396
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,423
l hate school.

397
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:34,296
Gracie.

398
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,699
Okay, okay.

399
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:44,068
-Don't take all the covers.
-And don't wet the bed.

400
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,107
l won't.

401
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:47,506
Gracie.

402
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,107
We don't wanna be alone in there.

403
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,815
Just for tonight.

404
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:56,318
All right. Just be quiet.

405
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:04,322
-Grandma says we gotta say our prayers.
-Just whisper it.

406
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:07,158
Now I lay me dowd to sleep

407
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:10,933
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

408
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,798
If I should die before--

409
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,507
-You look like a bunch of little animals.
-l won't bite them.

410
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:21,874
Boys do not sleep with girls!

411
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:23,844
ls that one of those commandments?

412
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:26,450
You bet it is.
lt's God's commandment.

413
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,677
And you get out of this bed right now.

414
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:32,620
You go back to your room,
and you stay there. Do you hear me?

415
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:07,587
-Shouldn't you be in class?
-Lady, l gotta pick my brother up.

416
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,093
My name is not ''lady.'' lt's Mrs. Thurston.
l'm a counselor at this school...

417
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:15,290
...and you will help me
gather up this mess.

418
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:26,204
-l'm gonna need to talk to your parents.
-Good luck.

419
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:31,042
-lf you find my dad, l'd love to meet him.
-Don't give me attitude. l just want answers.

420
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,844
-Now, what about your mother?
-She's in jail.

421
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,511
-Who's the head of the household?
-Supposed to be my grandmother.

422
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:41,523
-Who buys the food and prepares the meals?
-l do.

423
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:45,289
You gotta do something
about your schooling.

424
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:47,898
l don't know how you made it
to the 1 2th grade.

425
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,193
l don't know what they discuss in class.

426
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,701
Thing is, your lQ tests
say something completely different.

427
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:57,941
You're just behind, but you
cannot skate through this school...

428
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,079
-...like your others.
-Some days l have to leave early.

429
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,373
l don't want to hear
about you ditching.

430
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,948
lt's not ditching.
l need a job to make money.

431
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:10,953
Gracie, making money is not
as important as going to school.

432
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:15,319
Now, look, l can't help you at home,
but l can make sure you do your best here.

433
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:18,062
l am doing the best that l can.

434
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,564
And l think you can do a lot better
if you put your mind to it.

435
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,362
Can l be excused?
Or whatever l'm supposed to say.

436
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:30,839
-l have to pick up my brother.
-lf you really have to pick him up, go ahead.

437
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:35,275
But listen, my friend,
you better get your act together.

438
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:49,456
All right, Wolverines.

439
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:51,489
She thinks she's so hot.

440
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,621
Ladies, on your marks.

441
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:01,933
Get set.

442
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:27,760
So how'd you learn to run so fast?

443
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:32,063
-Running from truant officers, l guess.
-You should be on the track team.

444
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:35,570
Yeah, the coach asked me...

445
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,731
...but l don't have time for this.

446
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,937
Yo, Tommy, out here!

447
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,210
-lt's only her first week here.
-What are you doing here?

448
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:50,946
My fault.
l thought she deserved a day off.

449
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:54,888
She has had plenty of days off
since she met you.

450
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,823
Did you help Grandma with supper?

451
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:59,486
And the boys?
Did they finish their homework?

452
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:01,962
Jonny was working
on some stupid model.

453
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,693
He was using toilet-paper rolls
to build columns.

454
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:08,396
He's making a model of Acropolis.
Maybe you could have helped him.

455
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,707
Miss, could l get a burger
and a chocolate milk shake?

456
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,400
lf you can pay for it.

457
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:17,036
Please. Please, please, Gracie.
He forgot his wallet.

458
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:19,882
-l forgot my wallet.
-Fine.

459
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:22,747
l'll pay, but don't come again
without your wallet.

460
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:28,223
-Please. l gotta be able to depend on you.
-Okay. Thanks, Gracie.

461
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:39,463
Hey.

462
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,233
You going home?

463
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:45,269
-Yeah.
-l'll give you a ride.

464
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:48,741
No. lt's not far.

465
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,710
And l take the bus.

466
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:08,061
My car broke down.

467
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:12,767
Guess we're going
in the same direction, though.

468
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,831
And don't laugh.
My mom's a psychiatrist.

469
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:20,443
-Who's laughing?
-Everybody.

470
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:24,548
She's always asking me crazy stuff.
l don't really wanna tell my mom.

471
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:28,743
So, what about you?
You haven't said anything about yourself.

472
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:32,855
-You're not giving me a chance.
-l'm a motor mouth when l'm nervous.

473
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,018
-l make you nervous?
-Hell, yeah.

474
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:39,857
Okay, it's your turn.
My mouth is sealed.

475
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,026
You asked for it.

476
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,663
This is my house...

477
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:48,135
...and l live here with my three
half brothers and half sister.

478
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,035
We're all bastards.

479
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:54,645
We have different last names, different
fathers. l haven't seen mine since l was 2.

480
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:57,748
Our mother's a drug addict,
and she's in jail right now.

481
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,783
We live with my grandmother
as wards of the court.

482
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:03,682
All my brothers have ADD.
Jonny has ADHD.

483
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:06,323
Attention-deficit hyperactive disorder.

484
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:10,086
Robbie, the youngest, who's a little
slower, has trouble being alone.

485
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,026
-Okay, is that enough?
-No.

486
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,799
-l mean, l'm sorry.
-Don't be.

487
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:23,031
-l'm not.
-No, l mean, l like you.

488
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,607
l just wanna know you.

489
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,909
-Come here.
-What's the matter?

490
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,411
l don't have time for this.
l run a zoo.

491
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,607
How about l give you a ride tomorrow?

492
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:35,014
-l told you, l take the bus.
-That's okay.

493
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,950
So tomorrow we'll both take the bus.

494
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:43,854
What?

495
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,755
You are knocked up,
and l'm the last person that you tell?

496
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:50,025
-l knew what you'd say.
-This is stupid.

497
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,829
-How are you gonna raise a kid?
-See? l knew it.

498
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:56,303
You can't quit school. Mom quit,
and look what happened to her.

499
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:57,702
l hate school.

500
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,436
So you're gonna live with Ricky
and then what?

501
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:02,773
Clean houses for other people?

502
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:05,142
Stay here.
We can raise the baby together.

503
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:07,648
-Oh, Lord.
-Another one won't matter.

504
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:11,653
-Rose, Ricky said to hurry it up.
-Bye, you guys.

505
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:15,056
-Rosie, make sure that boy marries you.
-Rose, wait.

506
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:19,853
We've never been separated.

507
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,293
Hurry it up, babe.

508
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,961
l am saying goodbye to my sister,
Ricky, so just can it.

509
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:33,768
Look, l know what you're thinking.
That l'm gonna end up like Mom.

510
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:37,109
But, Gracie, l love him.

511
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,783
l can't do this without you.

512
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,922
lt had to happen someday.

513
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,952
l'm not like you.

514
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:50,185
You can do anything.

515
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:56,959
Just take care of yourself, huh?

516
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:06,200
l'll call you.

517
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:22,385
Excuse me, ma'am.

518
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,859
Could you help me with my computer?
l'm having some problems.

519
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,429
Go away.

520
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:31,058
So how's it going?

521
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:32,863
This is right up my alley.

522
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:37,337
The Black Plague was caused by bacteria
that lived on fleas that lived on rats.

523
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:41,367
-l know about rats.
-l'm having problems with my computer.

524
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:44,379
Why don't you come over there
and just, you know....

525
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,319
-lf you don't, then--
-Stop it.

526
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:53,346
Something's wrong. l don't know--
l don't know what it is.

527
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:59,156
You have to clear some space.

528
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:05,066
-Just press ''escape.''
-What if l don't wanna escape?

529
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:10,003
-Gracie, that report is due tomorrow.
-l'm almost finished, Mrs. Thurston.

530
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,399
Yes, you are.

531
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:15,807
Jeez.

532
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,275
She's not that bad.

533
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:24,387
l mean, she's on my case a lot,
but it's actually kind of nice.

534
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:27,389
-You know, she cares.
-l care too.

535
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:31,017
Why don't you invite me to dinner?
Meet Grandma Lou and the kids.

536
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:32,958
lt'd be fun.

537
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:34,926
l won't bite.

538
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,690
-Okay.
-There it is.

539
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:40,301
-All right.
-All right.

540
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:42,439
Robbie...

541
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,598
...we have to bless the food first.

542
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,976
-What do we say?
-A prayer.

543
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:55,209
Now I lay me dowd to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

544
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,910
If I should die before I--

545
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,716
Your grandma means
to have God bless the food.

546
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,086
-Thadk you.
-l don't know that one.

547
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,127
Yes, you do. Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat.

548
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:11,994
-One, four, three!
-Mom!

549
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,229
-Mom!
-Mom!

550
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,168
Monkeys!

551
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:18,275
Where you been, Mom?

552
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:21,935
Oh, oh, hello, my monkeys!

553
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:24,843
-Did you enjoy your trip?
-Trip?

554
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:29,077
-Where you went since l've been gone.
-l would hardly call that a trip.

555
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,782
Hi, Mama.

556
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,648
-These kids been good to you?
-Yes, Rowena, they have.

557
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:39,126
Oh, that's good. That's good.
Everybody, this is Franco.

558
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:42,357
-Franco, everybody.
-How do you do?

559
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,194
And who is this?

560
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:47,304
You sure don't look like one of mine.

561
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,303
This is my friend Tommy.

562
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:53,376
Tommy. Well, l'll be.
lt looks like Gracie got lucky, huh?

563
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:56,672
Mom, would you mind if l talked
to you in the hallway?

564
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:58,443
Not at all, baby.

565
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,015
What you eating?

566
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:04,182
Lettuce. Franco, make yourself at home.
l'll be back.

567
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:07,191
l'll be back.

568
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:09,951
Would you care to join us?

569
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:13,988
-l didn't know you had a boyfriend.
-He's not my boyfriend.

570
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,392
Whatever he is...

571
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,866
...he sure is hot.

572
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:21,335
You can't stay here.

573
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:25,341
What gives you the right
to tell me what to do?

574
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,445
Because l don't want another trip
to a youth facility.

575
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:30,843
And that's exactly what's gonna happen...

576
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,540
...if you and your friend
don't get out of here.

577
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,449
l just got out of jail, Gracie.

578
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:45,990
You don't wanna give me
a ''welcome home''?

579
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:51,631
You don't wanna give
your mama a hug?

580
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,170
Thank you.

581
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:06,280
l missed you.

582
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:12,416
Look, we're doing really good right now.
Please don't mess this up.

583
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:20,322
l am not gonna mess this up.

584
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:27,905
l am not gonna mess this up.

585
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:51,719
--he's got the big rig there.

586
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:55,924

587
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,592
-Where are you two off to?
-l'm taking Gracie to meet my folks.

588
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,797
Oh, yeah, and we weren't invited?

589
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:05,468
Hi. l'm as ready as l'll ever be.

590
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,111
You could use a little makeup
if you ask me.

591
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:09,837
-You look great.
-Thanks.

592
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:12,244
-Okay, well, good night.
-Oh, hey, hey!

593
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:16,819
Try doing something l might do.

594
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:20,482
Bye, Mrs. Larson.

595
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,597
-How many people live here?
-lt's not that big.

596
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,328
Yes, it is.

597
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:38,635
Tommy, oh, my God, my entire house
could fit in your garage.

598
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,506
-Do you think l need makeup?
-Will you knock it off?

599
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,113
Tommy, they are not gonna like me.

600
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:47,149
Listen, l like you.

601
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,787
They're gonna love you. Come on.

602
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,094
Mom, Dad!

603
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:02,258
So Tommy tells me
you have three brothers.

604
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:04,424
-And a sister.
-Older, younger?

605
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,627
-Younger.
-How much younger?

606
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,364
-She was a sophomore.
-ls this the lnquisition?

607
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,067
l'm just interested, Stan,
so just leave us alone.

608
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:19,546
Her name is Rose, and she's getting married
and expecting a baby.

609
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,776
Oh, goodness.

610
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,186
l hope that's not giving
you two any ideas.

611
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:29,486
-Well, l thought you wanted a grandbaby.
-l do, but not yet.

612
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:32,995
Where's the powder room?

613
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:35,928
The bathroom.
lt's through the door and to the left.

614
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,261
-Tommy, show Gracie.
-lt's okay. l got it.

615
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:43,305
-Gracie, how do you like your burgers?
-Cooked.

616
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,930
Powder room?

617
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:43,462
l keep telling your son
he has to visit some colleges...

618
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:45,431
...and make some decisions.

619
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:50,438
-What colleges are you looking into?
-l hadn't really thought about it.

620
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:53,736
Well, you'd better.
There's lots of competition.

621
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,148
Oh, are you still hungry?

622
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:02,445
lf no one's gonna eat them,
may l take them to my brothers?

623
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,714
-My grandma has a microwave--
-Of course not.

624
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,451
-We have some buns. We got some cookies.
-Get some containers.

625
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:14,865
-They're just little children.
-What am l supposed to do?

626
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:20,902
Rowena, l have asked you
not to smoke in my house.

627
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:26,436
Oh, okay.

628
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:31,172
That Franco fellow is upstairs
asleep on my bed...

629
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:36,717
...and little Robbie told me
that he saw you in there with him...

630
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:38,616
...doing exercises with him...

631
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:42,122
...and l know them exercises.
ln front of your own children!

632
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:45,660
What am l supposed to do?
There was no lock on the door.

633
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:49,562
Well, l'm sorry, though.
l mean, that-- Oh, God.

634
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:52,430
l don't want the kids to see me
like that, either.

635
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:57,006
l mean, what am l supposed to do?
l don't have much. He's all l've got.

636
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,165
Rowena, the children are so upset.

637
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:03,803
They've promised not to tell anybody that
you're here, but they're little children...

638
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:06,279
...and Robbie, he doesn't understand.

639
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,011
Oh, God. Your daddy,
this would just about kill him.

640
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,617
Listen, Rowena, that check
is gonna come tomorrow...

641
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:19,058
...and why don't you and your man
take the check.

642
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,256
Why don't y'all just leave,
because you know what?

643
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:25,925
lt would really be best for everybody.

644
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:29,004
-l bring nothing but misery.
-l didn't say that.

645
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:30,970
No, you did. You might as well.

646
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,474
Let me get Franco.
l'll get out of your hair.

647
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:36,238
Please come to Mama.
Listen to me, honey.

648
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:39,983
lf you just get back into the church....

649
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:42,247
Mom.

650
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:46,248
Why don't you admit
l should have never been born.

651
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:49,052
Oh, God. Don't say that, Rowena.

652
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,887
You're my baby.

653
00:45:51,328 --> 00:45:55,992
Oh, God. l will not turn you out.

654
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,330
My sweet baby. My little baby.

655
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:04,441
Oh, my God. l love you so much.

656
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,140
l love you too, Mama.

657
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,347
Oh, my baby.

658
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:17,012
God, l love you.

659
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:19,952
We kdow your mother's
at your graddmother's.

660
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,149
l just have to ask you one question.

661
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:26,695
Are there any relatives
that would take you and your siblings?

662
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:29,855
Not that l know of.

663
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,230
We'll have to find foster homes.

664
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:35,065
You're not separating us.
We've been through that.

665
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,333
-lt's not juvenile hall.
-They take the kids for the money.

666
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,477
l'm not stupid.

667
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:44,307
-Look, l'll get my mother out of the house.
-lt won't work.

668
00:46:44,482 --> 00:46:46,313
Your grandma will take her back.

669
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:49,282
-She says she won't, but she does.
-l'll take them.

670
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:54,254
l'll take them. l'll get an apartment away
from Grandma, and l'll save up my money.

671
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:57,622
-That money is for junior college.
-l can always make more.

672
00:46:57,795 --> 00:46:59,422
Gracie, you're 1 7 years old.

673
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:03,863
You have to be a legal adult to be a foster
parent. You'd have to be emancipated.

674
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:05,262
l can do that?

675
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,198
Yeah.

676
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,704
Even then,
a judge would have to go for it.

677
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:14,777
-That's too much on your shoulders.
-lt has always been on my shoulders.

678
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:17,778
Look, this is a solution.

679
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,438
You can't separate us.

680
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,645
l'll be their mother.

681
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,754
You...

682
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:31,520
...are not their mother!

683
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:38,091
-ls this so you can get the caregiver money?
-You are doing this to get the money.

684
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,796
This is all a setup! She gets the money,
and she gives it to you.

685
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:44,702
Only because it belongs to me,
you bitch!

686
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:47,002
No, don't curse your daughter like that!

687
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:48,839
You shut up!

688
00:47:51,682 --> 00:47:54,344
-You are not taking my kids!
-Your kids?

689
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:57,648
Just admit that you had us
for the welfare money.

690
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:01,951
Too bad you had so many miscarriages
because there would have been more!

691
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:07,060
-You go to hell!
-l was born in hell!

692
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:16,667
They are never going to give them to you.

693
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:19,234
Not to you.

694
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,243
Just leave...

695
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,677
...before l call the cops.

696
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:57,109
Oh, my little baby grandchild.
l love you.

697
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:06,415
Oh, God.

698
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:19,431
-We can run away.
-We don't have any wheels.

699
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:22,470
We could take a bus, get jobs
and find a place to live.

700
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,768
-Wyoming.
-We can't run away, guys.

701
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:29,242
That's how Mom deals with her problems,
by skipping town.

702
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,210
We have to ask the court.

703
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:34,977
You take care of us,
so why do we have to ask the court?

704
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:37,484
Judges are smart
and listen to both sides...

705
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:40,556
...and they figure out
what's best for us, right?

706
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:43,454
We already know what's best for us.

707
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:47,222
Why don't l read you guys a story.

708
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:50,130
We've read Bambi about 1 00 times.

709
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:53,964
Don't knock it.
lt's the only book we've got.

710
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,893
l don't think you know
what you're doing.

711
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:21,930
-You understand they must stay in school?
-Yes, sir.

712
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:24,727
You're employed part-time.
You have a work permit?

713
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:28,235
-Yes, sir. Through the school.
-This has been a very trying day.

714
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:31,738
l've had half a dozen children
who had to be placed.

715
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:36,743
Well, your school records have
certainly improved. Mrs. Thurston?

716
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:37,938
Yes, Your Honor?

717
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:41,448
You're a counselor at Gracie's school.
What's your assessment?

718
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:47,557
Gracie is doing extremely well, and l'm
also encouraging her to apply for college.

719
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:49,886
All of the children are making an effort.

720
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:54,725
Ryan and Robbie are in special day classes,
and Jonny's pulling in A's.

721
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:57,162
What happens to them
when Gracie's at work?

722
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:00,201
My grandmother can come
to my apartment after school...

723
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:02,464
...or there's foster-family daycare.

724
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,608
l know it's not perfect,
but it's very important to me...

725
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:08,142
...and to my brothers
that we stay together.

726
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:15,547
Where is the mother, Rowena Larson?

727
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,916
l talked to her yesterday.
She said she would be here.

728
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:22,757
Well, how did these children
get here today?

729
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:25,918
-Easy. We took the bus.
-You don't have a car?

730
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:28,155
We're getting one.

731
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:34,429
Look, l don't understand this money
problem with your grandmother.

732
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:38,063
She's getting $520 a month
for each child.

733
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:41,905
The thing is, Your Honor, my grandmother
gives the money to my mother.

734
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,569
We don't ever see it.

735
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:47,979
Gracie buys us our shoes and stuff, sir.
l mean, Your Honor.

736
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:51,178
The money would have to go
directly to you.

737
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:53,380
That's gonna make Grandma really mad.

738
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,991
Because my mother
will raise hell about it.

739
00:51:56,994 --> 00:51:59,588
-l mean, heck.
-You don't have to worry about her.

740
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:02,891
Just worry about these kids.
You got a checking account?

741
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,227
-l can get one.
-What about an apartment?

742
00:52:05,402 --> 00:52:07,370
l found one. lt has to be approved.

743
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:10,530
How will you handle it?
You got telephone, electricity.

744
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:13,301
These children gotta have
their own bed, dresser.

745
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:16,139
-Yes, l have the list.
-This is ridiculous.

746
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:19,805
-l'll give you a week to get it all in order.
-l can do it, judge.

747
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:23,976
Well, if you can do all that, maybe
we should give you a job around here.

748
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:27,289
Okay.

749
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:31,394
This is just temporary,
but we're gonna give it a three-month trial.

750
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:35,726
But l'm gonna be watching you. l want
reports from the doctor, the dentist...

751
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:38,595
...and copies of report cards.

752
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:44,305
This is highly unusual, but l'm giving you
a chance to keep your family together.

753
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:46,568
l hope it doesn't come back
to haunt me.

754
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:49,644
-Thank you, Judge Donner. Thank you.
-Next case.

755
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,891
Tough neighborhood. l don't know.

756
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:12,058
lt's better than most places we've lived,
and we can stay in the same schools.

757
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:14,763
Well...

758
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:18,206
...you're gonna have to clean it up.

759
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:23,308
l have plenty of experience
scrubbing out bathtubs and cupboards.

760
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:26,307
Well, put some pictures up.

761
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:29,850
Family stuff. Make it cozy and warm.

762
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:33,387
-l'll be back in a week.
-Does that mean you approve it?

763
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,253
Done.

764
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:42,562
-You did this without telling me?
-l was afraid you'd think l was nuts.

765
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:44,530
No, my parents think you're nuts.

766
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,329
l, on the other hand,
think you're incredible.

767
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:51,167
l didn't have a choice.
Before l know it, l'm picking out beds.

768
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:54,902
-What do you think of this one?
-lt's way too soft. You know what?

769
00:53:55,078 --> 00:53:57,603
We got a twin bed in the garage.

770
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:00,748
Okay, how much money you got?

771
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:03,978
l've saved a few thousand,
and with the foster-care money--

772
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:07,021
Wait a minute. You've been saving
your money in a sock?

773
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,283
Yeah, underneath the mattress.

774
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:13,361
Why didn't you just put it in the bank,
you know? Earn some interest.

775
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:15,620
What's that?

776
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:19,394
The bank pays you a percentage
for the use of your money.

777
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,996
Free money?

778
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:27,432
That is a great, great idea.

779
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:51,123
-This thing's awesome!
-Go, Gracie, go! Go, Gracie, go!

780
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:56,497
Grandma...

781
00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:01,266
...could you cut this for me
right there on that line?

782
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:05,879
Left, left, left, right, left.

783
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:11,351
-Up the stairs.
-Left, left, left, right, left.

784
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:33,099
We found a kitten!
Can we keep him, please?

785
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:36,905
Yes, we can. You all are gonna
be taking care of him, okay?

786
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,911
What do we call him?

787
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:41,880
-Lobo.
-That's a good name.

788
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,473
Okay, thank you, Jonny.
That's good enough.

789
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:11,671
What did l tell you?
We do not jump on the furniture.

790
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:15,511
Put it in the corner. Thank Mrs. Turner
when we give it back to her.

791
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:19,782
We don't have any pictures,
so what pictures do we put in the frames?

792
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:22,886
Keep the ones that are in there.

793
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,461
lsn't Mr. Bessey supposed to be here?
l'm late for my open house.

794
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,793
-Don't worry. He will be here.
-Now can we go out and play?

795
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:32,696
No, l don't want you guys
getting all dirty again.

796
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:35,895
Mr. Bessey is never late,
so something must have come up.

797
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:39,634
Okay, that's him. Okay, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

798
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:43,742
Okay, everybody ready? Clean hands?

799
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:46,006
Elbows?

800
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:47,810
-Okay, good.
-This is such bull!

801
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:51,715
-We're gonna miss the whole thing.
-Calm down, Ryan.

802
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,325
Hello. l'm Sandy Jacobs.
l'm your social worker.

803
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:59,929
Hi. You know what?
There might be a mistake.

804
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:03,066
Bob Bessey, Mr. Bessey,
he's actually our social worker.

805
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:06,134
Your file's on my desk now.
That's the way it works.

806
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,770
Okay.

807
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:10,397
You're late.

808
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:12,201
-Sorry. Traffic.
-Yeah, right.

809
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,275
We have a phone.
You could've called.

810
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:17,811
They're upset because they had
an open house at school tonight.

811
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:19,881
Yeah, it started an hour ago.

812
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:25,415
Yes, well, this takes precedence
over an open house at school.

813
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:31,456
lt's very homey.

814
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:34,722
-You have gas, electricity?
-Look at our kitten, Lobo.

815
00:57:34,898 --> 00:57:37,458
lt means ''wolf'' because he bites.

816
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:41,364
-We got our teeth cleaned.
-Me too.

817
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:45,440
Yes, l have the reports.
Who are these people?

818
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,834
Aunt Beth Ann and Uncle Mike.

819
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:52,844
-And where do they live?
-Portland.

820
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:54,745
They do?

821
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:03,585
Okay, l noticed in the report that
your Grandma Lou checks here regularly.

822
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,787
-We have a stable support line.
-Very stable.

823
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:12,133
And l noticed that Brian
has communication problems.

824
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:14,167
Do you mean Ryan?

825
00:58:14,337 --> 00:58:16,703
Oh, yes, Ryan. Sorry.

826
00:58:16,873 --> 00:58:19,034
So many families. So many children.

827
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:22,576
l don't wanna upset him.
l would rather discuss this in private.

828
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,614
l think you should consider
counseling for him.

829
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:30,950
That-- That's a great idea. l will do that.

830
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:34,113
Okay, well, l have to make my report
to the judge.

831
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:37,453
All in all, l would say, ''Good job.''

832
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:40,627
l'm gonna grant you
a three-month extension.

833
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:43,665
Good work, boys.

834
00:58:50,674 --> 00:58:54,371
Grace, l have got to hand it to you.

835
00:58:54,544 --> 00:58:57,741
You have a lot of patience.

836
00:58:58,048 --> 00:59:02,075
And you're a better mother
than l ever was.

837
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:05,483
Grandma, we never could have
done all this without you.

838
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,490
Who drank all the milk?

839
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:12,617
lf you drink all the milk, we don't have
anything left for the week.

840
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:15,255
Why couldn't we get cereal?

841
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:18,799
Because it's too expensive.
Ryan will eat the whole box.

842
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:21,301
lt's got too much sugar.
You're hyper enough.

843
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,066
-Gracie, who are those guys?
-Mind your own business. Get in the car.

844
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,608
Down, Robbie! Get down!

845
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:36,845
Gracie! Gracie!

846
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:38,983
Stay down, Robbie!

847
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:43,222
lt's okay.

848
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:46,222
lt's okay.

849
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:52,696
You can't give us any description
of the shooters?

850
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:55,804
You didn't notice the make,
the color of either vehicle?

851
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,941
l was covering up my brother.
That's all l thought about.

852
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:01,509
-Where exactly were you?
-Where were you?

853
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:04,272
Don't talk to my sister like that.
She pays taxes!

854
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:07,473
-Show some respect.
-You were caught in a crossfire.

855
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:11,644
They shot our car! Through the door,
the rear-view mirror, the windshield!

856
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:15,450
-They blew a tire off! My sister came home--
-Ryan, get a grip!

857
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:20,790
Go upstairs. l'll be up in a minute.

858
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,533
Now!

859
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,701
Excuse my brother.
He thinks he's my husband.

860
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:31,739
This is all so terrible.
You could have been killed.

861
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:33,842
Grandma!

862
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:37,708
Robbie, honey, go upstairs
and get ready for bed. Take Lobo.

863
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:40,111
Jonny will read one of the stories
we bought.

864
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:42,376
Good night, Mr. Policeman.

865
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:44,884
-You are not helping this.
-l know.

866
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:47,922
l shouldn't have said that,
but l couldn't help myself.

867
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:51,026
-l know, Grandma.
-These things were always happening...

868
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:54,561
-...to your mom.
-Gracie! l came as soon as l could.

869
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:56,494
You okay?

870
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:00,460
-What's wrong?
-l think l'm gonna puke.

871
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:08,773
Okay, you guys say your prayers?

872
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:11,539
All right. Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

873
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:14,513
-Good night.
-Good night, Tommy.

874
01:01:19,456 --> 01:01:20,445
Hey.

875
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,516
Hi.

876
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:26,485
l can't believe you threw up
on that cop.

877
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:29,864
Yeah, it was a real projectile too.

878
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:34,201
lt was a freak accident.
lt could have happened to anybody.

879
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:40,136
lt just brings up so much old stuff,
you know, with my mommy.

880
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,747
lt's like nothing has changed.

881
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:47,711
You're not in that life anymore.

882
01:01:49,386 --> 01:01:52,321
-lt's time we made plans.
-Plans?

883
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:55,390
Tommy, l can't even plan
on lunch next week.

884
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,822
l'm going to court
every time l turn around.

885
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:00,554
l'm going from social worker
to social worker.

886
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,494
l have to do the laundry
and the groceries by myself.

887
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:06,430
-l put shoes on their feet.
-They're getting older.

888
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:09,128
Your grandmother can take over soon.

889
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:15,708
-You're not hearing me.
-l'm hearing you, baby. Yes, l am.

890
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:18,478
Next year, we're gonna get
our own place.

891
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:20,878
l'm gonna go to Braxton.
You'll go with me.

892
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:24,885
-Tommy, l can't afford college.
-On a scholarship.

893
01:02:25,055 --> 01:02:29,048
Gracie, you're getting A's and B's.

894
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:32,453
Baby, l love you.

895
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:37,193
We're gonna get through this together.

896
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:40,630
Think about you for a change.

897
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,474
Forget about it.

898
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:49,105
Think about it.

899
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:55,880
Right now l'm thinking
about something else.

900
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:12,060
-So, what do you think now?
-lt's very ivory-tower.

901
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:14,703
-You like?
-l like. For you.

902
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:17,533
What makes you think
they'll give me a scholarship?

903
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:20,437
-This. l went on the lnternet.
-By yourself?

904
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:24,410
Oh, very funny. Look,
foster-family scholarship application.

905
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:27,709
-All you have to do is apply. lt's a lock.
-Yeah, right.

906
01:03:27,884 --> 01:03:30,682
-Do you know what a college degree means?
-More money?

907
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,378
No, more us.

908
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:35,456
You know, have our own kids,
start a family.

909
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:37,726
lnstant family, just add Tommy.

910
01:03:38,528 --> 01:03:40,223
You want?

911
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:46,096
Yes. Tommy, l want very much.

912
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:48,432
Good.

913
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:54,206
l've never once seen you take a break.

914
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:57,505
l'm applying for a scholarship,
so wish me luck.

915
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,047
College? l thought you were saving
for a wedding dress.

916
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:05,313
That'll come later.
And l'm renting a wedding dress.

917
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:08,719
l'm not gonna buy anything
that l'm only gonna wear once.

918
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,159
Hello?

919
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:13,557
Gracie, it's for you.

920
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,135
Grandma.

921
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:28,971
Hi. l'm here.

922
01:04:29,145 --> 01:04:30,874
lt's gonna be okay.

923
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:32,776
Rowena?

924
01:04:32,949 --> 01:04:35,611
No, no, Grandma. lt's Gracie.

925
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:39,516
You're running around
without your shoes...

926
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,214
...like when you ride your horse.

927
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:46,658
-l told you a million times.
-No, Grandma. lt's Gracie.

928
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,297
l've got my shoes on.

929
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:52,194
l knew you'd come, Rowena...

930
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:55,735
...because you know
how much l love you.

931
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,770
You know l spoiled you.

932
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:01,433
l spoiled you when you were a little girl,
but l was too strict...

933
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:04,671
...in all the wrong ways.

934
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:09,917
Parents aren't always so smart.

935
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:14,650
But l promise,
l'm gonna make it up to you.

936
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:20,353
Oh, forgive me, Rowena, please.

937
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,555
You forgive your mama?

938
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:27,731
Yeah. Yeah, l forgive you.

939
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,202
Just rest now, okay?

940
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,638
Just rest because l need you.

941
01:05:37,614 --> 01:05:39,946
We all need you.

942
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:43,809
Just rest.

943
01:05:45,555 --> 01:05:48,422
Lord, when we hear the words
of your commandments...

944
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:50,923
...that you giveth and you taketh away...

945
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:55,622
...so often we look only at the part
that's half empty, the taketh away.

946
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:00,132
Yet, even as we are filled with sadness
for the loss of our beloved Louella...

947
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:03,329
...we are also here to celebrate
what she gave us.

948
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:08,443
Louella Larson, proud mother to a fine
and wonderful daughter, Rowena...

949
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:12,377
-...loving grandmother....
-lsn't Mom supposed to be here?

950
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:14,982
She told Rose she was coming.

951
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:19,645
--just plain Lou, although
Lou was anything but plain.

952
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:22,348
We ask you, dear Lord, to take her.

953
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:28,190
l'm starving. All l want
is chocolate all the time.

954
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,597
Kids!

955
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,862
Boys!

956
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:41,503
Oh, my God. You guys.

957
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:44,010
We couldn't find the church.

958
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:50,543
Tommy, you're still around, dude.
That's rocking.

959
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:54,951
Well, look at you.
My girls, my little girls.

960
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:57,456
My baby girls.

961
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:59,356
Hi, Mom.

962
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,959
Get out!

963
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,795
Oh, my golly.

964
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:14,439
Can you believe it?
l'm gonna be a grandma.

965
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:20,414
Poor Grandma Lou, huh?

966
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:29,149
You guys, listen. l want you
to know something, okay?

967
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:31,584
lf you want anything...

968
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:36,422
...of your grandma's, a little trinket
or keepsake, you let me know.

969
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:40,433
She didn't have much. She only had
$ 7000, which she gave me, of course...

970
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:45,233
...you know, and the house and furniture.
Listen, where are my boys?

971
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,278
They're outside.

972
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:59,211
-Come on, come on.
-Hey, boys, guess who's home.

973
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,585
Well, what's up?
Come on, Jonny, Robbie.

974
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:10,961
-Well, come on! Yeah, Robbie!
-Mama!

975
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:13,595
Hi, baby.

976
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:16,304
How's my boy? Come on.

977
01:08:17,373 --> 01:08:21,537
-Jonny, let's go, man. Come on.
-Oh, Mom.

978
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:23,611
Ryan?

979
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,769
Ryan?

980
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:27,077
Come on, man.

981
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:31,478
That's the way l like to see it.

982
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:36,382
Do you think she's gonna try
and take the boys?

983
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:39,919
Who knows what she's gonna do?

984
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,924
l got her.

985
01:08:43,232 --> 01:08:44,790
Come on.

986
01:09:39,822 --> 01:09:44,054
Gracie, that guy over there,
he wants to talk to you.

987
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:48,863
Okay.

988
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:51,659
Will you cover for me? Thanks.

989
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,302
What can l do for you?

990
01:09:57,473 --> 01:10:01,000
What you can do is get your ass
over here and give me a hug.

991
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:03,008
Who are you?

992
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:05,606
Gracie, l'm your daddy.

993
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:09,550
What's the matter?
You don't believe me?

994
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:13,647
-l don't know. l-- l can't--
-Listen...

995
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:18,527
...have you got a little place where
we could go talk for just a minute?

996
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:22,193
Come on.

997
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:23,855
Yeah.

998
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:26,826
Yeah.

999
01:10:28,538 --> 01:10:32,269
Look at you, you're the manager.
l mean, that's fabulous.

1000
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:36,741
You know, and you look real pretty,
like your mom.

1001
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,311
You turned out great, Gracie.

1002
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:42,042
No thanks to you.
There's no smoking in here.

1003
01:10:42,218 --> 01:10:43,549
Come on, don't be mad.

1004
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:47,450
You know, l just-- l couldn't see you
because of the restraining order.

1005
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:50,023
-They'd have put me in jail.
-You beat me.

1006
01:10:50,192 --> 01:10:52,752
No, no, no. Your mom beat you.

1007
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:54,690
ls that true?

1008
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:58,964
Sweetie, l've just been
thinking about you all these years...

1009
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:02,263
...and waiting until you was 1 8
so that l could see you.

1010
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,902
Have you ever heard of a phone call?

1011
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:09,238
Jeez. Gracie, you know, l kind of had
some problems of my own for a while!

1012
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:16,447
But, you know, the thing is,
now your mom--

1013
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:19,747
She's trying to stick me
with this back child-support thing.

1014
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:22,720
She's claiming that Rosie
and the boys are my kids.

1015
01:11:22,892 --> 01:11:24,860
Well, you know they're not, right?

1016
01:11:25,328 --> 01:11:27,228
So, what l need--

1017
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:33,926
l just need you to sign this thing
that says that l was long gone--

1018
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,901
This is why you came to see me?

1019
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:40,731
Well, she can't get away with it,
because they're not my kids.

1020
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,434
No, they're mine!

1021
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:56,549
Good luck with your
child support, Daddy.

1022
01:12:08,304 --> 01:12:11,068
You guys, what is this?

1023
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,299
Well, wake up and smell the roses.

1024
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:16,309
Congratulations!

1025
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:18,413
-Thank you.
-You have to stay in bed.

1026
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:23,450
-Breakfast in bed, like on TV.
-Oh, my goodness. One, four, three.

1027
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:25,985
-Come here.
-One, four, three, Gracie.

1028
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:28,350
This looks delicious.

1029
01:12:30,693 --> 01:12:32,058
Jarrod Tarlatod.

1030
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:41,092
Gracie Thompson.

1031
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:44,330
Yeah! All right, Gracie!

1032
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:45,804
All right, Gracie!

1033
01:12:50,312 --> 01:12:53,406
Your parents must be very proud.

1034
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:55,607
Exactly.

1035
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:10,326
-Gracie!
-Hey, there you are.

1036
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:13,696
-Hold it. Hold it, guys. l want to get this.
-Cheese!

1037
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:16,634
-Beautiful.
-l am so proud of you.

1038
01:13:16,806 --> 01:13:19,206
-Congratulations.
-l told you you could do it.

1039
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:23,038
-Hey, there's punch in the corner.
-Gracie, Tommy, there you are.

1040
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:25,544
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, Mrs. Thurston.

1041
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:28,115
-Let's get a picture.
-l'm so proud of you.

1042
01:13:28,284 --> 01:13:31,151
l am sorry l was a pain in the ass.
l hated your guts.

1043
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,016
Don't worry about it.
l hated yours too.

1044
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,216
l got a job this summer
doing books for an escrow company.

1045
01:13:37,393 --> 01:13:40,362
This from the girl who once told me
she couldn't do math?

1046
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:43,157
l'm loading numbers into a computer,
that's all.

1047
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:47,063
Whatever it is, you're starting a new life
and with a new scholarship.

1048
01:13:47,236 --> 01:13:49,966
Now, that is the best news.

1049
01:13:51,674 --> 01:13:54,268
You proud of that? l can't believe it.

1050
01:13:54,443 --> 01:13:58,345
Boys, do you want to say hello
to Mrs. Thurston? Say hello.

1051
01:13:58,514 --> 01:14:00,880
Hi, Mrs. Thurston.

1052
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:03,951
So when were you gonna tell me?

1053
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,849
l don't know.

1054
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:10,687
-l just got all messed up.
-You found out you got a scholarship...

1055
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,191
...and you threw it away?

1056
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:15,330
How do l go to college
and leave the boys? A few years--

1057
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:19,264
Robbie's 7 years old.
That's a long time, Gracie.

1058
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:23,035
Look, l just gotta know.

1059
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:29,039
Do you love me or not?

1060
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:32,112
Tommy, you know that l do.

1061
01:14:33,482 --> 01:14:36,110
Say it, Gracie.

1062
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:47,294
But l can't turn my back on the boys.
Even if l wanted to, l can't.

1063
01:14:47,463 --> 01:14:49,863
Let somebody adopt them.

1064
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,091
lt's a good opportunity--

1065
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:54,759
lf anybody's gonna adopt them,
it's gonna be me.

1066
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:59,107
Do you know what you just said?

1067
01:15:02,578 --> 01:15:03,875
So you're serious.

1068
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:08,449
-You're gonna try and adopt them yourself?
-l don't know what l'm gonna do.

1069
01:15:12,655 --> 01:15:14,782
Look, the boys adore you...

1070
01:15:14,957 --> 01:15:17,892
-...and l know that you love them.
-l love you, damn it!

1071
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,393
l want to be with you!
l want to marry you!

1072
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:24,827
l want us to have our own kids,
not with them.

1073
01:15:25,534 --> 01:15:28,628
-Tommy, don't say that.
-You've got to make a choice.

1074
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:31,102
Look, l'm sorry, Gracie.

1075
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,103
l'm only 1 9.

1076
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:35,576
Got my whole life ahead of me.

1077
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:37,712
l can't.

1078
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:52,524
Gracie, your family is ruining your life.

1079
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:58,198
You don't even see it.

1080
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:11,243
You expect me to take this pro bono?

1081
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:13,310
l don't expect anything. l'm hoping.

1082
01:16:13,482 --> 01:16:16,349
-Do you know your mom will sign a release?
-l don't.

1083
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:19,282
The only way she'd sign it
is if she was high on pot.

1084
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:22,652
They'll assign her a lawyer.
You only get one shot in court.

1085
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:25,726
You'd have to luck out
with an understanding judge.

1086
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:28,386
-We had one before.
-And what about the fathers?

1087
01:16:28,564 --> 01:16:31,829
l don't know who half of them are.
Neither does my mother.

1088
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:36,267
You have to get a hold of relatives. You
have to check out last known addresses.

1089
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:38,497
You have to put ads in newspapers.

1090
01:16:38,674 --> 01:16:42,474
You've got to locate these people
so parental rights can be terminated.

1091
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:45,341
-Ancillary costs can add up.
-l know. l'm prepared.

1092
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:48,642
l went through all of this stuff
with an adoption worker.

1093
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:52,309
There's little or no precedent for this.
A person as young as you--

1094
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:54,683
Are you gonna help me or not?

1095
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:01,963
Robbie?

1096
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:06,425
Don't wrinkle it. l just ironed it.
lt's an expensive shirt.

1097
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:07,864
Belonged to my boss.

1098
01:17:08,537 --> 01:17:11,199
Come on. We gotta get going.
We can't be late.

1099
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:14,240
-lt got a big stain.
-Tuck it in and it won't show.

1100
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:18,437
-Why can't we ever get anything new?
-Why don't you start mowing more lawns?

1101
01:17:18,614 --> 01:17:22,448
-Are you scrubbed good behind your ears?
-My hair okay?

1102
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:24,352
What is that smell?

1103
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,387
l used some of Tommy's cologne
he left in the bathroom.

1104
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:31,424
-Well, you used too much.
-ls Mom gonna be there?

1105
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,425
Come on.

1106
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,402
All right, l want you to sit over here.

1107
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:46,541
You're in charge.
Do not talk to anyone, okay?

1108
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:49,872
Excuse me, while l go barf my guts out.

1109
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:06,995
Would you mind if l had two of those?

1110
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:08,390
-Aspirin?
-Yeah.

1111
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:09,792
Yeah, sure.

1112
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:20,498
l come here this morning
thinking l was doing some good...

1113
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:23,844
...and they took my children away
from me.

1114
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:29,483
What kind of people take babies
away from their mothers?

1115
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:34,882
l don't....

1116
01:18:36,725 --> 01:18:38,022
Sorry.

1117
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:39,490
l mean....

1118
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:44,964
l hope-- l hope it works out for you.

1119
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,931
lt's a great idea. Gracie's gonna love it.

1120
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:55,099
-Hi, Gracie.
-Look who's here, Gracie.

1121
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:57,438
Well, hi there, Gracie.

1122
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:59,478
Hey, what do you think?

1123
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:03,311
-They said l should look respectable.
-She looks pretty, doesn't she?

1124
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:06,784
l do feel like my mother.
Maybe l should add more lipstick.

1125
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,982
-You're beautiful, Mom.
-You look-- You look fine.

1126
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,220
-Mom wants to take us to Wyoming.
-Well....

1127
01:19:14,897 --> 01:19:16,296
We could all go.

1128
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:19,459
Gracie, you too. You're invited.

1129
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:22,263
-We could start over.
-We can take Lobo.

1130
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:26,033
She's gonna sell Grandma Lou's house
and buy one in Wyoming.

1131
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:32,408
We're gonna have a ranch house with
cottonwood trees and a pond and a pasture.

1132
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:34,742
We're gonna have a huge garden.

1133
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:37,317
Because we'll grow
all of our own food, right?

1134
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:41,320
Oh, and she says we're gonna have horses.
Arabian horses like Shamire.

1135
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1136
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,056
l know l wasn't a good mother...

1137
01:19:49,098 --> 01:19:52,090
...but like l told the boys, l loved you.

1138
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:55,865
l love all of my children.

1139
01:19:59,141 --> 01:20:01,541
l'm gonna make up for it now.

1140
01:20:03,946 --> 01:20:06,506
Please don't do this.

1141
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:15,182
l'll raise them like l was raised.
My parents were good Christians.

1142
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:19,418
l had a good upbringing. lt's just that
l got a little off track, that's all.

1143
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:22,621
-l'm in a parenting class now.
-You've only attended once.

1144
01:20:22,798 --> 01:20:25,995
Well, that's because l only found out
about it in the end...

1145
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:30,400
...but l'm gonna go
to the next session, l swear.

1146
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:34,301
Judge Marks, this is all a mistake.

1147
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:38,879
l want my kids. l want to give them
a good life. l've always wanted that.

1148
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:42,710
Are you prepared to get a job?
You won't raise them on welfare.

1149
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:46,616
Well, l'm taking it one step at a time.

1150
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:48,879
Thank you.

1151
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:50,786
Thank you.

1152
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:54,823
Will any of the children's fathers
be present here?

1153
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:57,761
Oh, golly, no, no, no.

1154
01:20:57,933 --> 01:21:01,960
No, they owe me way too much
child support. l never had a penny.

1155
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:06,164
But l will tell you that these kids
were conceived in love.

1156
01:21:07,676 --> 01:21:11,271
l understand, but according to the petition
signed by your daughter--

1157
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:13,414
Oh, yes, l read that.

1158
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:17,848
Gracie is a good kid,
but that's all she is is a kid.

1159
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:23,786
lf you don't see me fit to raise the children,
they should go to families that'll help them.

1160
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,654
No one helped them more than l.

1161
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:29,126
Please. l've gone over dozens of reports
from social workers.

1162
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:32,495
They'll tell you l've been the one
that's been responsible...

1163
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:36,764
...for feeding and clothing them.
l get them to school. lt has always been me.

1164
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:39,669
You should know that she has sex
with a boy in the--

1165
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:42,776
-That is not the way it went! He loved me!
-Yes, it is!

1166
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:45,140
-lt is the way it is.
-And l loved him.

1167
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:49,707
Will counsel on both sides please
try to get a grip on your clients?

1168
01:21:49,885 --> 01:21:51,648
Miss Larson.

1169
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:54,812
l'd like to call the children
to the courtroom.

1170
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:58,691
Let's.

1171
01:22:01,997 --> 01:22:05,023
Boys, the judge wants to see you.

1172
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,101
-Come on.
-Come on, Robbie.

1173
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,729
Ryan Walker...

1174
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:14,300
...Jonny Blicker...

1175
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:16,740
...and Robbie Locascio...

1176
01:22:16,912 --> 01:22:20,404
...you've been sworn in,
and l've explained what that means.

1177
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:26,347
Now l'm going to ask each of you
a very hard question.

1178
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:30,651
Ryan, you're the eldest,
so l'm going to ask you first.

1179
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:34,119
Who do you want to live with?

1180
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:47,099
Ode, four, three.

1181
01:22:49,311 --> 01:22:51,541
l love you, Mom.

1182
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:53,510
l will always love you.

1183
01:22:54,783 --> 01:22:58,685
l'm sorry,
but l would rather live with Gracie.

1184
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,014
What?

1185
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:09,792
Well, he's been brainwashed.
Wait, wait, wait.

1186
01:23:09,965 --> 01:23:13,958
-Jonny, what about you?
-Jonny. Jon, Jon, Jon. Now, look at me.

1187
01:23:14,136 --> 01:23:16,468
-Miss Larson!
-Look at your mother.

1188
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:20,241
Clearly, she has-- She's--

1189
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:24,277
She's poisoned them or brainwashed them
to be scared of me...

1190
01:23:24,446 --> 01:23:28,041
-Counsel, l've warned you.
-...and told them that l am bad.

1191
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:34,214
l'm not bad. l'm not bad.
l'm just looking for another chance.

1192
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:39,990
One more chance, please, to be
their mother. Boys, come to me.

1193
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:41,993
Jonny...

1194
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:43,764
...come to me, my babies.

1195
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,933
Boys.

1196
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:50,162
Boys, l know this is going
to be very difficult...

1197
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:52,830
...but ignore what your mother
just said to you.

1198
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:56,042
Just try and stay with your feelings.

1199
01:23:57,045 --> 01:23:58,808
Jonny...

1200
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:00,877
...who do you want to live with?

1201
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:06,285
Your Honor, we've been with Gracie
all our lives.

1202
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:10,289
She feeds us and reads to us...

1203
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:13,724
...and helps us with our lessons.

1204
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:19,594
She fixes us up when we're hurt
and when we're scared.

1205
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:22,430
That's what a mother does, right?

1206
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,539
She changed our diapers
when we were babies.

1207
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:29,175
-Mom, you know that's true.
-Robbie?

1208
01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:32,512
Robbie, what do you say about this?

1209
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:36,742
Robbie, pay attention.
Who do you want to live with?

1210
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:40,217
l would like to live in Wyoming
and ride a horse.

1211
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:43,849
-Wyoming?
-Yeah, it would be fun.

1212
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:46,088
Yeah, yeah.

1213
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:51,358
But l would like to sleep in my own bed
and go home with Gracie.

1214
01:25:00,675 --> 01:25:03,075
l can take care of it.

1215
01:25:05,914 --> 01:25:09,645
l've been with this case
for some time now.

1216
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:15,252
lt seems the children
have finally found some stability.

1217
01:25:15,957 --> 01:25:18,187
l don't want to disrupt that.

1218
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,729
Miss Larson, l know you feel
pain and remorse...

1219
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:25,765
...but it's all coming too late.

1220
01:25:27,502 --> 01:25:29,697
Parental rights are terminated.

1221
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:41,378
ls that--? ls that it?

1222
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:51,557
l can't see my babies anymore?

1223
01:25:55,764 --> 01:25:58,858
You're not my babies anymore?

1224
01:25:59,534 --> 01:26:01,764
Oh, God!

1225
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,876
l love you, my boys. l love you.

1226
01:26:16,485 --> 01:26:21,149
l will always find you.
No matter where you go, l will find you.

1227
01:26:44,112 --> 01:26:46,637
l hope you know
what you're doing today.

1228
01:26:46,815 --> 01:26:49,249
This is a huge thing you're taking on.

1229
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:53,353
There's no turning back.
These will be your children now.

1230
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:55,649
l understand.

1231
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,724
They've always been my children.

1232
01:26:58,126 --> 01:27:00,924
They've never been anyone else's.

1233
01:27:01,596 --> 01:27:03,757
Now, can we blow this joint?

1234
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:11,034
-He means, are we done?
-Almost.

1235
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:13,873
-Diesel, like Vin Diesel.
-That's stupid.

1236
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:16,567
-Potter, like Harry.
-Guys, we gotta get serious.

1237
01:27:16,745 --> 01:27:19,270
We have five minutes
to come up with a last name.

1238
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:21,779
-Lobo.
-That's the cat's name.

1239
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,815
Savage.

1240
01:27:24,386 --> 01:27:26,081
Jonny Savage.

1241
01:27:26,254 --> 01:27:30,122
No, how about Weatherly?

1242
01:27:32,093 --> 01:27:34,425
Because we've been through
bad weather.

1243
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:37,929
-Weatherly. Jonny Weatherly. Okay.
-Okay with me.

1244
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:39,657
All right, Weatherly.

1245
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:45,132
Weatherly, Your Honor.

1246
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:51,812
Ladies and gentlemen of the courtroom,
for the record...

1247
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,608
...l'm happy to present
the Weatherly family.

1248
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:56,546
-Yes.
-Yes.

1249
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:58,185
Gracie Weatherly...

1250
01:27:58,353 --> 01:27:59,980
...Ryan Weatherly...

1251
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,487
-...Jonny Weatherly...
-Yes!

1252
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:04,352
...and Robbie Weatherly.

1253
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:07,393
This is a miracle. lt's a first.

1254
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:10,895
l want to see you guys
when you graduate.

1255
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:13,557
lt's heroic what you're doing.

1256
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:18,263
l wondered, when l was
reading the case...

1257
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:22,536
...if l'd make a mistake by granting this.

1258
01:28:23,445 --> 01:28:27,040
But l know in my heart
l've made the right decision.

1259
01:28:28,617 --> 01:28:33,850
-l just hope you can handle it.
-l will. l can do it.

1260
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:36,013
lt's gonna be hard.

1261
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:39,551
You've got your own little family now.

1262
01:28:39,728 --> 01:28:42,458
You can make it happen.

1263
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:10,680
We are proud to present the Weatherlys!

1264
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,616
