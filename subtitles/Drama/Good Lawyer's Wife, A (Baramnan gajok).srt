1
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:04,443
Well, let's start
with soft targets.

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:06,845
These are reductions you can make

3
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:09,381
without further layoffs
or reorganization.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,720
Is one of them IT?

5
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:16,354
Why don't you just tell us?

6
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:18,356
Certainly. Annually,

7
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:20,525
you spend $10,
000 on paper products.

8
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:22,194
Cups. You're kidding.

9
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,395
We would suggest moving

10
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:25,397
to a self-policing
hydration policy.

11
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,734
You spend $38,000

12
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:31,002
on season tickets
to the Chicago Cubs.

13
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,804
Yeah, but that's good business.

14
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:33,939
We entertain clients.

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,373
We would suggest season tickets

16
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:37,242
for a less expensive
sport franchise,

17
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:38,977
the Chicago Red Stars.

18
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:40,779
The...?

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,013
Professional women's soccer.

20
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,950
We got to cut somewhere.

21
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:46,818
The floral budget for
the firm is $28,000.

22
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:49,387
Yup. Cut somewhere.

23
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:50,756
We would suggest moving

24
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:52,224
to perennials or going artificial.

25
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,460
We also suggest you no
longer validate for parking.

26
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,963
The self-policing

27
00:00:57,964 --> 00:01:01,500
hydration policy would be
presented as going green

28
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,934
with fact sheets
posted next to coolers

29
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:04,903
on reducing landfills.

30
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:12,144
Hello.

31
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,912
Oh, it's...

32
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:15,480
Uh, hi. Is, uh...?

33
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,583
Uh, no. Alicia left
her phone at home.

34
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:20,852
Oh.

35
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,822
You want to leave a message?

36
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:26,158
No. She's with another lawyer.

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,160
I'll try him. Thanks.

38
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:31,730
Okay.

39
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,005
Good morning.

40
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,439
Dorfman & Associates.

41
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,875
Sorry, we don't have our
phones in yet, Mr. Gardner.

42
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,177
Let me tell Alicia.

43
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:46,678
Mr. Gardner wants you
to start without him.

44
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,114
Thanks. Can you get us coffee?

45
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:51,383
Partners offices here.

46
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:52,784
Conference room there.

47
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:53,919
Waiting room.

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,221
I think this is some
kind of flowing thing.

49
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,289
What is it?

50
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,590
A glassed-in waterfall.

51
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,758
My daughter's the designer.

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,193
We have the drywall in next week.

53
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:03,695
Wow. No longer a
mom-and-pop operation, huh?

54
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,197
Last time we saw you,
it was in a storefront.

55
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:07,132
Not quite Stern, Lockhart,
but we're on our way.

56
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,333
You're walking through a wall.

57
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,501
Oh. Sorry.

58
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:11,236
We heard Stern,
Lockhart was in trouble.

59
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:12,537
Tammy.

60
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,306
No. We've had a few layoffs,
but we're steady now.

61
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:16,107
Where's all the money coming from?

62
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,342
Insider trading.

63
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:18,643
Dad's joking.

64
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:20,178
New corporate clients and

65
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,980
a depressed retail market.

66
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,381
What's this?

67
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,685
The world's 14 highest peaks.

68
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:29,487
Annapurna, Broad Peak, Makalu.

69
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:30,522
You climbed these?

70
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:31,690
Two left. Dad's hobby.

71
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:33,124
I don't know how it happened--

72
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,060
the outdoorsman sired a homebody.

73
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:38,230
So, shall we join suits?

74
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,065
I'm all right if we
combine lawsuits,

75
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,499
but we really need to combine.

76
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,634
No stabbing in the back.

77
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:43,835
You represent

78
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:46,004
the union employees,
we represent the nonunion.

79
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:47,505
Yeah. You have
something written up?

80
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:48,673
Over a handshake.

81
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,841
That's how I do everything.

82
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:51,243
We're junior associates.

83
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,544
We do everything in writing.

84
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:53,812
Okay.

85
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,046
Federal agents!

86
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,681
Put your hands on your head now!

87
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,416
All right, spread out.
Everything goes--

88
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,051
computers, files,

89
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:02,387
every box. Come on, Rivers.

90
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:03,688
This is harassment.

91
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,257
No, Eric. This is an arrest.

92
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:06,524
For what?

93
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:07,525
What did I do?

94
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:08,593
Maybe you didn't hear.

95
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,795
Hands on your head. Ma'am. Hey!

96
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:11,763
Come on. These are my lawyers.

97
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:13,231
They'll have me out in 24 hours.

98
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:14,733
Not this time. Okay, okay.

99
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:16,201
What's the charge
this time, Rivers?

100
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,235
First degree murder.

101
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:19,871
Who did I kill?

102
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:21,373
Kelli Gerber Smith.

103
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:22,641
Oh, come on, you lost a case.

104
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:24,509
When I lose a case,
I don't go pee on your lawn.

105
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,844
She was innocent,

106
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:28,079
and you gave her over to that scum.

107
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,384
Hey, that's ours.

108
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:35,387
Sir, we are lawyers with Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner.

109
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:36,888
We are not employees of this firm.

110
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,356
And we do not grant you permission

111
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:39,557
to confiscate our work product.

112
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,493
Well, given that I
can't distinguish

113
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:43,128
between work product in the field,

114
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,462
I'll segregate the files, and

115
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,564
you can get a court order
to have them returned.

116
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,767
Well... No.

117
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:54,906
What's his name?

118
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,174
AUSA Rivers.

119
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:57,309
It's federal.

120
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,910
I don't know the
cast of characters.

121
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,745
These are my lawyers.
They'll have me out in 24 hours.

122
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,013
What's he saying? ALICIA:
He telling them

123
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:03,114
that we're his lawyers,

124
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,216
and we will get him
out in 24 hours.

125
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:06,251
Uh, you led him to believe that?

126
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:07,452
No.

127
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:09,421
No. We were there on
the furlough lawsuit.

128
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:12,190
The metro suit.
We decided to marry union

129
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,325
and nonunion.

130
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,592
So why did Dorfman get arrested

131
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:15,660
for murder?

132
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:16,761
Well, Dorfman was defending

133
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:18,663
a drug dealer,
and there was this witness

134
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:19,898
testifying for the prosecution,

135
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,666
a Kelli Gerber Smith.

136
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,001
Supposedly, Dorfman gave her name

137
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,804
to his client, the drug dealer,
who then had her killed.

138
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,239
Who was the drug dealer?

139
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,808
LeMond Bishop.

140
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:34,713
Bishop's one of Dorfman's clients?

141
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,882
Uh, he wanted us to take
over his ongoing cases,

142
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,317
just while he's being held.

143
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:41,152
He doesn't have his
staff lined up yet.

144
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,455
He also wants us to
argue for his release.

145
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:47,492
He can pay us. It's a drug case.

146
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,794
First things the Feds will
do is freeze his assets.

147
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:53,698
He can pay us when
they're unfrozen.

148
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:58,803
He seemed good.

149
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,940
Yeah. We'll take it under review.

150
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:05,176
What was that about?

151
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,645
Either they don't like him,
or the rumors are true--

152
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:10,982
Stern, Lockhart's going down.

153
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,319
Oh, damn it.

154
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,921
And I have student loans.

155
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:18,990
Alicia?

156
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:19,824
Your husband.

157
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:21,326
Yeah, at least

158
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,528
you have someone to fall back on.

159
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:25,697
No, no. No, it's nothing.

160
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:27,399
I just can't find the tax returns.

161
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,500
And why do you need them?

162
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,534
You know Eli.

163
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:30,602
He needs to look

164
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:32,404
into anything that can
be used against us.

165
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:33,571
Uh-huh. Uh,

166
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:34,906
under my bed

167
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,075
in a box marked,
I think, house files.

168
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,243
Good. Thanks.

169
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,811
How are you doing?

170
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:41,980
Well, I was almost got
arrested this morning.

171
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,415
You... What?

172
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,283
Do you know an AUSA named Rivers?

173
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:46,384
Yeah.

174
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:48,553
Very intense guy.
Out to save the world.

175
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:49,687
Why, what happened?

176
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,156
He was arresting
this other lawyer...

177
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:53,024
It's a long story, but I almost
got caught up in the sweep.

178
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,225
He's a zealot.

179
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:55,827
Never look a zealot in the eyes.

180
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:57,395
How are you?

181
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:58,730
Good.

182
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,231
I made a BLT.

183
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,267
I'm very proud of myself.

184
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,868
You know, this is the closest

185
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,637
we've had to a normal conversation.

186
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,505
Yeah. I like it.

187
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:10,075
Maybe we should talk
on the phone more.

188
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,012
Speaking of which,
you left your cell phone here.

189
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,713
Will called.

190
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:18,149
Yeah.

191
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,453
He already got in touch.

192
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:24,189
Okay, back to work.

193
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,324
Back to work.

194
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:08,066
I say judges are skins this time.

195
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:15,607
Hello.

196
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,842
Mr. Gardner, AUSA Rivers.

197
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,978
That's okay. We won't
hold it against you.

198
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,513
Suit up.

199
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:22,747
You phoned.

200
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,449
You wanted your work product back.

201
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,217
Yeah, but at my office.

202
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:27,585
This is a friendly County game.

203
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:30,155
You're thinking about
taking the Dorfman case.

204
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:32,290
We would advise against it.

205
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:35,560
Really? And what else
would you advise?

206
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,762
Mr. Gardner,
you're having money issues.

207
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:40,498
You can't afford troubles
with the federal courts.

208
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,269
Wow.

209
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,204
This is like the movies.

210
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,940
You have to threaten me
with an audit or something.

211
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:50,608
Oh, that's the IRS.

212
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:54,078
It would be a federal crime
to influence the IRS.

213
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,481
Guys, I'm being
threatened over here.

214
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,815
Can you believe it?

215
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,951
Ooh... Poor baby.

216
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:03,188
Mr. Dorfman is in trouble.

217
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,624
He is guilty,
and his assets are frozen.

218
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,626
It would be a mistake

219
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,662
to represent him.

220
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,363
Too late. I already am.

221
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:14,332
As of when?

222
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,000
As of ten seconds ago.

223
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,535
Congratulations, Rivers.

224
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,971
You just won Dorfman an attorney.

225
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:30,343

226
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,083
<i>This is how it works.</i>

227
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,686
Germs enter the
political bloodstream

228
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:45,454
via anonymous Twitter accounts.

229
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,790
These are picked up by
political blogs that...

230
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,226
I'm going to drop that metaphor.

231
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,395
Why? No. No. Keep going.
See where it takes you.

232
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:55,965
There's an anonymous Twitter
account out there-- Upriser7.

233
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:58,601
It's saying things
about you and Alicia.

234
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:02,571
Well, isn't that, uh,
to be expected?

235
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:05,441
Some of them are true.

236
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,411
Like what?

237
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:11,714
"Saint Alicia, as she's called
behind her back, is despised

238
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:14,016
"because of her close
connection to boss, Will.

239
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,452
Widely hated,
she's given all best cases."

240
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,054
Are we saying that's true?

241
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:20,823
"Alicia and Peter sleep
in separate rooms.

242
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:22,625
"He is in maids quarters.

243
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,161
She's in the master.
Not even a real marriage."

244
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:30,166
So, the danger is that it'll
be picked by a political blog,

245
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,534
and then move into the mainstream.

246
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:34,070
I mean, I can reduce the
damage by flooding the zone

247
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,138
with bogus tweets
that say the opposite.

248
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:38,140
Any search engine will
be overwhelmed by both.

249
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:39,608
Wait a minute.

250
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:43,646
Who knew that we are
in separate rooms?

251
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:47,817
There's also stuff about Mrs.
Florrick's work,

252
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,352
her competition for a job,

253
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,087
and her connection with her boss.

254
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:52,188
What did that one say?

255
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,489
You don't want to read it.

256
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,857
That she's sleeping with him.

257
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,098
All right.

258
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,967
Let's find out who's
sending these tweets.

259
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,641
Thank you, Mr. Gardner.

260
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,710
My father is just so thankful.

261
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:15,978
No problem.

262
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,179
We'll see what we can do.

263
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,886
Yup.

264
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,287
Not my playground.

265
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:27,123
All rise.

266
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:31,160
Mr. Rivers, what do we have today?

267
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,661
Several motions on Eric
Dorfman, Your Honor.

268
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,497
And I'm sorry to hear
about your accident.

269
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,365
Thank you. I got your card.

270
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:40,036
I imagine you're seeking
detention pending trial?

271
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:40,936
Yes, Your Honor.

272
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,104
Mr. Dorfman, in our opinion,

273
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:43,606
released a witness
list to a killer,

274
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,107
and given that there will be

275
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,442
vulnerable witnesses in this case,

276
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:48,244
we ask for pretrial detention.

277
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:50,780
Your Honor, this is a
simple case of harassment.

278
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:53,682
AUSA Rivers failed to convict
LeMond Bishop on RICO charges

279
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,051
and is now going after

280
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,519
his lawyer as retribution.

281
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,054
In your opinion?

282
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:00,089
Excuse me?

283
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,023
In your opinion?

284
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,491
Yes, in my opinion.

285
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:05,027
He's trying to subvert the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.

286
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,496
Mr. Gardner is prone to
hyperbole, Your Honor.

287
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:09,932
Kelli Gerber Smith offered
to testify against

288
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,535
one of the most dangerous
kingpins in this country,

289
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:13,836
and in our opinion,

290
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:15,304
was brutally tortured and murdered

291
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,807
for her troubles. Your Honor,

292
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:20,109
the prosecution's
evidence is thin at best.

293
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,179
Generic carpet fibers
found on the body,

294
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,981
access to a witness list.

295
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:27,817
That hardly makes Eric
Dorfman suspect number one.

296
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:28,884
In your opinion.

297
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,353
Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

298
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,923
I thought it was obvious,
when I speak, it's my opinion,

299
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:35,291
and when he speaks, it's his.

300
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:37,526
Oh, boy.

301
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:38,561
Mister...?

302
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,162
Gardner, Your Honor.

303
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:41,997
It is equally obvious
that I'm a judge,

304
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:44,366
and yet you continually
refer to me as "Your Honor."

305
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,936
All I ask is that you do
the same with your opinion,

306
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:49,071
and remind yourself and the court

307
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,406
that it is in fact your opinion.

308
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:57,580
Your Honor, if I could
return to the facts.

309
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,415
Mr. Dorfman was one of four
people to hold the witness list

310
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,517
that was sealed
under a court order.

311
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:03,719
There were carpet
fibers found on the tarp

312
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,954
covering Ms. Smith's body

313
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:07,957
that came directly from Mr.
Dorfman's law firm.

314
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,227
And in our opinion, he was the
only one with anything to gain

315
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,461
if her name got out.

316
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,296
This is a vindictive prosecution

317
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,298
and should be treated as such.

318
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,700
In my opinion.

319
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:18,901
The court disagrees, Mr. Gardner,

320
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,936
and orders pretrial detention.

321
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:23,038
I'll see you both
back here on Wednesday

322
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,673
at 9:00 a.m. for pretrial motions.

323
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:27,176
<i> It's their courtyard,</i>

324
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,011
you play by their rules.
They're so cocky.

325
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:30,212
It's just another courtroom,

326
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:32,081
and they treat it like St. Peter's.

327
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,216
<i>Didn't we agree to not take this?</i>

328
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,285
No, we agreed to cut the
flowers and paper cups.

329
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:38,420
The least I can do is
take the cases I want.

330
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,889
You sure this isn't pride?

331
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,457
Of course, it's pride.
What's wrong with pride?

332
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,658
Pride built the pyramids.

333
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,460
And Watergate.

334
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,362
God, those do look fake.

335
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,631
Those are the real ones.

336
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,734
Okay, four people had
access to that witness list.

337
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,702
Find out who they were,
where it went.

338
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,871
Rivers, the court clerk,
Dorfman, the judge.

339
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:56,972
Good.

340
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,441
Now, did they or anyone
around them leak it?

341
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:01,877
Also let's look at the
prosecution's assumptions:

342
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,879
the witness in this
original case...

343
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,014
Kelli Gerber Smith.

344
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,782
Are we sure she was
even actually murdered

345
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:08,117
due to the case?

346
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:09,985
And if she was, did the killers
really need the witness list

347
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,287
to know she was going to testify?

348
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,788
How do we find that out?

349
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:14,089
Go to Bishop.

350
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,960
You want to go ask a drug kingpin

351
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:20,529
whether he really needed a
witness list to kill somebody?

352
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:22,965
Well, there's probably
a better way to put it.

353
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,833
But in theory,
he wants his lawyer out, too,

354
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,802
and if he could help
steer us towards evidence

355
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:28,537
that would exonerate Dorfman,
that'd be good.

356
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,439
You up for it?

357
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,107
Sure.

358
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:43,485
Uh, excuse me.

359
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,287
Mr. Bishop?

360
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:48,624
So you're my lawyer's lawyer?

361
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,292
Actually, she is.

362
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:51,527
Arms out, ladies.

363
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:52,928
It's all right.

364
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,430
The lawyers are on our side.
Didn't you hear, Tony?

365
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,698
When we were picking sides,

366
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:58,167
they got the cops;
we got the lawyers.

367
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:00,703
Beautiful horses.

368
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:01,870
They're not mine.

369
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,672
Rich people need
places to board them.

370
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:05,608
One of your legit businesses?

371
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,576
Hey, I'm all legit these days.

372
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,712
Isn't that right? TONY: It is.

373
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:11,080
So you wanted help with Dorfman?

374
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,281
Good.

375
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:13,449
I like him.

376
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,817
Did he show you his
rock collection?

377
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:15,851
I think he just picked

378
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:17,386
those rocks up off the street.

379
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,421
Guy has these rocks from the top
peaks from around the world.

380
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:21,657
Everest? No, not that one yet.

381
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,127
Mountain climbing never
made much sense to me.

382
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:27,296
Bunch of idiots who just
need something to do.

383
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:29,865
But he's a good lawyer.

384
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,300
And lucky.

385
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,669
We didn't even have to go to
trial with that witness dying.

386
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,838
You mean being murdered.

387
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,177
Mr. Dorfman has been accused

388
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:43,679
of leaking the witness's identity,

389
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,381
allowing you to murder her.

390
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,151
Well, as I'm sure you're aware,

391
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:51,487
he didn't do that because
I didn't do that.

392
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,188
Right.

393
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,523
But if you could steer us

394
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:55,958
in the direction of
what really happened,

395
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,760
I think that could help Mr.
Dorfman.

396
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:59,361
"What really happened"?

397
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:02,931
Is there some evidence

398
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:05,801
that points to the murder
happening for other reasons?

399
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:08,737
Reasons that didn't
require the witness list.

400
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:13,042
I own a chain of six
sporting good stores,

401
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,611
four restaurants, ten dry cleaners.

402
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:16,779
I am a businessman.

403
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,814
So I don't want you
making the same mistake

404
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,316
as the government,

405
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:23,786
thinking that, because of the
color of my skin, I sell drugs.

406
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:27,823
Because that would be racism,
wouldn't it?

407
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:34,730
Well, this is an exciting day.

408
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,799
You wanted to come.

409
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,068
So...

410
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,903
here's the thing.

411
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,104
I won't say much,

412
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,505
I won't answer questions,

413
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:45,641
but Bishop likes Mr. Dorfman,

414
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,743
thinks he got a raw deal.
We do, too.

415
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:52,114
Rivers found the black SUV
that carried this dead witness.

416
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:54,917
Unfortunately, this SUV was
never meant to be discovered,

417
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:58,554
so it may not be as
clean as one would hope.

418
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,958
Was Dorfman ever in this SUV?

419
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:07,029
Again, if there is any
attempt to subpoena

420
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,466
or question myself or Mr.
Bishop, we will deny this.

421
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,968
But Rivers found the
SUV two weeks ago,

422
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,604
right after the murder,
and he's kept it under wraps ever since.

423
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:17,239
Why?

424
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,674
Keep it out of your hands.

425
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,642
Surprise you at trial.

426
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:23,445
We would advise you to
fight its inclusion.

427
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,315
Talk about a pact with the devil.

428
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:29,218
We're taking trial
advice from killers.

429
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,352
Objection, Your Honor.

430
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:33,422
This SUV was kept
from us intentionally.

431
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,124
The only reason the court
knows about it at all

432
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,325
is because we brought it up.

433
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:37,760
It should be thrown out.

434
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,161
I'll give you some leeway,
Rivers. Go ahead.

435
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:41,630
In addition, Your Honor,

436
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,198
we discovered an impression

437
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,667
made on the console from
a hastily written note--

438
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:46,969
"Gerbre."

439
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,203
This of course

440
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,538
was the middle name of the victim,

441
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,674
and as you can see the last
two letters were inverted.

442
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:55,611
This clearly matches

443
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,080
the accidental inversion
made on the witness list.

444
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,248
We submit it into evidence.

445
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,749
Objection!

446
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,584
Again, Your Honor, this evidence

447
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:04,386
was intentionally withheld from us,

448
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:06,288
summarily removed from
all exhibit lists,

449
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:08,157
and should be excluded.

450
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:09,258
In your opinion.

451
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,926
Yes, in my opinion.

452
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,895
While Mr. Gardner and
his white-shoe firm

453
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:15,597
may have the resources to
process evidence expeditiously,

454
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:18,100
<i>in our opinion, Your Honor,</i>

455
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,035
the federal government does not.

456
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:23,238
Not according to your
own lab's time stamp.

457
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:26,375
In my opinion, Mr.
Rivers was holding on

458
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,377
to this key discovery evidence
for weeks, Your Honor,

459
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,946
lying to this court about
its very existence.

460
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,548
Mr. Gardner is working
with old information,

461
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,349
in our opinion.

462
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,918
I would submit this revision

463
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,519
of the evidence room stamp.
Objection.

464
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,321
I'll accept. Continue, Rivers.

465
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:41,256
Thank you. I would like to name...

466
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:42,791
Excuse me, Your Honor, I objected.

467
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,026
Yes, I know, Mr. Gardner,

468
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,295
and I accepted Mr.
Rivers' evidence.

469
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,063
Yes, but you failed to rule.

470
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,499
My ruling is implicit, Mr. Gardner.

471
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,967
Now, sit down.

472
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:53,101
No, it isn't, Your Honor.

473
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:55,904
And I will sit down when you rule.

474
00:17:57,674 --> 00:18:00,809
Would you like to be held
in contempt, Mr. Gardner?

475
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,977
No, I would not, Your Honor,

476
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,745
but I would like a
ruling on my objection.

477
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:05,681
You are trying my patience...

478
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:08,750
I understand that, Your Honor,
but we both know

479
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,052
if you don't use the proper

480
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:11,954
form of "sustained" or "overruled,"

481
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,222
the matter can't later be appealed.

482
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,790
And I was surprised

483
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,692
in reviewing your past court cases,

484
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,228
how often you encouraged
lawyers to move on

485
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:21,497
without actually ruling,
therefore avoided having

486
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:23,398
your nonrulings
overturned on appeal.

487
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,602
In my opinion.

488
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,837
Mr. Gardner, I have

489
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:31,440
never been quite so offended

490
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,609
in all my years on the bench.

491
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,578
I understand that, Your Honor,
but I still want a ruling.

492
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,080
A ruling I can appeal.

493
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,817
Your Honor,

494
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:44,152
this evidence is necessary
for our prosecution.

495
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:46,922
A conviction is necessary
for your prosecution.

496
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:48,123
That doesn't make it
a worthy argument.

497
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,625
One hour for lunch. Your Honor...

498
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:51,593
I said, one hour for lunch.

499
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,867
What the hell was that?

500
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,869
Do you have a map?
Do I have a what?

501
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,938
A map so I can show
you where you live.

502
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:05,073
That, my friend,
was a Chicago defense.

503
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:07,643
Get used to it.

504
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,429
Even if the judge kicks the SUV,

505
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,730
which given my
courtroom performance,

506
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,931
isn't all that likely...

507
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,833
Although fun....
we still need to undercut

508
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,768
the carpet fibers
from Dorfman's office.

509
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,505
That's the only thing
that ties him to the body.

510
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,773
Dorfman's carpet is US Taupe Dream.

511
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,876
It's one of the most common
in the country. Good.

512
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,577
Anything on the witness list? Yeah.

513
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,913
Two other prosecutors in Rivers'
office had access to it.

514
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,448
They were listed on
the initial filing

515
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:42,883
before Rivers took over the case.

516
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,985
I'm data-mining them now to find

517
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,820
any connection with Bishop's crew.

518
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,356
All right, Cary,
you stay on the carpet.

519
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:50,757
And, Kalinda,
you stay on the data-mining.

520
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,859
And, uh...

521
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,061
I'll go back to my office.

522
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,737
Yes, I do have a home. Good.

523
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:06,306
Maybe you should try using it.

524
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:07,541
Interesting case?

525
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,742
Yes.

526
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,644
May I help you, Mr. Gold?

527
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:14,514
"Saint Alicia is not just
sleeping with her boss, she is

528
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:16,349
also using him to get promoted."

529
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,118
Upriser7-- a tweet.

530
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,153
About, uh, two hours ago.

531
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:22,489
About me? Yes. And Peter.

532
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,857
But mostly you.

533
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,325
At first,

534
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:27,427
I thought it was intended to derail

535
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:28,862
Peter's campaign, but then

536
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:32,065
I realized, no... it's about you.

537
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,134
We're just collateral damage.

538
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:35,869
This is on the Internet? Yes.

539
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,372
And Ben Smith just linked to
it as part of a remainder item,

540
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,575
so it may get wider play.

541
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,510
Please excuse the melodrama,

542
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:47,714
but do you think there's anybody
here who's got it out for you?

543
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,486
Young guy, 12:00?

544
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,088
But would he know that

545
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,691
you and Peter are
in separate rooms?

546
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,959
That's in here?

547
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,227
Even mentions the name

548
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,229
of the moving company
that put the bed in.

549
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,365
"Saint Alicia" doesn't
sound like him.

550
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:07,300
That's the thing
about the Internet.

551
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,669
Nobody sounds like they seem.

552
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,075
Hi.

553
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:17,010
Want to make a call, Mrs. Florrick?

554
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:18,945
No, um, I just...

555
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,414
It's...

556
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,285
You know the movers

557
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:28,088
who came out last week to put in the bed?
Your apartment? Yes.

558
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,590
Is there any way Cary
could've heard about that?

559
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:33,059
Heard the movers
put in another bed?

560
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,762
Yes. No.

561
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:37,530
No, I don't mean on purpose.

562
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:40,967
I'm discreet, Mrs.
Florrick. Yes, of course.

563
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,869
It's not... it's just,
you know, the Bluetooth.

564
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,404
Sometimes you can be

565
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,973
near someone...

566
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,475
Never mind. Forget it.

567
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:22,375
Yes, hello. Um, can you stop Mr.
Gold from leaving?

568
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,577
I think he left...

569
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,114
My mistake. Uh, never mind.

570
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,314
Kalinda.

571
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,083
What's up?

572
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,651
Can you come into my office?

573
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,388
Certainly, ma'am.

574
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,256
Can you look inside that bag?

575
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,963
Wow.

576
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,832
Where did that come from?

577
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,000
I have no idea.

578
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,075
$200,000 and the vague
whiff of marijuana.

579
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,247
What did you say to him? Bishop?

580
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,949
Nothing. We just asked
about the murder.

581
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,150
What's up?

582
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,185
And why does it smell
like a frat house in here?

583
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:40,820
Oh.

584
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:43,957
Bishop?

585
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,325
Our best guess.

586
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:47,527
I'll make the call.

587
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,497
It's your retainer.

588
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:52,399
I didn't know you were hiring.

589
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,900
I'm not.

590
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,268
I need new lawyers.

591
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:59,806
Don't you already
have representation?

592
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,775
In jail.

593
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,443
I need someone now.

594
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:04,611
Business is piling up.

595
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,379
This is a bit unorthodox.

596
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,081
We represent your current lawyer.

597
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:10,450
Yes. My experience
is lawyers are good

598
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:12,986
at making the unorthodox orthodox.

599
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,287
Why us?

600
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,290
One of my aides saw him in court.

601
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,760
I was off-script.

602
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,128
Nice touch bringing the black guy.

603
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:25,432
For your information,
I'm an equity partner.

604
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,133
Where you from?

605
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,135
None of your business.

606
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,372
I have a corporation,

607
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,874
a large one,

608
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,276
with a lot of employees.

609
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:38,445
And they sometimes
get into trouble.

610
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,814
I need a firm to look after
their interests and mine.

611
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:43,283
Help me make the best financial

612
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,452
and legal decisions.

613
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:48,188
I pay well. I pay on time.

614
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:50,890
And I help those who help me.

615
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:57,063
You have a DUI involving
the Baja Fund CEO.

616
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,399
I could tell you things that would

617
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,501
help you with the
arresting officer.

618
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,446
I met your husband once.

619
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,048
Taller than I expected.

620
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,417
Yes, he is tall.

621
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,419
Electronic monitoring's
a bitch, isn't it?

622
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,454
They don't validate.

623
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:22,856
How can they not validate?

624
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,090
They're going to argue about this,

625
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:25,325
then they're going to say "yes."

626
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:27,527
Maybe. No. No "maybe""

627
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:31,264
Money makes things predictable,
so here's your signing bonus:

628
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,568
This Rivers-- I have something.

629
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,270
It isn't the same
as Sheffrin-Marks.

630
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,339
You don't even believe that.
How's it different?

631
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,208
You know how many kids died
from their asthma medicine?

632
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,877
Oh, my God, the sophistry
here is just blinding.

633
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:45,979
Sheffrin-Marks has white
employees in suits.

634
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,514
Bishop's crew has
African-American men...

635
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:49,549
Don't try to sell this
on the back of racism!

636
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,651
Sheffrin-Marks didn't set
out to murder anyone.

637
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,820
Shane Marx, Paul Din,

638
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,622
Johnathan Graham-- all murderers.

639
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:56,990
Accused murderers.

640
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,758
Now who's the sophist?

641
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,127
We're not in a court of law, Diane.

642
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:02,462
It's just you and me.

643
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:04,264
We represent murderers.

644
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:05,398
We get them off.

645
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,333
No. We keep the courts honest.

646
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,769
And why shouldn't the courts
be kept honest about Bishop?

647
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,237
Everybody deserves representation.

648
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,139
Does that stop suddenly
when it comes to...

649
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,274
A criminal organization

650
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:16,042
whose sole purpose is to sell drugs

651
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,278
and to murder to control territory?

652
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,713
Sure. Put it any way you want,
it's still a true statement.

653
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:26,152
We're doing this for the money.

654
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,654
Of course we are.

655
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:28,955
We're not a charity.

656
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:32,058
We do this or we lay off
half of Acquisitions.

657
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,927
That's ten lawyers
and ten families.

658
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,862
Not to mention your season tickets.

659
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm sorry.

660
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:44,270
He gave a parting piece of
information about Rivers.

661
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,371
What?

662
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,807
Rivers was sleeping
with Kelli Gerber Smith,

663
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,776
the murdered witness.

664
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,435
Objection, Your Honor. Overruled.

665
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,937
How's that, Mr. Gardner?
Do you approve of that?

666
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,338
I do. Thank you, Your Honor.

667
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,407
So, if there are no
more pretrial motions

668
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:08,142
maybe we can move this along.

669
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:09,610
Actually, the defense

670
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,746
requests that AUSA
Rivers be disqualified

671
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:13,347
as prosecution's representative.

672
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,515
On what grounds?

673
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:16,250
That's my question, Mr. Rivers.

674
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,853
Yes, Your Honor.
On what grounds, Mr. Gardner?

675
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:22,256
Your Honor, this is a signed
affidavit from the clerk

676
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:25,993
at the Lake Avenue Motel
saying that Mr. Rivers

677
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,461
spent the night with
Kelli Gerber Smith

678
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:29,797
on nine occasions.

679
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,799
Uh...

680
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,001
Relevance, Your Honor?

681
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,170
Your Honor,
do I even need to respond?

682
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,072
Is this true, Counselor?

683
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,708
Uh, Your Honor...

684
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,643
Answer the question, Mr. Rivers.

685
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,346
Yes.

686
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:48,449
But I assure Your Honor that
it will in no way affect

687
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,152
my ability to prosecute this case.

688
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:52,887
Motion denied, Mr. Gardner.

689
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,221
However,

690
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:57,491
I am reconsidering the SUV.

691
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:02,663
How did you find that out?

692
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,098
How? Inside source.

693
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,733
Too bad it didn't
disqualify Rivers.

694
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:08,269
We didn't want it to. It undercut
the judge's trust in Rivers

695
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,538
and got her to kick the SUV.

696
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,073
Cary.

697
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,241
Do you have a second?

698
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,076
Sure. What's up?

699
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,146
Are you tweeting about me?

700
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:21,549
Am I tweeting about you?

701
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,651
Are you Upriser7?

702
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,019
What are you talking about?

703
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,022
Someone's gossiping
online about me.

704
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,724
And you thought it was me?

705
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,561
Yeah.

706
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:36,230
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's good
to be working with you, too.

707
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:44,972
Hello?

708
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,274
In here, hon.

709
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:49,610
How was work?

710
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:51,846
Where's...?

711
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,180
In the shower. Kids are in bed.

712
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,615
I let them watch a little TV.

713
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:58,385
<i>Have you ever seen When
a Stranger Calls?</i>

714
00:28:58,386 --> 00:28:59,887
The movie?

715
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:02,456
A long time ago. Hmm.

716
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,625
We just traced the IP address

717
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:05,926
for the last anonymous tweet.

718
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,761
And?

719
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,897
It's coming from inside the house.

720
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,934
No, just a bit of an emergency.

721
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:16,403
Rivers found another
way to get the SUV in.

722
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,005
Through the GPS.

723
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,307
So I'll need you to come in. Sorry.

724
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:21,408
No, it's all right.

725
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:22,877
Um, I'll probably be half an hour.

726
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:24,044
Great. Thanks.

727
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:26,247
No problem.

728
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:28,249
Is that Will?

729
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,618
Yes. I have to go back in.

730
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,453
So what do you think?

731
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:33,954
I don't know.

732
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,258
Maybe one of them is angry.

733
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:39,059
Either about me running again or...

734
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,795
Or me at work. Yeah.

735
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:45,332
Do you really think it's possible
that our children would do that?

736
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,268
It's crazy, Peter.

737
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,371
Maybe someone was using our
Wi-Fi without us knowing?

738
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,339
Eli's checking it.

739
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,008
But we still have to talk to them.

740
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,976
I'll do it.

741
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:57,745
Tomorrow.

742
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:04,952
All-nighter?

743
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,887
No, just a few more hours.

744
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:12,226
I found condoms in
your bedside table.

745
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,967
I was looking for
your letter opener.

746
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,769
I thought maybe they
belonged to Zach.

747
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,470
You know, you found
them in his room.

748
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,406
But then I thought,
you wouldn't take them.

749
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,709
You'd have a sensible conversation
with him about responsibility.

750
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,711
So then, I thought they were yours.

751
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,980
But that didn't make sense
because you have an IUD.

752
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,282
I had it removed.

753
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:37,751
Oh, really?

754
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,153
So condoms do make sense?

755
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:40,754
They do.

756
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:43,791
For who?

757
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,435
Check it, Peter.

758
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,237
I said I was looking for your letter opener.
I have other drawers, too.

759
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:58,639
Did you check these ones?

760
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,341
I said that I was looking...
How about over here?

761
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,977
Did you check this drawer?
What is it you need to hear from me?

762
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:04,278
I will never touch
another woman again.

763
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,747
What do you want, a prize, Peter?

764
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:08,515
It seems to be the
minimum prerequisite.

765
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,250
For both of us.

766
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:14,989
Then trust me.

767
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,459
Then don't go to work tonight.

768
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,309
Trust me.

769
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,585
But the GPS isn't the same
as the SUV in our opinion.

770
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:45,853
It's contained in the SUV

771
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,721
in my opinion. RIVERS:
But the data is separate

772
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,723
and tracked through satellite imaging...
Which is only accessed

773
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,692
through the SUV,
which was thrown out!

774
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:53,661
Your Honor, the GPS shows

775
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,829
this SUV drove right from Mr.
Dorfman's office

776
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,264
to the site where
the body was dumped

777
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:58,565
on the night of the murder.

778
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,601
You have no proof my
client was in the SUV

779
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,202
or at his office at those times!

780
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,338
This isn't about Mr.
Dorfman pulling the trigger.

781
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,973
We don't need to prove that,
Your Honor,

782
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,441
in our opinion. This is about

783
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,710
whether or not he was complicit
in the witness' death.

784
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:12,579
And the inference is that...
Was the GPS factory installed?

785
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,682
What? I don't know.

786
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,250
How is that relevant, Mr. Gardner?

787
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:19,086
If the GPS was installed at the factory,
it should be considered

788
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:22,122
part of the automobile regardless
of whether or not the tracking

789
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:24,024
information was pulled
from satellite technology.

790
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,426
The GPS was manufactured

791
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:27,294
by Botheon, Incorporated,
Your Honor.

792
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,395
Not General Motors.

793
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:30,130
A separate corporate entity

794
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,465
that uses separate satellites

795
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:32,766
that gather information.

796
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,401
Therefore, we should
be able to introduce

797
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,236
this information into evidence.

798
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,638
Overruled, Mr. Gardner.

799
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,907
The GPS data is
allowed into evidence.

800
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,811
<i>We're still looking for ways
to undercut the GPS,</i>

801
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:45,612
but we need to know:

802
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,815
Were you at your law
office that night?

803
00:32:47,816 --> 00:32:49,483
The night of the murder? Yes.

804
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,618
But you didn't

805
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,887
talk to or see any
of the Bishop crew?

806
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,889
No.

807
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,558
Then why were they at your office?

808
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,827
Because this GPS has
them at your office.

809
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,328
I don't know. They could've been

810
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:02,529
parked there for all we know.

811
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,665
All "we" know? Who's we?

812
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,899
We.

813
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,569
Dad and me.

814
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,670
You were there?

815
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,605
Yes.

816
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,611
Okay, we'll try to do what
we can to undercut the GPS.

817
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:20,347
Thanks. Mrs. Florrick.

818
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:22,149
Could you stay a minute?

819
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:25,085
No, Tammy. We're fine.

820
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,397
Your daughter had

821
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,567
access to the witness list
and she leaked it to Bishop.

822
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,803
Why?

823
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,471
To win the case?

824
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,374
I had a struggling firm.

825
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,610
She wanted to show Bishop we
could handle his business.

826
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,311
And you, you knew?

827
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,515
Well, then that's your defense. No.

828
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:57,751
You even think of using her to free me,
and I'll confess.

829
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:59,286
She's not my client.

830
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,555
I am your client
and I will confess.

831
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:06,126
Eric, this... I don't
think you understand.

832
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,029
With that information,
Bishop will kill her.

833
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,565
No. He knows if he
moves against her,

834
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:12,933
I'll tell Rivers everything.

835
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,837
I've got some files socked away,

836
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,006
and attorney-client
privilege be damned.

837
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:21,475
Then what are you going to do?
Because if I found out

838
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,876
your daughter leaked
the witness list,

839
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,578
Rivers can't be far behind.

840
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,218
Will you take a message
to Bishop for me?

841
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:46,999
It's not a big deal.

842
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,001
I won't have a talk.

843
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:51,436
No scolding, no mothering, just...

844
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:52,871
I want to know.

845
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:54,706
Well, I don't tweet.

846
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,845
Y-you guys think that...?

847
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:02,281
Mom, this is stupid.

848
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:03,382
Don't say "stupid."

849
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:05,784
There were two IP addresses used:

850
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:08,921
the Internet at your
school and here.

851
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:10,155
I can't believe this.

852
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:11,623
This is like a police state.

853
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:12,858
Don't be melodramatic.

854
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,459
I'm asking you a question.

855
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,595
No, you're not.
You're not saying "no."

856
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,030
Grace, don't.

857
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,799
You didn't do this?

858
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,234
You didn't write these things?

859
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,036
Mom! What?

860
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:25,771
Let's at least pretend

861
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:27,706
we know what happened
here the last six months.

862
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:29,641
That was different.

863
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,343
We didn't tell you
about the pictures,

864
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,745
because they were
trying to hurt you.

865
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:35,247
It was a lie, Zach.

866
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:36,915
And not one.

867
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,318
It was over and over again.

868
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:42,554
But a lie like lying about
having Jews in your basement.

869
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:48,327
You know, like, with the Nazis.

870
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:51,396
Let's trust each other again.

871
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:55,667
My defenses are down.

872
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,903
Let's go. Just tell me.

873
00:35:57,904 --> 00:35:59,604
I told you.

874
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:07,112
He did it.

875
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:09,648
That's the way he and
Becca talk all the time.

876
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:16,321
Uh, not really how I
wanted it to, but...

877
00:36:16,322 --> 00:36:18,223
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I don't know...

878
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:20,325
Becca?

879
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:21,727
She's still in class.

880
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,630
Will you excuse us, ladies?

881
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:28,467
It's okay.

882
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:37,009
Have you got a problem?

883
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,111
That depends, Upriser7?

884
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,048
Oh, so what are you, like,
the Internet police?

885
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:44,249
No, just an interested

886
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,119
bystander who wants to protect
his six-figure income.

887
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,920
So, you and Zach talk a lot.

888
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,089
He talks a lot about his parents,
is that it?

889
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,625
Oh, no.

890
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:56,428
Have I been a bad girl? No,

891
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:59,364
dear Becca, because that would only

892
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:01,400
make you want to do it again.

893
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:03,702
You know what you've been?

894
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:06,004
Gum on the bottom of my shoe.

895
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,541
Spoiled little brat who
will get pregnant at 17,

896
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,076
have an abortion at 18

897
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:13,879
and meet some sweaty frat
boy over spring break,

898
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,848
and work as a dental hygienist
until the day you die.

899
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:19,818
And you...

900
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,420
you're a perv.

901
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,834
You better get your
story straight, perv.

902
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:42,074
Oh, Mr. Gold. I'm sorry.

903
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:43,275
Don't worry, Officer.

904
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:44,676
Just a daughter of
a friend of mine.

905
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:46,078
She's all right now.

906
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,246
Aren't you, Becca?

907
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:51,416
I'm good.

908
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,589
See, I have a lot of friends,

909
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,393
I'm sure you do, too,
but only difference is,

910
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,495
my friends are not in homeroom.

911
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:06,898
So I want you to listen to me.

912
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:08,600
Stop tweeting.

913
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:10,068
If you tweet,

914
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:12,070
I will know you tweet and I will...

915
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:17,442
<i>Have you seen Drag Me to Hell?</i>

916
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:19,344
It will be just like that.

917
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:21,546
Do you understand?

918
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:24,883
I want to hear the words.

919
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,820
I understand.

920
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,356
Good. And enjoy high school.

921
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:34,025
It really is the best
time of your life.

922
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:43,869
This way, gentlemen.

923
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,104
My name is Tony Gurstelle,
and I am guilty

924
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,340
of the murder of Kelli Gerber... WILL: Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

925
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:50,876
He's surrendering himself freely!
Get out of my way!

926
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:53,712
I acted alone and with no
consultation from anybody else.

927
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:56,248
I had no access to the witness list

928
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:58,550
or any other information
other than my own.

929
00:38:58,551 --> 00:39:01,153
I don't have anything
further to add...

930
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:03,889
What kind of deal did you make?
You got your murderer.

931
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,458
Come on, what kind of deal
did you make with Bishop?

932
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:08,627
Do you expect an answer? Really?

933
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:10,996
What kind of deals do
you make every day?

934
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:12,731
With drug dealers, killers?

935
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:16,501
I am in pursuit of the good.

936
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:19,671
You're in pursuit of
your own sanctity.

937
00:39:19,672 --> 00:39:21,339
Take your suspect.

938
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,475
He killed your girlfriend.

939
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:25,443
You won.

940
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:28,180
You wake up with fleas, Counselor.

941
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:31,750
You pay your rent,

942
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:34,853
you go to your restaurants,

943
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:37,856
but you still wake up with fleas.

944
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:50,101
I'm firing you.

945
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:53,371
No reflection on your work.

946
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,874
I just feel more
comfortable with Dorfman.

947
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,109
And keeping the evidence
he has on you secret?

948
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,244
Well, that doesn't hurt.

949
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:00,946
Good work on his defense,
by the way.

950
00:40:00,947 --> 00:40:02,948
Good work on your deal.

951
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:05,417
Dorfman keeps everything
he knows under wraps

952
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:07,118
and you turn over the murderer.

953
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,822
Well, we only ended up there
because of your defense.

954
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,026
Look, we can work with Dorfman
and share your business.

955
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:16,561
No, thanks.

956
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,029
I need an up-and-comer.

957
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,331
Someone who's hungry.

958
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:21,967
You don't think we're hungry?

959
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:24,302
Not like Dorfman.

960
00:40:24,303 --> 00:40:26,504
Guy's a mountain climber.

961
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,543
Sorry it didn't work out.

962
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:42,420
So, I'm pitching our
firm to this drug dealer.

963
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:46,658
I'm telling him we'll
validate for parking again.

964
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:52,297
They don't teach you
that at law school.

965
00:40:52,298 --> 00:40:53,498
And he said, no.

966
00:40:57,436 --> 00:40:59,638
He said he looked at our financials

967
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,773
and he thinks we have a year left.

968
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:11,683
So what are we going to do?

969
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:13,051
I don't know.

970
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,986
Lay off Acquisitions?

971
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:16,321
Or split up.

972
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,189
Do you want that?

973
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,658
It's an option.

974
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:22,627
I take my people, you take yours.

975
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,764
Or we could shop for
another drug dealer.

976
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:31,636
Hey, they're the only ones
making money these days.

977
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,341
Or find a third partner.

978
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,845
How does that work?

979
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,380
Find a replacement for Stern.

980
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:43,682
Bring him in as equal partner.

981
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:47,152
Somebody with a client list,
some equity.

982
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:48,753
You're okay with giving up a third?

983
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:51,022
Of what, a sinking ship?

984
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:52,957
Sure.

985
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,560
We'll kill each other if
we don't find a referee.

986
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:58,096
A third partner?

987
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:00,598
Someone neutral,
someone we both agree on?

988
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:11,009
An optimism fills the void.

989
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,478
I think that's alcohol.
Just as good.

990
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,891
You sure? Yeah.

991
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,961
Come on. Let's go
before I change my mind.

992
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:31,696
Just wait.

993
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:32,997
Come on. Let's go.

994
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:34,065
Just one second.

995
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:35,834
I need to get something of mine.

996
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:11,069
