CLAPHAM JUNCTION

2
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,977
<i>30 degrees plus expected today.</i>

3
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,915
<i>In fact we could beat
the record, which stands...</i>

4
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:58,529
<i>as the 12th of June this year, when
we've got 32, we could even make it...</i>

5
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:02,769
<i>to 33 degrees today.
And of course it's the persistence...</i>

6
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:06,981
<i>of that heat - no respite at all.
No let up tonight. 15 degrees...</i>

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,630
<i>minimum 15 degrees, one or two
cities could well be pegged into 20s overnight,</i>

8
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>and that is really really hot.</i>

9
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:19,018
<i>How long is this gonna last for?</i>

10
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:23,107
<i>Well, we've got the breakdown on the way
tomorrow so at least another 24 hours...</i>

11
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:22,796
Look to the right.

12
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,159
Look up.

13
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,036
That was very good Danny.

14
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,467
- You're keeping well, are you?
- Yes, thanks.

15
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:01,103
- I must say you're looking well.
- Good, thank you.

16
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:08,431
- Surviving this heat, heh?
- Just about.

17
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,928
- Pretty scorching innit?
- Yes it is.

18
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:19,165
O-K!
So, fire away.

19
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,742
The giving of a band,
signifies the promise of a love...

20
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,351
...that is ever lasting,
and is a public affirmation, ...

21
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:31,046
that the contract between
Will and Gavin will be honoured.

22
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,136
- Will?
- This ring is a token of my abiding love...

23
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:45,298
<i>...and a sign of the promise
I make to you today.</i>

24
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:21,177
Bishop can be a bit of a prick
when it comes to poofs.

25
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:28,732
And as for old Wurzel down at Lambeth Palace,
she's got her knickers in a right twist.

26
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,759
- Would you like a top up, sir?
- Oh, how kind.

27
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,668
- How do you stand the strain?
- I may be ++++

28
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:42,443
...but I still believe in
Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam.

29
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:49,402
Oh, er, waiter.
Bring us a few more lovely sausages, will you?

30
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:54,868
So then we go back to
where we were at the start...

31
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:56,518
...with that guy in the truck...

32
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,280
...and we realise Chris has said
fuck off to the lot of them, and...

33
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:07,032
...decided to make a new start in London.
And, um, well, that's about it.

34
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:19,583
Er, you see, Robin, the thing is, erm,
you know I am a great fan.

35
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,722
- Oh you don't like it.
- You do know that, don't you?

36
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,138
- You don't, do you?
- I just feel we've been there before.

37
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:27,675
- No we haven't?!
- I mean, the whole gay thing.

38
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:30,733
- Is that an issue anymore?
- It is if you're gay.

39
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,109
That's what you have to ask yourself.
Is it still an issue?

40
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,327
- Anyway, this is more than that...
- Because, I don't think it is.

41
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,824
You know what, with
Elton and David,

42
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:44,848
and Ian and, well, everyone.
You know, what's the problem?

43
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,708
It's been done.
We've moved on.

44
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,999
- It's accepted.
- But, the way this would approach..

45
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:53,166
I mean, if you make it
a bit more like Gary Glitter.

46
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:58,717
- Gary Glitter?!
- Vietnam, Cambodia, the whole sex tourist thing,

47
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,098
then, maybe, maybe.

48
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:04,085
But the whole sex tourism thing
has been done to death.

49
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,154
As it is, it's not for me.

50
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,882
I'm sorry, it just isn't.

51
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:14,015
Look, I'm so keen to
work on something with you.

52
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:19,191
I mean you know that.
But this, sorry, it's a no.

53
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:32,659
- You're still married?
- Yes.

54
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:37,591
Well done. I'm seeing
Dunstan next week.

55
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,373
- Are you?
- Shall I send him your love?

56
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:43,932
- I wouldn't bother.
- No, best not.

57
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,174
Well I leave you then.

58
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:01,540
He reached grade seven.

59
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:05,252
Miss Richard says if he carries
on like this, he could get to...

60
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,254
- the Royal College of Music.
- That's marvellous Dolly

61
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,987
- He is a good boy.
- You must be so proud.

62
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:18,365
You know, it makes me weep for joy.
I want so hard to get him that fiddle.

63
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,689
You know, you should
give him Mrs. H.

64
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,659
- Well, I'd love to, Dolly.
- He play like an angel.

65
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:29,590
- So, what you're having then?
- Monkfish cheeks and ceps.

66
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,098
Excuse me, sir. The sausages.

67
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:19,416
- Thank you. That accent, I can't quite...
- Shropshire sir ++++.

68
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:41,278
<i>30 degrees I've got here that says it all.
That's for the central London.</i>

69
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:42,478
Nan, I'm back!

70
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:44,904
<i>Of course that's where
most of the population are.</i>

71
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:47,902
Hello nan!

72
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,121
- Darling.
- Bleeding hot, isn't it? D'you want anything?

73
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:59,366
- Darling.
- How about a nice cuppa, eh?

74
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:38,087
Hi, me. Yes, I'm gonna be a bit late.
I've got to pop over to St Luke's.

75
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:44,622
Oh, some mini-crisis or other.
Probably nothing, but you know how it is.

76
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,627
Well, of course I'll try.
But tell them not to wait.

77
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:58,235
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yes, I will. I promise. Bye.

78
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,033
- You look at my arse, innit?
- Are you looking at his arse?

79
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:48,647
- Was there any calls nan?
- Just the one.

80
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,209
- And which one was that, then?
- It was your mum.

81
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:55,698
- Oh, yeah?
- She wants to see you, darling.

82
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,410
- Don't start, nan.
- She said she hasn't touched a drop in weeks.

83
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,236
- She is a liar, Nan.
- She ain't, Terry, she's a good girl.

84
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:08,171
- No, she ain't, Nan.
- Might be lots of things, but she ain't no liar.

85
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,585
- She is a good girl at heart.
- No, she ain't, Nan.

86
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:15,186
- She IS Terry, she is a good girl.
- No, she ain't.

87
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,988
- D'you want an 'am salad?
- Give her a call, Tel.

88
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,374
- I ain't calling her.
- She wants to see you.

89
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,368
- No she don't, Nan.
- She does, Terry.

90
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,715
There was a time she could've
me all she liked.

91
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,018
If anything happens, you won't
be able to live with yourself.

92
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,047
D'you want an 'am salad
or something hot?

93
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:39,817
- Do it for me, darling.
- I'll do you a salad but I ain't speaking to her.

94
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:45,013
Gavin has taught me how to love.
To love him, to love myself.

95
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:51,331
This is forever, honey. And if it ain't,
well, you've got one hell of a pre-nup.

96
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,948
So let's all get slaughtered.
Bottoms up!

97
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:02,622
Come on, then, gorgeous.

98
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:46,842
- Skiving off, are you?
- No, sir, it's my break.

99
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:50,523
I'm paying for all this, you know.
It doesn't come cheap.

100
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,931
I don't expect it does, sir.

101
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:57,531
You know it's very, very charming
that you should call me sir.

102
00:13:58,512 --> 00:13:59,717
You really don't have to.

103
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:06,434
- So, Ludlow.
- Yeah.
- Very nice.

104
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,497
- Yeah. Bit on the quiet side.
- Mm. It is a bit, I suppose.

105
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,515
Nice enough.

106
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:28,443
- Ludlow. Nice castle.
- Yeah.

107
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,486
Very nice. I love that part of the world.

108
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:34,965
- You've never been, have you?
- Somewhere up north, isn't it?

109
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,899
- Help yourself.
- No, no. Not when I'm on duty.

110
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,369
It's my wedding.

111
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:54,973
- It's a beautiful ring.
- We had them made specially.

112
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:58,794
- He must think the world of you.
- It's too big though. The jeweller fucked up.

113
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,536
- Could have it altered.
- You don't wanna go loosing it.

114
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:06,679
You're right there.
Gotta watch your ring, haven't you?

115
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,536
- Y'know that's incredible.
- What is?

116
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:16,809
This wedding. I never, ever thought
I'd live to see the day...

117
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:20,216
...two blokes getting married. I mean,
it's just fantastic, isn't it?

118
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,181
I suppose it is.

119
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,398
Gavin and I have lived together for so long.

120
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:30,573
Yeah, it is pretty fantastic.

121
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:41,602
- You're blushing.
- It's hot.

122
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:44,581
No, no, I'd better get back.

123
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:24,777
Where have you been?
I was expecting you ages ago!

124
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:29,284
- I had to go to the library.
- Christ, we're gonna be late as usual.

125
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,961
Darling, use a glass.

126
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:38,994
You will be allright, won't you?

127
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:41,084
Of course I will.

128
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:44,869
Why don't you go and
see Benjy or someone?

129
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,783
I don't like the thought of you being by yourself
and it is going to be such a lovely night.

130
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:52,467
- Mum, I'll be fine.
- Got that gorgeous humous which you like...

131
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:56,602
- ...and some lovely yummy fresh baguette from.
- Mum, I'm OK.

132
00:16:56,602 --> 00:17:00,450
Oh, I know you are darling.

133
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:10,207
Must go and put a face on.
If your father calls tell him to get his arse in gear

134
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:32,139
- Not going, are you?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

135
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:37,293
- Pity.
- End of my shift.

136
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,947
I'll tell you what.

137
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm living with a mate at the moment,
south of the river, ...

138
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,231
...but I'm moving into my own
pad next week.

139
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:53,224
I mean it's only rented, like,
but I'm really excited.

140
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,735
- I bet.
- I left home, made the move to London, ...

141
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:59,438
...got my own job and then
my own pad. Brilliant.

142
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:01,321
Brilliant.

143
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:06,042
So what is this place then?

144
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,795
Pantry.

145
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,814
- What did they use it for?
- ++++.

146
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,629
You're full of it, aren't you?

147
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,624
I just love London. Always knew
I would and you know something?

148
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:23,550
- What?
- I do.

149
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:28,228
Charlie with the groom, ...

150
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:32,304
- ...I'll lose my job.
- Not with me behind you.

151
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:45,467
Christ, I'd like to lick the hairs
on the back of your neck.

152
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:50,572
You just got married.
You should have other things on your mind.

153
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:57,168
You going somewhere nice
for your honeymoon, then?

154
00:18:57,168 --> 00:19:00,568
Eventually.
Gav's back to work tomorrow.

155
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:04,023
- What is he do?
- He makes people better.

156
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:08,080
- What do you do?
- I just make money.

157
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,524
Will you be missed?

158
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,122
- Not here?
- Where then?

159
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:48,831
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Come on.

160
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,340
As honest as the day is long, huh?

161
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:22,559
Don't want to end up lonely, Tel.

162
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,661
No Nan.

163
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:28,580
I've got you ain't I?
Who are you going to have?

164
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,051
- I'm worried for you.
- I'll be alright, Nan.

165
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:35,868
I do. I worry for you.

166
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,048
Leave it out, Nan.

167
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,163
We all need someone, darling.

168
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:48,277
Oh, I'll find someone, Nan.
Don't you worry.

169
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:56,529
Come here.

170
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,699
- My mobile.
- Oh, what?

171
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:25,495
- I want to see you again.
- You can't.

172
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:28,465
- Call me.
- No.

173
00:21:29,348 --> 00:21:35,086
- You will, you know.
- You're sure of yourself, aren't you?

174
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,776
Bye then.

175
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,347
You've gotta lovely arse.

176
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,791
And you've gotta lovely husband.

177
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,884
- Where the hell have you been?
- I'm sorry.

178
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,343
I was running out of excuses,
what have you been up to?

179
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:14,081
Oh, for christ's sake, give me some.
I've been twisting with the vicar.

180
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:18,709
- Very pure, don't overdue it.
- I was beginning to thing you'd had second thoughts.

181
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:22,168
- Where's the ring?
- It's in my wallet, kept slipping off.

182
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:25,459
- I know I gave him the right measurements.
- It's allright, I'll take it in tomorrow.

183
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,452
A pint please.

184
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:11,567
- Hot, innit?
- Yeah.

185
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:18,448
- I think you'd gone.
- Nah I ain't gone.     - Good.

186
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:21,835
- I'm Alfie, by the way.
- Oh, yeah?

187
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:26,084
- Yeah.
- You don't meet many Alfies.

188
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:40,820
Let me introduce you to...

189
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,732
No, it's OK.

190
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:56,656
My mun rang just before I left. I told her
I was doing a wedding, but I didn't tell her it was gay.

191
00:25:56,656 --> 00:26:00,171
- She wouldn't have minded it, would she?
- I don't know. She probably knows everything anyway.

192
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,655
Yeah, mums usually do.

193
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:13,521
- Nice.
- Yeah, if you like that sort of thing.

194
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:21,670
- Pissed all down my trousers.
- Oh, yeah?

195
00:26:23,753 --> 00:26:26,176
Still, you won't mind that, will you?

196
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:33,277
I said it don't go there.
But he don't listen, know what I mean?

197
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,354
He's a knob.

198
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:38,096
He kept pushing. And I kept telling him
and then the fucking thing snapped.

199
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,805
- A right knob.
- About 30 quids worth.

200
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:43,486
- He should get the boot.
- I've been fucking saying that.

201
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:12,186
- Hello, Rog.
- Hey, Robin.

202
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,235
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm OK.

203
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,523
- How are you?
- Fucking knackered.

204
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:17,777
Come on and have a drink.

205
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:22,044
What can I get you?

206
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,402
- Robin!
- Fancy one of these?

207
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,128
You're looking so well, isn't he, Roger?

208
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:33,705
- Greatful clients sent me a couple of cases of that.
- Oh, I've got you this.

209
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:38,104
- You shouldn't have.
- And I must say, it's bloddy nice. Here you are.

210
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:41,850
- And you've put on a little bit of weight.
- Do you think?     - Yeah, it's good.

211
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,071
- See what you think.
- Thanks, cheers.

212
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:57,988
Fucking...

213
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:09,417
<i>See how I trust my lovely
Shropshire lad! You've got to call me now.</i>

214
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,290
Silly bastard!

215
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:24,080
- Something about summer, isn't there?
- Yeah.

216
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,800
Gets the old sap rising. Ever get the feeling
sometimes that you're missing out.

217
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,482
- That the party is going on without you.
- You don't feel that, do you?

218
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,407
It's all a bit aimless, you know.
Sort of chugging along.

219
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:42,946
Something about the kids going to university.

220
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:48,719
I feel a bit itchy in the foot department.
I want to play the field again.

221
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:52,277
Well, I've been playing the field since I
was 15, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

222
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,236
I need women.
I just love them, you know?

223
00:29:59,236 --> 00:30:01,368
Well, you've got one.

224
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,741
It's not the same though, is it?

225
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,630
So what's your name then?

226
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,494
Smithy.

227
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,208
Smithy? I like that.

228
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,350
Yeah?

229
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,268
What's yours then?

230
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:41,939
Mickey.

231
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,014
Irish, are you?

232
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:46,622
No.

233
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:52,463
You said you live around here.

234
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:54,454
Not far.

235
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:59,698
- So is this your patch then?
- Yeah, sort of.

236
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:01,362
How about you?

237
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:03,337
No.

238
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,566
I'm from outside London.

239
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,186
Oh, yeah?

240
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:11,704
And where is that then?

241
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,103
Sussex.

242
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:18,758
Sussex, hey?
Very nice, very nice.

243
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,613
Whereabouts in Sussex?

244
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,514
Nutley.

245
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,557
Nutley?
I ain't never heard of Nutley.

246
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,080
- That's my mum.
- Oh yeah?

247
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,150
She died.

248
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,075
Few months ago, of a heart attack,...

249
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,251
...she is out of the blue.

250
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:55,014
I don't half miss her.

251
00:31:57,345 --> 00:32:02,061
- My mum died not so long ago.
- Did she?

252
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,979
What did she die of?

253
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:08,855
She got run down.

254
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:10,850
What?

255
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,468
You mean depressed, like?

256
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:16,184
No. By a mailvan.

257
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:20,644
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

258
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:23,694
They drive like fucking maniacs, those guys.

259
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,168
That's terrible.

260
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:29,830
- You know what?
- What?

261
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,962
She was posting a
letter at the time.

262
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:35,304
Christ, I'm...

263
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:38,680
Yeah, it makes you think, don't it?

264
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:52,560
- I envy you. You've got freedom, no ties.
- But look at you, you've got a proper job.

265
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,548
Big-time barrister and a criminal
amount of money. Wife and kids.

266
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:01,977
You're a proper grown up. I live in a
state of perpetual adolescence.

267
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:04,365
I'm an adolescent at heart.

268
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:07,635
I still enjoy football,
good wank.

269
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:12,638
It was good, wasn't it?
The school and that.

270
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:15,896
Yeah, yes it was.

271
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,981
Christ, I need a fuck!

272
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:24,148
Hot, isn't it?

273
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:42,473
Orphans in the storm, heh?

274
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,302
Yeah.

275
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,363
I like this one.
Can we just...

276
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:05,559
Can we have it up a bit?

277
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:11,885
Yeah.
Yeah OK.

278
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,968
- Such a bloody nightmare.
- It doesn't matter.

279
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:27,197
- He was so late back!
- Big recycling meeting about this filing business.

280
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,510
- You just have to put your foot down!
- I just couldn't leave.

281
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,211
- Bloody council!
- I'm sorry.

282
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:34,894
- It doesn't matter, really.
- I had a costume fitting and I was ready.

283
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:38,492
- Why are you doing this?
- Cos I hate fucking Pet Shop Boys!

284
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,615
- Is Minty here?
- I'm afraid she had to cry off.

285
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:45,373
- Oh, no.
- Well, she's practically dead with hay fever, so...

286
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,634
- Let me get you a drink.
- Have you been at the Botox?

287
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:51,677
- No, I haven't!
- Oh, I must say you're looking suspiciously fresh.

288
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,271
Roger and Robin are in the garden.

289
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:00,452
Robin?

290
00:35:01,004 --> 00:35:02,520
Yeah, I'm sure you've met.

291
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,826
He's that old school
friend og Roger's.

292
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:08,139
- Oh, isn't he the..
- Writer.

293
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,095
That's right.
White?

294
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:10,833
Yeah, please.

295
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:17,056
Shut the fuck up!

296
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:24,676
Won't mind a bit of piss,
you said.

297
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:31,684
How do you like it
you filthy cocksucker?

298
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:33,762
Huh?

299
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:36,093
That's nice, is it?

300
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,948
Huh?

301
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:39,787
How nice is that?

302
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:50,645
You pathetic little shit!

303
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,925
How proud would Mummy
be now, hey?

304
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,400
- I'm doing Howards End.
- Very nice, what are you playing?

305
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,660
- Mrs Willcocks.
- Oh, great!

306
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,736
I'm afraid I don't know it.

307
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,159
Oh, you must! Vanessa Redgrave
played her in the movie.

308
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,625
So, it's been done before, then.

309
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,756
Everything's been done before.
They only do things now that have been done before.

310
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:50,283
- That seem to be the case.
- It's never been done on television.

311
00:37:50,283 --> 00:37:52,567
- I think it has.
- No, I'm sure it hasn't.

312
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,421
I think you're right. In the '70s.

313
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:58,018
- How would you know, you never watch TV.
- I did in the '70s.

314
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:01,406
- Who is doing it?
- Well, Frank Winston has commissioned it.

315
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,981
- Did he now?!
- Do you know him?

316
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,422
I had a meeting with him this morning
as a matter a fact.

317
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:07,257
Darling, isn't he?

318
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:08,431
Top up?

319
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:12,157
Something's always
intrigued me about Howards End.

320
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,224
It's such an intriguing novel.

321
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:16,419
Whether or not it's
got an apostrophe.

322
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,127
Isn't it supposed to be the end of Howard,
well the end of several Howards?

323
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,930
Or is it just Howard's end?

324
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:24,998
Anyway, I'm thrilled to bits.

325
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:14,128
I'm sorry Belinda. I just have to pop
something into little Albert.

326
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:20,535
I've bought him the cutest little cap.
He looks so adorable.

327
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:36,174
Hello, mate.

328
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:37,227
Where are you off to, then?

329
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:39,714
Excuse me.

330
00:41:44,673 --> 00:41:46,282
Come here!

331
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:04,469
- Hello there, mate.
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.

332
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:06,511
Christ, you look fucked!

333
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:07,937
Do I?

334
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:10,245
You could do with a stiff one.

335
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,037
Gotcha!

336
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,391
Beinda and I met at Pilates. I showed her
some photographs of little Albert.

337
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:22,753
He is my grandson and we just
hit off immediately.

338
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:25,083
- She is lovely, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

339
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,967
- Are you married?
- No, I'm gay.

340
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,043
Oh, how nice!

341
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:33,847
Have you got a.. what do they call it..
a civil partner?

342
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:35,557
Not at the moment, no.

343
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:36,622
Oh...

344
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,292
Would you like a Pringle?

345
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:42,391
Oh, my hubby at last!

346
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,625
Sorry, darling.

347
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:47,384
You don't know Robin, do you?

348
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:50,688
No, we don't.

349
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,764
Close your mouth, darling,
you look like a carp.

350
00:42:52,764 --> 00:42:54,175
Robin and I were at school together.

351
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:55,599
Pleased to meet you.

352
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:57,906
God, what was that?

353
00:42:57,906 --> 00:42:58,963
What?

354
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:01,965
It sounded like a scream or something.

355
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:04,243
It was probably a fox being fucked.

356
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,122
I've got your pen.

357
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,723
Your Parker ballpoint.

358
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:21,247
You dropped it in the library
this afternoon.

359
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,619
I found it.

360
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,301
And I thought I'd bring it over.

361
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:41,102
Can't I come in?

362
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:44,573
Why?

363
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:49,413
So I can give it to you.

364
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,744
You can give it to me here.

365
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,164
But I'd like to...

366
00:44:58,164 --> 00:44:59,662
What?

367
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:03,185
...come in.

368
00:45:03,185 --> 00:45:04,805
You can't.

369
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:10,425
- Why not?
- Because I don't want you to.

370
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:14,099
- Why not?
- Because I don't.

371
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,031
You're not doing anything.

372
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:20,668
How do you know?

373
00:45:20,668 --> 00:45:23,688
Look, you give me the pen
or I'll shut the door.

374
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:29,449
- Move.
- I thought it might be nice...

375
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:31,469
...to have a chat.

376
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:33,370
A chat?

377
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,540
Yes.

378
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:38,691
I don't want to have a chat.

379
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:40,641
I don't know you.

380
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:44,832
- You would if we had a chat.
- Look, just shove off!

381
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:46,935
Move your foot and piss off!

382
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:04,731
No more games. Just get back
home to Mummy and Daddy, OK?

383
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:08,506
- They are out.
- Go back and wait for them.

384
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,800
Don't you want your pen?

385
00:46:22,885 --> 00:46:25,989
- What are you so worried about?
- I'm worried I'm gonna belt you one
if you don't get the fuck out.

386
00:46:29,378 --> 00:46:31,137
You wouldn't.

387
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:35,320
Don't push it.

388
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,529
I beg you.

389
00:46:41,794 --> 00:46:45,509
Why can't I stay for a minute?

390
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:48,774
What's wrong with that?

391
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:54,025
We've always seen
each other in the library.

392
00:46:56,603 --> 00:46:59,552
What's the problem?

393
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:08,691
I'm bored to death over there reading and
I don't want to go to bed yet.

394
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:12,542
I just...

395
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,652
...thought we could have a chat.

396
00:47:17,536 --> 00:47:21,516
Five minutes, that's all, then
I'll go, I promise.

397
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,505
You're doing history, aren't you?

398
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:35,244
I'm doing history too.

399
00:47:37,114 --> 00:47:39,295
Amongst other things.

400
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,745
Are you at college?

401
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:47,609
What's your favourite period?

402
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,943
I quite like Hitler.

403
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,684
Not the bloke.

404
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,629
But, you know,
the Third Reich and all that.

405
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:01,303
Is that it, then?

406
00:48:01,974 --> 00:48:03,708
What?

407
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:07,474
Our chat.

408
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:10,117
We'll probably find a few
other things to talk about.

409
00:48:16,778 --> 00:48:19,171
You needn't have pushed so hard.

410
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:22,468
Well, you put your
foot in the door.

411
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:31,568
Do you think I could have
a glass of water?

412
00:48:35,388 --> 00:48:37,526
- Ah!
- Your arse looks nice.

413
00:48:41,278 --> 00:48:42,453
Here we go.

414
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:43,855
We're married!

415
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:49,006
We are fucking married!

416
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:50,541
Keep it down!

417
00:48:58,216 --> 00:48:59,864
Thanks.

418
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:14,042
Thank you.

419
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:17,214
Have you had a fire?

420
00:49:17,214 --> 00:49:18,233
Yeah.

421
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:19,470
What happened?

422
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:22,080
I had an accident.

423
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:25,795
I left the toaster on.

424
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:28,155
You should tell someone.

425
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:30,873
I told you.

426
00:49:33,377 --> 00:49:36,041
It's a lousy neighbourhood, isn't it?

427
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,154
This side of the street, it is.

428
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:43,552
I don't like people around here
too much, do you?

429
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:46,123
I wouldn't know,
I keep myself to myself.

430
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:49,901
That's difficult to do, though,
sometimes, isn't it?

431
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:58,565
You haven't been here long,
have you?

432
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,399
No, I haven't.

433
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:03,299
I don't know about you
but I'm tired. Good night.

434
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,341
Good night.

435
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:06,759
It's not that late.

436
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,406
You wanna be home for your
mum and dad.

437
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,791
They won't be back for ages.

438
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:12,321
I wanna turn in.

439
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:14,294
My foot hurts.

440
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,823
I told you, you shouldn't
have put it in the door.

441
00:50:18,722 --> 00:50:20,930
I'm Theo by the way.

442
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,499
- Who are you?
- Tim. Now fuck off!

443
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,569
Do you think I could have
another glass of water, please, Tim?

444
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:28,335
He is 18 months.

445
00:50:28,335 --> 00:50:30,381
- Yes, you said.
- Little Albert.

446
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,427
I wasn't so sure about the "Albert"
but it's starting to grow on me.

447
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:35,136
Good job he wasn't called Ivy.

448
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:38,587
He does make me laugh. I popped in
earlier - I was telling Belinda - I...

449
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:41,440
...had to give him the cutest little
cap. Like Andy Roddick wears.

450
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,358
- Now, he IS cute.
- And he was prancing around without his...

451
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,884
He is so proud of his willy.

452
00:50:47,884 --> 00:50:50,429
I think it is a stage that boys go through.

453
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:52,743
And it is surprisingly big,
isn't it, Julian?

454
00:50:53,573 --> 00:50:56,861
And he climbed onto my lap and
tried to push it into my button hole.

455
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,405
- It can't be that big then.
- Oh, they were very big buttons.

456
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:03,748
And in the end I just couldn't
resist and had to kiss it.

457
00:51:03,748 --> 00:51:05,810
Mmm, lovely!

458
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:09,305
Why are you always by yourself?

459
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:11,586
It's how I like it.

460
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:15,637
Don't you have any friends?

461
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:17,383
All the chat...

462
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:21,694
All the rubbish.

463
00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:23,911
It needn't be like that.

464
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:27,443
Yeah.

465
00:51:28,143 --> 00:51:29,085
Well...

466
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,045
I've never mugged in.

467
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:39,623
I've always been ever
so slightly shunned.

468
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,196
By my lot, ...

469
00:51:43,196 --> 00:51:44,993
...your lot.

470
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:48,642
Not quite up there.

471
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,655
You get used to it out on a limb, ...

472
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:54,536
...not quite up there enough.

473
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:58,486
We could be friends.

474
00:52:00,277 --> 00:52:01,678
No, we couldn't.

475
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:04,266
Of course we could.

476
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,260
You're, what, ...

477
00:52:07,922 --> 00:52:09,957
14?

478
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:12,678
15?

479
00:52:12,678 --> 00:52:14,251
I'm coming up for 30.

480
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:18,282
We don't have anything in common.
We can naver be friends.

481
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,396
You've seen me before, haven't you?

482
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:34,223
You live up the road.

483
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:36,488
I mean, you've noticed me.

484
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,180
You've looked at me, haven't you?

485
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,364
And in the library...

486
00:52:47,403 --> 00:52:51,533
You've looked at me like I've
looked at you, that's all I'm saying.

487
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,481
You'd better go.

488
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:00,987
Can I have some lager, please?

489
00:53:00,987 --> 00:53:03,019
No.

490
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,616
Go on...

491
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:08,349
- Mom and Dad let me have a drop sometimes.
- Then go home and have a drop!

492
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,259
You are very quiet tonight, Julian.
You all right?

493
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:16,553
Poor bloke's knackered!
Give him a break!

494
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:18,362
I am pretty tired, actually.

495
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,848
- Working late, were you?
- He is always working late, aren't you darling?

496
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,319
Oh, that's no good,
all work and no play!

497
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,050
- That's what I tell him.
- You should let your hair down once in a while.

498
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,988
Exactly! Do you know something, Robin, ...

499
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:32,894
- I think you should take him in hand.
- You don't need me to take you in hand, do you, Julian?

500
00:53:32,894 --> 00:53:35,130
That's enough. Enough, OK?

501
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:44,121
I'm sorry, I really am pretty wiped out.

502
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,425
- Darling, would you like us to go?
- No.

503
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,270
I'm sorry.

504
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:52,549
No, please, don't.

505
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:56,190
We all get a bit scratchty
when the pressure is on.

506
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,144
Another stiff one, eh?
That should do the trick.

507
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:02,783
Thank you.

508
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:29,109
You got a light?

509
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:30,439
Oh, yes.

510
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,643
Sorry.

511
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:09,117
Nice, innit? The moon.

512
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:13,019
Oh yes, yes it is.

513
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:20,976
- You been here long?
- Not long, no.

514
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:23,801
- What, live around here, do you?
- No.

515
00:55:28,212 --> 00:55:30,046
Whereabouts then?

516
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:32,901
- Out west.
- Out west, eh?

517
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:34,573
Yes.

518
00:55:38,078 --> 00:55:40,696
Very nice.

519
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:42,575
Yes, it is.

520
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:47,456
So how did you get in here then,
on a bus?

521
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,683
I drove.

522
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,981
Oh yeah?
What car you got?

523
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,354
- Very inquisitive, aren't you?
- Bother you, does it?

524
00:55:57,892 --> 00:56:00,164
No. No.

525
00:56:05,669 --> 00:56:07,643
That's allright then.

526
00:56:09,177 --> 00:56:12,669
It's an Audi.

527
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:20,797
An Audi, eh? One of them big fuckers or
like one of them little hairdresser type?

528
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,658
A4 estate.

529
00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:24,322
You've got a family then?

530
00:56:24,322 --> 00:56:25,954
No.

531
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,020
It makes you wonder doesn't it?

532
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:35,985
Why that star is next to that one?

533
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:39,107
That one is next to that?

534
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:42,082
I suppose it does.

535
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,865
Do you know what I think?

536
00:56:43,865 --> 00:56:44,986
No.

537
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:47,046
I think it means fuck all!

538
00:56:59,706 --> 00:57:01,453
It's bleeding hot, innit?

539
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:06,166
Yes, it is.

540
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:15,086
I wouldn't half like
to see your A4 estate.

541
00:57:15,714 --> 00:57:17,924
- Would you?
- Oh, yeah!

542
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:19,774
I love a big motor.

543
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,352
Mickey.

544
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,688
Joe.

545
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:27,923
Hello, Joe.

546
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,010
What was that?

547
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,096
It was over there.

548
00:57:35,254 --> 00:57:36,478
Joe!

549
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:49,893
Fuck!

550
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:19,060
Help me.

551
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:30,559
Help me.

552
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:33,408
Alfie, innit?

553
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,167
Help me.

554
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:45,375
Is this yours, Alfie?

555
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:47,755
Please, help me.

556
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:52,199
That's a little diamond, innit?

557
00:58:53,023 --> 00:58:54,710
What's this next to it?

558
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,806
Looks like a sapphire to me.

559
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:00,234
What do you reckon, Alfie?

560
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:02,887
Sapphire, is it?

561
00:59:06,796 --> 00:59:10,295
And it's not yours you say.

562
00:59:11,322 --> 00:59:13,021
Get help.

563
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:18,566
Well, that is nice.

564
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:22,682
Very nice indeed.

565
00:59:28,146 --> 00:59:31,565
By the middle of 2010, we aim to cut
our carbon emissions by at least...

566
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:33,204
Darling, we really don't want
to hear about Camden's carbon footprint.

567
00:59:33,204 --> 00:59:34,497
... by at least 20 per cent.

568
00:59:34,497 --> 00:59:35,697
Do we, Robin?

569
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,193
- Julian?
- Actually, I think it's rather interesting.

570
00:59:38,193 --> 00:59:39,406
See, darling, no one does.

571
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:05,309
No, I've always got on with gay men.

572
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:07,244
I have, really.

573
01:02:07,244 --> 01:02:10,472
They are so funny,
and unthreatening.

574
01:02:10,472 --> 01:02:13,241
In fact we've got quite a few
gay friends, haven't we Julian?

575
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:15,758
I have never counted.

576
01:02:15,758 --> 01:02:18,481
But I have to admit, there is
a part of me that's rather old-fashioned.

577
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:22,762
I do love the idea of strong, protective man,
battling out in the field, and then...

578
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:25,982
...returning home for some vigorous impregnation!

579
01:02:25,982 --> 01:02:29,567
- No dissention there, old chap!
- Don't you think you should go outside?

580
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:31,860
- Does anybody want me to go outside?
- No, it's fine.

581
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,642
But you wouldn't do that
sort of thing, would you, Robin?

582
01:02:35,925 --> 01:02:38,770
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you are talking about.

583
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:42,228
- Well, you know, having it away in bushes.
- Marion!

584
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:44,105
It does seem rather irresponsible.

585
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:45,596
It depends, doesn't it?

586
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:49,356
I'm sure any of us would have it
anywhere if you felt desperate about.

587
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,011
Hmm?

588
01:02:52,011 --> 01:02:56,582
And, some of them, and I
don't mean you, Robin, ...

589
01:02:56,582 --> 01:02:59,130
...they do tend to push it in your face.

590
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,247
You could say that.

591
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:03,014
None of this sniffing around in the dark.
It is a bit doggy like, isn't it?

592
01:03:03,014 --> 01:03:04,999
- And is it really necessary?
- Marion!

593
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:07,411
I mean, we accept you now,
can't you behave like normal people?

594
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,895
- I think you've made your point.
- Perhaps we enjoy sniffing around in dark places.

595
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:14,316
Perhaps we find this acceptance
you refer to is slightly boring.

596
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:19,197
Perhaps we miss that
little jolt of excitement.

597
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:25,297
What do you think, Julian?

598
01:03:25,297 --> 01:03:28,931
I think we can all do with a little
bit of excitement in our lives.

599
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:31,588
So I suppose I'd have to agree.

600
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,221
Really?

601
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:36,097
There's so much for you lot with all that...

602
01:03:36,097 --> 01:03:40,326
...clubs and things and cottages
and black rooms.

603
01:03:40,326 --> 01:03:41,728
Dark room.

604
01:03:41,728 --> 01:03:43,690
Do you go clubbing much?

605
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:44,707
No, I don't.

606
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:47,158
No, I don't suppose you do, considering.

607
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:50,492
Considering what?

608
01:03:52,543 --> 01:03:56,051
That you haven't been too well, have you?

609
01:03:56,991 --> 01:03:59,969
I don't go clubbing any more probably
for the same reason that you don't.

610
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,638
We're past it.

611
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:05,153
Anyway, how do we know that this...

612
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,637
...poor chap outside was...

613
01:04:07,637 --> 01:04:09,901
...sniffing around as you say.

614
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,042
He could have just been walking.

615
01:04:15,624 --> 01:04:17,554
And we don't even know that he is gay.

616
01:04:18,426 --> 01:04:20,031
In any case...

617
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:23,729
...even if he was sniffing around and fucking
like a dog in the bushes, does it matter?

618
01:04:24,676 --> 01:04:29,477
He was in the most dreadful,
appalling state.

619
01:04:29,477 --> 01:04:36,639
And no one, no one deserves
to be treated like that.

620
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:42,179
Have you seen me at night?

621
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:45,797
Watching you?

622
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:48,940
I kneel by the window.

623
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:51,487
With a fag.

624
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,382
Haven't you noticed?

625
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:59,631
When your curtains are open...

626
01:05:01,803 --> 01:05:03,668
...I watch you.

627
01:05:09,402 --> 01:05:11,350
I watch you and I wank.

628
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:18,716
You watch me...

629
01:05:20,544 --> 01:05:22,486
...and you wank...

630
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:27,677
...with a fag.

631
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:30,701
Why?

632
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:33,637
Isn't it obvious?

633
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:36,923
I mean...

634
01:05:38,845 --> 01:05:41,337
...why have you got a fag?

635
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,155
I always smoke when I wank.

636
01:05:51,606 --> 01:05:53,937
You're not angry, are you?

637
01:05:58,123 --> 01:05:59,991
It's not funny!

638
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:01,488
No.

639
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:04,669
No, I know it's not.

640
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:07,703
It's OK.

641
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,256
Really.

642
01:06:14,256 --> 01:06:18,724
There's a man opposite us lives in
that council block - ghastly place.

643
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,558
Here we go.

644
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,515
What do you mean "here we go"?

645
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:24,471
Young man...

646
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:29,020
Not unatractive, but something about him.

647
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,579
Simply because he is a quiet type?

648
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:31,989
- Have you ever spoken to him?
- No.

649
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,279
- Well, there we are then.
- I haven't spoken to lots of people by us.

650
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:35,881
You have no idea what he is like!

651
01:06:40,147 --> 01:06:43,089
- They do say...
- Ahh, they!

652
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:46,044
...that he has been inside...

653
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,593
- ...for interfering with youngsters.
- That's a rumour.

654
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,838
- You smoked the whole pack?
- Who the fuck cares?

655
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:55,238
Wouldn't he be on a list or something?

656
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:56,857
These things aren't foolproof!

657
01:06:56,857 --> 01:06:58,289
Have you ever seen him
with any youngsters?

658
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,217
Of course I haven't!

659
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,405
I'm far too busy.

660
01:07:03,405 --> 01:07:05,414
People are...

661
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:08,784
...they are scared being different.

662
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:14,578
You are not gonna understand that.

663
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:21,274
It takes a lot of courage.

664
01:07:21,274 --> 01:07:24,295
But...

665
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,890
...if you can be what you are...

666
01:07:31,446 --> 01:07:33,569
...not what you think you should be...

667
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,799
...you'll be happy enough...

668
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:42,547
...and understand yourself...

669
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:46,410
...and you can face anything.

670
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:54,414
If you get sad...

671
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:58,850
...your luck goes.

672
01:08:05,566 --> 01:08:07,695
I've seen you.

673
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:14,935
I've seen you lots.

674
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:20,110
But it's no good.

675
01:08:23,328 --> 01:08:25,870
You've got to go.

676
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:36,467
You've...

677
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:38,833
You've got to go.

678
01:08:43,938 --> 01:08:46,625
Please, go.

679
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:57,832
Please!

680
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:04,005
I know for a fact that
his flat was attacked.

681
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:05,631
Poor chap.

682
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:08,687
- Petrol bomb, through the window.
- It's terrible.

683
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:11,883
- Fortunately he was in so the flat didn't burn down.
- Did he get hurt?

684
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,954
I don't know.
Probably the kids.

685
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:17,277
Well, it was! And they did it
because of what they heard.

686
01:10:17,277 --> 01:10:19,649
And they are fucking
bigoted parents!

687
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:21,518
- I want to go.
- Nat.

688
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:25,079
- I want to see how my baby is.
- He'll be fine.

689
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,051
- I don't like leaving him.
- We've done it before.

690
01:11:27,051 --> 01:11:29,786
I want to go!

691
01:11:58,299 --> 01:12:00,527
I really find your complacency
quite unbelievable.

692
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:03,804
Just because he is keeping himself to himself
doesn't mean there's anything sinister going on.

693
01:12:03,804 --> 01:12:08,552
Those stories don't come out of just
thin air, there must be some reason for them.

694
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:11,664
Well, imagine if they're true, hm?

695
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:15,379
What if he started interfering
with Theo?

696
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:19,979
Sorry.

697
01:12:19,979 --> 01:12:20,957
Hang on.

698
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:26,357
Sorry.

699
01:12:27,415 --> 01:12:28,461
OK.

700
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:29,319
Try again.

701
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,202
Slowly.

702
01:12:33,638 --> 01:12:35,436
Slowly. Yeah.

703
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:36,458
Slowly.

704
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:39,176
Slowly. Yeah.

705
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:47,972
Oh yeah!

706
01:12:58,669 --> 01:13:01,293
- You do understand, don't you?
- Of course.

707
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:08,108
Funny old night with all that nastiness over the road.
And I just want to go and give him a big hug.

708
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:11,858
- I'd love to see him again.
- He is gorgeous, he is a bit moody, but...

709
01:13:11,858 --> 01:13:14,705
- How old is he now.
- Nearly 15.

710
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,672
What a lovely evening.

711
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:24,459
Monkfish cheeks!

712
01:13:24,459 --> 01:13:26,427
You're a card!

713
01:14:43,969 --> 01:14:45,459
Thank you.

714
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,142
Did you see anything?

715
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:49,298
I'm sorry?

716
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,901
Well you were obviously there
for the long haul.

717
01:14:52,748 --> 01:14:55,461
- Where exactly?
- So you must have seen something.

718
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:57,721
I don't know what you are on about.

719
01:14:57,721 --> 01:14:59,360
You did, didn't you?

720
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,692
Excuse me.

721
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:02,760
Because if you did,
you really should tell the police.

722
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,727
I'm aware of my resonsibilities.

723
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:06,210
I don't give a toss
about your peccadilloes.

724
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,808
You really have been somewhat
tiresome tonight with your snide looks.

725
01:15:09,808 --> 01:15:13,150
But I do care that some poor
bastard's had the shit beaten out of them.

726
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:14,801
It's rather puerile,
if you don't mind me saying.

727
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:18,972
If you saw anything that could be remotely
helpful in finding the bastards who did it...

728
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:20,102
<i>Everything OK?</i>

729
01:15:20,102 --> 01:15:21,765
Yeah, fine, thanks.

730
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:24,162
Then you have got to tell someone.

731
01:15:24,162 --> 01:15:26,540
Because next time Julian...

732
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,132
...it could be one of us.

733
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,053
By the way...

734
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:37,244
...nice cock.

735
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:14,068
Theo, darling!

736
01:16:47,873 --> 01:16:49,322
No.

737
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,814
You've gotta go.

738
01:17:03,382 --> 01:17:04,360
This is such a mistake.

739
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,182
First or second.

740
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:08,850
There'll be a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

741
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,013
Which door?

742
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:14,729
I don't know.

743
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:16,280
Which door?

744
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,247
I think this is the wrong floor.

745
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:19,652
Oh for God's sake!

746
01:17:22,323 --> 01:17:24,030
You're not gonna say anything,
are you?

747
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,318
Of course not.

748
01:17:33,293 --> 01:17:38,418
Becaue if you did, that would really
really fuck things up!

749
01:17:38,418 --> 01:17:39,879
Why would I?

750
01:17:39,879 --> 01:17:42,589
It's what I wanted.

751
01:17:47,022 --> 01:17:48,685
It's what I want.

752
01:17:54,051 --> 01:17:55,475
Who is that?

753
01:18:20,814 --> 01:18:22,668
- Where is he?
- Sorry?

754
01:18:22,984 --> 01:18:24,338
- Theo?
- Please.

755
01:18:24,338 --> 01:18:26,084
What is it? What's wrong?

756
01:18:27,467 --> 01:18:28,138
You are his parents.

757
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:29,565
- Get out of there.
- Why?

758
01:18:29,565 --> 01:18:31,004
Tim.

759
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:32,124
Pleased to meet you.

760
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,697
- Peter.
- Hi.

761
01:18:33,697 --> 01:18:35,461
What the hell are you doing?

762
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:38,009
- Get out for Christ's sake!
- Mum, what?

763
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:39,905
What are you doing here?

764
01:18:39,905 --> 01:18:41,114
What's wrong with you?

765
01:18:41,114 --> 01:18:43,711
If you don't tell me what's going on
I am going to call the police.

766
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,006
The police?

767
01:18:45,006 --> 01:18:49,340
If he has laid one finger on you...

768
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:52,598
- If you have touched my son!
- Nat, please.

769
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:56,597
What do you mean Nat please?
He is 14!

770
01:18:56,597 --> 01:18:57,174
Mum!

771
01:18:57,174 --> 01:18:58,546
Well, have you?

772
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:01,309
Have you touched him?

773
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:04,025
- Have you touched him?
- Dad, tell her!

774
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:05,085
Nat!

775
01:19:05,265 --> 01:19:07,502
No I haven't. Why would I touch him?

776
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:12,343
- You're half naked.
- It's very hot!

777
01:19:12,343 --> 01:19:14,084
Oh, will you shut up!

778
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:16,924
Tell me. Theo.

779
01:19:18,013 --> 01:19:19,726
Why are you here?

780
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:22,477
- To give him this.
- What?

781
01:19:22,477 --> 01:19:26,346
I picked it up by mistake this afternoon
in the library and found it in my things.

782
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:28,892
How do you know it's his?

783
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:33,231
Because I've seen him using it.
It is quite distinctive, black and gold you see.

784
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:36,812
You mean you see each other in the library.

785
01:19:36,812 --> 01:19:39,140
Sometimes in the history section...

786
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,062
...I see lots of people. What's the problem?

787
01:19:41,062 --> 01:19:42,305
I told you there'd be an explanation.

788
01:19:42,305 --> 01:19:43,918
Yes, so I thought I'd bring it over.

789
01:19:43,918 --> 01:19:47,188
- At midnight?
- I couldn't sleep, and I could see his
light on, so I thought, "Why not?"

790
01:19:47,188 --> 01:19:51,843
Darling, you didn't have to get into his flat
to give it to him.

791
01:19:51,843 --> 01:19:54,661
- It's very nice of him, very thoughtful.
- Yeah.

792
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:56,223
Most lads would've nicked it.

793
01:19:58,723 --> 01:20:00,838
So why do you still got it?

794
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,106
- There you go.
- Thanks.

795
01:20:04,106 --> 01:20:05,117
Right.

796
01:20:05,117 --> 01:20:06,198
Let's go.

797
01:20:08,997 --> 01:20:13,625
You've been smoking, and alcohol.
You stink of alcohol.

798
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:16,332
- So do you.
- Don't you dare speak to me like that!

799
01:20:16,332 --> 01:20:20,898
Have you been feeding my son
alcohol and cigarettes?

800
01:20:20,898 --> 01:20:22,427
- Feeding him?
- Nat, come on!

801
01:20:22,427 --> 01:20:23,730
- Well, have you?
- Mum!

802
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,927
Well, say something, why don't you?

803
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:28,016
Let's go home.

804
01:20:31,342 --> 01:20:33,887
I know you've been up to something.

805
01:20:33,887 --> 01:20:35,536
Nothing has happened.

806
01:20:36,994 --> 01:20:40,597
- I can smell it.
- Dad tell her nothing has happened.

807
01:20:40,597 --> 01:20:42,359
- Come on Nat!
- Get off me!

808
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,342
Great!

809
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,535
Just great!

810
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,815
Can I put something on then?

811
01:20:48,815 --> 01:20:56,044
If you so much as look at my boy again...

812
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,606
Sorry.

813
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,521
Sorry about all this.

814
01:21:14,088 --> 01:21:17,088
<i>Hate Mob Slays Gay.</i>

815
01:22:15,605 --> 01:22:17,458
Fuck.

816
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:32,435
<i>I have Mr. Cape on the line.</i>

817
01:22:32,435 --> 01:22:33,606
<i>Cape?</i>

818
01:22:33,606 --> 01:22:35,416
<i>Robin Cape.</i>

819
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:38,351
<i>Did he say what it was about?</i>

820
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:41,400
<i>Only that it was very important and he
should speak with you.</i>

821
01:22:51,114 --> 01:22:52,890
<i>- Julian.
- What do you want?</i>

822
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,179
<i>- Have you called the police yet?
- Now listen to me.</i>

823
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:55,551
<i>He is dead.</i>

824
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:57,631
<i>He died in the night.</i>

825
01:22:57,631 --> 01:23:01,833
<i>So unrecognisable that the police said that
he had to be identified by his fingerprints.</i>

826
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:04,052
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

827
01:23:54,186 --> 01:23:55,549
Hot, innit?

828
01:23:59,153 --> 01:24:00,970
Live around here, do you?

829
01:24:02,993 --> 01:24:04,780
It's not bad I must say.

830
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,878
Nice view.

831
01:24:06,878 --> 01:24:08,274
Fresh air.

832
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:10,932
So...

833
01:24:10,932 --> 01:24:13,502
- Where do you live then?
- Not around here.

834
01:24:13,502 --> 01:24:15,524
You have got a tongue then?

835
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:18,885
You see all sorts up here.

836
01:24:18,885 --> 01:24:20,444
Walking their dogs...

837
01:24:20,444 --> 01:24:21,735
...flying their kites...

838
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:23,104
...pulling up the nettles.

839
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:26,687
I saw George Michael up here the other day.

840
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:27,794
Did you?

841
01:24:27,794 --> 01:24:28,820
Yeah.

842
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,458
He has got a place around here.

843
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:35,242
What's your name?

844
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:39,474
Alf.

845
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:41,785
Alf.

846
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,323
I like that.

847
01:24:44,068 --> 01:24:45,939
Merv.

848
01:24:47,345 --> 01:24:49,745
Pleased to meet you Alfie.

849
01:24:51,251 --> 01:24:53,603
It's very smart, where did you get that?

850
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,918
From an admirer.

851
01:24:56,918 --> 01:24:58,623
Must have thought a lot of you.

852
01:25:00,532 --> 01:25:02,171
Yeah, he did.

853
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:06,412
I can see why.

854
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:55,881
Hello, Alfie.

855
01:26:02,441 --> 01:26:03,723
You know something?

856
01:26:04,547 --> 01:26:07,068
I think you're pretty new at this.

857
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:09,144
I think I'm gonna have to teach you.

858
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:12,952
Teach me a lesson?

859
01:26:12,952 --> 01:26:16,053
Oh yeah, I'd enjoy that.

860
01:26:22,568 --> 01:26:23,642
Try again.

861
01:26:47,059 --> 01:26:49,018
- Danny?
- Yes, miss?

862
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:55,948
- If there is ever anything you want to tell me?
- What should I want to tell you, miss?

863
01:26:57,486 --> 01:26:59,940
If there is anything bothering you?

864
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,759
There's nothing bothering me, miss.

865
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:06,045
- Or if there is anything on your mind.
- There's nothing, miss.

866
01:27:07,914 --> 01:27:09,916
- If there is.
- There isn't.

867
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,803
Good. Good.

868
01:27:16,894 --> 01:27:20,180
- I'm here to help, you know.
- Thanks, miss.

869
01:27:45,438 --> 01:27:47,204
What happened to you?

870
01:27:48,684 --> 01:27:51,005
I walked into a door.

871
01:27:51,005 --> 01:27:54,094
- On the heath.
- I walked into a door on the heath.

872
01:27:58,088 --> 01:27:59,103
Sorry.

873
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:06,650
Did you report it?

874
01:28:08,081 --> 01:28:10,786
What's to report.

875
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:16,269
He shouldn't be allowed to
get away with it.

876
01:28:16,973 --> 01:28:19,550
The police need to know what's going on.

877
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:27,481
Does that hurt?

878
01:28:29,815 --> 01:28:31,351
No.

879
01:28:32,942 --> 01:28:35,728
We're not living in the
Dark Ages any more.

880
01:28:36,488 --> 01:28:38,677
It's time these
Neanderthals caught on.

881
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:42,123
Yeah.

882
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:44,078
Dead right, Doc.

883
01:28:44,078 --> 01:28:47,261
I mean, all I was doing was
sniffing out a bit of knob.

884
01:28:49,063 --> 01:28:51,437
There's nothing wrong in that, is it?

885
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:55,430
You know where I'm coming from?

886
01:29:03,448 --> 01:29:05,276
Look to the right.

887
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,299
Left.

888
01:29:08,987 --> 01:29:10,493
Who knows doc...

889
01:29:10,493 --> 01:29:11,654
Up.

890
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:15,193
One day we might bump
into each other again.

891
01:29:15,193 --> 01:29:16,436
Down.

892
01:29:18,492 --> 01:29:20,891
And you wouldn't know
what had hit you.

893
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,784
Right.

894
01:29:25,124 --> 01:29:27,126
Left.

895
01:29:26,942 --> 01:29:28,612
You better watch you.

896
01:29:29,451 --> 01:29:30,317
Up.

897
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:32,453
I'm a married man.

898
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,628
Down.

899
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:36,580
Oh yeah?

900
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,642
We don't want my husband getting jealous.
Do we?

901
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:46,003
Oh no, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

902
01:29:49,336 --> 01:29:51,274
If I could just...

903
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:56,992
What's up?

904
01:30:10,873 --> 01:30:12,890
Hello?

905
01:30:15,328 --> 01:30:16,768
Gav?

906
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:19,726
Are you allright?

907
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:26,075
Did you take the ring back
to the jewellery's today?

908
01:30:26,075 --> 01:30:28,484
<i>The ring?</i>

909
01:30:28,484 --> 01:30:29,857
Yeah, the ring.

910
01:30:30,564 --> 01:30:32,059
Did you?

911
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:34,868
<i>Yes, yes of course I did, yes.</i>

912
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:38,119
You did.

913
01:30:41,842 --> 01:30:43,734
There was no problem or anything?

914
01:30:43,734 --> 01:30:45,706
No.

915
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:48,519
They said it'll be ready next week, why?

916
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:59,086
You didn't drop it or lose it,
because if you did I'd understand.

917
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:01,232
I wouldn't mind.

918
01:31:01,704 --> 01:31:04,263
I could get another one made, I mean...

919
01:31:04,707 --> 01:31:06,388
...it wouldn't be a problem.

920
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:09,341
I told you, I took it into
the jewellerys.

921
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:14,281
Gavin, do you want to
tell me what's going on?

922
01:31:16,353 --> 01:31:17,430
Gav?

923
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,971
<i>Gav, what is it?</i>

924
01:31:22,698 --> 01:31:24,823
I'll see you later, OK?

925
01:31:38,084 --> 01:31:40,663
<i>The 24 year old waiter,
originally from Ludlow...</i>

926
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:44,072
<i>...was found last night on Clapham
Common by a pensioner walking his dog.</i>

927
01:31:44,072 --> 01:31:47,559
<i>He was taken to hospital,
but doctors were unable to save him.</i>

928
