1
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,445
I did not witness the most
important events in my life.

2
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,408
My deepest story must be told by a blind man...

3
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,618
from behind a wall...

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,453
from underground.

5
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,673
Hey, open the door.

6
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,050
Open up!

7
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,046
We have to hurry, I can hear them coming.

8
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,341
Bella...

9
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,219
Under there.

10
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,416
Stay where you are!
Go, check the upstairs!

11
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,917
Check over there!

12
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,632
- Please don't...
- Be quiet!

13
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,012
Shut up! Shut up!

14
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:08,197
Jake... can you get me a towel?

15
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,539
Here you go.

16
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,386
I've been thinking about paper.

17
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,890
Paper or china?

18
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,560
China or paper?

19
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,647
- I think it's paper.
- What?

20
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,565
First year anniversary.

21
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,693
- That's next week.
- I know.

22
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,487
I think we should celebrate.

23
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,908
Why wait?

24
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,416
Hmmm.

25
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,932
Are you all right?

26
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,518
Yeah.

27
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,063
Maybe we should just get ready.

28
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,316
Okay.

29
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,624
You ready to go?

30
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,959
This woman at Birkenau...

31
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,128
she kept an image of her husband and daughter...

32
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,174
cut from a photo, underneath
her tongue for three months.

33
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,428
She could've been killed at any moment.

34
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,637
Incredible.

35
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,222
Yeah.

36
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,895
That a person would die for a photograph.

37
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,607
You don't wanna come, do you?

38
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,275
Everyone will miss you.

39
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,861
They're starting to think you don't like them.

40
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,070
You can't work on this all the time.

41
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,822
You'll drive yourself mad.

42
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,161
Actually, I've finished it.

43
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,039
Why didn't you say anything?

44
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,128
It's great, Jake.

45
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,047
You can move on now.

46
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,007
Start your own book, do whatever you want.

47
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,551
- We could take that trip.
- What trip?

48
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,970
To the island.
To Greece.

49
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,389
Yeah. I...

50
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,432
Maybe.

51
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,017
Oh, Jake.

52
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,769
Come on. They'll be waiting for us.

53
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,688
- We can share the good news.
- No, I...

54
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,191
I'm not up for it.

55
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,736
- You go.
- Or...

56
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,281
- maybe I could just stay here.
- No, no.

57
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,408
Go alone.

58
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,369
Say hello to everyone.

59
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,954
Okay.

60
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,337
It's great, Jake.

61
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,548
A new beginning.

62
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,402
Hey...

63
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,404
We're here.

64
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,803
My son...

65
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,807
There it is...

66
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,851
Home.

67
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,102
When we were married...

68
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,062
I hoped that if I let Alex in...

69
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,648
if I let in a finger of light...

70
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,610
it would flood the clearing.

71
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,571
And at first, this is exactly what happened.

72
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,657
Mingus, Mendelssohn, Mozart...

73
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,993
Mantovani.

74
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:31,163
- That's an odd selection.
- I'm on the "M's".

75
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,289
Ha...

76
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,752
Crash course?

77
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,256
Huh, yeah...
Something like that.

78
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,643
I really don't know that much about music.

79
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,228
My sister used to play.

80
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,270
- Did she?
- Yeah.

81
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,105
- What?
- The piano.

82
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,108
- Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann.
- She had good taste.

83
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,444
- Yeah.
- Does she still play?

84
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,114
No... No, she's...
she doesn't play anymore.

85
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,494
Do you know about the
concerts at the conservatory?

86
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,578
No.

87
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,623
Ah... W.E.A...
The Workers Education Association.

88
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,668
The union...
Every Sunday afternoon at two.

89
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,671
It's all amateur stuff, really...
but a lot of my friends go.

90
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,464
Who do you hang out with?

91
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,885
Uh... I don't really have any friends.

92
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,846
- No?
- Well...

93
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:30,681
A few.

94
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,391
Well, I could probably afford to be...

95
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,560
more discriminating myself.

96
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,487
Oh!

97
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,697
Oh, look at those.

98
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,615
Those are perfect.

99
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,908
You need a pair of galoshes.

100
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,827
No, I need those...
It's the color.

101
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,288
They'll look brilliant
on the wet pavement.

102
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,592
Hee... haw!

103
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,391
What?

104
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,434
- You're so...
- Why you're laughing?

105
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,977
You're so...

106
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,813
- You're so serious.
- I'm sorry.

107
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,857
No, don't be sorry.

108
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,068
Okay, I'm not sorry.

109
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,613
I brought you back your books.

110
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,782
- Hi, Ben.
- Hey.

111
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,161
I really liked "The Etranger"...

112
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,496
"Seven Days in May"...
not so much.

113
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,833
I don't know...
I'm not really into political thrillers.

114
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,543
You're a little early, Ben.
What time is it?

115
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,461
Uh... I don't know.

116
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,714
Ben?

117
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,057
Oh, there you are.

118
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,519
Leave Jacob alone... he probably
hasn't even had his breakfast yet.

119
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,731
- That's all right.
- Come on.

120
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,941
How about I bring you a
new batch of books later?

121
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,193
Okay.

122
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,864
You've always spoiled him.

123
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,826
Oh... Hello.

124
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,703
Oh, this is Alex...

125
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,330
and this is Joseph.

126
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,166
- Joseph, um...
- Nice to meet you.

127
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,294
- he... he lives down the hall.
- Ha...

128
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,505
I've known Jakob since he was a boy.

129
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:50,714
Really?

130
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,092
Oh yes... yes,
he was a lovely boy too, huh...

131
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,887
so quiet, so polite.

132
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,264
You're embarrassing me, Joseph.

133
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,641
Oh, well...

134
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:04,478
I'll, uh... I'll leave you and...
uh, your friend.

135
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,188
Bye... huh.

136
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,586
So, you've lived in this place a long time.

137
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,547
Yeah.

138
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,216
I've never lived anywhere for more than two years.

139
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,635
Well, it's comfortable.

140
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,306
Hmm.

141
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,059
Mmm, what's that?

142
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,021
You're not too big on change, I'm guessing.

143
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,732
Oh...

144
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,609
Jacob and I came here on our first date.

145
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,194
That wasn't a date... we'd just met.

146
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,239
Date or not, I thought you'd had taken him
to some horrible underground jazz club.

147
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,741
Or some god...
awful lecture by Marshal McLuhan.

148
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,745
Or to some very worthy,
but also very dull meeting on the joys...

149
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,497
of the Labor Progressive Party.

150
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,417
And now you're making fun of my politics.

151
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,836
Well, we know you come by them honestly.

152
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,505
Oh!

153
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,102
Hey!

154
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,604
Thank you.

155
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,941
- Hey, where's mine?
- There you go, it's right over here.

156
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,235
They liked you.

157
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,613
Hey, hey...
I learned some Jewish.

158
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,573
Uh'huh?

159
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,786
I have a yellow dog?
You don't even have a dog.

160
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,121
Is that what I said?

161
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,874
That lady in the market tricked me.

162
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,043
Oh, I...

163
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,171
I think we should get married.

164
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,592
- What?
- And I don't wanna wait too long...

165
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,635
for you to ask.

166
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,846
I'm just saying, I think it looks...

167
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,473
pretty inevitable.

168
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,393
You think so?

169
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,021
Yeah, I do...
I think we can make each other happy.

170
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,235
Mmm.

171
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,743
Alex never understands...

172
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,370
thinks that she's doing me good...

173
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,374
snatching me from the jaws of despair, rescuing me.

174
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:34,461
But each time a memory or a story slinks away...

175
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,840
it takes more of me with it.

176
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,175
Everything is wrong.

177
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:46,014
The bedroom, Alex beside me, my panic.

178
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,767
How will Bella ever find me here?

179
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,770
Beside this strange woman...

180
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,981
speaking this language...

181
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:58,527
eating strange food, wearing these clothes...

182
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,868
- Hello.
- Congratulations on your book.

183
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,202
- Poppy seed.
- Poppy seed.

184
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,829
Elaine, you're a goddess.

185
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,664
- Give me your coat.
- Okay.

186
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,627
Alex... they're here.

187
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,005
- How are the children?
- Ah, who cares?

188
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,340
As long as someone else was taking care of them.

189
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,425
- Hi.
- There she is.

190
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,051
- Hello.
- Mmm.

191
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,221
- Hi.
- Hi.

192
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,890
How are you?

193
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,516
Aha!

194
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:33,645
- Poppy seed.
- Your favorite.

195
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:36,315
Be right back.

196
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,286
So, Maurice, how's the museum?

197
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,413
Oh, you know, It's paleontology.

198
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,332
It's not a very glamorous...

199
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,584
Not that much to say.

200
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,793
Well, never mind...

201
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,546
I get more than enough history right here at home.

202
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,304
- Alex?
- Yeah.

203
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,014
Maybe I could give you a hand in the kitchen.

204
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,849
Sure.

205
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,779
And there was this Czech woman, a farmer's wife...

206
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,323
- Mm-hmm.
- she hid a family of Jews...

207
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,991
people she barely even knew.

208
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:32,412
Seven of them, for the entire war...
almost two years, feeding them.

209
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,789
- At the end of the war...
- Jake...

210
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,749
was the first time her husband
found out about it. Just a second.

211
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,709
You'd think he'd be proud of her, yes?

212
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,710
Sure.

213
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,255
He beat her so badly, she almost died.

214
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,424
Jake, maybe you should just give Maurice a break.

215
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,927
- No, this is okay.
- No, it's not.

216
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,345
If you're not married to him...

217
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,848
you're not obligated to listen
to this stuff 24 hours a day.

218
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,808
- Alex, really, it's...
- No, Maurice...

219
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,644
it makes your brain explode...
his obsession...

220
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,437
- with these details...
- Alex.

221
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,982
It's obscene.

222
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,240
What's going on?

223
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,872
No. No!

224
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,791
"The moment I'd spent half my day...

225
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,668
crawling through misery to reach...

226
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,254
vanishes under a bulb.
The shadows slip away...

227
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,089
as Alex again barges in...

228
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,341
with her shameless vitality".

229
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:29,511
Do you have any idea what this has been like for me?

230
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,182
I can't take this anymore.

231
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,896
This is what you want, isn't it?

232
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,606
Then you can...

233
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,774
sit in the dark forever.

234
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,902
Every trace of me will be gone...

235
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,404
my clothes which you think are too flashy...

236
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,781
and my job which you think is trivial...

237
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:53,827
and my friends whose names you can't even remember.

238
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:58,874
You're ungrateful, Jake.

239
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,543
- Alex.
- What?

240
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,807
Right.

241
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,694
I tried to bury images...

242
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,864
to cover them up with distractions...

243
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,033
with attempts at love.

244
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:37,037
By day, I entered the world...

245
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:42,626
but at night, my mother, my father... Bella...

246
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:47,130
simply rose, shook the earth from their clothes...

247
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,341
and waited.

248
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,680
To live with ghosts requires solitude.

249
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,019
I know only fragments of what Athos contained.

250
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,273
Salt, olives...

251
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:32,528
vine leaves, sea foam...

252
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:36,365
a life spanning two wars and one love.

253
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,367
Elena.

254
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,203
Were there words that they regretted?

255
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,455
Did they imagine children?

256
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,627
When a man dies...

257
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:52,047
his secrets bond like crystals.

258
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:07,855
There is no one here.

259
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,023
You can come out.

260
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,699
You need some fresh air, Jakob.

261
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,118
Come out.

262
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:28,834
One day you have to come out.

263
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,274
At least we have this.

264
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,086
Your gums are bleeding.

265
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,089
I'll soak some bread in water for you.

266
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,136
Eat... eat.

267
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:44,243
Your Greek is still better than your English.

268
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:57,923
Hmm?

269
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:03,262
Oh, Nicolas... thought I'd lost it...

270
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,932
my brother.

271
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,650
He died at age of 18...

272
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,986
in a traffic accident.

273
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,156
Hmm.

274
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:25,033
Sometimes people die when it's not expected...

275
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,036
not just during wartime.

276
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,300
Come here.

277
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,551
No one will see you.

278
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,179
We're too high up.

279
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,932
My grandparents used to have a house...

280
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:52,311
on the island of Hydra, overlooking the sea.

281
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:55,189
Once when Nikos was a boy...

282
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,524
he folded a paper airplane...

283
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,402
and sent it over the edge.

284
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,617
It landed in the hat of a man drinking ouzo...

285
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,036
in a cafe near by the dock.

286
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:12,039
On the wings of the airplane...

287
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,124
my brother had written a note...

288
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,460
begging to be saved from a kidnapper.

289
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,881
And he described where he was being held captive.

290
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:26,720
Then... the police came to our house...

291
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,765
and Nikos laughed and laughed...

292
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,434
while my father...

293
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:36,313
chased him yelling, halfway down the hill.

294
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,444
It's all right!
It's all right.

295
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,365
I'm here.

296
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,266
- Good morning, Athos.
- Good morning.

297
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,986
Hmm?

298
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,754
Hmm... hm.

299
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,524
Hmm?

300
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:32,529
I have to go into town.

301
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,163
Why?

302
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:45,167
Hey... don't worry.

303
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,294
I'll be all right.

304
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:21,328
We know that many of the Jews have
escaped and are hiding somewhere...

305
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:31,213
and we know that a lot of you
people did help them to escape...

306
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:34,216
also helping them to hide at this moment.

307
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:45,811
Everybody has to stay in the square,
while we're searching every house...

308
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:50,232
right now everyone's a suspect,
until we find out who's been helping them.

309
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:01,410
Stop! Stop!

310
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:07,207
Stop! Don't walk away!

311
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,710
- Stop!
- Fire!

312
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:40,240
Come here.

313
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,336
Can you read this?

314
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,157
Jakob.

315
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,577
Jakob! Jakob.

316
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,250
Stop! Jakob!

317
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,075
Oh...

318
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:08,287
You are back.

319
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,776
It's over.

320
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,207
Come outside.

321
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:02,049
It's safe now.

322
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:18,774
This is a letter,
I received a few months ago.

323
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:22,694
It's invitation to teach in Canada.

324
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:26,448
See the stamp?

325
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:29,368
Mountain...

326
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,954
Snow...

327
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:37,251
As soon... huh, as I get a visa.

328
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:42,130
Jakob.

329
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,049
Jakob!

330
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,969
Jakob!

331
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,223
Jakob. Ja...

332
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:26,175
That the dead may drink.

333
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:30,345
That the dead may not go hungry.

334
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:33,807
For your parents.

335
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,935
For Bella.

336
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,150
For all who have no one to recall their names.

337
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,535
Tell me.

338
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:00,292
Jakob...

339
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,420
it may not mean anything to you now...

340
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,339
but you must try to be buried...

341
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:09,051
in ground that will remember you.

342
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:43,001
I long for the loss of memory.

343
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:46,171
Though I have tried to will my parents...

344
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,298
and Bella from my sleep...

345
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,300
this will amounts to nothing...

346
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,887
for my mind betrays me in a second.

347
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,849
I've crossed an ocean and
lived many years without them...

348
00:50:56,849 --> 00:51:01,478
yet I can feel Bella's gentle fingers on my back...

349
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:04,773
my father's hand on my head...

350
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:06,483
and suddenly I'm afraid...

351
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:09,903
and turn around in empty rooms.

352
00:51:29,882 --> 00:51:31,550
How are your parents?

353
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,343
They're fine.

354
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:36,930
- How are you?
- I'm all right, I guess.

355
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,892
- I start university next Year.
- I know, that's good.

356
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:43,312
- I'm dating someone.
- Oh, really?

357
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:45,564
- Is she here?
- No.

358
00:51:45,564 --> 00:51:47,274
Oh.

359
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,402
What's her name?

360
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,279
- Naomi.
- Ah.

361
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,865
An excellent name.

362
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:58,869
- Do you know what it means?
- No, I don't.

363
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:02,831
In Hebrew, it means "Full of Grace".

364
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,142
I didn't expect you to be here.

365
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:26,146
Do you still think it's true, that I...

366
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,649
wanted to change you?

367
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,570
I mean, it's in the book, so I suppose you do.

368
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,280
Alex, if it hadn't been for you...

369
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,615
I never would've written the book.

370
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:39,868
I would never have...
Gone to Greece.

371
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,163
I don't know if that's true.

372
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,624
Well, I...

373
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,128
So what now?

374
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,632
I'm going to teach here
for a few months every year...

375
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:55,467
when I'm not on the island.

376
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:59,054
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Uh, no.

377
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:02,015
- You?
- Sort of.

378
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:05,310
He's a musician.

379
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,398
Aren't you lonely?

380
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:14,653
Yeah. Same old Jake.

381
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:19,950
You've written a very good book.

382
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,287
You should be proud.

383
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:59,740
From Mr. Taylor, my new colleague.

384
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:02,534
It's invitation... to party.

385
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:05,913
Look how popular we are already.

386
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,823
Electricity.

387
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:48,997
Running water.

388
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,708
It's like living in hotel.

389
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:49,183
I was looking forward to snow...

390
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,476
but there is hardly any at all.

391
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,061
You're like a lot...

392
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,855
you've got a fascination with the cold.

393
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:58,025
Well, a few winters here,
will change that, I'm sure.

394
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:01,278
Excuse me.

395
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,658
I hope you're having a good time.

396
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,827
I'm sorry there aren't more children here.

397
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:12,039
Thank you, it's very nice.

398
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,043
Oh, wait...
I have something for you.

399
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,051
I know you're not...

400
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:27,554
I mean...

401
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:31,517
well, everyone should be able
to take part in a celebration.

402
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,393
Right?

403
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:39,107
Thank you... you're much too kind.

404
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:47,658
Oh! I almost forgot.

405
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:51,787
Jakob...

406
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:53,789
why don't you pose with Athos?

407
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:56,458
Oh. Hmm.

408
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,877
Come.

409
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,587
Good.

410
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:02,798
Smile.

411
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,979
Oh, thanks, Jakob.

412
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:21,483
Too much champagne.

413
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,611
I'll feel better in the morning.

414
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,992
Mmm!

415
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,952
Ah, excellent.

416
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:34,371
I taught you well.

417
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:36,915
You didn't open your present.

418
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,002
What do you think it is?

419
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:41,753
Refrigerator?

420
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,130
Locomotive?

421
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,840
A frog?

422
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,092
Open it.

423
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:04,776
Put it on.

424
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,245
Ah... looks good on you.

425
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:17,706
What is it?

426
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,960
My god.

427
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,754
Stay where you are.

428
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,798
Oh... careful.

429
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:41,438
Now what?

430
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:46,860
I'm... um, I'm sorry to bother you.

431
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,529
- Everything all right?
- Ah...

432
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:51,240
This crazy storm.

433
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:53,116
Do you want to come in?

434
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:55,744
Ohh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you... Um...

435
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:59,498
I was wondering if...
if you had any extra candles?

436
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:02,417
Of course... take this one.

437
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:05,128
- I'll bring you some more.
- Thank you.

438
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,006
I'm, uh, sorry to bother you.

439
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:09,424
It's... it's...

440
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,134
it's my husband... he...

441
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:12,678
What is it?

442
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:15,138
Oh, he doesn't take too well to, huh...

443
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,517
I shouldn't leave him alone too long.

444
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:20,853
Uh'hm.

445
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:07,501
So, this book you're writing.

446
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:09,086
"Bearing False Witness".

447
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:10,671
But it's not really a book yet.

448
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:13,423
Just a lot of notes, ideas.

449
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:16,468
Who knows if I ever finish it.

450
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:19,888
And, uh, it's about what happened during the war?

451
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:23,392
Well, uh, it's about the abuse of history.

452
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:27,521
It starts, uh, with Biskupin in Poland...

453
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,273
where I met Jakob.

454
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,984
10 years ago,
a river dried up there...

455
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,945
and people started
finding artifacts.

456
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:38,198
But then the Nazis came and they buried everything.

457
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:39,575
As far as they were concerned...

458
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:42,202
there couldn't possibly be an advanced culture...

459
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:43,912
that they didn't create.

460
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:47,499
So they destroyed the evidence.

461
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:50,711
It's a good thing you're doing.

462
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,797
Already, people say the things I lived through...

463
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:56,300
never happened.

464
01:01:57,176 --> 01:01:59,303
You'd think they'd at least wait a few years...

465
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,763
until we're all dead.

466
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,060
The mitzvah that you did...

467
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,188
for that boy...

468
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:10,481
it's a blessed thing.

469
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:12,858
Did you know...

470
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:18,113
that Joseph was a conductor in Warsaw...

471
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:20,741
- Huh.
- Before the war?

472
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,035
A very good conductor.

473
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:25,329
Oh, not that good.

474
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:28,707
And he's a very good piano teacher too.

475
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,334
Parents pay me...

476
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:33,170
and children resent me.

477
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,421
Is that good teaching?

478
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,298
Don't listen to him.

479
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:38,759
- Thank you.
- My Sara...

480
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,677
she was a singer.

481
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,971
Not bad either.

482
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:46,433
Now I sell dry goods in the market.

483
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:50,020
I'm the singing dry goods lady.

484
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,691
Things change.

485
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:17,297
Some more sugar.

486
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:16,565
You eat so slowly...

487
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,984
like an aristocrat.

488
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:32,748
I think about her too.

489
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,751
You think she's dead.

490
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,295
I don't know, Jakob.

491
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:41,256
Maybe it's better to hope.

492
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:53,268
Listen...
when I feel things...

493
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,939
building up inside me, I write.

494
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:59,233
You have also something to express.

495
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:01,276
So...

496
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:05,322
you will write too.

497
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:08,534
Write what?

498
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:11,161
What you must.

499
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,163
There is an old saying:

500
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:15,499
"The great mystery of wood is not that it burns...

501
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:17,209
but that it floats".

502
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:20,295
No.

503
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:23,757
There is a good and bad side to everything.

504
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:27,636
You can choose to see what destroys something...

505
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:30,806
or what saves it.

506
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:52,578
"There is earth that never leaves your hands...

507
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:55,414
rain that never leaves your bones".

508
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:59,626
"At night, memory roams your skin".

509
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:03,338
"While you sleep, the sea floods your house".

510
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:05,257
"You wake in the bog...

511
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:08,343
burning with the smell of earth"

512
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:12,264
"Nothing releases you...

513
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:16,101
not death in the dream, not waking".

514
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:20,397
"This is how one becomes undone, by a smell...

515
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:23,275
a word, a place...

516
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:25,861
a photo of a mountain of shoes".

517
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:31,492
"By love that closes its
mouth before calling a name".

518
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,412
Jakob, it's beautiful.

519
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:39,374
Beautiful.

520
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,382
Ohh, damn you.

521
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:50,594
Look at us, huh?

522
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:53,639
Uh?... Ah'hah.

523
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:58,310
The two bachelors crying into our coffees.

524
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,990
Okay.

525
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,953
Then I'm going to do some work of my own.

526
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,291
Ben, it's getting late.

527
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,419
Your parents will think we kidnapped you.

528
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:31,093
I know you're not asleep.

529
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:35,389
Come on, Ben.

530
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,979
Come on, time for bed.

531
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:57,411
Ah, there you are.

532
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,955
Did he fall asleep?

533
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:03,250
Come on, now, time for bed.

534
01:08:04,126 --> 01:08:06,628
Don't make me go.

535
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:14,261
Ben.

536
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:17,306
Come on, Ben.
Ben, Ben.

537
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:19,475
Come on.

538
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:21,602
Okay... go on.

539
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:24,313
Good night.

540
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:28,108
You always know, Jakob.

541
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:29,401
If he ever gives you any trouble...

542
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,069
you just send him back, huh?

543
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:33,947
- He can overstay his welcome.
- It's no trouble.

544
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,658
- Good night.
- Good night.

545
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,927
You should rest. It's not good for you...

546
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:57,888
to work night after night like this.

547
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:01,558
There is an old Greek saying.

548
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:05,771
"Light your candle before night overtakes you".

549
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:08,273
You have a saying for everything.

550
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:41,218
That was a beautiful ceremony.

551
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,178
So many people.

552
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:44,888
Yeah.

553
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:50,435
You know, when you first came here...

554
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:53,188
you were what... 11?

555
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:57,276
- Mmm-hmm.
- Just a little bit older than Ben.

556
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:05,534
Hey! What's this?

557
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:09,580
An apple.

558
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,498
Is an apple food?

559
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:13,250
Why do you throw it away?

560
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,294
I don't want the other half.

561
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:19,214
Can you imagine?

562
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:22,634
Take it.

563
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,352
I said take it!

564
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:33,896
During the war...

565
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,064
everything had value, no matter how small.

566
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:38,484
A button, a pencil, a spoon!

567
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:40,235
Not to mention the things
that could make you weep.

568
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:42,613
A good pair of shoes.

569
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:45,365
Hot water, a scrap of food.

570
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:48,368
Isn't that right, Jakob?

571
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:52,164
Now my own son throws away an apple.

572
01:12:52,164 --> 01:12:54,333
Joseph.

573
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,337
Well, if my only son doesn't even
understand the value of things...

574
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:01,256
why did we even survive?

575
01:13:10,307 --> 01:13:12,684
I'm sorry.

576
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,926
Why don't you play something?

577
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,225
I know I have written to you before.

578
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:38,645
This letter is in regards to a missing person.

579
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:41,857
First name Bella... last name Beer.

580
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:45,569
Biskupin, Poland, 1942.

581
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:48,322
Age fifteen.

582
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:57,664
I'm seeking any information...

583
01:14:57,664 --> 01:15:00,125
regarding her possible whereabouts...

584
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,461
Please post the following
every Friday for one year.

585
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:03,754
I know the records are incomplete...

586
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:05,339
I know I have written to you before.

587
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:07,341
Check your list, taking into account...

588
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:09,384
possible variations of spelling.

589
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:12,221
First name Bella, last name Beer.

590
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,306
Age fifteen.

591
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:35,304
Jakob...

592
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,514
I want to tell you something.

593
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:44,438
Hello?

594
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:45,439
Jakob?

595
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,107
It's Ben, how are you?

596
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:49,151
Oh, hi, Ben. Uh, I'm fine.

597
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:51,945
- I'm just sleeping.
- We were thinking of you.

598
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:54,656
How are things in Hydra?

599
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:57,367
Good... how's Naomi?

600
01:16:57,743 --> 01:17:00,329
- She's fine.
- And your dad?

601
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:03,081
How's he, since...

602
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:05,584
He's okay.

603
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:07,211
Well, I'll be seeing him soon.

604
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:10,380
I'll be back for class, in a couple of weeks.

605
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,299
- That soon?
- Yeah.

606
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:14,343
Okay, hang on.

607
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:17,095
- Jakob!
- Hi, Naomi.

608
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:18,263
Good to hear your voice.

609
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:19,640
Well, say you'll come to dinner.

610
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,434
Oh yes, of course, soon as I get back.

611
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:24,228
Great.

612
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,121
Finally!

613
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:45,040
How was your trip?

614
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:47,125
Oh, you remembered my olive oil.

615
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,003
How could I forget?

616
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:54,132
Hi!

617
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,677
Welcome back.

618
01:17:57,469 --> 01:18:00,222
Listen, there's this woman
from the museum knows.

619
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:02,641
She's a curator, very smart.

620
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:04,560
Oh, no!

621
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,103
All right, then.

622
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:07,437
"All right", what?

623
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:09,857
Invite her over sometime.

624
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:11,859
Uh'hu...

625
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:14,987
Well, actually, she already did.

626
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,536
Jakob... Michaela.

627
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:49,938
Naomi's had us on her thesis diet for months now.

628
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,356
When I was doing the Russians...

629
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:53,692
all we ever ate was cabbage soup and perigees.

630
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:55,235
Then it was the Latin Americans.

631
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:57,488
Empanadas, rice, beans.

632
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:58,989
And now it's Sweden.

633
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:00,866
And every other day, we're eating salted fish.

634
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:01,909
That's not true!

635
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:04,578
And... what's wrong with salted fish anyway?

636
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:05,579
You know, when I was small...

637
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:07,748
I was obsessed with salt.

638
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:09,917
I think it started because we traveled so much...

639
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:11,835
and everywhere, I kept hearing about salt.

640
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:13,754
City of salt.

641
01:19:13,754 --> 01:19:16,465
Road of salt.

642
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:20,219
And in the Sahara,
there were entire cities built of salt.

643
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:22,930
I used to imagine caravans...

644
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:26,517
weighed down with thick cakes of salt.

645
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:29,144
I'm talking too much.

646
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:33,190
So, Naomi.

647
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,818
- How's your project?
- Um, good.

648
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:39,238
I... Collect songs and lullabies
from everywhere in the world.

649
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:42,491
Become a kind of a mania with me.

650
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:45,661
A song for every occasion... or person.

651
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:48,163
By now I can match a song or a ballad to anyone.

652
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,791
- What about Jak...
- What about Mich...

653
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:52,376
What about Jakob?

654
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:54,336
- What about Michaela?
- Jakob. No!

655
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:56,380
No, I don't...

656
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,966
Try, try. Um...

657
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:03,095
Well, for you, I... I would have to say,
"Moorsoldaten"...

658
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:05,139
Hmm...

659
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,474
"The peat bog soldiers".

660
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:13,021
Peat bog.

661
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:15,816
You're very good.

662
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:18,235
Do you know the song?

663
01:20:18,235 --> 01:20:20,320
Oh, yeah.

664
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,115
- It's... well, it's...
- Huh...

665
01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:26,952
it was written by prisoners during the war.

666
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:29,371
And they weren't allowed to
sing anything but marching songs...

667
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:30,789
while they were working...

668
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:33,417
so they wrote something that
sounded like a marching song...

669
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:34,585
but...

670
01:20:34,585 --> 01:20:36,962
Well, really, it's a song about hope.

671
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:38,964
Sing it.

672
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:41,967
Uh...

673
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:48,474
"Wherever the eye may wonder...

674
01:20:48,474 --> 01:20:53,270
heath and bog everywhere".

675
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:58,442
"Birdsongs brings no solace...

676
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:02,154
and trees stand bare".

677
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,827
Very good.

678
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:11,330
So, you still live in Greece.

679
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,831
Back and forth.

680
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,876
I write there, teach here.

681
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:19,338
How long have you known Naomi?

682
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:22,925
Well, to tell you the truth, not that long.

683
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:25,844
I've only been at the museum a few months.

684
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:28,472
How long have you known each other?

685
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:30,182
Well, I've known Ben all his life, really.

686
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:31,350
I was there when he was born.

687
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:35,145
His parents lived in the apartment next to ours.

688
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:38,106
Ben was very premature.

689
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,775
And when his mother went into labor...

690
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:42,736
His father came running Into our apartment in a panic.

691
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:45,405
And Athos, my godfather, was away at a conference...

692
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:47,449
so I called the ambulance and...

693
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:50,869
anyway, I ended up being at the
hospital when she gave birth.

694
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:54,164
When they brought him from the delivery room...

695
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:56,458
He weighed less than three pounds.

696
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:59,002
So small.

697
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:02,923
In this almost transparent body.

698
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:06,218
He was like a spirit.

699
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:10,055
Not even a person.

700
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:14,268
No bigger than my hand.

701
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,944
Take off your coat.

702
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:08,363
I'll make some tea.

703
01:23:22,628 --> 01:23:23,712
Oh, this is...

704
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:26,048
From my mother's side of the family.

705
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:28,675
She's Russian, he's Spanish.

706
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:32,054
Fabulous arguments, as you can imagine.

707
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,056
And they used to go on for hours.

708
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:36,934
What stamina.

709
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:39,478
Hmm.

710
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,565
Hmm.

711
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:45,734
What?

712
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,153
Lemon.

713
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:51,198
Why? You... you want milk?

714
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,659
No.

715
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,919
Even the horror of the past...

716
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:48,505
you try to reinvent it and re-imagine it.

717
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,549
Like my grandmother.

718
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:53,302
Yeah, sort of.

719
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:56,263
Not always so amusingly.

720
01:24:57,723 --> 01:25:00,100
Take specific moments and...

721
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:02,769
your mind fills in the gaps.

722
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:05,939
I've spent years trying to imagine...

723
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:08,358
Bella's route from the house.

724
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,445
Where did she die?

725
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:15,949
In the street?
In the train?

726
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,243
In the barracks?

727
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:20,621
You try to reconstruct...

728
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:23,707
visualize every possible scenario.

729
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:28,086
I used to dream that maybe she escaped.

730
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:33,842
I haven't dreamt that in a long time.

731
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:38,013
I also used to wonder...

732
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:40,766
what might have happened if I'd stayed.

733
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:45,896
Waited in the house instead of running away.

734
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:50,025
Maybe she came back.

735
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:02,746
There's a poem by Akhmatova.

736
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:07,334
"You are many years late...

737
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:11,547
how happy I am to see you".

738
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:49,585
Joseph?

739
01:26:57,342 --> 01:26:59,094
Joseph?

740
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:06,560
We shouldn't tell the rabbi...

741
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,104
or they won't let him into the cemetery.

742
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:13,692
At least he waited 'till my mother died.

743
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:16,278
I still can't believe he would do that...

744
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,655
after everything he went through.

745
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:21,200
Your father suffered a lot, Ben.

746
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,618
He didn't suffer.

747
01:27:22,618 --> 01:27:25,204
He was impenetrable.

748
01:27:26,497 --> 01:27:29,291
Can I ask you something?

749
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:36,089
I don't understand how you could
have gone through what you did...

750
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:38,383
and still be so generous,

751
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,594
Still write the things you do.

752
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:43,847
I used to think that if I understood you...

753
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:46,141
I could understand my father better.

754
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:49,728
But it's like you're from different worlds.

755
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:53,774
Well, I don't think so.

756
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:57,528
Your father told me not long ago...

757
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:00,280
that he still would dream...

758
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,616
about his mother and father.

759
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:04,576
The smallest things.

760
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:07,871
The detail of his mother's coat, a button...

761
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:10,457
his father's shoes, outside in the rain.

762
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:12,668
And that when he woke up in the morning...

763
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:15,295
old as he was...

764
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:18,841
he was still crying.

765
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:46,887
After years of trying to be closer to them...

766
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:49,973
I now fear that I am only haunting...

767
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:53,101
my parents and Bella with my calling,

768
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,688
Startling them awake in their black beds.

769
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,570
All the years I've felt Bella entreating me...

770
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,614
filled with her loneliness...

771
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:08,450
I have misunderstood her signals.

772
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:15,123
Like other ghosts, she whispers...

773
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:18,460
not for me to join her...

774
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:21,338
but so that when I'm close enough...

775
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:24,758
she can push me back into the world.

776
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:10,888
Whoa!

777
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:14,308
Ah!

778
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:44,630
Mmm.

779
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,964
Garlic.

780
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:48,509
And, uh...

781
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:53,305
Basil.

782
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:05,859
Mmm. Sweat.

783
01:32:07,653 --> 01:32:09,404
Honey.

784
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:15,619
Mm, oh, coconut oil.

785
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:19,081
Salt.

786
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:22,204
Read it.

787
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:29,253
You sure?

788
01:34:56,864 --> 01:35:00,993
"I did not witness the most important events of my life".

789
01:35:00,993 --> 01:35:04,913
My deepest story must be told by a blind man...

790
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:08,750
from behind a wall, from underground...

791
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:13,338
from the corner of a small house on a small island...

792
01:35:13,338 --> 01:35:17,676
that juts like a bone from the skin of sea.

793
01:35:17,676 --> 01:35:23,015
While I hid in the radiant light of Athos' island...

794
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:26,602
thousands suffocated in darkness.

795
01:35:26,602 --> 01:35:29,563
While I hid in
the luxury of a room...

796
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:32,691
thousands were stuffed into crawlspaces...

797
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:36,236
stables, pigsties.

798
01:35:36,904 --> 01:35:39,364
While I was learning Greek and English...

799
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:42,201
learning geology and poetry...

800
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:46,288
Jews were filling the corners and cracks of Europe.

801
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:50,250
I didn't know that while I listened to stories of explorers...

802
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,712
a Jew could be purchased for a quart of brandy...

803
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:57,466
for sugar, cigarettes.

804
01:35:59,343 --> 01:36:02,387
What do our bodies make us believe?

805
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:07,518
That we're never ourselves,
until we contain two souls.

806
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:10,646
Now I'm not afraid when harvesting darkness.

807
01:36:10,646 --> 01:36:14,233
Night after night it is happiness that wakes me.

808
01:36:14,233 --> 01:36:18,570
There is room at last for everyone I have ever loved.

809
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:22,866
As Michaela approaches,
I shake like a compass needle...

810
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:26,328
feeling for the first time a future...

811
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:30,666
my words, my life, no longer separate...

812
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:33,377
after decades of hiding in my skin.

813
01:36:33,377 --> 01:36:38,423
"Here is a woman who will slowly undress my spirit...

814
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:42,511
bring my body to belief".

815
01:37:22,009 --> 01:37:24,136
We're gonna be late.

816
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,222
Coming.

817
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:35,230
Your Heart's desire is she's a girl,
Bella if he's a boy, Bela.

818
01:38:00,589 --> 01:38:03,842
"Each morning I write these words for you all...

819
01:38:03,842 --> 01:38:08,639
for Bella and Athos and Elena, for Alex...

820
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,809
for Joseph and Sara, for...

821
01:38:11,809 --> 01:38:14,978
Ben and Naomi, for Michaela.

822
01:38:14,978 --> 01:38:17,940
Michaela.

823
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,275
I can describe what her wrists look like...

824
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:22,861
or how her hair grows at the back of her neck.

825
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:28,408
But more, I know what she remembers.

826
01:38:29,117 --> 01:38:31,787
I know her memories.

827
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:39,169
I pray that soon my wife will
feel new breath inside her own.

828
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:44,216
I pray and press my head against
her side, and whisper a story.

829
01:38:47,803 --> 01:38:53,517
Child I long for, child I dream...

830
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:59,606
if we conceive you, think of us sometimes...

831
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:02,651
your mother and me, when it rains.

832
01:39:02,651 --> 01:39:05,654
And one day, when you've almost forgotten...

833
01:39:05,654 --> 01:39:08,907
I pray you'll let us return.

834
01:39:08,907 --> 01:39:12,452
That through an open window,
even in the middle of a city...

835
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:16,623
the sea air of our marriage will find you.

836
01:39:17,082 --> 01:39:18,417
I pray that one day...

837
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:20,627
in a room lit only by night snow...

838
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:23,255
you will suddenly know how miraculous...

839
01:39:23,255 --> 01:39:25,924
is your parents' love for each other.

840
01:39:28,427 --> 01:39:32,473
My son, my daughter...

841
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:35,142
Bella.

842
01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:37,144
Bela.

843
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:40,063
If we conceive you...

844
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:43,066
know that once I was lost in a forest.

845
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,735
I was so afraid...

846
01:39:44,735 --> 01:39:46,445
my blood pounded in my chest...

847
01:39:46,445 --> 01:39:50,782
and I knew my heartstrings would soon be exhausted.

848
01:39:50,782 --> 01:39:53,827
I saved myself without thinking.

849
01:39:53,827 --> 01:39:56,705
I grasped the two syllables closest to me...

850
01:39:56,705 --> 01:40:00,334
and replaced my heartbeat with your name.

851
01:40:00,334 --> 01:40:02,085
Bella.

852
01:40:05,255 --> 01:40:10,135
Now I see that I must give what I most need".
