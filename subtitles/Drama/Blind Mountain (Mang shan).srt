1
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,200
Watch carefully. Open your hand

2
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,730
Hi.

3
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,520
Two rooms. Our l. D.'s.

4
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,020
My back kills.
All this just for a few bucks.

5
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,390
I can't take much more either.

6
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,020
Hey! Hu!

7
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,210
What?

8
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,850
How much money are we going to make?

9
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,220
At least five hundred.

10
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,030
If we're lucky, even nine hundred.

11
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,740
Really? Then I'll be able...

12
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,910
to pay back my family's debt.

13
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,460
Certainly. After a few trips.

14
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,630
Hu, I'm so lucky to have met you.

15
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,200
I couldn't find a job even
after looking for a month.

16
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,400
My family spent tons
of money on my college,

17
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,280
But I still couldn't find a job.

18
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,330
If I can make some money,
I'll have to thank you.

19
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,920
Forget it. After all, we're friends.

20
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,500
Don't be silly.

21
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,190
I like helping others. It's my way.
Why be selfish?

22
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,260
Bai Xuemei, listen up.

23
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,880
You got to be tough for this job.

24
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,050
It's not bad. Sounds like a fun way
to make a buck. Easy!

25
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,490
If the money is good,
I don't care how hard the work is.

26
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,230
That's good.

27
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,210
We found rare herbs for making medicine.

28
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,160
Let's see how well you'll do.

29
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,480
Manager Wu, don't worry.

30
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,740
She's got good people skills.

31
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,280
Just smile at them.

32
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,440
Those herb-picking
hicks will be all yours.

33
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,770
Then we'll get a top price.

34
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,310
You're the one who'll make them go crazy.

35
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,380
Oh, what a turn on!

36
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,180
Stop it!

37
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,990
Hey, not so hard.

38
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,540
Play somewhere else.

39
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,720
We're going to look
for the herb pickers.

40
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,640
Wait here. Keep an eye on our stuff.

41
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,210
Okay.

42
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,520
Mister!

43
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,570
Hello. Where's Manager Wu?

44
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,180
Who's that?

45
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,510
From the Chinese medicine company.

46
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
What company? Never heard of it.

47
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,400
Here's his business card.

48
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,870
Have you seen my wallet and l. D.?

49
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,760
I swear, we didn't take your stuff.

50
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,900
Thanks. I'll go look for them.

51
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,970
Where are you going?

52
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,940
What?

53
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,130
You can't leave.

54
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,530
What do you want H

55
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,130
Miss, I'll tell you.

56
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,440
Your family sold
you to be my son's wife.

57
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,090
That's impossible. They're not family.

58
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,100
They hired me to work for them.

59
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,730
You could be lying.

60
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,180
The fact is I bought you for 7,000.

61
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,890
Now you're my son's wife.

62
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,420
Mister, they really aren't my family.

63
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,050
They lied to you.
I'm going to the police.

64
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,720
You're not going anywhere!

65
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,870
This can't be happening!

66
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,710
Miss, all girls end up married.

67
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,250
You married my son,
so we'll treat you as family.

68
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,400
Are you out of your mind?

69
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,690
You can't go.

70
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,850
I beg you, let me go.

71
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,030
Grab her.

72
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,590
They are not my family.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,090
I promise. Please, let me go.

74
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,070
Just ignore her. She'll tire of yelling.

75
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,050
What do you want?

76
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,140
Get out of here!

77
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,250
Cheers!

78
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,470
Drink or remain a bachelor!

79
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,560
Same for your son and grandson!
No women, ever!

80
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,000
Drink up or else no women
in your next life either!

81
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,110
A pack of cigarettes.

82
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
How was it?

83
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,230
How was what?

84
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,450
How'd it feel?

85
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
What?

86
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,480
You know, in bed.

87
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,770
Real good.

88
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,450
You're full of it.
How do we know you really did it?

89
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,620
Because I did.

90
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,730
Oh yeah? Tell me, are her tits big?

91
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,470
Shut the fuck up!

92
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,210
I can tell he didn't do it.

93
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,190
I know you're a good person.

94
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,860
Please let me go.

95
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,250
Eat first.

96
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,370
If you let me go,
I'll thank you for the rest of my life.

97
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,730
Please.

98
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,340
I'll be good to you just
as long as you stay.

99
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,010
No way.

100
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,260
Then give the 7,000 back to me
and I'll let you go.

101
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,430
I'll write a letter to my father.

102
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,920
I'll ask him to send the money, okay?

103
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,300
You think I'm stupid?

104
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,920
Your father will bring the police.

105
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,730
I'll have wasted the money on you.

106
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,020
You know you could go to jail
for buying a wife?

107
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,110
Fuck jail.

108
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,060
Everyone does it.
City people spend even more.

109
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,680
What are you doing here?

110
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,870
I can come if I want.

111
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,950
Not in bed with your wife?

112
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,040
You'd rather hang out with us?

113
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,580
What's it to you? I'll come if I want.

114
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,590
Your damn temper hasn't changed!

115
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,330
I bet she won't sleep with you.

116
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,870
If she won't sleep with you,
just beat her.

117
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,930
Is this girl faking
marriage to rip you off?

118
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,420
It doesn't seem like it.

119
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,810
Be careful. People are up
to no good these days.

120
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,960
Don't let her run away.

121
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,980
Make sure you sleep with her first.

122
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,380
Get her pregnant,
and she won't want to run.

123
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,290
All you do is smoke.
Go use your dick for a change.

124
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,160
Go back to your wife
and take care of business.

125
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,080
Snake eyes!

126
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,330
I won!

127
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,380
Out all night! What good are you?

128
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,460
Stop! Where are you going?

129
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,340
She's too strong.

130
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,950
You can't even handle a girl.

131
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,070
Aren't you man enough? Get in there.

132
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,500
My girl, all women go through this.

133
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,870
You have to get married too.

134
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,690
If you do this, we'll treat you well.

135
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,970
Get out!

136
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,760
We can't let her get away with this! Go!

137
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,380
Damn it! Come and help.

138
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
Fuck!

139
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,830
Hello, Teacher Huang.

140
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,260
- Hello. - Decheng,

141
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,720
- off to school? - Yeah.

142
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,110
Degui, did you do it?

143
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,980
You bet. Come over for a drink soon.

144
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,550
Damn, look at how happy you are.

145
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,210
Mister Degui, where's our wedding candy?

146
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,610
Get lost. What stupid candy!

147
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,630
No wedding candy,
the groom wets his bed.

148
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,550
No wedding candy,
the groom wets his bed.

149
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,780
Get to school!

150
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,620
Fourth graders, work on homework.

151
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,020
Third graders, read with me.

152
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,650
Confucius goes to Lao Zi.

153
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,640
"Confucius was a famous teacher
early in his life."

154
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,760
"He never felt he had enough knowledge."

155
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,480
"At the age of 30,
he left his hometown of Qufu."

156
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,070
"He went to Luoyang to ask the
philosopher Laozi to teach him."

157
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,480
Eat.

158
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
You can't change things.
You might as well take care of yourself.

159
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm sorry, but I really had no choice.

160
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,120
When you have a child,
you'll know what I mean.

161
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,640
Our family spent so much money on you.

162
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,350
I hope you can do your duty as a wife.

163
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,660
Who married your son?

164
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,090
Animal! You're all animals! Get out l

165
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,600
What? Want a beating?

166
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,290
Go on, beat me to death!

167
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,890
Degui, forget it.

168
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,720
Forget it. That's enough.

169
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,880
Get her!

170
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,720
- Help me! - Get her! Stop her!

171
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,750
Help me!

172
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,550
Where are you fucking going?

173
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,390
Come back.

174
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,870
Hey, what's going on here?

175
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,610
Village Chief, she's trying to run away.

176
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,650
Help me! I was kidnapped!

177
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,250
Stop yelling. If you were kidnapped,
what proof do you have?

178
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,320
You want to run away even though
they handed over a dowry?

179
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,800
Aren't you the one who's cheating them?

180
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,950
She must be faking marriage
for the money.

181
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,450
I never took their money.

182
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,540
If I had, then you could
throw me in jail.

183
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,820
Who'd fucking do that?
Who'd pay me back?

184
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,540
Please help me. I'm telling the truth.

185
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,590
Who knows if you're telling the truth?
Where's your lD?

186
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,590
My lD? It was stolen.

187
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,970
You don't even have an lD.
How can anyone believe you?

188
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,410
Go on back with them for now.

189
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,670
The village council will look into this.

190
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,230
It's settled. Go on back.

191
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,910
Go on.

192
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,430
Thanks.

193
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,800
I won't chain you up if you stop...

194
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,120
trying to run away.

195
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,740
Fourth Uncle! Fourth Aunt!

196
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Have a seat. Get some water.

197
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,120
No thanks.

198
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,590
We're here to collect the pig tax.

199
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,430
The total is 38.40.

200
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,400
That's right.

201
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,900
I sold the pig two months ago.

202
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,410
Really? Did you pay any tax?

203
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,630
Show us the receipt.

204
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,050
Go get it.

205
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,370
Pig tax, pork tax, income tax.
Got to pay them all.

206
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,150
You still owe 1 8.20.

207
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,270
But we don't have any pigs now.

208
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,500
It doesn't matter.
That's the rule from above.

209
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,210
Don't make things hard on us.

210
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,740
Ignore her. My woman's gone crazy.

211
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,400
Help me!

212
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,630
We don't handle family matters.

213
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,430
You're damn lucky!

214
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,810
Control her. Words alone
can't fucking get the job done.

215
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,360
It's just like tax. Got to be forceful.

216
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,060
Okay.

217
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:32,360
Help me!

218
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,210
Stop yelling or
I'll beat your fucking mouth in.

219
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,490
Okay, that's enough.

220
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,390
Bitch, I can make you obey me.

221
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,720
Go on. That's enough.

222
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,470
Mom, how's she today?

223
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,940
She's been quiet.

224
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,650
Mom!

225
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,430
- Decheng, I need money.
- What happened?

226
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,310
My wife slit her wrist.

227
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,120
Go back inside and study.

228
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,660
Hurry and take her to the hospital.

229
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,040
Doctor!

230
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,150
What?

231
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,230
She slit her wrist.

232
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,160
To the operation room.

233
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,140
Go on! Hurry!

234
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,730
Doctor, please save my daughter-in-law.

235
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,530
What happened?

236
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,720
She slit her wrist.

237
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,280
Put her on the bed inside.

238
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,120
Where's her husband?

239
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,520
Here.

240
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,630
Did you bring money?

241
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,520
Yeah, but not much.

242
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,510
Go pay.

243
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,980
Doctor, is she going to die?

244
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,470
Save her first.

245
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,910
You have to pay first.

246
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,870
Why's medicine
so fucking expensive now?

247
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,880
Hospitals are all the same.
Doctors all get a cut.

248
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,730
This hospital is okay.
Larger ones are more corrupt.

249
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,470
Ok. Don't worry.

250
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,140
Do you feel better?

251
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,200
I'm Chen. She's Deng.

252
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,910
Your mother-in-law asked us
to talk to you.

253
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,730
She's not my mother-in-law.

254
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,130
Hold him.

255
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,620
Actually,

256
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,370
we were bought like you.

257
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,910
Want to sit?

258
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,770
Listen.

259
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,650
You can't change things now.

260
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,520
Accept it or you'll make things worse.

261
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,680
That's right.

262
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,900
Just look at the mess in here.

263
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,660
Do you have a comb? I'll comb your hair.

264
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,100
Four years ago, I felt the same way.

265
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,720
I couldn't take my husband's beatings.

266
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,020
Chen, help me to escape.

267
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,600
You'll never make it.

268
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,710
Who doesn't want to escape?

269
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,590
There's only one road out.

270
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,140
It is blocked. There's no way out.

271
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,050
If I can't escape, I'd rather die.

272
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,560
Don't do anything crazy.

273
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,530
It's easy to die. Living is what's hard.

274
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,500
Just think of your parents.

275
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,040
You owe it to them...

276
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,800
to keep on living.

277
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,770
Wait until you can go about more freely.

278
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,450
Then think of a way to run away.

279
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,300
Chen, want a drink?

280
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,760
No thanks.

281
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,500
We have to go. Come see us soon.

282
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,130
Take care.

283
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,280
Okay.

284
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,160
Come and see me.

285
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,450
Why'd you buy two piglets?

286
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,710
Why not? We have to pay the tax anyway.

287
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,770
Where'd you get the money?

288
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,050
Borrowed it.

289
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,580
You always borrow money.
See if you can pay it back!

290
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,980
Women don't understand shit.

291
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,110
Fourth Uncle.

292
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,900
You've come. Come in.

293
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,090
Did you buy these piglets?

294
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,150
Borrowed them.

295
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,410
Where's my cousin?

296
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,630
In the field.

297
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,860
Cousin, are you feeling better?

298
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,390
I'm not your cousin!

299
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,470
Sorry. I'm your husband's cousin.
My name is Decheng.

300
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,410
My name means "integrity."

301
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,450
You're that teacher.
Thanks for saving my life.

302
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,560
I didn't do anything.
I've wanted to stop by.

303
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,970
Teacher Huang,
just call me by my first name.

304
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,850
I shouldn't. Don't call me 'teacher.'

305
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,560
You were in school longer than me.

306
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,230
I brought you a few books.
I hope you'll like them..

307
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't have any good books.

308
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,960
Uncle, see you!

309
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,920
You just read these stupid books!
Feed the pigs!

310
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,000
Are you trying to burn the pigs?

311
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,070
If anything happens to them,
I'll beat you to death!

312
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,410
Village Chief! Village Chief!

313
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,270
Village Chief!

314
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,450
What is it?

315
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,740
She wants to see you.

316
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,260
Oh, your case.
I'm still looking into it.

317
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,560
I still haven't heard back
from the police.

318
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,240
Go on back.

319
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,510
I'll let you know when I hear something.

320
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,120
Thank you.

321
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,880
No problem.

322
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,680
Get back to your game.

323
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,630
Take care.

324
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
Snake eyes!

325
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,130
Royal flush!

326
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,730
Chen, I can't take it.

327
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,370
Which road should I take to run away?

328
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,870
Don't take the big road.
Take the small path out.

329
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,750
Once over the mountain,
you'll see the main road.

330
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,220
Then you'll have made it.

331
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,950
Which mountain?

332
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,020
The tallest mountain over there.

333
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,060
Auntie, what are you singing?

334
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,630
Do you like it?

335
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,740
Yes.

336
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,570
What's your name?

337
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,770
Li Qingshan.

338
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,950
Are you in school?

339
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,130
Yes.

340
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:47,920
Which grade?

341
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,120
Fourth.

342
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,470
Don't call me Auntie.

343
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,010
Call me Sister Bai, okay?

344
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,150
Okay.

345
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,370
Go on. Say it.

346
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,590
Sister Bai.

347
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,270
You're here.

348
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,010
So this is your college-educated wife.

349
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,390
You owe me a drink.

350
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,850
Then come over for a drink.

351
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,010
Next time.

352
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,850
- See you.
- Take care.

353
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,110
She's listening to you now, right?
I told you she just needed a beating.

354
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,710
It's 1 5.80.

355
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,990
Put it on my tab.

356
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,880
Come and get this.

357
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,420
Come if you need anything.

358
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,280
What do you want?

359
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,470
A bag of salt.

360
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,370
See that woman? She tried to run away.

361
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,880
Same thing would happen to you.

362
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,200
Chen, I'm going to run away.

363
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,450
Be careful.

364
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,520
If you make it, tell my folks I'm here.

365
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,530
Ask them to come save me.

366
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,630
Okay.

367
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,890
Where are you going?

368
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,070
To pee.

369
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,030
Have you seen Xue Mei?

370
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,910
Not good for much,
but sure knows how to pee.

371
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,220
Your clothes got washed away.

372
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,930
You two follow the road.
Er Hu, follow me.

373
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,400
Excuse me, which way into town?

374
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,030
Thanks.

375
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,600
Have you seen a woman run by?

376
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,930
- Have you see her?
- No.

377
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,280
To the town.

378
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,850
Hi, can you give me a ride?

379
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,560
- Where to?
- lnto town.

380
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,720
- Three bucks.
- I don't have any money.

381
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,150
Then forget it.
I usually charge five bucks.

382
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,800
Please help me. I don't have any money.

383
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,370
No way. If everyone wanted a free ride,
I'd be broke.

384
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,660
Help me.

385
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,860
You thought you could run away!

386
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,080
Let me go.

387
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,630
Come back.

388
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,570
You still run away?

389
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,810
I give you stuff to eat
and buy you new clothes.

390
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,890
What else do you want?

391
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,430
- Stop beating her. You'll kill her.
- Stay out of it.

392
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,040
Bitch, I can make you obey me if I want.

393
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,460
Sister Bai, here you are.
It's still warm.

394
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,710
No, thanks.

395
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,010
Take it.

396
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,770
Thank you.

397
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,470
Fourth Aunt.

398
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,390
You're here.

399
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,310
I wanted to come earlier,
but I've been too busy.

400
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,900
Are you better?
I borrowed some more books for you.

401
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,890
Thanks.

402
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,310
The people here aren't well educated.
They're barbaric.

403
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,030
I'm the only one
who went to high school.

404
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,460
I always dreamed of going to college.

405
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,620
I wanted to leave this mountain village.

406
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,480
I never did well on the entrance exam.

407
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,180
I could only come back to teach.

408
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,720
Isn't it good being a teacher?

409
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,120
Sure.

410
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,930
But the pay is low,
and we don't get paid on time.

411
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,040
I've had it. I feel like quitting.

412
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,910
Don't laugh at me.

413
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,990
I'm a teacher
but haven't even seen a train.

414
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,240
I've seen a train.

415
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,660
Look what happened?
I was still kidnapped.

416
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,700
How could you have believed those guys?

417
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,450
I really don't know.

418
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,430
I had just graduated

419
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,590
and couldn't find a good job.

420
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
My folks owed lots of people money.

421
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,970
My brother also needed tuition.

422
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,140
I wanted to help
my folks pay back the money.

423
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,500
And help my brother pay tuition.

424
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,690
They said I'd make lots of money
by selling medicine.

425
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,520
So I came here with them.

426
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,110
After I came here,
I drank a cup of water.

427
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,420
Then I don't remember what happened.

428
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,740
Tell me,

429
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,570
What was it like to live
on a college campus?

430
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,310
Nothing special.

431
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,120
What a waste marrying him.

432
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:26,550
I didn't marry him.

433
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,500
Decheng, can you help me?

434
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:40,960
I do feel great sympathy for you.
I do want to help you.

435
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,410
Really? Then can you help me to escape?

436
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,980
That's hard.
You do know that he's my cousin?

437
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,130
De Cheng, you're here.

438
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,760
Uncle. Cousin.

439
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,830
- Cousin, hi.
- What are you doing?

440
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,060
Nothing. I brought some books.

441
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,040
So she's not bored all day.

442
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,080
She does nothing but read.

443
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,360
You're still not satisfied?

444
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,790
She's just a fucking waste of my money.

445
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,320
It's going to take a while
to pay you back.

446
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,150
No problem. There's no hurry.

447
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,550
Mailman!

448
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,990
Can you mail this for me?

449
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,870
I don't have any stamps,
but I'll pay you later.

450
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,900
Thanks.

451
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,760
Chen, why haven't you come by to see me?

452
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,330
I'm bored out of my mind.

453
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,170
We were just thinking
of going to see you.

454
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,480
How's it going with her?

455
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,340
Nothing new. She can do some work.

456
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,190
Is her tummy getting larger yet?

457
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,230
No.

458
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,220
Why not? It's been months
and she's still not pregnant.

459
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,170
Who knows. We're worried sick.

460
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,450
Just make your son take some medicine.

461
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:22,940
Make him work extra hard at night.

462
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,570
Can you lend me some money?

463
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,240
I've been here years

464
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,710
and have never seen a cent.

465
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,030
When I have money,

466
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,870
I'll pay you back double.

467
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,070
They always pay for things.

468
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,830
They're afraid
I'll run away with their money.

469
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,110
Can you go to the police station
and make a report?

470
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,570
It's not so simple.

471
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,520
They side with the locals.

472
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,220
When Gui Hua filed a report,

473
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,020
the police didn't care.
They said it was a family dispute.

474
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,340
Her husband beat her until
he broke her leg.

475
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,950
None of us have succeeded at running away.

476
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,690
It's best to accept our fate.

477
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,330
I no longer want to escape.

478
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,250
I've got two kids.

479
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:03,020
What if I did get out?

480
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:04,330
What about the kids?

481
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,710
What man would still want me?

482
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,080
Life can be so hard.

483
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,730
It's best not to think too much.

484
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,300
Look after your health first.

485
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,570
Aunt, hello.

486
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,380
I've got some books for my cousin's wife.

487
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,470
She's inside.

488
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,790
Stupid books!

489
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,410
You're here. Come in. Sit down.

490
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,960
I borrowed a few more books for you.

491
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,520
Thanks.

492
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:56,590
You're welcome.

493
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,790
I just want you to know that
I really do want to help you.

494
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,150
I know. You're different from them.

495
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,450
You're educated.

496
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,730
But you must not rush.

497
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,850
You know what things are like here.

498
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,520
I've got to come up with a good plan.

499
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,890
Stop fighting. Eat your own.

500
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,100
Aunt, I got to go.

501
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,760
Listen up.
This is an important announcement.

502
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,820
Party officials are coming
to inspect the village.

503
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,150
Every home must be cleaned and tidied up.

504
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:09,300
Respect the leaders. Watch what you say.

505
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,730
Whoever ruins the village's reputation...

506
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,100
will pay a price.

507
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,930
We will not let you off lightly.

508
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,490
Listen again.

509
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:27,610
Whoever ruins the village's reputation...

510
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,990
will pay a price.

511
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:14,890
We warmly welcome you!

512
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,880
We're here. Get down.

513
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,860
That's the village council.

514
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,320
After you, please.

515
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,190
The Party officials have left.

516
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,480
Let's go back. We're damn starving!

517
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,850
- Do I have a letter?
- No.

518
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,570
Can you help send another letter for me?

519
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,800
Okay.

520
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,890
Thanks.

521
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,030
You're welcome.

522
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:53,770
De Gui.

523
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:54,990
What is it?

524
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,910
The school would like
your wife to help out. Okay?

525
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,990
Just for a bit.

526
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,660
What can she do?

527
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,600
Her education is better than ours.

528
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,840
Then keep an eye on her.
Don't let her run away.

529
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,420
Don't worry.
I'll definitely bring her back.

530
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,080
Hey, come on and help them at school.

531
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,990
Why'd you come get me?

532
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,940
We only have two teachers.

533
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,810
One just went home.

534
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,390
Some tea?

535
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:13,960
I'm not thirsty.

536
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,080
Actually the school doesn't need you.

537
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,970
This is the only place

538
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,130
we can really talk.

539
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,270
Can you help me get out of here?

540
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:33,940
I will. I promise.

541
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,260
I'll help you leave this place.

542
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,130
Don't lie to me.

543
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,320
I would never lie to you.

544
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,270
Lunch is ready.

545
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,450
Come down and eat.

546
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,640
Okay.

547
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,450
You're crazy!

548
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,130
I can't stop thinking of you.

549
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,100
They're always watching me.
I can't get away.

550
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,040
I'm going crazy!

551
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,460
Let's get out of here!

552
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,560
Not now. It's not the right time.

553
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,570
De Cheng! Time to eat!

554
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:38,890
Okay.

555
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,150
Want some alcohol?

556
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,190
No thanks.

557
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:57,650
We'll drink tonight.

558
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:00,440
Tomorrow they will come
and help your family.

559
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,480
He won't.

560
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,390
He gets two people to help. Good deal!

561
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,010
Let's run away now.

562
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,090
No, it'll be bad.

563
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,040
If they find us both gone.

564
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,020
Don't you really love me?

565
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,410
Of course I love you.

566
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:43,880
You said you'd take me out of here.

567
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:44,890
Yes.

568
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,170
When?

569
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,340
I'm still looking for the right time.

570
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,050
We need money.

571
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,510
I'm saving up.

572
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,880
I don't need so much money.
I just want to leave.

573
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,720
I know. Be patient. Trust me.

574
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,990
Don't hit him!

575
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,890
You slut!

576
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,490
Decheng, What should be done?

577
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,210
Uncle, De Gui, I'm sorry.

578
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,190
Fuck! That's all! Now you're forgiven!

579
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,250
Shut up!

580
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:34,040
There are two possibilities:
we can ask the village chief decide

581
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,420
He can decide what should be done.

582
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,220
Or just forget about the money
De Gui borrowed from you.

583
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,780
You decide.

584
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,020
Hi, what do you want?

585
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:33,130
Toilet paper and a bag of salt.
Add it to our tab.

586
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,000
What else?

587
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,240
Nothing else.

588
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,980
Can I borrow some money?

589
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,110
This small shop doesn't make much money.

590
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,440
Just a little. Promise to pay you back.

591
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,320
You don't have a penny.

592
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,750
How are you going to pay me back?

593
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,050
How'd you like for me to pay your back?

594
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,140
How much do you want?

595
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:07,750
Fifty.

596
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,120
That much!
That kind of money doesn't come easy.

597
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,440
Then forget it!

598
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:17,460
Wait a moment.

599
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,200
My wife keeps tabs on me.
How about forty?

600
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,730
Have you mixed in the medicine
for the pigs?

601
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:57,810
Yes.

602
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:41,930
Xue Mei! Where is she?

603
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,170
De Gui, get up!

604
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:36,550
Stop!

605
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,730
- Where to?
- lnto town.

606
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:11,610
Thanks.

607
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,130
Excuse me, where's the bus station?

608
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,740
Over there.

609
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:29,850
Thanks.

610
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,610
When are you leaving?

611
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:46,650
In forty minutes.

612
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,440
Thanks!

613
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:52,780
Be careful. Let them off first.

614
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,180
Stop pushing.

615
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:57,190
When's this bus leaving?

616
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,790
Soon. Get on.

617
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,260
Ticket.

618
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,650
Into the city.

619
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:06,690
Twenty.

620
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,930
Don't stop! I beg you!

621
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,080
Don't stop! I beg you!

622
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,480
My life will be over!

623
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,450
Mister! Mister! Open the door!

624
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:35,220
What is it?

625
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,170
My wife ran away. Let me take a look.

626
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,390
Have a cigarette.

627
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,660
Here.

628
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,660
Open the door.

629
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,700
Get up! Running away?

630
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,500
This is his wife. Stay out of it.

631
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,660
Don't hold us up with
your family problems.

632
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,370
You never thought I'd find you.

633
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,310
What are you doing?

634
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,180
This is my wife.

635
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,950
Don't mind them. Let them get off.

636
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,090
Help me!

637
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:19,120
Help me!

638
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,010
What's going on?

639
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,050
His wife's gone crazy.

640
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,580
Yes, she's having a mental breakdown.

641
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,190
Save me! I've been kidnapped!

642
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,060
Then take her to a hospital.

643
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,900
Don't hold up traffic. Get going!

644
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:42,920
Save me!

645
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,040
Thanks!

646
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:44,260
You're welcome.

647
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,380
Slow down. There's more.

648
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,820
Isn't your period two months late?

649
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,860
It's often late.

650
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,800
Are you?

651
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:27,710
What?

652
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,540
Don't touch me! Get away!

653
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,980
Please! Stop hitting yourself.

654
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,410
Get out! Stay away from me.

655
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,770
Fuck, do you want to die?

656
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,850
Stop hitting her!

657
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:05,050
She's pregnant with your child.
Get out of here!

658
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,170
If you hurt my kid,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

659
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,540
Hit me if you want,
but don't hit the baby!

660
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:16,250
I beg you. Please! Stop hitting yourself.

661
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,540
We will always be grateful to you.

662
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:21,920
Go out.

663
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,040
Go.

664
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,050
Li Qingshan.

665
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,450
Why aren't you in school?

666
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,750
Tell me, what happened?

667
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,910
I can't pay for school.
My dad won't let me go.

668
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,890
Wait a minute.
Do you want to go to school?

669
01:20:59,100 --> 01:20:59,930
Yes.

670
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,890
You can come here.
I'll be your teacher, okay?

671
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,080
Okay.

672
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:33,910
Hi, sister Bai.

673
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,200
You're here.

674
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,820
Check my homework.

675
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,170
Which question?

676
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:43,240
This one.

677
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,660
One and five-eighths minus
three-eighths equals?

678
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,160
Two-eighths.

679
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:51,490
What happened to the "One"?

680
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,860
It should be one and two-eighths.

681
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,870
Be more careful!

682
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:32,390
My god! It was a baby girl.

683
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,030
Of course. Who'd get rid of a baby boy?

684
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,970
Bury the baby.

685
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,920
Don't let the dogs eat it.

686
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,890
Do you think it's a boy or a girl?

687
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:57,260
Don't worry.
Look how pointy your tummy is!

688
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,320
It's got to be a boy. Don't worry.

689
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,670
- Did I get a letter? - No.

690
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,270
Help me to send another one.

691
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,280
You two get out of here!

692
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:54,750
Push harder!

693
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:04,030
Harder!

694
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:15,970
Boy or girl?

695
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,960
A boy. The mother's fine.

696
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,380
Thanks so much.

697
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:37,380
My grandson's a good boy.
Look at my cute grandson.

698
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,760
Hold on.

699
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,060
Do you have a letter for me?

700
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,100
No

701
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,100
I really can't smoke.

702
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,360
My pal, this is for you.

703
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:27,340
Thanks for your help.

704
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,290
Glad to help. It's tough having a wife.

705
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:35,760
Here's the letter she wrote.

706
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:36,910
Thanks.

707
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,050
Take care.

708
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:46,230
- See you.
- Take care.

709
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,320
Fuck! She hasn't given up!

710
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:19,730
Hi, Sister Bai.

711
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,630
The mailman gave your letter
to your husband.

712
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:42,690
Don't feel sad.
I'll mail the letter for you.

713
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,580
Give me the towel.

714
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:06,670
Did you hear me? Give me the towel.

715
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,030
Are you fucking deaf?

716
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,040
What's taking you so long?

717
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:30,740
Towel.

718
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,950
Are you trying to make me go blind?

719
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:15,130
Did you finish it?

720
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,290
Yes.

721
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,600
Goodbye, Teacher Bai.

722
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:25,580
Bye.

723
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:26,280
Goodbye, Teacher Bai.

724
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,520
Bye.

725
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:36,150
Does anyone know?

726
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,310
No, I mailed it in town.

727
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:43,110
Thanks.

728
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:41,040
Where are you going?

729
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,690
To see Chen.

730
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,180
Give me the baby.

731
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:07,080
Where's Huang Degui!

732
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:08,920
Working in the fields.

733
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,450
Is Bai Xuemei here?

734
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,150
Are you Bai Xuemei?

735
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,390
My daughter! It's me... your dad.

736
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,390
What took you so long?

737
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,430
Let's go home.

738
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,810
Give me the baby.

739
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:43,920
This is my child.

740
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:44,790
The baby belongs to us.

741
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,480
Leave the baby,

742
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,850
otherwise we'll never get out of here.

743
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:49,910
Someone help me!

744
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:51,100
The cops are taking the baby!

745
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,510
Please come home first.

746
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,420
We'll get the baby later.

747
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:56,160
Help me!

748
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,740
Let's get going.

749
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,880
Hurry up!
The police are taking your wife away.

750
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:30,230
Stop them!

751
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,980
Stop!

752
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:39,650
Move out of the way.

753
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:44,330
This is our job. Let us through.

754
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,400
Freeze!

755
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,180
Move out of the way.
It's against the law to buy people.

756
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:50,760
What law? You'll have to shoot me first!

757
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,120
The selling of people
is strictly forbidden.

758
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:54,760
It's illegal to steal away her rights.

759
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,360
She's my wife. Give her to me.

760
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,270
Many people buy wives.
Have they all broken the law?

761
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,440
I bought my wife too. Lock me up.

762
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:04,740
My friends, you are all parents.

763
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,380
How'd you like it if your daughter

764
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:07,910
was stolen and sold?

765
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:09,650
We need to understand her situation.

766
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:11,450
If she pays me back, then she can go.

767
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:13,540
I paid 7,000 for her.

768
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,740
Give me my money or she stays.

769
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:16,790
That's right.

770
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:20,540
If you want to leave,
you'll have to run me over first!

771
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,060
You're too old for this.

772
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,630
What are you doing? Get up please.

773
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:28,090
I don't want to live!

774
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,390
Okay, we won't take her yet.

775
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,030
We'll go to the village council

776
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,720
and discuss this...

777
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,210
You can't go.

778
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:14,050
Open the door.

779
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:17,180
Why didn't you let me know first?

780
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:20,870
You think you can just come
and take her away?

781
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,480
You don't consider
the village government at all.

782
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,740
We didn't want to...

783
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:28,560
trouble you.

784
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:30,920
Like I'm not used to trouble?

785
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:34,270
Our job as leaders is
to take care of trouble.

786
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,490
What else would we be doing?

787
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,840
If something happens to you,
who would take the blame?

788
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,840
This is just the damn
way people are around here.

789
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:48,220
They lack education. What can I do?

790
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,800
Please help us out.

791
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:55,310
The villagers are up in arms.
What can I do?

792
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:57,430
We're here to enforce the law.

793
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,850
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

794
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:02,930
Thanks.

795
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,220
Damn! He's lying between his teeth.

796
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,220
Doesn't look like we'll get out of here.
What should we do?

797
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:22,690
We must get in touch with
the local police,

798
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:24,710
and leave with all the women

799
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,910
who were bought.

800
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:29,500
I wish it were so simple.

801
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,510
Do you know how many women
were sold here?

802
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,310
Why don't they just run away?

803
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,890
Do you want to leave?

804
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,880
There's no way I'll stay.

805
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,870
They're all animals. They're not human.

806
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:53,230
This place isn't even worth peeing in.

807
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,580
Okay, if you want to go back,

808
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:57,830
then you must do as we say.

809
01:37:58,110 --> 01:38:01,630
Today stay with them.
Hold out for a while longer.

810
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,690
Sir, you have to take me away today.

811
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:06,560
Otherwise I'll end up dying here.

812
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:09,100
Please!

813
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:11,860
You can't go. Please!

814
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,560
I had to rescue my daughter.

815
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:16,800
It wasn't easy to finding
the money needed.

816
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,920
If we fail this time,

817
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:21,840
I won't have the money to try again.

818
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:23,070
I beg you!

819
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:28,650
Get up. What are you doing?

820
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,650
I can pay if you will save my daughter.

821
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,000
Who said we're not going to save her?

822
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:34,400
We're just thinking of a plan.

823
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:39,370
I'll stay here with my daughter
and wait for you.

824
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,280
Dad, go back first.

825
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,510
You have no idea how barbaric they are.

826
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:47,480
Don't be afraid.
I won't leave until they rescue you.

827
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,090
Okay. But you must stay here
no matter what.

828
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:52,630
We'll be back within three days
to take you away.

829
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:57,360
Let them through.

830
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:02,410
Director, you can take care of them.

831
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:03,760
You must make sure they are safe.

832
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:05,600
Don't worry. I promise.

833
01:39:08,530 --> 01:39:10,550
Discuss this with the other family.

834
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,560
It's best to find a peaceful solution.

835
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,520
It's easy to solve.
My daughter-in-law stays.

836
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,980
Okay.

837
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,390
Move out of the way.

838
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:26,750
Let them go.

839
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,990
Please let them pass.

840
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:08,610
Please, stop! Where are you taking her?

841
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:09,620
We're not going anywhere.

842
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,020
It's okay, they'll only be gone two days.

843
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:13,180
No way.

844
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:16,500
We're not leaving.

845
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:20,470
Get out of the way.
We have to leave today.

846
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,880
- No matter what.
- No way! Don't hit her!

847
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:25,040
Who cares!

848
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,890
Don't hit her! We're not leaving.

849
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:29,040
You want to wait for the police
to rescue you?

850
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,300
No way!

851
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,160
We'll stay! Don't hit her!

852
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:33,100
She's my wife, for the rest of her life!

853
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:35,860
Help! Please!

854
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,070
Don't hit her!

855
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:39,990
Don't hit her!

856
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,640
Someone! Help!
