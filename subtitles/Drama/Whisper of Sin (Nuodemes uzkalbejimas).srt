1
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,036
Mr. Lee Dong Jun.

2
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:23,273
You are under arrest for forging a trial...

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,042
and forming a slush fund.

4
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,445
You have the rights
to consult an attorney...

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,014
I won't consult an attorney.

6
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,750
What I have done is...

7
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,019
not worth defending.

8
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,158
I will accept the punishment as they
are asserted by the prosecutor...

9
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,592
and as they are ruled by the judge.

10
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,297
You may choose to remain silent.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,101
Thank you for everything.

12
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,271
Without you,

13
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:56,872
I would have...

14
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,581
lived for that seat.

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,018
Thank you so much,

16
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:09,853
Young Ju.

17
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,592
Look at me.

18
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,797
Look at me, Young Ju.

19
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:52,888
Attorney Lee Dong Jun, who has been...

20
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,025
the temporary CEO of Taebaek
after CEO Choi Il Hwan's arrest,

21
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,662
was arrested by the police
for a forged trial.

22
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,565
Attorney Lee is accused of declaring
Shin Chang Ho as guilty...

23
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,910
for charges against
Kim Sung Sik's murder...

24
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,736
knowing the real culprit is someone else.

25
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,472
The police said they will do
everything to find out...

26
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,673
if he received anything in return
for forging the trial.

27
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,387
Currently, Attorney Lee...

28
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,880
has admitted to all of his crimes.

29
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,558
This is Mr. Lee's testimony.

30
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:31,962
He testified that he forged
the outcome of the trial...

31
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,740
and covered up the real culprit
behind Kim Sung Sik's murder.

32
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,833
The entire case began when...

33
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,579
you, Kang Jeong Il murdered...

34
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:40,603
Murder?

35
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,973
Who?

36
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,912
Me?

37
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,084
Would you call it a murder
if I stabbed a dead body...

38
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:56,786
with a fishing pole?

39
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,491
Sadly, when I arrived at the fishing site,

40
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,194
Reported Kim Sung Sik was...

41
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,230
already dead and gone.

42
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,270
I told you just to take the document.

43
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,640
Mr. Lee, you were a judge.

44
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,921
I'm sure you have studied many precedents.

45
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,848
This is usually seen in many
hit-and-run cases.

46
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,719
This person is walking on the streets.

47
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,442
A car that was passing by...

48
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:36,059
hits the pedestrian.

49
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:40,664
The pedestrian dies on the spot.

50
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,169
Then a car that came after that...

51
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,839
hit the body of the pedestrian
who's already dead.

52
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,876
I'm sure...

53
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,945
many precedents say the
second driver is innocent.

54
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,480
Right?

55
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,986
It's just like that.

56
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,588
Before I got to the there,

57
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:07,856
Baek Sang Gu's subject...

58
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:10,026
had already killed Reporter Kim Sung Sik.

59
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,262
He put up such a fight. What can we do?

60
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,397
Don't worry about it.

61
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,800
This rain will wash away the blood.

62
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,374
I was afraid.

63
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:27,610
What if...

64
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,081
What if he wakes up?

65
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,484
I was so afraid...

66
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,520
that I stabbed the dead body...

67
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,589
with the fishing pole.

68
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,819
Are you trying to avoid
your murder charge...

69
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,365
with desecration of a corpse?

70
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,235
I am only speaking the truth.

71
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,171
Ms. Choi, who was at the scene...

72
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,640
says you murdered...

73
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,143
Su Yeon saw that.

74
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,851
From afar.

75
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,655
Where on her testimony does it say...

76
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,027
that Reporter Kim was alive
when I stabbed him?

77
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:25,268
Article 159 of the Criminal Code,
desecration of a corpse.

78
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,414
It says anyone who has damaged
a corpse, human bones or hair...

79
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,640
will be detained up to two years...

80
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,944
or be fined up to 5,000 dollars.

81
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,848
Su Yeon bribed Chief Justice.

82
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,550
She'll receive a severe punishment.

83
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,386
CEO Choi...

84
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,223
took the lead in covering up
the whole incident.

85
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,161
He'll receive a life sentence.

86
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:53,997
Mr. Lee.

87
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,232
You have forged an outcome of a trial.

88
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,328
You'll receive a severe punishment too.

89
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:05,341
This huge incident began...

90
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:09,312
with a petty crime,
desecration of a corpse.

91
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:16,653
5,000 dollars of fine.

92
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,990
That's pretty burdening.

93
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:23,092
Mr. Lee.

94
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:25,728
You should...

95
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,567
rewrite your testimony.

96
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:55,525
Su Yeon.

97
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:01,164
You'll spend a very long time in prison.

98
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:04,968
I'll visit you often.

99
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:09,272
I'll show you how I got out...

100
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,441
and how I live on.

101
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,410
I really want to...

102
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:16,379
show that to you.

103
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,998
This is the result of the autopsy.

104
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,333
On Reporter Kim's body,

105
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,537
you'll see wounds which were created
by a knife and a fishing pole.

106
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,015
However, it's unclear...

107
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
if the cause of his death was the
knife of Baek Sang Gu's subject...

108
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,543
or the fishing pole.

109
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,945
They say it's impossible
to tell from an autopsy.

110
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,923
Kang Jeong Il has been quite
cooperative in the investigation.

111
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,323
I thought he would admit to his crime...

112
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,894
and give up on taking any legal actions.

113
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:07,902
When he was investigated
face-to-face with Choi Il Hwan,

114
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,132
he made sure there are...

115
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,335
no evidence about how he
covered up the incident.

116
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,439
When he was investigated with Choi Su Yeon,

117
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:18,640
he made sure...

118
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,922
she did not see that Kim Sung
Sik was alive at that time.

119
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,547
He really is a smart lawyer.

120
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,086
He has been looking for a
loophole in the investigation.

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,022
The only one who can testify
Reporter Kim was alive is...

122
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,791
Baek Sang Gu.

123
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,394
He knows we cannot bring
Baek Sang Gu, so...

124
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:40,595
Let's forget about Kang
Jeong Il's murder charges.

125
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:43,633
Damaging a dead body.

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,735
You should take that, Young Ju.

127
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,906
- Dong Jun.
- He has committed another crime.

128
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,642
Murder instigation.

129
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,478
I'm the victim.

130
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,349
Kang Jeong Il ordered for you to go abroad.

131
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,651
Baek Sang Gu tried to kill
you on his own accord...

132
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,021
To prove that he did not instigate murder,

133
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,825
he would have to bring Baek Sang Gu.

134
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,861
However,

135
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,530
Baek Sang Gu is not here.

136
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,368
To catch Kang Jeong Il,

137
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,071
we must use his ways.

138
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,849
I made seasoned lotus roots.

139
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,094
Once he goes to prison,

140
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,654
he won't be able to eat
anything that I cook.

141
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,655
I'm sure this is troublesome,

142
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,891
but please do this for me
while he's still here.

143
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,163
May I...

144
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,800
also ask you for a big favor?

145
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,214
It's been over 30 years.

146
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,750
It's my first time coming
back to this hospital...

147
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,250
after I left this place as a nurse.

148
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,128
And this is my first time
asking you for a favor.

149
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,169
I hope you can do this one for me...

150
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,171
as Dong Jun's dad.

151
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,781
You probably checked the
autopsy result from the NFS.

152
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,089
I'm pretty sure you looked
for Baek Sang Gu's body,

153
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,065
but you don't look so good.

154
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:20,723
Presumption of innocence.

155
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:25,928
Don't be stubborn in trying to
arrest me for murder. Be objective.

156
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,732
Then you will get to find
out the truth, Young Ju.

157
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,471
Jeong Il, the statement you
wrote for the murder...

158
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,541
should be revised for a statement
of desecration of a corpse.

159
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,147
Jeong Il killed Reporter Kim.

160
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:46,315
I witnessed the crime scene.

161
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,052
Su Yeon.

162
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,288
Lower your voice.

163
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,459
The days you could abuse
the law are gone now.

164
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,428
We have an additional charge.

165
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,999
(Statement)

166
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,634
This is the victim's statement.

167
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:08,069
We are checking to see...

168
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,473
if you hired Baek Sang
Gu to murder Dong Jun.

169
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,078
We have a witness who saw Baek
Sang Gu receiving the payment...

170
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,815
from you for the contract killing.

171
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,385
(Statement)

172
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,487
Here is the statement.

173
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:26,656
(Statement)

174
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,396
Goodness, I would have come to you.

175
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:36,778
He was an underling of Baek
Sang Gu who was at the scene.

176
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,274
This must be a familiar face to you.

177
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:41,671
Jeong Il,

178
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,572
did you instruct Baek Sang Gu...

179
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,693
to kill Dong Jun in exchange
for something in return?

180
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:52,548
No way.

181
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,184
I...

182
00:13:58,888 --> 00:13:59,889
Please take a seat.

183
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,765
Director Lee Ho Beom.

184
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,801
Was there a time you performed a
surgery on Dong Jun who arrived...

185
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,242
at the hospital after being stabbed?

186
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:15,972
Yes.

187
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,642
I will perform the surgery.

188
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,077
Get some sleep.

189
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,079
I will wake you up.

190
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,316
You must know informing the
police when you receive...

191
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,218
a patient with a stab
wound is the protocol.

192
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,921
I was going to report it.

193
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,124
But at that time, he visited me.

194
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,128
That is a complete lie.

195
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:42,131
I have never seen him before.
This is my first time seeing him.

196
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,433
This is what he said at that time.

197
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,637
This might come across as a bit
rude in our first meeting,

198
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,440
but please don't report this to the police.

199
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,578
This will only make things messy...

200
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,148
for Taekbaek, Dong Jun,
and Hangang Hospital.

201
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,318
He is making a false statement.

202
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,022
I have never set foot in Hangang Hospital.

203
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,891
When Baek Sang Gu acquired
the construction company,

204
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,795
he needed Jeong Il's help to get
a loan from a savings bank.

205
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:14,764
I have the document.

206
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,937
I obtained it with the intention
of destroying it to protect him.

207
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:26,042
I'm glad that I didn't
throw it out and kept it.

208
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,580
Every piece of evidence...

209
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,084
proves that you instigated murder.

210
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,521
I only told Baek Sang Gu to get
Dong Jun to a country overseas.

211
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,856
This is only instigation of violence.

212
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:43,959
Baek Sang Gu tried to
murder Dong Jun on his own.

213
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,661
Jeong Il, if you want to prove your claim,

214
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,497
bring him then.

215
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,268
Oh, right.

216
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,570
If you bring him,

217
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,974
it will be revealed that
Reporter Kim was alive.

218
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:11,787
I have a witness who saw you
promising Baek Sang Gu a reward.

219
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:16,122
You asked the President's doctor
to conceal the attempted attack.

220
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,097
The evidence you rewarded
him will be submitted.

221
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:23,799
Jeong Il,

222
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,007
you'll be arrested on the suspicion
of instigation of murder.

223
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,470
Jeong Il, you will end up...

224
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,939
spending a long time in prison.

225
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,742
I will visit you often.

226
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,878
I will show you how I got out...

227
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,880
and how I live on.

228
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,217
I really want to...

229
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,020
show that to you.

230
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,606
Your mom came to visit me.

231
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,976
Since I told lies my whole life,

232
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,780
she asked me to lie one more time for you.

233
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:24,285
I will ask the people at the Blue
House to decrease the sentence...

234
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,287
Don't.

235
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,358
Out of all the paths you walked on,

236
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,867
there wasn't a single moment I
wanted to follow in your footsteps.

237
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,766
I'm sorry, Dad.

238
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,371
Okay. I understand.

239
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,941
I hope...

240
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,745
you won't regret the path
you chose or look back,

241
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:51,814
Dong Jun.

242
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,556
I heard you are investigating the
police officers who partook...

243
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,559
in the cover-up of Reporter Kim's murder.

244
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,180
Police officers with low rankings
are being asked to take the blame.

245
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,467
At that time, I was in the briefing
with senior police officers.

246
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,836
Everyone disregarded the truth.

247
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,771
Taebaek.

248
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:19,141
Taebaek took every case related to
corruption in the defense industry.

249
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,809
CEO Choi of the law firm hired...

250
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,845
high-ranking officials who were
released after being detained...

251
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,646
due to the corruption
as the firm's advisors.

252
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:30,119
Please investigate the senior police
officers present at the briefing.

253
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,988
(List of attendees of the briefing)

254
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,750
This is the list of senior police
officers who attended the briefing.

255
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,461
There must be a reason why they
turned away from the truth.

256
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,612
The world is fair.

257
00:19:57,913 --> 00:19:59,281
Your mom is...

258
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,884
beautiful and elegant.

259
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,388
I thought I wanted to
grow old just like her.

260
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,092
But her cooking is a bit...

261
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:15,531
Even our taste in food is similar.

262
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,560
But there's a good side of this though.

263
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,870
If you continue to eat my mom's food,

264
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:24,740
food from any restaurant in this world...

265
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,842
tastes delicious.

266
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,716
Your friends came to visit.

267
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,118
All of them were lawyers.

268
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,788
They wanted to be your attorney.

269
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,724
They didn't want money from you.

270
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,327
They said you were under an
inescapable circumstance.

271
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:47,029
There are some people...

272
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:50,277
who endured that inescapable circumstance.

273
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:52,968
Mr. Shin Chang Ho.

274
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,037
Reporter Kim Sung Sik.

275
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,609
I don't need a lawyer.

276
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,986
I think I can wait for five years.

277
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,192
Don't drink too much.

278
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,662
Go for a run in the morning.

279
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,898
I asked my mom for your herbal medicine.

280
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:24,466
I asked her...

281
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,736
to send the same one that
I had taken every month.

282
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:34,476
Don't worry.

283
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,378
I'll pay for it.

284
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:41,656
I have a favor to ask you.

285
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,821
On the day I get released,

286
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,092
I want to eat a meal...

287
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,164
made by you.

288
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,271
The world is fair.

289
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,040
When it comes to cooking, I am...

290
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,275
Very good?

291
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,131
Goodness, you have knots everywhere.

292
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,300
You're in a serious condition.

293
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:36,171
That's fine. Stop.

294
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:43,979
Goodness.

295
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,050
(Former Attorney General, Lee Tae Jun)

296
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:50,386
A few months ago,

297
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:53,655
I was the highest ranking
person in this prison.

298
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,491
But in the next room,

299
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:58,660
there are chief justices, ministers,

300
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,864
and the another attorney
general all in one cell.

301
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,366
All of the corrupt...

302
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,669
chief justices, ministers, and
the Attorney General are...

303
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,571
in this place,

304
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,140
so I guess...

305
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,918
the outside world is cleaner now.
Isn't that right?

306
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:14,942
Yes.

307
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:17,746
Attorney General.

308
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,549
Why do you always keep those
earmuffs next to you?

309
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,286
Oh, these earmuffs?

310
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,391
This guy who went away before me...

311
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,193
gave this to me.

312
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,431
He told me never to listen
to the corrupt world.

313
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,835
Instead, listen to the truths
which ring inside of you.

314
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:43,071
The sounds which resonate within
your heart. You know, right?

315
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,773
He told me to listen to that.

316
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,910
Tae Gon.

317
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,813
Wouldn't it be so wonderful
if you can live twice?

318
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:53,816
The first time, we lived in a sewer.

319
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:55,083
The second time,

320
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,519
you should live in a clear pond.

321
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,321
Yes.

322
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:03,658
You know, ponds that are so clear
that you can see the bottom.

323
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,603
You can see those things...
What are they called?

324
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:08,606
The precious and expensive ones.
Right, mandarin fish.

325
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,300
- A place like that.
- Right, exactly.

326
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:16,972
Your trial is tomorrow, right?

327
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:19,174
- Yes.
- I see.

328
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:21,352
I'm all finished.

329
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,612
You can get a new start.

330
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,081
So do it well.

331
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,317
- Yes, Attorney General.
- And...

332
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:30,486
when the police...

333
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,921
calls you over,

334
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,158
can you take me too?

335
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,194
When you eat short rib soup there,

336
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:40,496
I'd like...

337
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:42,898
a bite of jjajangmyeon too.

338
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:45,434
Attorney General, I cannot do that.

339
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,675
What if they stop calling me for
asking them to take you too?

340
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:51,473
And eating jjajangmyeon...

341
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,242
can be quite loud.

342
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,744
You hear this slurping sound.

343
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:59,047
You cannot do that in
the interrogation room.

344
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:23,472
Tae Gon.

345
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:25,974
I am...

346
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,612
confident that I can eat it
without making any noise.

347
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:37,344
Can't you do this one for me?

348
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:41,557
No, Attorney General.

349
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:49,307
The suspects which have covered up
Reporter Kim Sung Sik's murder...

350
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:51,400
will undergo their first joint trial...

351
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,201
in Seoul District Court today.

352
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:56,872
This trial is a separate case
from the slush fund case.

353
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:59,040
The case involves Choi Il Hwan,
the former CEO of Taebaek,

354
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,342
his daughter, Choi Su Yeon,

355
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,544
Chairman Kang Yu Taek's son, Kang Jeong Il,

356
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:04,212
Attorney Lee Dong Jun,

357
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,115
and the former chief secretary
of Taebaek, Song Tae Gon.

358
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:10,485
Everyone who is involved
will be at the hearing.

359
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,388
(Accused)

360
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,090
My dad...

361
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:21,263
I just followed CEO Choi Il
Hwan's orders, Your Honor.

362
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,066
A judge in his office...

363
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:27,002
asked the NHS a lawful question.

364
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,447
You have exaggerated the case...

365
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:31,071
and handed it over to the chief justice.

366
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,552
Are you saying you merely
followed your father's order?

367
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:37,412
I've always been good at running
errands since I was a kid.

368
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:40,816
I believe you are a grown woman
who can think and discern...

369
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,086
the meaning behind what your
father asked you to do.

370
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,654
My father makes the decision.

371
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,508
Everything that is written on
the bill of indictment is...

372
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,993
just me following my dad's orders.

373
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,363
I did not mean to commit a crime.

374
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,641
I told my daughter to do this.

375
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:07,976
It was because...

376
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,212
I wanted a righteous and competent judge...

377
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:12,247
as my son-in-law.

378
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,985
Does it make any sense that
you would force a man...

379
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,120
you want as your son-in-law
to forge a sentencing...

380
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:21,423
I did not write that sentencing.

381
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,760
Why did you do that?

382
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:35,446
Chief Secretary Song had received money...

383
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,272
from Chairman Kang Yu Taek.

384
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:40,542
Yesterday,

385
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:42,778
you sent me this.

386
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,780
I came by to give this back to you.

387
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,548
I heard you recently moved.

388
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:49,160
I sent it so that you can
paint the walls again.

389
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,185
Do you need more?

390
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,165
I'm sure there was some kind
of an exchange between them.

391
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,757
They must've written the sentencing...

392
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,244
and asked him to forge the trial.

393
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,831
Your Honor.

394
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,102
I really wanted him as my son-in-law.

395
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,572
That's why I asked my daughter
to tell those things...

396
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,040
to the chief justice.

397
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:16,178
However, the one who
wrote the sentencing...

398
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,180
and asked him to forge the trial is...

399
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,918
Kang Yu Taek, who wanted to cover up...

400
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,898
his son, Kang Jeong Il's murder.

401
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,157
It may look like one case,

402
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,612
but this is just a coincidence...

403
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,040
where two intentions were
merely mixed up in a case.

404
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,952
Yes. I did get some money
to paint my walls again.

405
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:58,253
So what?

406
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,655
What do you want me to do now?

407
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,825
I didn't do anything for him to get that.

408
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,259
It was just his encouragement.

409
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:09,397
Yes, it's like a bonus.

410
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:11,843
Su Yeon is saying what she did is...

411
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,535
merely carrying out CEO Choi's orders.

412
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,471
To refute her argument,

413
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:20,842
we need an evidence that she
made a move on her own accord.

414
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:26,081
You should meet Attorney Hwang Bo Yeon.

415
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,918
- Then what is CEO Choi...
- He's protecting Su Yeon.

416
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,754
He cannot escape...

417
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,181
the charges against
murdering Chairman Kang.

418
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:37,926
If he makes an argument...

419
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,580
saying you are the one who
wrote the sentencing,

420
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:44,799
he thought he could hide
that Su Yeon got involved...

421
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,301
in the process of the cover up.

422
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:50,238
Hey, I've never even written
anything like a sentencing before.

423
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,540
I was a prosecutor.

424
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,478
It's not easy to change
one's style of writing.

425
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,782
The sentencing which CEO Choi wrote is...

426
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:04,186
probably written in his style of writing.

427
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:07,656
You're right. Whenever I see a sentencing,

428
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,658
I can tell which judge wrote it.

429
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:12,970
After CEO Choi graduated Judicial
Research and Training Institute,

430
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:14,563
he worked as a judge for three years.

431
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:16,898
They are probably available...

432
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,934
on the court's internet server.

433
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:22,037
You should look for the
sentencing which he wrote.

434
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,620
You two are undergoing a trial
without physical restraint.

435
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,858
If you cooperate, it'll be
taken into consideration.

436
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,362
Mr. Cho.

437
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:51,099
I met with Jeong Il.

438
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,635
He asked me to destroy CEO Choi.

439
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:56,171
It's his last request.
I should do that much.

440
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,373
Ms. Hwang?

441
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:00,642
I will testify.

442
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:03,645
If I write a good letter of apology,

443
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,199
it'll be used in favor to
my trial, wouldn't it?

444
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,051
(Witness Stand)

445
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,420
Ms. Choi...

446
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:18,560
Choi Su Yeon...

447
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:21,730
met with Chief Justice
Jang Hyun Guk quite often.

448
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,418
She's even asked him for an
internal investigation...

449
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,767
regarding Lee Dong Jun's
extramarital affair.

450
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,771
How sad.

451
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,974
During International
Conference for Jurists,

452
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,310
he will come across a nightmare.

453
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,712
It's been a while,

454
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,447
Attorney Lee Dong Jun.

455
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,652
I handed over...

456
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,480
the captured images of the video
to Chief Justice Jang Hyun Guk.

457
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,624
What did you give to Chief Justice Jang?

458
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:56,730
Choi Su Yeon claims...

459
00:31:56,731 --> 00:32:00,235
that she did the whole thing at
the dictation of Choi Il Hwan.

460
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:03,837
No woman would conduct an investigation...

461
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,042
into her husband's affair at
the dictation of her father.

462
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:12,447
Chief Justice Jang and Choi Su Yeon...

463
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:14,549
communicated with each
other on regular bases.

464
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:25,627
The original ruling has been
deleted from the server.

465
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,463
Did you check the ruling
on the server before?

466
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:30,732
Yes.

467
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:34,835
(Enter the security code.)

468
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,938
Jeong Il. I found it.

469
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,976
At that time, the draftsman
of the ruling was...

470
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,845
Choi Il Hwan.

471
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:50,652
Attorney Cho Gyung Ho is an
old friend of Kang Jeong Il.

472
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,755
His testimony has no credibility.

473
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:56,424
Mr. Lee Dong Jun.

474
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:06,801
The police secured the ruling
and asked me to examine it.

475
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:13,241
When Choi Il Hwan was...

476
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,111
a Daegu District Court judge in 1977,

477
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,413
he wrote this ruling.

478
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:23,318
Your Honor.

479
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:25,353
A person's style rarely changes.

480
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,156
The ruling of Mr. Shin
Chang Ho's first trial...

481
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:32,160
and the ruling Choi Il Hwan wrote
as a Daegu District Court judge...

482
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,062
have the same style...

483
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,116
of introductions and closing with
sentences to sidestep points.

484
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:40,135
They are considered as similar.

485
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:47,375
I will submit the demanding
document that Song Tae Gon wrote...

486
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:49,611
as a prosecutor as well.

487
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,746
Please compare the documents...

488
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:55,183
and make a wise judgment
on who wrote the ruling...

489
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
of Mr. Shin Chang Ho's...

490
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:59,354
first trial.

491
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,352
Without Mr. Lee Dong Jun, this
case wouldn't have been revealed.

492
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:37,224
This shows how Mr. Lee Dong Jun has
cooperated with the investigation.

493
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,293
I beg you will...

494
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,137
(Sentencing Guidelines for Perjury
and Destruction of Evidence)

495
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:52,539
Prosecutor.

496
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,542
For the accomplices in the same case,

497
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,911
we should have the same
sentencing guidelines.

498
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,980
If I reduce the prison terms of Mr.
Lee Dong Jun,

499
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:03,518
we will have to sentence reduced
terms to the accomplices.

500
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:07,021
I don't think...

501
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:10,158
that's what Mr. Lee wants.

502
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,140
Charging the accused, Kang Jeong Il...

503
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,176
with desecration of a corpse and
solicitation to commit murder,

504
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,279
I demand 15 years in prison.

505
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,216
Charging the accused, Choi Il Hwan...

506
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:37,485
with bribe-offering,
obstruction of business,

507
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:39,888
and murder of Kang Yu Taek,

508
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,757
I demand life imprisonment.

509
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,399
Charging the accused, Choi Su Yeon...

510
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,868
with bribe-offering and
obstruction of business,

511
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,138
I demand 12 years in prison.

512
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,342
Charging the accused, Song Tae Gon...

513
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,578
with obstruction of business,

514
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,481
I demand five years in prison.

515
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:12,720
The accused, Lee Dong Jun,

516
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:15,089
while working as a judge,

517
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:19,527
tried to sell his ruling for personal gain.

518
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,363
So he should be given a severe punishment.

519
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,370
I demand...

520
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,242
10 years in prison...

521
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,511
for the accused, Lee Dong Jun.

522
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,189
The accused, you may give
your final testimony.

523
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,613
I was a judge, but I didn't
live as a decent judge.

524
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,417
I insulted a reporter's life who
led a decent life as a reporter.

525
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,120
I even pursued...

526
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,223
a comfortable life by doing so.

527
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:25,660
I will say no more.

528
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:28,229
Please punish me severely...

529
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:32,333
and show that nobody is
free from the law...

530
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:36,437
and let the people who are
watching this trial know...

531
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,340
that the time of justice...

532
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,844
has begun.

533
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:06,933
The police announced today the
list of the 24 officials...

534
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,435
with a special promotion
and 48 officials...

535
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:09,770
with an award certificate
praising their hard work...

536
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:12,640
for the investigation on the
slush fund scandal of Taebaek.

537
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,442
The police says they deserve credit for...

538
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:17,077
standing against...

539
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:19,514
the huge judicial corruption without fear.

540
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,318
Well, it just...

541
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:25,053
doesn't make any sense.

542
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,222
Mr. Lee took care of the whole
thing, but his name isn't there.

543
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:30,124
What is the police throwing a party for?

544
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,597
Is it that...

545
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:39,500
the superior officials are
trying to take all the credit?

546
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,344
Gi Yong, I'll make the first move.

547
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,515
The investigation started with
the inside report from Mr. Lee.

548
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:56,983
The list of executives forbidden
from leaving the country...

549
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,386
and those who accepted bribes.

550
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:01,456
Mr. Lee Dong Jun submitted the
whole thing to the police.

551
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,192
The police said they conducted
the investigation on their own.

552
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,463
That's not true. What the police
have done for this case...

553
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,765
is follow Mr. Lee...

554
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:13,134
and take his statement.

555
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,139
Lieutenant Shin Young Ju who was
in charge of the investigation...

556
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,742
claimed that it was Mr. Lee Dong Jun
who reported all the information...

557
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:23,644
and cooperated with the investigation.

558
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,713
She also claimed that the
police tried to hide it...

559
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:30,051
and take all the credit for the outcome.

560
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,885
This case is forming public opinion that...

561
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:36,023
the sacrifice of a whistleblower
shouldn't be covered up.

562
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:40,128
Please tell me if there's anything
that is at variance with the truth.

563
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,231
Another truth will be reported tomorrow.

564
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,073
It turns out...

565
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,942
there has been Mr. Lee Dong Jun's
devotion for the investigation...

566
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:57,545
on Taebaek's scandal.

567
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,081
The ruling of his first
trial is just a day away.

568
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:03,717
Whether they will accuse
Lee of his crime...

569
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:05,420
or praise him for his devotion...

570
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,655
remains to be seen.

571
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,361
Thank you.

572
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,964
Thank you very much.

573
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,300
For what you've done for my son.

574
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:20,935
I can't thank you enough.

575
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,878
All rise.

576
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:40,955
Be seated.

577
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:49,062
We hereby adjudicate on
Kim Sung Sik's murder...

578
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,364
and concealment case as follows.

579
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,253
Charging the accused, Kang Jeong Il...

580
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:57,247
with desecration of a corpse and
solicitation to commit murder,

581
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,631
I sentence him 10 years in prison.

582
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,120
Charging the accused, Choi Il Hwan...

583
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,279
with bribe-offering, obstruction
of business, and murder,

584
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:07,133
I sentence him life imprisonment.

585
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:13,066
Charging the accused, Choi Su Yeon...

586
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:15,556
with bribe-offering and
obstruction of business,

587
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:17,603
I sentence her seven years in prison.

588
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,069
Charging the accused, Song
Tae Gon with obstruction...

589
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,322
of business, I sentence
him two years in prison.

590
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,075
For the accused, Lee Dong Jun,

591
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,189
I sentence him four years in prison...

592
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:41,148
and his license to be disbarred.

593
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,246
(Application for National Compensation)

594
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,126
I plan to file an application
for national compensation.

595
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,385
I have two points.

596
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:19,630
They are the false charge for the murder...

597
00:42:19,654 --> 00:42:22,790
and the delay the stay of execution
although his cancer was serious.

598
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,260
I want your help...

599
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,996
to write this application.

600
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,670
There are other good lawyers.

601
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:38,615
You are the one who knows best...

602
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,074
how my dad led his life...

603
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:43,277
and how he left this world.

604
00:42:45,212 --> 00:42:46,280
Think of this trial...

605
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:50,484
as my dad's epitaph.

606
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,056
This won't be in history,

607
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,758
but it will be remembered for a long time.

608
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:03,598
My dad's epitaph that...

609
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:05,866
you and I will leave behind.

610
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:11,872
Please write one for me.

611
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:21,248
I hope I will be handsomely compensated.

612
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,258
I need the money for something.

613
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,126
(A few months later)

614
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,727
I, hereby rule on the application for...

615
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,865
national compensation filed by the
bereaved family of Shin Chang Ho.

616
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,502
I approve the requested amount,

617
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,970
250,000 dollars in full.

618

(Law school)

621
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,883
Say that a patient is about to die.

622
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,585
In order to keep dignity
and value as a human,

623
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:33,630
the patient can refuse
life-sustaining treatments...

624
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:35,523
or can decide to stop the treatments.

625
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,461
It is acknowledged as part of one's
constitutional right to decide.

626
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:43,964
However, does the country have the duty...

627
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:47,134
legalizing this guarantee of
this right for the patient...

628
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:49,146
to be able to stop
life-sustaining treatments?

629
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,410
But this is a different matter.

630
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:54,742
I'm nervous.

631
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,545
Next week is my bar exam.

632
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:00,081
Will I pass?

633
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:13,160
At my law school,

634
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:16,397
we use your rulings as our textbook.

635
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:20,901
Are your rulings that great?

636
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,172
Well, if I say that, it
sounds like I'm bragging.

637
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:40,054
You started your studies...

638
00:45:40,187 --> 00:45:41,355
with the compensation.

639
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,591
So...

640
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:45,726
I'm sure your dad...

641
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,028
will help you become a lawyer.

I asked the realtor guy next
door to look up your number.

Starting today, my daughter is a lawyer.

651

It's only a test.

00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:04,271
and look for an office
space for my practice.

655
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:06,140
Why would we put our store on the market?

656
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,875
You need to rest, Mom.

657
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:11,145
Your shoulders and knees hurt after
peeling the garlic all day long.

658
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,939
I'll take care of you from now on.

659
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:14,715
Your daughter is a lawyer now.

I told them my daughter is a lawyer
when I gave the rice cakes out.

665
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,312
People looked at me differently.

Don't do that now.

667
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:50,783
A lawyer should read the
law books and hold pens.

Chang Ho,

671
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,397
our daughter became a lawyer.

672
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,401
She studied with the money you left behind.

673
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:10,637
She became a lawyer...

Thank you.

680
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,511
It was a bit expensive with the
salary of a police officer.

681
00:49:36,757 --> 00:49:38,077
You have to wear it for 10 years.

He has serious Alzheimer's. His
disease is rapidly worsening.

713

His family can't take care of him,

714
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:46,113
and he didn't want to go to his
hospital, so he came here.

715
00:52:48,515 --> 00:52:49,583
Did he want me...

716
00:52:49,983 --> 00:52:51,985
to see him like this?

717
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:57,157
A President's doctor,

718
00:52:58,025 --> 00:52:59,359
a poor ordinary person,

719
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:02,196
a person who's led a successful life,

720
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,898
and a person who's wrestled
against adversity...

721
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:07,968
eventually go down the same path.

722

They are so cruel.

723
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,542
They've never visited him once.

The people from Hangang Hospital.

725
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:22,416
He doesn't even expect to see them.

726
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:27,721
I guess he knows that.

Dad,

733
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,645
you,

734
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,315
and me, as a family.

735
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:14,901
This is good. Eat a lot.

736
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:17,371
Eat up.

737
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:03,317
You should gobble up jajangmyeon noisely.

Attorney General.

739

I ordered this from Seonwongak.

740
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:17,597
You're right. You're good at this.

741
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,637
By the way,

742
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:26,239
what are you doing these days?

743
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:30,477
I don't have the license, but I
have the original technology.

744
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:32,279
I work at an attorney's office.

745
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,247
You're so unctuous.

746
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:45,926
Is this your first time at formal trial?

747
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,661
You mean...

748
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:50,496
this is your first time to
stand before the court?

749
00:55:50,497 --> 00:55:52,566
I've only taken care of
some cases with fines,

750
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:54,401
summary indictment, and settlements.

751
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,989
How does it feel to stand before the court?

752
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,142
I wouldn't even talk to the judge
right if he looked down on me.

753
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,643
Don't worry about it.

754
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,145
You'll do just fine.

755
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:15,288
Try to think...

756
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:17,724
I'm the judge.

757
00:56:27,734 --> 00:56:30,070
Prosecuting counsel, testify.

758
00:56:48,255 --> 00:56:50,190
The medical device she purchased...

759
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:52,726
is worth about 300 dollars.

760
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,096
But they deceived old people into
buying it for 1,000 dollars...

761
00:56:56,296 --> 00:56:58,030
with some performances...

762
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,866
and free trial events.

763
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:02,335
And the requests for
refund has been denied.

764
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:04,438
Your Honor,

765
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:06,540
please give an order for a refund.

766
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,922
The events and transport
of product cost money.

767
00:57:11,545 --> 00:57:14,123
Above all things, she's used
the product for three months.

768
00:57:14,147 --> 00:57:15,182
It's unreasonable...

769
00:57:15,882 --> 00:57:16,883
to give her a refund.

770
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:20,352
She's tried to reach you for the
past three month, but she couldn't.

771
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,756
If they accept every single refund request,

772
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,558
the company will go bankrupt.

773
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,362
A bankrupt company can move one,

774
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,365
but a bankrupt person has
to keep making a living.

775
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:36,969
It's only 1,000 dollars
we're talking about.

776
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,530
The money of 1,000 dollars is her
pocket money for a whole year.

777
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:42,042
Your Honor.

778
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,845
A bankrupt company can move one,

779
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:47,414
but a bankrupt person has
to keep making a living.

780
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,186
Dozens of her friends at the
senior center were deceived.

781
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:59,893
Collect their cases and
file a class action suit.

782
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,095
Gather the receipts of purchase...

783
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:04,364
and submit in court.

784
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:08,301
I will never...

785
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,470
disregard...

786
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:12,272
concrete evidence...

787
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:16,176
ever again.
