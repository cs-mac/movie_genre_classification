00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:01,969
Previously on <i>Defiance...</i>

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,377
First we need to secure
his marriage.

3
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:06,630
If they're against us,
we'll never be able

4
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:08,765
to take control
of the McCawley mines.

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,268
I'm thinking about
our son's future.

6
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:13,252
Wanna come back
to my place later?

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,221
- What's at your place?
- Me.

8
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,806
No.

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,644
Come back and work with me.
I can't do this alone.

10
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:25,031
- No thanks. Not interested.
- You sure about that?

11
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,568
I finally got my hands
on one of the artifacts.

12
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,323
Yeah!

13
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:38,854
You'll never please your bride
with that shriveled worm of yours.

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,914
Your mother
didn't seem to mind.

15
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,621
- Who's next?
- Well, look at you.

16
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,724
You ain't worthy
of Christie McCawley.

17
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,841
Yes, he is!

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,263
Defend my honor, Alak.
Kick his ass.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,407
On the eve of your wedding,

20
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:09,359
you've defeated
your savage brothers.

21
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:13,747
Now it's time to taste the
fruits of your victory.

22
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:19,986
I'm ready for you,
husband.

23
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,989
<i>Rembu! Rembu! Rembu!</i>

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,631
Boys.

25
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:39,043
____________

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,442
- Claim your wife.
- Another round, Jared.

27
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,694
- Koni shots for everyone!
- Casti punk.

28
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:48,114
Not until we get to see you
pony-mount your bride.

29
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,068
Ritual coitus
is so old-school.

30
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,853
It's 2046.

31
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:56,289
Wait, are you saying
no to your bride?

32
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:57,490
Are you?

33
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,075
Look, the thing is, Tirra,

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,128
my real bride would probably
have a problem with this.

35
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:03,580
Come on, man.

36
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:04,748
Nobody's gonna know.

37
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,549
Let it go, kupack.

38
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:09,836
I guess that's what happens
when you hook up with a Human.

39
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:13,173
Pink meat makes your
<i>jondura</i> go soft.

40
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:31,408
Hey!

41
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:33,827
Is that a hand?

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,920
_________

43
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,966

Christie.

47
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,428
You are a vision.

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,980
It's all because
of Kenya.

49
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,265
She made this dress.

50
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:47,934
She does have
an amazing touch.

51
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,636
Well, it's only
been worn once,

52
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,438
and it looks
much better on you

53
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,307
than it ever did on me.

54
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,910
Kenya, I'm sure
you were a stunning bride.

55
00:03:56,977 --> 00:04:00,697
In another lifetime.

56
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:03,032
I'll see you both
tomorrow.

57
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:10,256
Christie,
in Human tradition

58
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,792
I understand
the mother of the bride

59
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,127
gives her daughter
something borrowed

60
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:16,796
to wear during
the ceremony.

61
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:19,165
As your mother's
not with us,

62
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:23,136
I thought I would give you
something I wore at my wedding.

63
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:27,273
When we boarded the ark, we were
only allowed to bring three items.

64
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,611
I took my family gem,
my diary, and this.

65
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:34,347
It's called a <i>telo.</i>

66
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:38,401
- How do I wear it?
- I'll show you.

67
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:42,372
My mother wore it,
and her mother before that.

68
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,742
You know, the Human phrase
daughter-in-law

69
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:49,579
is so cold, so distant.

70
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:55,051
Our word, <i>hanya tavo,</i>
means "heart daughter."

71
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:58,304
You are my <i>hanya tavo,</i>
Christie.

72
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:04,043
I can't see anything.

73
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:08,147
You're not supposed to.

74
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,401
In Castithan tradition,
the bride is blind

75
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,987
until her betrothed
opens her eyes

76
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:16,889
at the end
of the ceremony.

77
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,276
I'll never forget
the moment my handmaidens

78
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,695
lifted my <i>telo.</i>

79
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:25,564
At first,
the light was so bright.

80
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:32,956
But then, after a moment,
he came into focus.

81
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,626
My new husband.

82
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,577
It was magical.

83
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,966
It's beautiful.

84
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,308
I'm looking forward
to this wedding tonight.

85
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:57,447
- This town needs a party.
- Weddings are stupid.

86
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,982
Okay.

87
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,118
See, most people, Irisa,
they don't do everything alone.

88
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,769
They think life's
more meaningful

89
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,438
with someone
at their side.

90
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:10,109
Some even like to celebrate this
idea with friends and family.

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,078
You're going, right?

92
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:17,300
You're going. You're
gonna be my date.

93
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,886
- I don't date.
- Why not?

94
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:21,954
I'm from the badlands.

95
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,559
You see, when I first
came to Defiance,

96
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,127
I was nothing
but a card hustler.

97
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,479
Couldn't read or write,

98
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,314
never thought
I'd amount to anything.

99
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:34,317
Now I'm wearing
a badge.

100
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:38,855
- People change.
- You're an idiot.

101
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:43,809
So are you.

102
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:48,814
Wound's triangular.
Paperweight?

103
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,667
Possibly.

104
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:55,705
Whatever it was, our John Doe took
one pretty hard to the coconut.

105
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:59,658
That's one hell
of a big damn rock.

106
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,761
Obviously robbery
wasn't a motive.

107
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,631
I've seen that ring before.

108
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:11,888
This is no John Doe.
His name is Hunter Bell.

109
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,306
Who's that?

110
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:17,143
He owned the needwant back when
it was just a hotel and bar.

111
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:18,695
Slow down, hot shot.

112
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,280
Nobody cheats in
my establishment but me.

113
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:22,398
I'm not cheating.

114
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:26,882
__________

115
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,455
Back off, Datak.
I got this.

116
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:32,709
Kenya, bring these gentlemen
a free round.

117
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,794
Let's go.

118
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:42,585
What are you thinking trying
to hustle my poker table?

119
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:47,390
I'm thinking, damn, I'm gonna
get rich off these Casti punks.

120
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:52,011
They're crap players.
You got that right.

121
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,880
You gonna cut me?

122
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:59,185
First lesson's free.
So is this one.

123
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,887
You're not as slick
with the cards as you think.

124
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,689
Come with me.

125
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,891
- Hey, lawkeeper.
- Clancy.

126
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,828
Hey, Hunter.
Who's the kid?

127
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,364
My friend here just got off
the truck from Yosemite.

128
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:14,000
Needs a bed and a job.

129
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,868
Does he mind
scrubbing toilets?

130
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,205
He can't
get enough of it.

131
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:22,408
So you and this guy
were close?

132
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,912
Not exactly, but he helped me.

133
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,848
I owed him.

134
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,416
When did he go missing?

135
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:34,270
About seven years ago,
give or take.

136
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:35,938
I'd only been on the job
three days

137
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,257
when I caught
my first case.

138
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:49,285
My husband's missing.

139
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:54,073
Hunter had a lot
of enemies...

140
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:56,375
And most people figured
he'd blown town.

141
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,578
Except me.

142
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,634
I found one drop of blood,
and that's it.

143
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:08,838
If it was murder, why
isn't there more blood?

144
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:13,142
Somebody cleaned the floor.
They missed a drop.

145
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,594
Yeah.

146
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:18,314
Look, Hunter was a...
He owed money.

147
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:20,299
He got into a fight,
he lost a little blood,

148
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,568
and he hightailed it
out of Defiance.

149
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:24,487
No, look.

150
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,856
Okay, I've never
owned a home.

151
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,075
Never owned a business.

152
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:30,643
But in this day and age,

153
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:34,747
a man doesn't simply walk away
from their accomplishments.

154
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:35,832
Yeah, right.

155
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,252
Yeah, not a man like Hunter.

156
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,787
I think someone killed him.

157
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,675
Turns out, I was right.

158
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,096
We've been in town, what,
four months?

159
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:52,965
Never heard Kenya mention
a missing husband.

160
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,637
How do you know
it's Hunter?

161
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,734
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:14,153
Hunter owned the needwant.

163
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:16,405
When he was gone,
you took over, right?

164
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,291
It was in his will,

165
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,360
which is the same answer that
I gave you seven years ago.

166
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,163
Tommy, you wanna give us
a minute?

167
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:33,723
People thought
that he ran off,

168
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,425
but I knew that
he wouldn't do that.

169
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,844
You guys had a good thing?

170
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:46,719
Stop!

171
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:53,242
I miss him a lot.

172
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,297
I feel weird
officiating this wedding.

173
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:10,467
Well, Rafe asked you
personally.

174
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:12,853
Yeah, but that was before
Datak was my opponent.

175
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,889
The whole town will see
you standing up there

176
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,758
looking authoritative
and elegant.

177
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,593
It's good politics.

178
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:24,147
You know, Datak's putting all his
resources into this campaign.

179
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:28,568
- Should I be worried?
- Now listen.

180
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:32,272
You have a very strong track
record and my endorsement.

181
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:33,874
If Datak's going to beat you,

182
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:36,076
he's going to need
a lot more ammunition

183
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,461
than he's got right now.

184
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:40,547
Madam mayor?

185
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:43,667
Nolan.
Tommy.

186
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,112
You boys excited
about the wedding?

187
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,337
I hope you're both going
to save a dance for me.

188
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:49,806
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,676
We found
Hunter Bell's corpse.

190
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,796
- My God.
- Where was it?

191
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,231
He'd been murdered.

192
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,151
Body stashed in a hollow wall
in the needwant.

193
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:05,638
What is this?

194
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,074
I thought
you said he stopped.

195
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:10,477
This is just something
I got caught in a drawer.

196
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:15,866
Here's to my big sister,

197
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,950
the new assistant mayor.

198
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,251
Hunter's never gonna stop.

199
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,503
Someday you're gonna
be running this town.

200
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:20,704
He's never gonna change.

201
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:24,591
Hunter sees something in
me that no one else does.

202
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,993
Stop being so stupid!
He's gonna kill you!

203
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,161
Look at the choices that
you make with your life.

204
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,346
Look what you did to Connor.

205
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,791
Look what you did
to your own baby.

206
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,516
You don't even want to let
anybody into your life.

207
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,802
I have someone in my life. You.

208
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,504
And I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you.

209
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,189
I think I'm old enough
to look after myself.

210
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:41,725
No, you can't, Kenya.

211
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,195
And if it comes to it, I
will do whatever it takes

212
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,865
to make sure he never
lays a hand on you again.

213
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,236
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,040
Mayor Nicky,

215
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm gonna have to ask mayor
Rosewater some questions.

216
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,695
Yes, of course.

217
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:07,167
I'm really sorry
about Mr. Bell.

218
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:24,067
Hunter Bell was
your brother-in-law, right?

219
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,318
Yes.

220
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,070
You woulda known him
pretty well.

221
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:30,440
What was he like?

222
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,993
Charming, rich, handsome.

223
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,862
Maybe
a little bit dangerous.

224
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,368
He was a bully.

225
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,740
Did he...

226
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,793
Did he bully your sister?

227
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,580
No.

228
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,718
He loved her,
she loved him.

229
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,805
She was devastated
when he disappeared.

230
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,593
They're lying,
both of them.

231
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,028
Maybe.

232
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:10,363
You know, I think that Hunter
was beating on Kenya,

233
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,232
and Amanda could've killed him
to protect her sister.

234
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,768
Or Kenya killed him, and
Amanda's lying to protect her.

235
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,787
So what are you gonna
do about it?

236
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:19,772
I'm gonna go home,
put on some fresh clothes,

237
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:21,708
and go to a wedding.

238
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,743
Nolan.

239
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,162
A man was killed.

240
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,447
A bad man,
long time ago.

241
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:30,050
You're gonna try to bury this,
aren't you?

242
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:32,135
It's my job
to keep the peace,

243
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,806
not run around like Sherlock
Holmes chasing old ghosts.

244
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:39,009
What about justice?

245
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:41,561
Make sure you wear
a tie tonight.

246
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:49,969
My daughter is not wearing this
hockey mask at her wedding.

247
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:53,139
This is an heirloom.
Show some respect.

248
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,692
She'll be able to see when
she's walking down the aisle,

249
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,444
and folks will be able
to see her.

250
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,112
A Castithan wedding
isn't a wedding

251
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,331
if the bride doesn't wear
her <i>telo.</i>

252
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:03,816
I'm the one footing
the bill for this thing.

253
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,319
Christie wears
what I say she wears.

254
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,005
You Humans believe
you're so superior.

255
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,925
The truth is
you're primitives.

256
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:14,994
Your minds are dull,
your hands are clumsy.

257
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:19,516
The scent of your pink skin
sickens me.

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,685
Does this skin
look pink to you?

259
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,937
You all look the same.

260
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:27,941
Let me ask you something.

261
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:31,010
You hate Humans so much,

262
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,012
why are you letting
your boy marry one?

263
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:38,851
- Well, Alak wishes it.
- No.

264
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:41,705
You've been good
with this the whole time.

265
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:47,077
So I gotta ask myself,
what's your angle?

266
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:49,329
What do you get out
of this wedding?

267
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,532
I believe in love.

268
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,587
You know, I was thinking
about how the McCawley mines

269
00:15:57,672 --> 00:16:01,007
are built on land stolen
from Irathient settlers.

270
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,592
Now that's a tainted legacy

271
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:05,929
that I do not want
to leave to our kids.

272
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:11,318
So when I die, my
mines go to a trust

273
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:14,321
benefiting the Irathient
population of Defiance.

274
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:17,190
You do think I'm doing
the right thing,

275
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,392
don't you, Datak?

276
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:22,329
Well, they're your mines,
Rafe.

277
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,230
I don't care
what you do with them.

278
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:25,865
Good.

279
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,454
Breakfast is on me.

280
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,126
The wedding is off!

281
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,579
Datak, I understand
you're upset,

282
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,965
but if Christie does not want
to wear the <i>telo...</i>

283
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:45,084
It's not about
the <i>gwoking telo.</i>

284
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:48,021
Rafe McCawley has written
Christie out of his will.

285
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,940
The mines are going
to the I-raths.

286
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:57,280
Rafe may say that now,
but be patient.

287
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,449
Once his first
grandchild arrives,

288
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,401
he'll reconsider.
I will not wait.

289
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,236
Instead I will win
this election.

290
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,622
Then when I'm mayor,
I will find a way

291
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:08,107
to take the mines away
from Rafe McCawley.

292
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,210
How does Alak
feel about this?

293
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,579
Alak's a child.

294
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,914
He'll get over it.

295
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,834
My parents would not have
wanted me to marry you.

296
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:20,286
And yet, here we are.

297
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,223
Alak is more pliable
than either of us at his age.

298
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,791
We were immigrants.

299
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,793
We were strong
because we had to be.

300
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,084
Alak will never
have to endure

301
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,462
the same hardships we did,

302
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,931
and I thank <i>Rayetso</i> for that.

303
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:41,408
Don't you want him
to be happy?

304
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:45,144
Our son loves
this Human girl.

305
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:48,248
She makes him smile.

306
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:53,152
She lifts his spirits in a way
that nobody else can.

307
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:58,091
A Castithan woman can
lift his spirits... just fine.

308
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:02,262
Alak is of this New World.

309
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,965
He doesn't see the Humans
the way we do.

310
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,184
He sees beauty in them.

311
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,220
Kindness.

312
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:13,022
Then he's lost
the sense of smell.

313
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:15,358
Maybe you have too.

314
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,848
I'm calling the priest.

315
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:30,123
Perhaps Alak should be the first
to hear of your decision.

316
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,836
You know, Nolan should
really be here right now.

317
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,255
It's a waste of time.

318
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:48,925
Yeah, looking for evidence
is a big waste of time.

319
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,927
You want evidence?

320
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,312
You know,
if I ran things

321
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,848
I'd have five deputies
combing over every inch

322
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:56,716
of this place.

323
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,935
You don't need
five deputies.

324
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,726
What is that, a hair?

325
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,778
Whisker.
Liberata.

326
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,736
Jered.

327
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:19,706
Jered the bartender was working
here when Hunter owned it.

328
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,009
Jered, it's Tommy.
You around?

329
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,415
Jered?

330
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,856
- It's locked.
- So?

331
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:38,391
So we've got
to go back to Nolan

332
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:39,893
and get a warrant
or something.

333
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:43,813
- We can't just...
- Can't just what?

334
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,259
Poor Jered.

335
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:10,479
His throat's been slit
earlobe to earlobe.

336
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,999
Just like Elah Bandik.

337
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,934
Someone didn't
want him to talk.

338
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:21,040
- Why are his fingers like that?
- I don't know.

339
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:24,911
Maybe nitrogen depravation.

340
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:28,297
This has all the markings
of a Casti hit.

341
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:32,117
When I was about your age,

342
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,622
the arks were going through
their final preparations.

343
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:41,894
I had just won passage
playing <i>ivali.</i>

344
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:44,764
But my father
refused to leave home.

345
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:46,349
I don't understand.

346
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,351
Why would he stay
on a dying planet?

347
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:52,972
He said if the suns were
to swallow up our world,

348
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:57,443
he needed to be inside
the walls of the holy temple.

349
00:20:57,494 --> 00:21:02,815
He could not leave the Castithan
scrolls unattended.

350
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:06,085
Not even in the face
of death.

351
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:09,822
- Do you know why?
- No.

352
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:12,592
Because he'd made that promise
to his own father.

353
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:18,097
Fine.

354
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:20,833
I'll talk to Christie
about the <i>telo.</i>

355
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:27,556
When I gave you permission
to marry outside of our race,

356
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:32,028
I knew it was a dishonor
to my father's memory.

357
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:35,731
But I let you
and your mother sway me.

358
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:38,183
I was wrong.

359
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:42,021
Dad. No.

360
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:45,408
I regret allowing it
to have come this far.

361
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:48,027
But you are my only son, Alak.

362
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:51,497
And our Castithan blood
will not be diluted.

363
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:54,867
Do you understand?

364
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,536
No, no, no,
I don't understand.

365
00:21:57,587 --> 00:22:00,256
Okay, I love her.

366
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,474
This is <i>bullshtak.</i>

367
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,042
Watch yourself.

368
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:05,394
Without the name Tarr,
you're nothing.

369
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,513
Nothing but a street haint
with dyed hair

370
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:09,682
and a record collection.

371
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,567
Street haint?

372
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:13,385
Isn't that
how you see yourself?

373
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,855
You're always talking
about how you pulled yourself

374
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:17,990
out of the mud and made
the Humans respect you.

375
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:19,391
I said to watch
your tongue.

376
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:20,860
I don't give
a kanga rat's ass

377
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:23,079
about the sacred scrolls.

378
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:24,947
All right, maybe
your father chose to die

379
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:26,353
guarding a bunch
of stupid papers,

380
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,733
but I wasn't born on Casti

381
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:31,037
I was born on Earth,
just like Christie.

382
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,788
And we're getting married.

383
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:35,041
I didn't expect you
to be happy about this,

384
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,293
but you will obey my wishes.

385
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:38,817
Or what,
you're gonna slit my throat?

386
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,596
That's the Casti way.

387
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:45,434
I'll give you time
to cool off.

388
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:03,786
Datak.

389
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,538
Not now, lawkeeper.

390
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:07,456
- Can't wait.
- Will wait.

391
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,108
Datak Tarr,
you're under arrest.

392
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:10,409
On what charges?

393
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,133
For the murder of
Jered Kikema and Hunter Bell.

394
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:32,947
- Hey.
- Hey.

395
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:35,099
I'm so excited.

396
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,818
I even decided
to wear the <i>telo.</i>

397
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:40,037
I know I said
I didn't want to,

398
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:42,490
but then I was thinking,

399
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:44,742
my wedding...

400
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:47,411
My dream of what
I wanted it to be like

401
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:49,330
when I was a little kid...

402
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:51,249
That's never gonna happen

403
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,050
because my mom
won't be there,

404
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:55,052
my brothers
won't be there.

405
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,837
All that matters
is that you're there.

406
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,590
And if it makes
your parents happy

407
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:01,342
for me to wear
a metal mask over my face,

408
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:04,962
- then so be it.
- Christie...

409
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:08,899
There's something
that I need to tell you.

410
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:16,941
Christie?

411
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:32,340
What did you do? What
did you say to her?

412
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:34,208
It's my father.

413
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:38,512
He... he's trying
to stop the wedding.

414
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:41,832
I don't know what to do.

415
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:44,769
I can't live without her.

416
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:49,523
- You really love her, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

417
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:55,563
Then that's all
that matters.

418
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:01,319
Why in the three hells
would I kill

419
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,237
a knee-high
Liberata bartender?

420
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,706
Maybe because he knew
you killed Hunter Bell.

421
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,075
Or maybe because
he helped you hide the corpse.

422
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,327
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

423
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:11,362
- You don't recognize this?
- No!

424
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:12,880
Really?

425
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:14,465
'Cause we found that
in your closet.

426
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:15,800
And that handle,

427
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:17,718
that matches the caved-in part
of Bell's skull

428
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,703
like a key fits a lock.

429
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,639
Well, I've never seen it
before in my life.

430
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,174
Tommy tells me
that you and Bell

431
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,375
were in business
together.

432
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:29,814
Yeah. You might say that.

433
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:34,068
- You're asking for a raise?
- I'm asking for a stake.

434
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:35,386
I built this tent.

435
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:38,105
Quadrupled profits
every month.

436
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,859
- I deserve it.
- Look who's all grown up.

437
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,361
When I first came to town,

438
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,162
you were running brawls
in dark alleys,

439
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,748
jacking rollers
on Urdu street.

440
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:52,503
My money made you, Tarr.
Don't ever forget that.

441
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,791
With all due respect, I
suggest you reconsider.

442
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:02,513
You know,
in some cultures

443
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,249
when a man
challenges the chief,

444
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,102
there's a fight

445
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:11,222
until only one of them
is left standing.

446
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,091
You want power?

447
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:18,145
Power isn't seen. It's felt!

448
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,267
How does that feel?

449
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:44,788
What's wrong,
can't win a fair fight?

450
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,975
I win.
That's all that matters.

451
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:52,313
Drop the blade
or I drop you.

452
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:13,150
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

453
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:19,006
I believe
your life expectancy

454
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,509
has taken a turn
for the worse.

455
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:22,993
Why did you do it?

456
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:24,545
Yeah, well,
call me old-fashioned,

457
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:26,347
but I believe
in a fair fight.

458
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:28,048
Yes, you are old-fashioned,

459
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,501
right down to your choice
of antique weapons.

460
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,436
Well, I like to hit
what I'm aiming at,

461
00:27:32,504 --> 00:27:35,055
and my aim isn't
always too good.

462
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,008
I'll try to remember that.

463
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,060
That clown's making
a move on my mines.

464
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:41,678
I imagine you have
no intention

465
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,531
of allowing that to happen.

466
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:45,516
See, normally I wouldn't
think you and I

467
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,284
have much in common,

468
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:49,853
but when it comes
to our friend Hunter Bell,

469
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:53,240
I think we do.

470
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:56,160
Let me buy you a drink.

471
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:59,079
I wish I had the pleasure of
hearing Hunter Bell's last breath,

472
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:00,831
but I'm afraid
someone else beat me to it.

473
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,634
Whoever it is,
they're trying to frame me.

474
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:06,537
They planted that walking
stick in my closet.

475
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:08,589
Any idea who?

476
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:10,841
I pay my taxes
so people like you

477
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:13,093
can figure things
like that out.

478
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:22,319
Get out of here! Go on.

479
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:30,561
- What was that?
- Theater.

480
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:32,997
Datak Tarr
is an egomaniac.

481
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,398
If he had killed
Hunter Bell,

482
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,001
that body wouldn't be
holed up in a wall.

483
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,003
It'd be on display
in the town square.

484
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,672
So then why did
we bring him in here?

485
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,008
Now he's good
and riled up,

486
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,793
maybe he'll lead us
to the person who framed him,

487
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:48,629
the real killer.

488
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:51,915
You knew this
this whole time?

489
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,552
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:56,637
Thought you'd be
more convincing this way.

491
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:02,610
Where I come from, framing a
man is the act of a coward.

492
00:29:02,694 --> 00:29:04,645
Tarr, I don't know
what you're talking about.

493
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:06,096
Hunter Bell.

494
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:08,432
You had as much reason
to kill him as I did.

495
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:11,986
Why not just have the <i>jondura</i> to
admit it instead of implicating me?

496
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,738
You really think I killed
that sack of <i>shtako?</i>

497
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,790
Well, if you didn't do it,
who did?

498
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:20,828
Don't know, don't care. I
have a wedding to attend.

499
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:28,785
- The wedding is off.
- That's what Alak said at first.

500
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:30,754
Then we started talking.

501
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,807
Your son loves my daughter,
and my daughter loves him,

502
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,476
and that's good enough
for me.

503
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,127
He may never get
my mines,

504
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:38,596
but I will
look out for him.

505
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:40,898
And I will make sure
that those kids

506
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:43,067
have a wedding that they
will always remember.

507
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:45,519
Please.

508
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,141
We should get over there.

509
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:53,577
The ceremony's
about to begin.

510
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:08,542
Dr. Yewll? I got your message.

511
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:10,427
I'm just on my way
to the wedding.

512
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:13,881
I won't keep you long.

513
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,050
Would you mind
locking the door?

514
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:22,506
Have you come
to a decision?

515
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:24,191
Are we partners again?

516
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,977
We'll get so much farther
working together.

517
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,346
This isn't about
the artifact.

518
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,818
Our favorite Liberata
bartender was killed today.

519
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,654
No, how sad.

520
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,872
A Casti charge blade
slit his throat.

521
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:41,408
Datak Tarr.

522
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:45,245
Why am I not surprised?

523
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,464
Nicolette.

524
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:52,703
It's me you're talking to.

525
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:59,543
I had no choice.

526
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:04,248
He was the only person who knew
that we killed Hunter Bell.

527
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,127
There was no reason
to hurt him.

528
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:11,881
Jered has known the truth
for seven years,

529
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:13,215
and he never said a word.

530
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,168
It was preemptive.

531
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:18,704
I was exposed once, doctor.

532
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:22,441
I couldn't risk that
happening again.

533
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,080
Well, vision seems to be
functioning okay.

534
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:30,015
I told you, I'm fine.

535
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:33,652
It's just this damn ache
in my arm and leg.

536
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,920
Okay.

537
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,889
Let's take a look at it.

538
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,281
Okay, wiggle your fingers.

539
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,072
How did you get in here?

540
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:56,926
Kenya slipped.
I needed some salve.

541
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,627
Well, get out.

542
00:31:58,712 --> 00:32:00,796
This is a sterile
environment.

543
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:13,859
Thought you might come by.

544
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:16,479
Excuse the renovations.

545
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:17,897
Drink, ladies?

546
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:20,149
Or should I call you
something else?

547
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:25,604
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

548
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:29,492
Yes, there certainly has.

549
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:34,446
The citizens of this town believe
their mayor is a Human being.

550
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:37,383
- What do you want?
- Well, let's start with the truth.

551
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,419
'Cause I am bubbling over
with curiosity.

552
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,255
- I am an Indogene, Mr. Bell.
- Nicky...

553
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:47,226
Camouflaged biologically
to appear Human.

554
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:48,894
What are you,
some sort of spy?

555
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:52,598
There is something very important
in this town, Mr. Bell.

556
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:56,185
In the wrong hands,
it could be very dangerous.

557
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:59,939
We're here to prevent
that happening.

558
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,741
We're here to protect Earth.

559
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:08,313
- Yeah? For my kind or your kind?
- For all kinds.

560
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:12,334
Well, I don't want to get in
the way of your important job,

561
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,654
so why don't you give me
a cool hundred "G"

562
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:18,541
to keep that secret of yours
nice and safe.

563
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:25,214
I've heard what an enterprising
young man you are.

564
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:30,502
- Quite the negotiator to boot.
- This isn't a negotiation.

565
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:32,337
You're right about that.

566
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:44,533
You psycho piece of <i>shtako.
</i> You <i>chuping</i> killed him.

567
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,852
I was afraid I hadn't
hit him hard enough.

568
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:51,657
Jered, dear.

569
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,910
Would you mind helping us
clean up this mess?

570
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,220
Relax, doctor. It's
all cleaned up.

571
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:11,894
- It's over.
- Yes, I suppose it is.

572
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:16,315
You know, when I first
came to this town,

573
00:34:16,382 --> 00:34:18,934
I wanted to start over.

574
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,438
I wanted to right my wrongs,
and you...

575
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:26,442
Well, you told me everything
that I wanted to hear.

576
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:28,327
You were my inspiration.

577
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:39,254
But you changed.

578
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,907
You unleashed the Volge,
Nicky.

579
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:44,960
You murdered
a harmless bartender.

580
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:47,763
It has become
painfully clear to me

581
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:50,349
that there is no end
to the lives

582
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,750
that you're willing
to sacrifice

583
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:54,470
for what you call
the greater good.

584
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:57,940
If I can't trust you
with a simple walking stick,

585
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:01,760
how am I supposed to trust you
with a genocidal weapon?

586
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,982
The first needle
was a paralytic.

587
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:12,121
It'll stop you from struggling
and also from experiencing pain.

588
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:17,326
You know, I've changed too.

589
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,279
I've become a healer
instead of a destroyer.

590
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:25,217
And that's why I'm so sorry
for what I have to do.

591
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:33,092
But it's for
the greater good.

592
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:40,733
Good-bye, old friend.

593
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:57,888
There. You look beautiful.

594
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,015
Didn't think
I'd be this nervous.

595
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:03,434
You have nothing
to be nervous about,

596
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,236
as long as you remember

597
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:07,388
that your husband
is your partner

598
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,056
and your equal,

599
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:13,244
and you are never gonna let him
treat you as anything less.

600
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:14,895
No.

601
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:19,200
Christie, can I have
a word with you, please?

602
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:23,254
Good luck. Bye, Stahma.

603
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:28,909
I understand you're not
comfortable wearing the <i>telo.</i>

604
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:33,431
- It's all right, really.
- So I made this for you instead.

605
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:41,389
An old world bridal veil?

606
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,025
I copied it from a book.

607
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:48,780
- Stahma, you didn't have to.
- I wanted to.

608
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:51,766
As my grandmother
said to my mother

609
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,568
on the day
of her wedding...

610
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,559
__________

611
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:00,113
__________

612
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:05,829
__________

613
00:37:46,955 --> 00:37:50,157
Datak accused Rafe
of framing him.

614
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:53,327
- I don't buy it.
- Nor do I.

615
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,833
Dad.

616
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:05,857
It's okay, Alak.

617
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:08,509
Here, give me your hand.

618
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:23,291
You okay?

619
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:29,380
- Weddings are just weird for me.
- Yeah, I get that.

620
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:56,223
No knives?

621
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:31,592
Why is she not wearing
the <i>telo?</i>

622
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:34,195
I don't know.

623
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:51,129
Nicky isn't here.

624
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:53,414
That's strange.

625
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:06,293
Red's fingers.

626
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:08,930
I knew I'd seen that
somewhere before.

627
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,598
The Liberatas
during the war

628
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:12,132
when the EMC used
oxygen bombs...

629
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,434
That's what
they looked like.

630
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:15,987
Liberata breathe nitrogen,
not oxygen.

631
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:18,272
Oxygen poisoning.

632
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:23,244
<i>Today is a special day,</i>

633
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:26,030
<i>an important day
for Defiance.</i>

634
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:29,033
<i>That's why I didn't
want to spoil it</i>

635
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:31,586
<i>with my presence.</i>

636
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:34,172
<i>I killed Hunter Bell</i>

637
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:37,758
<i>for what I thought was
the betterment of this town.</i>

638
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:41,128
<i>When his body
was recently discovered,</i>

639
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,330
<i>I killed Jered Kikema,</i>

640
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:47,969
<i>whose only crime
was witnessing my own.</i>

641
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,938
<i>I realize it's only
a matter of time</i>

642
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:53,941
<i>before the lawkeeper
discovers the truth.</i>

643
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:58,529
<i>With my health, I'll never
survive Vegas prison.</i>

644
00:40:58,614 --> 00:41:03,350
<i>So I've decided
to end my life.</i>

645
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:07,521
<i>I told myself I was acting
for the greater good.</i>

646
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:10,241
<i>But that kind of thinking</i>

647
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:13,878
<i>leads you down a dark road.</i>

648
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:17,415
<i>I can only hope
I've left the town I love</i>

649
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:21,085
<i>in better hands
than my own.</i>

650
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:22,637
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

651
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:26,040
She used to be
good people.

652
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:28,809
Sometimes good people
do bad things.

653
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:41,405
Congratulations, kid. You
solved your first case.

654
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,943
Yeah, I just
can't believe it.

655
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:50,865
- Mayor Nicky.
- I know.

656
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,251
People are
a mystery, kid.

657
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:55,736
Sometimes even
to themselves.

658
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:01,759
And they all have secrets.

659
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,261
Only rule I know

660
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,746
is that every time you think
you have them figured out,

661
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:07,431
they change.

662
00:42:07,516 --> 00:42:09,517
We all do.

663

He killed my friend.

666
00:42:47,906 --> 00:42:51,075
An alchemist used a stone
to keep my body from aging.

667
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:52,493
If I blow your heart
out of your chest,

668
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:53,694
do you think that'll stop you?

669
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:54,992
I'm gonna guess
that's Charlotte.

670
00:42:54,997 --> 00:42:56,130
No!

671
00:42:56,164 --> 00:42:57,364
Myka!

672
00:42:57,382 --> 00:42:59,717
A poisoned dart.

673
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,635
A 15year-old boy?

674
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,971
Yeah, Nick Powell.

675
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:05,806
Why don't you come back
to South Dakota with us?

676
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:07,675
Nick, hey.
How's it going, man?

677
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:15,883
We could be looking
at ovarian cancer.

678
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:29,830
- Hey, mykes.
- Hey.

679
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:32,282
What are you doing up?
