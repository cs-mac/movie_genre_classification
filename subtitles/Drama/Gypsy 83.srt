1
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,465
Oh, my God.

2
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,341
Did you see that?

3
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,465
Your ass should be in school.

4
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:43,772
lt’s Saturday, dear Gypsy.
Come out and play.

5
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,005
When are you gonna
learn to drive...

6
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:48,014
like a normal 18-year-old?

7
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:50,312
Soon as you let me
practice in the Trans.

8
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,845
ln your dreams.

9
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,314
Hello.

10
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,416
Hello, sunshine.

11
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,619
lt’s been, like,
ten whole hours.

12
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,393
l know.

13
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:06,558
Oh, shit!

14
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,192
My sister.

15
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,964
Stay down.

16
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,197
Sorry.

17
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,976
Gypsy Vale, that three-for-one
Thursdays idea of yours...

18
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,445
is going apeshit.

19
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,471
Top sales in north-central Ohio.

20
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,915
Cool.

21
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,148
Dinner for two,
compliments of Polly Pearl.

22
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,119
Chili’s. l love Chili’s.

23
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:37,324
Try the low-cal potato poppers.

24
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:38,831
Keep it up, G-force.

25
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,229
You little shit.

26
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,209
l need to keep this job.

27
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,381
Hello.

28
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,017
Hi. lt’s Taylor, Connie.

29
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:02,248
Yeah.

30
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:10,624
Didn’t you go
to Sandusky High?

31
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,632
Yeah. lt’s gonna be
$9.48, please.

32
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,759
Gypsy something, right?

33
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,263
Vale. Gypsy Vale.

34
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:25,411
l see you’re still
into Stevie Nicks.

35
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:26,571
Jammin’.

36
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,014
Hello, Connie.

37
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:34,282
Weren’t you going to be
some big rock star or something?

38
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:38,724
Yeah. You sang at talent night.
What was that?

39
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,889
Third grade? Oh, my God.
How hilarious.

40
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:47,866
So, like...what happened?

41
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:53,568
That sure is
some good eating, little lady.

42
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,479
Thank you
for shopping at Foto-Hut.

43
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,447
Who is she now?
Some loser housewife?

44
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,183
You’re the one
who’s gonna be famous.

45
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,957
Hi, Carl.

46
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,812
Hey, dad.

47
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:43,289
Hey, mom. Hey, Charlie.

48
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:54,196
Give me the camera.

49
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:59,932
OK...Clive.

50
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:42,513
l come out with my back
to the audience.

51
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,039
Total mystery and drama.

52
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,449
With the fog machine?

53
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:48,010
Smoke, Stevie wind,
the whole damn nine.

54
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,652
And l take off my cape.

55
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:57,356
And three white-winged doves
fly out.

56
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,593
And then, at the height
of the guitar solo...

57
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:05,104
l come center stage.

58
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:08,030
And l fuckin’ twirl.

59
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:10,304
Stop. You’re giving me wood.

60
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,936
Go, baby! Go!

61
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,718
l want the world
to hear my voice, you know.

62
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:26,283
l want them to write my lyrics
on their AOL profiles...

63
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,817
just like they do Stevie.

64
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,955
And when my CD comes out...

65
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:36,094
l want all these assholes to
line up at the fucking mall...

66
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,902
and kiss my ass
one sound-scan at a time.

67
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,066
Excuse me.

68
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,098
May l ask you a question?

69
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:47,079
Do you think it’s appropriate
to dance in a graveyard?

70
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:50,082
Don’t you think that we should
dance while we can?

71
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:54,075
l think you should have
more respect for the dead...

72
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,317
and especially for yourself.

73
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,416
Excuse me?

74
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,757
l didn’t want to mention this...

75
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,025
but you could be
a very pretty girl...

76
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:08,194
but that would be inappropriate
for any young lady...

77
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:10,999
especially for someone
your size.

78
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:14,973
Look, Granny,
l am a pretty girl, OK?

79
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,441
Big is beautiful.
Haven’t you heard?

80
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:18,171
And for the record,
l don’t give...

81
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:20,509
a flying fuck
or a rolling rimjob...

82
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:24,506
what you or anyone else
thinks of me.

83
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,041
You’re dismissed.

84
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,594
Hey, G.

85
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:50,966
Hey, daddy. lt’s gonna have to
be the Colonel tonight.

86
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:55,971
OK.

87
00:08:58,652 --> 00:08:59,812
Nails.

88
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,081
Cheers.

89
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,748
How was work?

90
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:08,190
Fucking fabulous. And you?

91
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,093
lt was pretty good.

92
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,588
l signed up a new kid
for lessons today.

93
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,828
That’s awesome.

94
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,944
What’s this?

95
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,975
Something to write
your lyrics in.

96
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,453
l love it. Thank you.

97
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:41,791
Why don’t we do one
of your old Luna Angel tunes?

98
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,228
’’Crystal Sea?’’

99
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,793
OK.

100
00:09:55,308 --> 00:10:00,177
l fell into a crystal sea

101
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:08,646
lnside a ship of fools
like...me

102
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,179
Was it just a dream?

103
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:15,058
Was l floating ’round
in circles?

104
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:18,121
Oh, your face, your face

105
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,291
ls all l see

106
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:27,132
l’ll be waiting here, my love

107
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:33,839
Forever and a year, my love

108
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:41,313
Waiting here for you, my love

109
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,301
Forget your trench coat,
girlie boy?

110
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,270
Piss off!

111
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,968
Hey.

112
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,630
Hey, Lois.

113
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,040
Nice outfit.

114
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,306
Thank you. l like it.

115
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,109
My brother,
he’s in the basement.

116
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,979
Gypsy?

117
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,782
This whole...gay thing.

118
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,311
He thinks we can’t deal,
but cripe...

119
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,790
l had a gay friend
in college.

120
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,055
We used to be so close.

121
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:34,795
ls he using...safe sex?

122
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,801
He’s a virgin.

123
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:46,778
Good. l just worry.

124
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,711
Look after him for me, OK?

125
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,517
l do.

126
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,990
Thanks.

127
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:04,625
Check it out.

128
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,723
Come here.

129
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,843
Clive.

130
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:20,470
Cool, G.

131
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,852
Did you finish my new shawl?

132
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,320
Not yet.

133
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:35,085
Could you please just ditch
the fucking term paper...

134
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,925
and fix my face?

135
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:41,896
How could l improve
on perfection?

136
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,301
All right, Mr. Straight-A...

137
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,795
l’m not getting nearly enough
hard-core fagma this afternoon.

138
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:50,207
l’m sorry.

139
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:53,440
l’m just kind of down today.

140
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,743

141
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,947

unlikely godmother of goth.’’

143

Sterling.

144
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:09,317
Did you check
on the Nicks-Pix?

145
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,728
They just posted
some delicious new photos.

146
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,368
Oh, my God.

147
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:27,072
What?

148
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,978

of Stevie experts.

161

Oh, my God. Let me see.

162
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,883

163
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,946
Nothing.

You have to perform.

168
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:42,474
Earth to Gypsy.

169
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,045
Do you regret not taking
Luna Angel to New York or L.A.?

170
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,611
You know, building
on the Cleveland triumph...

171
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,316
really going for it?

172
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:54,155
Where did that come from?

173
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,627
l’d like a real answer, dad.
No bullshit.

174
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,992
Not anymore.

175
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:08,236
You think l have
what it takes...

176
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:12,267
to make it big or whatever?

177
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,644
As a totally objective party...

178
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:19,082
l think you are a superstar.

179
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,452
What if l told you
that l know where Velvet is?

180
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:27,618
Look.

181
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,388
These were taken
several years back...

182
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:35,424
at a club in New York City,
and l’m thinking about going...

183
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:38,130
performing.

184
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:41,231
And maybe she’s still there.

185
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:43,834
We agreed
that your mother is dead.

186
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,310
l know, but maybe
she had a reason.

187
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,279
Maybe she could explain.

188
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,680
You know the reason, baby.

189
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,815
l know.

190
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,758
You don’t ever wish
you went with her?

191
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,830
Everything l need
to make me happy...

192
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,898
is right here in this room.

193
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,654
This is the life.

194
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,956
Last night, l dreamt
we were in New York City.

195
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,298
We decided to stay.

196
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,097
We never came back.

197
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,962
That’s a good idea.

198
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:49,031
Then you could completely
drop out of school...

199
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:51,942
and trash your 4.0.
That’s smart.

200
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:53,104
Yeah.

201
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:56,172
Fuck it.

202
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,481
l don’t...

203
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:03,120
l can’t go.

204
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,818
lt’s just shitty timing,
you know.

205
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,918
Maybe next year we could go.
We could plan more.

206
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:12,055
No, we could be dead
next year.

207
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,265
l’m sorry, sweet child.

208
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,429
You’ve been talking about
getting out of Sandusky...

209
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:19,597
since l met you.

210
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,164
Yeah. Well,
Sandusky’s not that bad.

211
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,903
My dad’s here.

212
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,846
OK. Look me in the eye...

213
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,076
and tell me that you’re
happy in Ohio.

214
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,920
l’m happy in Ohio.

215
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,584
Did you just have an aneurysm?

216
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,559
Sometimes life is a tradeoff.

217
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,289
You’re eighteen,
and you don’t get it.

218
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,956
Get off the gown.

219
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:47,591
You’re twenty-five,
and you’re gonna be here...

220
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,363
until they bury your ass.
Admit it.

221
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:53,594
What about our dreams?

222
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,504
My mom is alive.

223
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,583
She bailed on us.

224
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:08,712
Bye-bye.

225
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,346
When?

226
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,155
1983...

227
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,356
April thirteenth.

228
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,901
She moved to New York to be
a big-time rock star.

229
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:27,167
Ended up tending bar...
at Mother.

230
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:29,299
And you don’t want to see her?

231
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:31,833
No. l don’t really
give a shit about her.

232
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,869
She’s your mom.

233
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:38,907
Don’t you fucking
lecture me, kiddo.

234
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:42,478
She’s been dead to me
since before you were born.

235
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,016
l’m sorry.

236
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,493
l bet you are.

237
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:04,970
Did you say good-bye?

238
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:06,301
You?

239
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:09,740
No. We’re runaways!

240
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,834
Farewell, Sandusky!

241
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,009
l don’t think
l ever want to have sex.

242
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:52,006
- l’m serious.
- OK.

243
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:54,519
l just want someone to kiss...

244
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:58,421
with big, soft, delicious lips.

245
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:01,915
He’d have to smother me
in old-school romance.

246
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:06,955
l mean, candles and incense...

247
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:10,935
Moet and Chandon...

248
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,670
but only in a deserted castle
in the south of France.

249
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:22,478
Oh, my God. You are so much more
of a girl than l am.

250
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:28,480
Sex just seems so...messy.

251
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:32,321
Oh, no, no.
Sex can be awesome.

252
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:34,986
Not that l would
remember, but...

253
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,659
Maybe you and l should try.

254
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:50,070
l think l’m past my wayward-sex
fag-hag test-fuck phase...

255
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,873
but thank you for the offer.

256
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:54,675
lt’s just ’’been there,
done that.’’

257
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:58,847
At least l’d know for sure.

258
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:02,650
Honey, you’re a queer,
with a capital ’’Q.’’

259
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,280
OK, you know what?
Some of us...

260
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:06,951
don’t care to be defined
by our sexuality.

261
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,793
OK. Sorry.

262
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:15,964
Can l ask you a question?

263
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,127
What?

264
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,364
Are you gay?

265
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:23,364
Yes! But l don’t have anything
in common with those people.

266
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,970
l mean, like l give a rat’s ass
about Judy Garland...

267
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:29,446
or...Stonewall.

268
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:32,042
Being queer is
a very small part of me.

269
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:34,052
Yeah, whatever.

270
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,202
Wow.

271
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:30,035
So much beauty...
all in one place.

272
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:36,337
Please give
a warm welcome...

273
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:38,350
to international
recording artist...

274
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,410
and karaoke hostess
extraordinaire...

275
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,115
Miss Bambi LeBleau.

276
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:49,189
We love you, Bambi!

277
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,492
Maestro.

278
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,464
Yeah, girl!

279
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:02,405
When Sunny gets blue

280
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:07,140
Her eyes get dry and cloudy

281
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:13,049
Then the rain begins to fall

282
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:19,590
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter

283
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,618
Love is gone, what can matter

284
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:30,500
When no lover comes to call?

285
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:33,972
When Sunny gets blue

286
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:38,409
She breathes a sigh
of sadness

287
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:45,907
Like the wind
that stirs the trees

288
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:50,820
Wind that sets leaves a-swaying

289
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:53,950
Like some violins are playing

290
00:26:53,993 --> 00:27:01,525
Weird and lonesome melodies

291
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:05,503
People used to love

292
00:27:05,537 --> 00:27:10,907
To see her smile and laugh

293
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:16,609
That’s how she got her name

294
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:20,244
Since that sad affair

295
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:25,154
She lost her smile
and changed her style

296
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,490
Somehow she’s not the same

297
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:36,162
But memories will fade

298
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:40,661
Pretty dreams will rise up

299
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:47,942
Where the other dreams
fell through

300
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,178
Hurry, new love, hurry here

301
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:55,311
Kiss away each lonely tear

302
00:27:55,354 --> 00:28:01,759
And hold her near when Sunny

303
00:28:01,794 --> 00:28:12,193
Gets blue

304
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,935
Thank you so much.

305
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,467
She’s a genius.

306
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:21,809
l think l’m in love with her.

307
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:23,838
How are you feeling tonight?

308
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:26,282
My name is Bambi LeBleau...

309
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,513
and l’m delighted
to be your hostess...

310
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:31,045
for an evening
of karaoke in Maryland.

311
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,251
But if you’re feeling
kind of shy tonight...

312
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:38,730
by all means...
have another cocktail.

313
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:41,995
And our first request is...

314
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,525
Sigma Alpha Sigma.

315
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,974
Hello. My name is Troy.

316
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,171
We’re passing through
from Ohio State University.

317
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:56,807
We’re training this year’s
banner crop of pledges...

318
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:00,876
who will now entertain
you fine folks with a song.

319
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:02,819
Enter, bitches.

320
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,597
l’m too sexy for my shirt

321
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,626
Too sexy for my shirt

322
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,867
Too sexy it hurts

323
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:24,467
l’m too sexy for Milan

324
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,082
What some people will do
to belong.

325
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:35,109
Troy’s a little fox,
though, huh?

326
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:36,781
They’re not my type.

327
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:38,847
Ten to one, he’s horse-hung.

328
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:41,086
Did you check out his thumbs?
A dead giveaway.

329
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,720
Like l would care.

330
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:48,222
l think my dear boy
doth protest too much.

331
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:52,203
OK, Miss Rock Star,
fill one of those out...

332
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:54,171
and get your freak ass
up there.

333
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,605
ln this dump? Please.

334
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:58,269
Do you actually care
what these people think?

335
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,834
That’s a first.

336
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,608
Just consider it a dress
rehearsal for New York.

337
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,455
Left, left, right, left...

338
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:24,192
Bye, guys.
Next time, bring your togas.

339
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:28,366
l have to admit to you-all
that l am out of requests.

340
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,001
So l need a volunteer.

341
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,203
Her!

342
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,839
- Yes.
- No.

343
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,438
What are you worried about?

344
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,175
Come on. Do l have to
come on down there...

345
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,619
and drag you up here?
Come on.

346
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:45,088
Come on.
What are you worried about?

347
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:47,523
Someone’s gonna show you up
or something?

348
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,421
That’s right.
Helps you compete, doesn’t it?

349
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:54,591
- l’ll be back.
- There we go.

350
00:30:54,733 --> 00:31:00,000
Please give a warm welcome
to Gypsy 83.

351
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:18,521
l can see we’re thinking
about the same thing and

352
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:23,290
And l see your expression
when the phone rings

353
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,659
And we both know

354
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:29,156
There’s something
happening here

355
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:36,770
There’s no sense in dancing
’round the subject

356
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:39,538
Come on. Come on.

357
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,011
...When it’s treated
with neglect

358
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,276
So don’t turn now

359
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:48,651
There’s nothing here
for you to fear

360
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:52,054
You can talk to me

361
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,689
You can talk to me

362
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:02,055
You can talk to me

363
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:07,298
You can set your secrets
free, baby

364
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,876
Dusty words lying under carpets

365
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:18,212
Seldom heard, honey,
must you keep your secrets

366
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,912
All locked inside

367
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:26,516
Hidden safe from view, oh-oh?

368
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,618
And was it all that hard?

369
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:32,186
ls it all that tough?

370
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,164
l showed you all my cards now

371
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,292
lsn’t that enough?

372
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:39,065
Oh, you can hide your hurt

373
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:43,700
But there’s something
you can’t do

374
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:47,303
You can talk to me

375
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:52,942
You can talk to me

376
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,416
You can talk to me

377
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:03,694
You can set
your secrets free, baby

378
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:13,871
That moron.

379
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:25,277
A big hand for Gypsy 83.

380
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,047
You’re a star
in my book, baby.

381
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:30,111
l didn’t know
it was Halloween.

382
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:32,817
You hurt? You rocked.
Fuck them. Just fuck them.

383
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:34,985
Hey, you--fat chick and the fag.

384
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:36,722
This one’s for you.

385
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,252
How does this happen?

386
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,002
l’d like to dedicate this one...

387
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,940
to the redneck, beer-gut
pig-fucker up on stage.

388
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah, you, bitch.

389
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:55,741
Why don’t you come down here
and suck my fucking cock?

390
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:05,582
lnbred motherfuckers!

391
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,390
How about coming up to my pad
for a nightcap?

392
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:15,957
l could probably use one.

393
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,499
Wow.

394
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,641
Cocktails?

395
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:29,806
l do a wicked Bloody Mary.

396
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:33,284
The bloodier, the better,
right, baby?

397
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:40,883
- Lebleau.
- OK.

398
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:43,486
Oh, my God.

399
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,018
This is amazing.

400
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,496
Let me apologize
about tonight.

401
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:51,832
For some reason,
this karaoke thing...

402
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,430
seems to attract the lowbrows.

403
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:56,805
You can say that again.

404
00:34:56,842 --> 00:35:00,778
Believe it or not,
in my day...

405
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,781
that joint
was a classy place.

406
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:05,908
And we thought
Sandusky was bad.

407
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:07,578
Thank God you rescued us.

408
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,611
Avec bon plaisir.

409
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,392
Where’s yours?

410
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,985
Teetotaler, baby.

411
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:19,690
So, where are you guys headed?

412
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,460
New York, New York.

413
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,434
Gypsy’s gonna be
a famous rock star...

414
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:25,629
and l either want to be...

415
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,073
a photographer, a painter,
a stylist, or a poet.

416
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:32,406
Here’s to New York City.

417
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:36,174
May all your dreams come true.

418
00:35:42,154 --> 00:35:43,746
You’re good.

419
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:46,188
You could be great.

420
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,658
Please. l blew.

421
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:51,719
Rule number one--never let
the assholes get you down.

422
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:57,730
Been there, done it,
learned it the hard way.

423
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:03,201
As a matter of fact,
you...remind me a lot of me...

424
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,232
when l was your age.

425
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,507
Yeah? How come?

426
00:36:07,546 --> 00:36:10,845
You’ve got stars in your eyes.

427
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:18,312
You lived in New York?

428
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,427
Twenty-one years, baby.

429
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:28,093
Were you, like, famous?

430
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:30,795
That is you, isn’t it?

431
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:35,972
You’re dreamy.

432
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,237
Come on. Let’s hear
some of your records.

433
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:40,972
You’d have to scrape
the dust off, baby.

434
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,242
Come on. We think
you’re sterling.

435
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:46,808
That was yesterday.
l live for today.

436
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:49,684
- Please.
- With sugar on top.

437
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,986
- You know you want to.
- Never.

438
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:11,600
- This is so awesome.
- Yeah.

439
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,578
God, what the hell are you doing
in the middle of nowhere?

440
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:18,811
l’m out to pasture, retired.

441
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,477
You don’t miss it--

442
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:26,286
the big city and all
the buzz-buzz, glamour-glamour?

443
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:28,485
The truth is no.

444
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:33,987
The first record was a smash,
but then music changed.

445
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:38,366
Tits and cocktails went out,
and the hustle came in.

446
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:40,564
Of course, that didn’t stop me
from beating my head...

447
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,835
against the wall
for 20 years.

448
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:47,140
One day l just woke up,
looked in the mirror...

449
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:51,877
and said, ’’Give it up, girlie.’’

450
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,044
l’m sorry. l don’t get it.

451
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:58,180
You made it. You had a hit.

452
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,249
l had a blast.

453
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:06,560
Thank Christ l socked away
the big bucks...

454
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,431
while l was still making them.
So now l’m just...

455
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,594
living the good life.

456
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:15,231
You got a husband and kid
stashed away somewhere?

457
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:21,473
Never wanted them.

458
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:27,809
Thanks, honey.

459
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:35,024
l had a dream,
gave it my best shot.

460
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,925
C’est la vie.

461
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,355
You know what?
This should really be...

462
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:43,128
on one of those
Rhino reissues.

463
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:44,465
Excuse me?

464
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:47,027
Yeah. Lounge is
totally hip again.

465
00:38:47,072 --> 00:38:49,597
You’re yanking my crank.

466
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,201
Wait. Oh, my God.
Total brainstorm.

467
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:54,040
You should come
to New York with us...

468
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,512
and make your big comeback.

469
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:57,139
Oh, my God. lt’s brilliant.

470
00:38:57,182 --> 00:38:58,308
l’m...

471
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,476
l’m fift...

472
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:00,575
for...

473
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,745
Let’s just say
l am no spring chicken.

474
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:07,087
Seriously, you’d be
totally cutting-edge.

475
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,184
l could photograph
your album covers...

476
00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:11,422
and design your costume.

477
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:19,895
l have a life here, sweetie.

478
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:21,769
So did we.

479
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:26,707
The return
of Miss Bambi LeBleau.

480
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:28,975
What have you got to lose?

481
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:32,949
Really. l mean,
you’re a singer.

482
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:34,679
Fuck.

483
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,620
Singers are meant to sing.

484
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:43,993
Let me think about it.

485
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:46,292
- Yes!
- OK.

486
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:49,266
You think about it,
but l’m going to New York...

487
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,928
first thing
in the morning, so...

488
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,005
But right now,
l really have to pee.

489
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:01,274
Through the bedroom,
first door on the right.

490
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:18,655
May l have this dance?

491
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,493
Enchante.

492
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,649
Sorry about that.

493
00:41:11,683 --> 00:41:13,082
Guess what.

494
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,142
Bambi said yes.

495
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:17,347
Are you sure it’s OK?

496
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,322
Yeah. lt’s awesome.

497
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:21,757
This is gonna be so cool.

498
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:28,899
Try as we may, l guess
the dream never dies.

499
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:30,798
Does it?

500
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:33,668
No, l guess it doesn’t.

501
00:42:37,669 --> 00:42:40,160
- What happened?
- Don’t worry about it.

502
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:42,832
- l loved her.
- Me, too.

503
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:45,365
Then what is your problem?

504
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:03,124
You’re going the wrong way.

505
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:04,958
Where are you going?

506
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:06,759
Home.

507
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:08,789
This was stupid.

508
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,630
Your ass belongs
back in school.

509
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,398
Turn around...please.

510
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:18,173
Fuck. Fuck.

511
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:57,246
The night that Velvet left...

512
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,114
dad just didn’t know
how to deal, you know.

513
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:02,278
So he looked me
straight in the eye...

514
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,416
and he said,
’’Your mother left us...

515
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:11,485
’’because she loved her dreams
more than she loved us.’’

516
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:17,758
Bambi never had a hit.

517
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:20,464
She’s a drunk.

518
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:23,963
She rolled the dice,
and she came up bust.

519
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,810
Just like Velvet.

520
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:33,211
Bingo.

521
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:36,516
So you abandoned her
like Velvet did you?

522
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:42,752
Maybe l refuse to give up
my life for a pipedream.

523
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:48,655
We’re going home now.

524
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,793
Dad and Lois
must be worried sick.

525
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:54,168
They’re grownups. They can
take care of themselves.

526
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:57,003
l’m not doing it
to my dad again. Get in the car.

527
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:08,950
What happened at talent night?

528
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,453
Excuse me?

529
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,422
ln third grade.

530
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:15,187
Screw you.

531
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:17,956
No. Gypsy, please.

532
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:20,429
Just tell me.

533
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:24,958
All right.

534
00:45:30,308 --> 00:45:33,243
Spring jubilee, talent night.

535
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:38,146
Velvet taught me one
of her favorite Stevie songs.

536
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:40,980
We practiced for weeks.

537
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:44,510
And dad showed me
the chords on the guitar.

538
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:48,821
Anyway...a week before
my big debut...

539
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,385
Velvet splits.

540
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,388
But l go through
with it anyway...

541
00:45:54,432 --> 00:46:00,598
because she’s gonna show,
right? l mean...

542
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:04,768
She’s got to show.

543
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:08,711
So...

544
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:11,613
all the cutesie little
kiddies...

545
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:15,278
and their perfect
mommies and daddies are there.

546
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:16,786
And l get up on the stage...

547
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:18,948
singing and playing
my little guitar...

548
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:24,594
And l pissed my dress.

549
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:32,896
lt ran down my leg
and dripped off the stage.

550
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:38,568
And some guy with a mop
came out...

551
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:42,636
and told me to get back
to the audience...

552
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,978
and go find my mom.

553
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:52,413
Come here, sweetie.

554
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:42,105
Cool. Pick him up.

555
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:45,438
- Are you kidding?
- Come on. The Amish rock.

556
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:56,644
Hello.

557
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:59,383
l’m Zachariah.

558
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,254
l’m running away.

559
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,228
OK.

560
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:15,937
So, Zachariah, have you ever
been in a car before?

561
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:18,271
Never one this radical.

562
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:21,935
Do either of you
have a cigarette?

563
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:23,537
You can smoke?

564
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:27,950
As of this moment, l can do
anything l damn well please.

565
00:48:31,122 --> 00:48:34,683
So, you running from something?

566
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:37,159
Conformity.

567
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:38,627
Boredom.

568
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:40,153
And cows.

569
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:44,297
May l pump?

570
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:45,461
Sure.

571
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:46,970
Awesome.

572
00:48:49,473 --> 00:48:50,963
What do l do?

573
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:52,976
OK, no problem.

574
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,979
First, you unscrew
the gas cap, like so.

575
00:48:56,013 --> 00:48:58,038
On some cars, there’s a button
on the inside...

576
00:48:58,082 --> 00:49:00,915
you have to press to unlock it,
but this is an older model.

577
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:04,888
And then you make
your octane selection.

578
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:09,586
We’re on a budget,
so we’ll use this one.

579
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:12,425
And then you put it
in the hole...

580
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:14,590
and you simply pump away.

581
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,362
Yeah.

582
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:25,265
l really like your clothes.

583
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,834
l’m dying to get out of mine.

584
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:36,944
He’s gorgeous.

585
00:49:36,988 --> 00:49:39,821
Come on, man.
So is Norman Bates.

586
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:41,950
l know l would kill
for that hat.

587
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:43,984
When you were walking
over here...

588
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,962
l think l saw him
staring at your ass.

589
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:48,693
- Shut up.
- l’m not kidding.

590
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:54,995
Just my luck--an Amish sodomist.

591
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,234
Go for it.

592
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:59,299
What are you looking at?

593
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,470
Damn, honey, l don’t know.
You ask them.

594
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:04,310
Are you guys some kind
of dragon queens or something?

595
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:07,146
- l’m sorry?
- Don’t even bother.

596
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:14,981
Look, honey, an Amish.

597
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:17,824
You people sure make
a kick-ass pie.

598
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:20,456
That’s some good-eating pie.

599
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:21,897
What the fuck?

600
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:35,803
Fucking perverts.

601
00:50:38,015 --> 00:50:39,482
Look. Check it out.

602
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,021
We’re hungry, mommy.

603
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:29,753
l am starving.

604
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,283
Anything in particular?

605
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,657
May l make a request?

606
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,273
Eat your Whopper
before it gets cold.

607
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:54,773
Whopper? Oh, yes. Thank you.

608
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:05,652
l have a secret confession.

609
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:07,186
l was a fast-food virgin.

610
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:15,838
l have a secret
confession, too.

611
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:18,865
Yeah? What is it?

612
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:24,814
OK. l’ve never really
said this to anyone before...

613
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:29,615
but...l’m kind of a virgin, too.

614
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:32,053
What?

615
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:34,387
Normally l’m really not
this forward...

616
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:37,553
but the light is so beautiful
right now...

617
00:53:37,595 --> 00:53:41,292
and l’m a little tipsy,
and l...

618
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:47,361
l think you’re
the most beautiful man...

619
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,167
that l’ve ever seen.

620
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:53,870
Me?

621
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:02,547
l’m flattered, but...

622
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:13,023
Oh, God.

623
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:14,621
l’m sorry.

624
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,624
He does this. lt’s OK.
He’ll be back.

625
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:25,332
Who are you
fucking girls pledging?

626
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:27,810
Sir, Sigma Alpha Sigma, sir.

627
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:29,210
Excuse me?

628
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:31,680
Sir, Sigma Alpha
fucking Sigma, sir.

629
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:35,515
That’s better.
Troy, you want to crash here?

630
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:37,543
Right on.

631
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:41,752
OK, guys. Get up. Up!

632
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,726
March. Go.

633
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:49,656
After a bottle of this...

634
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,693
our asses are camping
right here tonight.

635
00:54:57,775 --> 00:55:01,609
Absinthe--the green fairy.

636
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:04,705
- Hey.

637
00:55:04,748 --> 00:55:06,181
- Hey.

638
00:55:06,216 --> 00:55:08,548
So, where are your robots?

639
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:13,818
They’re in the camper.
l needed a break from them.

640
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:15,791
Yeah, l bet you did.

641
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:25,422
Hi.

642
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:41,970
This stuff completely fucked me.

643
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,955
Who the fuck was that?

644
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,787
l don’t know.

645
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:03,729
Wait, wait.

646
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:06,926
Could you leave it on?

647
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,835
OK.

648
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:11,204
OK. lt’s OK.

649
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:12,401
OK.

650
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:27,146
Hey.

651
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:28,954
Hey, there.

652
00:57:34,264 --> 00:57:37,392
OK, l think there’s...

653
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:39,299
some kind of twisted fag
sex ring going on here.

654
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:40,462
Really?

655
00:57:40,504 --> 00:57:41,937
That guy just looked at us...

656
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:43,530
like he wanted to peel off
our boxer shorts...

657
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:46,668
and eat us for breakfast.

658
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,541
That is so wrong.

659
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:50,979
This is a public place.

660
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:52,481
Damn queers, man.

661
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:54,643
Yeah.

662
00:57:54,685 --> 00:57:57,381
You can’t trust the...

663
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:59,946
l don’t even wear boxers.

664
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,727
What is that?

665
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:13,861
lt’s a ring.

666
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:27,679
l’m so fucking trashed.

667
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:14,922
You are so beautiful.
You don’t even know it.

668
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:35,184
Look at me.

669
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:40,005
You gonna be all right?

670
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,610
l can go all by myself
now, daddy.

671
01:00:42,653 --> 01:00:45,383
l’m a big boy now.

672
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:47,390
l’ll be right out here
if you need me.

673
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:35,871
Just think,
this time tomorrow...

674
01:01:35,906 --> 01:01:38,170
we’ll be in New York City.

675
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,005
The Big Apple.

676
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:46,573
God, l was so fucking nervous
about the audition.

677
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:49,608
We are talking
killer stage fright.

678
01:01:49,653 --> 01:01:52,850
But now that l know
you’re gonna be there...

679
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:57,622
Buzz-buzz.

680
01:01:57,661 --> 01:02:00,129
Glamour-glamour.

681
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:07,463
We’re closed.

682
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:17,174
l guess we better
put our clothes on.

683
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:24,112
You make me feel warm.

684
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:01,452
Don’t forget me.

685
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:09,465
OK.

686
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:40,392
No one has ever
touched me like you.

687
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,590
l just wanted you
to know that.

688
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,795
OK, l know it.

689
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:54,806
Forgive me, Gypsy.

690
01:03:54,845 --> 01:03:57,837
l thought
this was what l wanted.

691
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:02,075
l don’t understand.

692
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:04,245
l’m going back.

693
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:06,915
Back?

694
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:08,117
Home.

695
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:10,092
l am so, so sorry.

696
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:12,219
What did l do wrong?

697
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:13,388
Nothing.

698
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:17,956
No, you know what?

699
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:19,491
l’m not gonna let you.

700
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:21,629
l’m married.

701
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,600
And we’re gonna have a baby.

702
01:04:29,813 --> 01:04:32,782
l will never forget you.

703
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:36,252
You’re just like
all the rest, huh?

704
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:37,844
Fucking throw me
in the garbage.

705
01:04:37,888 --> 01:04:39,480
Do me a favor.

706
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:41,149
The next time you want
some pussy on the side...

707
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,182
you can fuck
a goddamn sheep...

708
01:04:43,226 --> 01:04:45,490
and leave us women alone.

709
01:04:45,528 --> 01:04:47,962
Get out!

710
01:05:07,717 --> 01:05:09,116
Hey, baby.

711
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:14,453
How was it?

712
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:16,152
Where is he?

713
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:23,455
Why can’t they all
be like you?

714
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:26,128
You OK?

715
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:30,963
What’s wrong?

716
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:32,634
Where’s Troy?

717
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:37,810
You hooked up with him.

718
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:42,645
Oh, my God.

719
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:48,688
l thought l would have
been petrified...

720
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:51,319
but l just dove
right in there.

721
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:54,592
You said you weren’t even
into him. l don’t believe this.

722
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:58,658
You were so right
about the thumb thing.

723
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:01,364
This is great.

724
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:03,269
This is just
fucking sterling.

725
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:05,069
What’s wrong with you?

726
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:07,201
Now you can go join
the fag club...

727
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:10,235
get a tan, big muscles...

728
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,771
some gorgeous boyfriend.

729
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:14,443
Don’t make me laugh.

730
01:06:14,484 --> 01:06:16,315
l’m just wondering what the hell
happens to me...

731
01:06:16,353 --> 01:06:18,821
now that you’ve graduated
to butt-fucking.

732
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,453
Where do l fit in?

733
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:29,129
Why is it always about you?

734
01:06:29,165 --> 01:06:30,757
That’s bullshit.
lt’s not always--

735
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,290
No, it’s always about you.

736
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:35,463
All you can ever think about
is your own fat ass!

737
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:39,464
Where are you going?

738
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:41,272
l need my own space right now!

739
01:06:45,015 --> 01:06:47,483
What are you doing?

740
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:54,984
Oh, my God.

741
01:06:55,025 --> 01:06:57,152
Are you OK?

742
01:06:58,995 --> 01:07:01,259
Maybe l’ll just
catch a ride with Troy.

743
01:07:01,297 --> 01:07:02,924
Shit. lf there is
one scratch on--

744
01:07:02,966 --> 01:07:04,934
Have a nice life!

745
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,339
Fuck.

746
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:52,978
The sun’s up.

747
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:13,165
Goddamn it!

748
01:08:13,203 --> 01:08:15,763
You’re right!

749
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,430
OK?

750
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:24,440
Look, what you said...

751
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:29,942
about how l’m,
you know, selfish or whatever.

752
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:31,954
l’ve been up all night.

753
01:08:35,959 --> 01:08:39,952
You needed me,
and l wasn’t there...

754
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:41,623
and then...

755
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:44,794
l’m sorry.

756
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:47,800
OK?

757
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:55,440
Look, baby, l was just a mess
after Zachariah.

758
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:58,140
What did he do to you?

759
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:01,583
He fucked me,
and then he dumped me...

760
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,415
for his wife.

761
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,284
Oh, my God. He’s married?

762
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:20,930
l always wondered how l’d feel
when you finally did the nasty.

763
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:24,929
Part of me would be
really happy for you.

764
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:28,273
Then the selfish bitch
was always scared shitless.

765
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,778
Why?

766
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:32,940
Because...l don’t want
to lose what we have.

767
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:35,280
Which is what?

768
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:38,014
Something sick and twisted...

769
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:40,614
that we both desperately
need therapy for.

770
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:46,452
Look, all l know is,
when l’m with you...

771
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:51,623
l was just about to say
something really corny.

772
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:56,638
l’m afraid you’re gonna give
your love to someone else.

773
01:10:02,145 --> 01:10:04,636
But enough about me.

774
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:07,149
Let’s talk about you.

775
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:10,983
What do you mean?

776
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,647
l mean...

777
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,857
You can talk to me.
Come on.

778
01:10:16,893 --> 01:10:19,487
l won’t bite you.

779
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:23,491
OK.

780
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:28,334
l guess l thought that...

781
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:30,703
l was in love with you.

782
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,300
And l’m not.

783
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:40,013
lt’s more like...
l worship you.

784
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,554
l’m a fag.

785
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:56,026
l’m really fucking gay.

786
01:11:03,973 --> 01:11:05,804
l’m scared.

787
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:09,641
l know.

788
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,971
You’re gonna be OK.

789
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:45,972
You are so fucking dead!

790
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:02,624
- Valley freak!
- Faggot!

791
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:52,303
Oh, my God.

792
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:56,641
Oh, yes, Lord.

793
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,709
We’re home.

794
01:15:31,574 --> 01:15:33,542
Children of the night.

795
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:45,379
l, the Empress
Chi Chi Valenti...

796
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:55,126
welcome you to the fifth annual
’’Night of a Thousand Stevies!’’

797
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:57,394
Silence!

798
01:15:57,433 --> 01:16:01,802
Goddess Nicks, l call out.

799
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:05,364
lf you are present,
reveal yourself.

800
01:16:07,443 --> 01:16:09,911
Wherever you are tonight...

801
01:16:09,946 --> 01:16:12,881
the recording studios
of Los Angeles...

802
01:16:12,915 --> 01:16:16,783
your desert home
in Paradise Valley, Arizona...

803
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:23,054
please hear our call!

804
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:25,424
Please welcome
our first performer...

805
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:32,958
on this most magical evening--
the lovely Enchantress.

806
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,420
Ask her.

807
01:17:03,466 --> 01:17:06,594
- Love the look, lady.
- Thanks.

808
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:11,429
l would really like
to perform here tonight...

809
01:17:11,474 --> 01:17:12,998
but l missed the audition.

810
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:15,510
l’m sorry.
lt’s totally packed. l don’t...

811
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:17,910
Do you know Velvet Vale?

812
01:17:23,452 --> 01:17:25,352
Anybody here
who’s been here awhile?

813
01:17:25,388 --> 01:17:27,481
Yeah. Chi Chi. She should be
back there somewhere.

814
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:29,286
OK. Thanks.

815
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:37,859
- Hi. l’m Danny.
- l’m Gypsy 83.

816
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:41,269
The judges will adore your cape.

817
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:45,535
Thank you. Actually, he deserves
all the credit, though.

818
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:50,712
This is Clive, by the way.
Excuse me.

819
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:56,511
l’m Hazleton.

820
01:17:56,552 --> 01:17:57,849
Hi.

821
01:18:05,995 --> 01:18:10,295
So, you’re into Poppy Z, right?

822
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:12,527
Yeah, of course.

823
01:18:12,568 --> 01:18:13,865
Oh, my God.
We have so much in common.

824
01:18:13,903 --> 01:18:16,030
l’m obsessed with ’’Lost Souls,’’
you know.

825
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:19,769
lt’s so lyrical and completely
and totally sensual.

826
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:21,470
Yeah. What a great album.

827
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:28,674
’’Lost Souls’’
is a book, sweetie.

828
01:18:28,718 --> 01:18:31,312
Poppy writes books.

829
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:35,489
l’m kind of new at this.

830
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:37,890
Poser!

831
01:18:37,927 --> 01:18:41,294
They’re just jealous
because l like you.

832
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,627
Yeah, right.

833
01:18:42,665 --> 01:18:44,997
Hazleton, darling,
l think your boyfriend...

834
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:48,629
needs to use the bathroom
to powder his nose.

835
01:18:56,245 --> 01:18:59,703
Why don’t you try being a freak
out in the real world?

836
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:04,419
You catty cunts.

837
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:11,419
Honey, here.

838
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:16,921
Let me see.

839
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,931
lt’s Robbie.

840
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:25,099
My name is Robbie.

841
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:31,610
l always hated it.

842
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:36,846
l mean, you know,
’’Clive’’ is way edgier, right?

843
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:44,585
l just don’t
fit in...anywhere.

844
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:14,551
Could l see Chi Chi?

845
01:20:22,998 --> 01:20:26,399
My, aren’t you the cat’s meow?

846
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:30,000
l know that you’re busy...

847
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:32,337
but l drove all the way
from Ohio...

848
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,001
to perform here tonight.

849
01:20:34,043 --> 01:20:36,511
Did you audition?

850
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:38,308
No. We got hung up.

851
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:41,145
Sorry, hons.

852
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:50,252
Do you know her?

853
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:53,119
That’s Velvet.

854
01:20:53,162 --> 01:20:55,392
ls she here?

855
01:20:57,366 --> 01:20:59,630
Chi Chi needs privacy.

856
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:01,693
Yes, Empress.

857
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:07,304
ls she performing tonight?

858
01:21:13,983 --> 01:21:15,883
Open it.

859
01:21:19,722 --> 01:21:22,282
This is me.

860
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:25,987
You have your mother’s eyes...

861
01:21:26,028 --> 01:21:28,087
Gypsy.

862
01:21:29,999 --> 01:21:32,866
You didn’t get
your mother’s poems?

863
01:21:32,902 --> 01:21:34,164
No.

864
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:38,435
She wrote to you for years.
She never heard back.

865
01:21:38,474 --> 01:21:40,999
No, l never got any poems.

866
01:21:43,012 --> 01:21:45,412
Why isn’t she wearing this?

867
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:52,085
l’m sorry.

868
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:55,752
When?

869
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,282
Four years ago.

870
01:21:58,327 --> 01:22:01,421
Why didn’t she
come back for me?

871
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:14,500
My sweet darling, l’m so sorry.

872
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:25,113
Hello.

873
01:22:25,154 --> 01:22:26,815
Daddy.

874
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:29,688
Sweetie, are you OK?

875
01:22:29,725 --> 01:22:31,989
Where are you?

876
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:33,494
l’m in New York.

877
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:36,362
l thought so.

878
01:22:36,398 --> 01:22:38,832
Are you sure you’re OK?

879
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:43,399
l’m gonna sing tonight, dad.

880
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,873
l wish you were here
to watch me.

881
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:50,167
Yeah, me, too.

882
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:56,675
You know, l decided
to finish the studio.

883
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,688
l’ve been working like a dog
since you’ve been gone...

884
01:22:59,722 --> 01:23:04,750
and l got the sixteen-track
working really good...

885
01:23:04,793 --> 01:23:07,626
and l thought,
as soon as you get back...

886
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:11,258
we could start working
on that album.

887
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,235
Why didn’t you tell me
about the poems?

888
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:21,973
Did she recognize you?

889
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:26,504
She’s dead.

890
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:36,151
She killed herself, daddy.

891
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:47,998
And you want to be
just like her, huh?

892
01:23:55,677 --> 01:23:58,510
l love you, sweetheart.

893
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:01,072
Please come home.

894
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:06,615
l’m your daughter, dad.
l’m not your wife.

895
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:10,959
l love you, too.
l’ll call you soon.

896
01:24:21,804 --> 01:24:27,071
Please welcome the daughter
of Mother legend Velvet Vale...

897
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:30,306
Gypsy 83!

898
01:24:42,324 --> 01:24:44,656
l wrote this song for my mother.

899
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:04,776
Lullabies

900
01:25:06,782 --> 01:25:09,444
Her voice so sweet

901
01:25:11,286 --> 01:25:15,552
l remember every moment

902
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:20,290
How she sang me fast asleep

903
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:22,797
And then the emptiness

904
01:25:24,099 --> 01:25:26,294
The angry lace

905
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:33,004
All those gray Novembers

906
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:37,808
Lost, alone, can’t find my way

907
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:42,613
But you come running,
arms wide open

908
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:46,883
Pick me up,
and say we’re spinning

909
01:25:46,922 --> 01:25:50,551
Mama’s home,
her journey’s done

910
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:55,120
Gonna kiss your tears away

911
01:25:55,164 --> 01:25:59,464
And you come running
with your arms wide open

912
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:03,437
Pick me up,
hey, we’re spinning

913
01:26:03,472 --> 01:26:07,340
Mama’s home,
her journey’s done

914
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:12,712
Gonna kiss your tears away

915
01:26:12,748 --> 01:26:16,946
Now l’m awake

916
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:18,976
And l can see

917
01:26:20,756 --> 01:26:25,693
Oh, the nightbird call
you heard so strong

918
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:32,394
You passed along to me

919
01:26:32,434 --> 01:26:35,801
And l’m still running,
arms wide open

920
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:39,705
Hold you tight
and pray l’m dreaming

921
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:43,268
Take me home
with your sweet song

922
01:26:43,312 --> 01:26:47,214
No more tears to wipe away

923
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:51,242
And l’m still running,
arms wide open

924
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:55,017
Hold you tight
and pray l’m dreaming

925
01:26:55,057 --> 01:26:58,754
Take me home
with your sweet song

926
01:26:58,794 --> 01:27:00,728
And promise me

927
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:09,602
Promise me you’ll stay

928
01:27:09,638 --> 01:27:12,106
Lullabies

929
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:29,413
Voice so sweet

930
01:28:10,365 --> 01:28:13,425
Did you find it OK?

931
01:28:13,468 --> 01:28:15,368
Yeah.

932
01:28:15,404 --> 01:28:18,066
OK.

933
01:28:19,441 --> 01:28:21,500
l know you’re doing
the right thing...

934
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:23,272
but l still can’t help
but try and think...

935
01:28:23,312 --> 01:28:25,940
of things to make you stay.

936
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:28,950
l think sometimes
you need to run away...

937
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:31,384
to figure out where you really
need to be is home.

938
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:37,584
Still got stuff
to figure out, don’t l?

939
01:28:56,978 --> 01:28:58,878
l love you.

940
01:28:58,914 --> 01:29:00,575
And l love you.

941
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:06,914
l want you to keep the Trans.

942
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:08,252
No.

943
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,019
l don’t need it anymore.

944
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,724
lt’s getting late.

945
01:29:16,765 --> 01:29:19,859
Go, baby, please.

946
01:29:28,944 --> 01:29:30,571
Drive it back someday.

947
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:31,943
OK?

948
01:29:33,615 --> 01:29:34,946
Yeah.

949
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:56,060
Bye.
