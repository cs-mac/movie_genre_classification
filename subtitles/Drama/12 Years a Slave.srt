1
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:12,532
"All right now. Y'all fresh niggers."

2
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,242
"Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang."

3
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,453
Very simple. I want you
to take your knife.

4
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,372
Get in them cane.

5
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,416
Make it sing.

6
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,459
Take the cane out.

7
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,919
Cut my tops.

8
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,213
Clean the shucks off.

9
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:31,009
Throw it on a pile for the planting gang.

10
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,761
Now, them cane ain't gonna
jump up and bite you.

11
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:34,929
Don't shy back.

12
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,931
Rush here, boys! Rush here!

13
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:41,936
~~My Lord.~

14
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,438
~Sunshine.~

15
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:44,689
~~My Lord.~

16
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,357
~Lord, Lord.~

17
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,900
~~My ma.~

18
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,360
~She dead.~

19
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,737
~~My pa.~

20
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,196
~He dead.~

21
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,573
~~My Lord.~

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,949
~Sunshine.~

23
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,367
~~My Lord.~

24
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,744
~Sunshine.~

25
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,203
~~Is late.~

26
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,747
~In high.~

27
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,081
~~In high.~

28
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,750
~In high.~

29
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,209
~~My Lord.~

30
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,711
~Sunshine.~

31
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,046
~~My Lord.~

32
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,631
~Lord, Lord.~

33
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,049
~~My ma.~

34
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,467
~She dead.~

35
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,885
~~My pa.~

36
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,386
~He dead.~

37
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,804
~~My Lord.~

38
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,306
~Sunshine.~

39
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:19,807
~~My Lord.~

40
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,225
~Yes, sir.~

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
FarangSiam thanks you.
Enjoy!

42
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,181
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

43
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,892
Into bed.

44
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,019
Into bed. Thank you for the music.

45
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,437
- Come on.
- Ouch.

46
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,230
Get in there. Come on.

47
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,025
Give me a kiss.

48
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:25,738
I love you, Margaret.

49
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,615
I love you, too.

50
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,867
Sleep well.

51
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,204
I'll take this.

52
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,417
I don't want to hear any more noise.

53
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,056
Three weeks and two days.

54
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,392
It is the custom.

55
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,811
I wonder what you will do without me.

56
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,605
I won't stay idle.

57
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,234
Darling, it's good money.

58
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,572
If only I didn't have to share
your cooking with other people.

59
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,993
You don't.

60
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,917
Be good for your mother. Okay, Alonzo?

61
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,921
Can I get a kiss, please? Thank you.

62
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,589
Travel safely.

63
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,174
Stay safely.

64
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,762
Ready?

65
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,946
Devil call his name, there he is now.

66
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,448
Mr. Northup!

67
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,325
I have two gentlemen whose
acquaintance you should make.

68
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,494
Misters Brown and Hamilton.

69
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,787
Sir.

70
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,789
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen...

71
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,375
were inquiring about
distinguished individuals...

72
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,210
and I was just this very moment...

73
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,547
saying Solomon Northup is an expert player
on the violin.

74
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:07,882
He was indeed.

75
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:09,267
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

76
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,676
Well, taking into consideration

77
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,219
his graciousness and your modesty...

78
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,389
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?

79
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,807
Of course.

80
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,350
Good day.

81
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,977
A circus?

82
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,184
That is our usual employee.

83
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,077
The company currently
in the city of Washington.

84
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,800
Circus is too constricting a word...

85
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,401
to describe the talented and merry band
with which we travel.

86
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,488
It is a spectacle unlike
most have ever witnessed.

87
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,323
Creatures from the darkest Africa

88
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,075
as yet unseen by civilized man.

89
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,659
Acrobats from the Orient...

90
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,788
who contort themselves
in the most confounding manners.

91
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,873
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown...

92
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,708
an internationally renowned practitioner

93
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,543
in the art of prestidigitation.

94
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,087
We are on our way thither to rejoin

95
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,810
the company having left
for a short time...

96
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,947
to make a small profit from
our own exhibitions.

97
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,729
The reason for our inquiry
with Mr. Moon...

98
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,636
Yes. We had just a devil of a time

99
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,513
in procuring music for our entertainments.

100
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,681
Men of true talents are seemingly
in short supply.

101
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,849
Thank you, sir.

102
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,936
If we could persuade you to accompany us
as far as Washington...

103
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:04,522
We could give you one dollar
for each day's services...

104
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,088
and three dollars for every night played
at our performances.

105
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,032
In addition, we would provide
sufficient pay...

106
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,196
for your return here to Saratoga,
two weeks from today.

107
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,620
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

108
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,421
Hamilton, you know too much.

109
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,090
Some say not enough.

110
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,969
Solomon, 43 dollars. All to you.

111
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,055
That is far more than my wages amount to.

112
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,765
It's been a most profitable week, sir.

113
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,225
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

114
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,601
Cheers.

115
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,732
Another.

116
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:55,281
Gentlemen, your generosity
is extraordinary.

117
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,491
And your talents are undeniable.

118
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,701
Mmm. To Solomon.

119
00:10:58,868 --> 00:10:59,994
Cheers.

120
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,370
Cheers.

121
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,621
Ugh!

122
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,665
It's all right, Solomon.

123
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,958
There's no shame in it.

124
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,543
No shame at all.

125
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,518
Hamilton, we must hurry.

126
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,402
One too many libation.

127
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,779
We're halfway there.

128
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,047
So sorry...

129
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,133
We won't hear it. We won't.

130
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,261
Let him sleep, Hamilton.

131
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,888
Mmm. A good night's rest.

132
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,140
And tomorrow...

133
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,519
tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed

134
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,896
as if the earth were new again.

135
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,816
Hamilton, there's
nothing more we can do for him.

136
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,944
Such is the pity.

137
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,331
Well, boy, how do you feel now?

138
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,587
My name... My name is Solomon Northup.

139
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,008
I'm a free man. A resident
of Saratoga, New York.

140
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,802
The residence of my wife and
children who are equally free.

141
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,846
And you have no right
whatsoever to detain me.

142
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,389
You're not any free man.

143
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:26,849
And I promise you...

144
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,184
I promise you upon my liberation

145
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,478
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.

146
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,606
Resolve this.

147
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,567
Produce your papers.

148
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,243
You're no free man.

149
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,829
And you ain't from Saratoga.

150
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,248
You're from Georgia.

151
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,503
You ain't a free man.

152
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,384
You're nothing but a Georgia runaway.

153
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,099
You're just a runaway nigger...

154
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,518
from Georgia.

155
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,468
You're a slave!

156
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,554
You're a Georgia slave!

157
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,031
Are you a slave?

158
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,492
No.

159
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,051
Help.

160
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,013
Help me.

161
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,183
"Help me!"

162
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,227
"Somebody help me!"

163
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,063
"Help!"

164
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,358
"Help!"

165
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,873
That old thing of yours
is just rags and tatters.

166
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,501
You need something proper to wear.

167
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,881
Go on, put it on.

168
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,568
There.

169
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,323
That's fine.

170
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,700
That's fine.

171
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,479
- Got no gratitude?
- Thank you.

172
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:23,502
No. That's from my wife.

173
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,212
Rags and tatters.

174
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,881
Rags and tatters.

175
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,643
Go on, wash up.

176
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,356
The boy, too. Get him clean.

177
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,402
Scrub now.

178
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,737
Do you know when my mama will come?

179
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,239
"Hush him up!"

180
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,323
Mama! Mama!

181
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,491
Quiet.

182
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,118
- Quiet, please.
- Mama!

183
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,411
"Hush him up!"

184
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,956
Your mother will come, I swear she will.
But you must be silent.

185
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,000
Be silent.

186
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,550
We need a sympathetic ear.

187
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,469
An opportunity to explain our situation.

188
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,638
Who, in your estimation,
is that sympathetic ear?

189
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,515
The two men I journeyed with.

190
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,741
I'm certain they're making
enquiries at this very moment.

191
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,276
I'd be just as certain they're counting

192
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,159
the money paid for delivering you
to this place.

193
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,815
They were not kidnappers,
they were artists. Fellow performers.

194
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,358
You know that?

195
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,527
You know for certain who they were?

196
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:36,366
The reality to come is
us being transported southward.

197
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,619
New Orleans, if I was to venture.

198
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,747
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.

199
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,540
And beyond that...

200
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,936
Well, I suppose once in a slave state,
there's only one outcome.

201
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:47,844
No.

202
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,878
I don't say that to give you
empty agitation, John.

203
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,632
For y'all, there ain't nothing but that.

204
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,258
But John wasn't kidnapped.

205
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,844
John's just being held as debt,
that's all.

206
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,929
Master pay his debt and John be redeemed.

207
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,576
Boy, our masters will not come for us.

208
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,725
John is sorry for y'all,
but that's how it be.

209
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,727
Where you're going,
you're going without John.

210
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,105
- Mama!
- Randall!

211
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,858
Mama!

212
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,403
Are you all right?

213
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,447
Are you all right?

214
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,700
Thank you, God.

215
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,412
Come on. Get up.

216
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,289
- I said, get up!
- No, don't...

217
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,375
I don't want to hear you talk!
Get in the yard.

218
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,584
Not my children!

219
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,088
Ain't no need for all that.
Just taking a little trip, that's all.

220
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,340
Don't want to frighten the children

221
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,092
over a little boat ride, do you?

222
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,927
John's master gonna pay his debt.

223
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,095
Line up!

224
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,380
His master gonna pay his debt!

225
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,938
I don't want to hear a word out
of none of you!

226
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,273
Not a one.

227
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,871
"All right, come on."

228
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,291
"Move. Come on."

229
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,378
"Come on, child. Come on."

230
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,046
"Follow your mama."

231
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,214
"Come on, boy."

232
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,298
"Up these stairs."

233
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,634
"Get down out of that wagon. Come on."

234
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,636
"Come on. Move it!"

235
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,471
"Let's go!"

236
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,973
"Up, Up, up the stairs."

237
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,767
"Come on, let's go."

238
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,773
"Come on, move it!"

239
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,692
"All right, come on."

240
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,738
"Hey, you. Get up."

241
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,823
"Sit down, right there."

242
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,160
"Come on."

243
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,580
"Right there. Just sit down."

244
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,076
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

245
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,424
If you want to survive, do and
say as little as possible.

246
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,138
Tell no one who you really are and
tell no one you can read and write.

247
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,185
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.

248
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,327
"Now keep your mouth shut."

249
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,920
I say we fight.

250
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,422
The crew is fairly small.

251
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,577
Were it well planned, I believe
they could be strong-armed.

252
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,511
Three can't go against the whole crew.

253
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,639
The rest here are niggers.

254
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,349
Born and bred slaves.

255
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,768
Niggers ain't got no stomach for a fight.

256
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,270
Not a damn one.

257
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:37,232
All's I know, if we get where
we're traveling...

258
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,067
we'll wish we'd died trying.

259
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,695
Survival's not about certain death,

260
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,322
it's about keeping your head down.

261
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,120
Days ago, I was with my family...

262
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,456
in my home.

263
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,335
Now you tell me all is lost.

264
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,674
«Tell no one who I am.»
That's the way to survive?

265
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,971
Well, I don't want to survive.

266
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,642
I want to live.

267
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,066
Better off.

268
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,568
Better than us.

269
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,837
I don't see him.

270
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:04,813
Clemens!

271
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,715
- Clemens Ray!
- Master.

272
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,091
- Clemens!
- Master Ray, sir!

273
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,509
Master Ray!

274
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,797
Who's in charge here?

275
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:11,928
I'm the captain!

276
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,263
I'm Mr. Jonus Ray.

277
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,015
My solicitor has documentation...

278
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,934
verifying the negro known as
Clemens Ray is my property.

279
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,437
I know nothing of this arrangement.

280
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,404
You are ordered to return that property

281
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,232
immediately or be charged with thievery.

282
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:26,693
Free him!

283
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,739
Master.

284
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,699
Master Ray, sir.

285
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,076
Clemens!

286
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,443
- Clemens!
- Get him back!

287
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,954
"Clemens!"

288
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,622
"Clemens!"

289
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,374
Clemens!

290
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,025
Mr. Parker.

291
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,403
Ah, Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

292
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,697
Solomon, could I interest you
in a new cravat?

293
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,104
Pure silk, by way of the French.

294
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,868
We're in need of a fresh carryall
for my Mrs.'s travels.

295
00:26:59,035 --> 00:26:59,869
Nothing more.

296
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,704
The year has passed already.

297
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,111
Off to work at Sandy Hill again?

298
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,040
I am.

299
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,542
I have just the thing.

300
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,377
Something to suit your style...

301
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:10,004
and yet sturdy enough
for the 40-mile round trip.

302
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,172
It's beautiful.

303
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:12,257
At what price?

304
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,341
We will take it.

305
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,636
Children, come see what your father
has just purchased for me.

306
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,342
One moment, sir, and you'll be assisted.

307
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,181
- Mr. Parker.
- Sir?

308
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,558
If we could discuss the price.

309
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,531
Oh, forgive me, Solomon.
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

310
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,584
A customer waits. Welcome, sir.

311
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,564
Shop well, sir, but mind your wallet.

312
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,482
Pay no attention
to this gentleman's nonsense.

313
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,733
Jasper!

314
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,028
My regrets for the intrusion, sir.

315
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,072
No intrusion.

316
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,369
Good day, sir.

317
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,037
Good day.

318
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,914
Jasper, out.

319
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,341
Very good. Very good.

320
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,261
Let's see, here. Eliza!

321
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,890
Stand up when you hear your name. Eliza.

322
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:03,600
Lethe!

323
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,820
John.

324
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,690
Oren.

325
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,109
Platt.

326
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,113
Platt.

327
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,743
Stand up.

328
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,121
You fit the description given.

329
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,623
Why didn't you answer when called?

330
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,041
My name is not Platt.

331
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,042
My name...

332
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,087
Your name is Platt.

333
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,467
Captain, get these niggers to my cart.

334
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,314
Mmm.

335
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:00,823
Move.

336
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,079
I believe I have something very much

337
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,789
to your liking in the back room.

338
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,666
Follow me, please.

339
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,669
Yes. Now, inspect them at your leisure...

340
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:17,674
but I ask you to pay particular regard
to young Ezra here.

341
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,092
Incredibly sound limbs.

342
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,344
I have never seen anything quite like him.

343
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:24,347
And this marvelous creature.
Can you believe it? Mmm?

344
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,182
She'll make a fine lady's maid.

345
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,517
Madam?

346
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,519
So, inspect at your leisure.

347
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,980
Take your time.
Help yourself to refreshments.

348
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:35,149
Gentlemen, what catches your fancy here?
Hmm?

349
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,651
This boy? Yes?

350
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,987
Open your mouth. Open wider.

351
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,531
Look in there.
Never been sick a day in his life.

352
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,338
And I call particular attention to Martha.

353
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,827
She is an excellent pastry cook.

354
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,704
Ah, Mr. Ford.

355
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,456
Splendid seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?

356
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,667
This lad? He's very brawny.

357
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,586
How much for the ones Platt and Eliza?

358
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,213
Ah, yes.

359
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,799
A thousand for Platt. Uh... Oh.

360
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,677
This is a nigger of considerable talent,
I assure you.

361
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,554
700 for Eliza.

362
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,389
My fairest price.

363
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:07,890
Mmm.

364
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,892
You will accept a note?

365
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,645
Please, sir. Do not divide my family.

366
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,345
Do not take me unless
you take my children.

367
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,361
Eliza! Quiet!

368
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,118
You will have the most
faithful slave in me.

369
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,828
The most faithful slave
that has ever lived.

370
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,349
But I beg that you do not separate us.

371
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:21,397
Your price for the boy?

372
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,645
Eliza! Stop it!

373
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,171
I will give you something to cry about.

374
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,349
Randall, come forward. Come, come, come.

375
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,619
Now, do you see how fit this boy is?

376
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,038
Like ripe fruit.

377
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,082
May I take your stick a moment?
Observe this.

378
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,251
Randall, jump, jump, jump. Run, run, run.

379
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,587
Very good! Higher.

380
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:38,880
Now, you see this.

381
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,633
It's very likely he will grow into
a fine beast.

382
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,595
600 for the boy.

383
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,263
Fair and final.

384
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,098
Done.

385
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,601
Superb. A moment, please.

386
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,061
Mr. Ford.

387
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,437
Please. Eliza!

388
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,356
How much for the little girl?

389
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,523
Ah...

390
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,108
You have no use for her.

391
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,943
One so young will bring you no profit.

392
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,945
No, no, no. I cannot sell the girl.

393
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:06,741
No, there's heaps and piles of money
to be made from her.

394
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:09,202
She's a beauty. One of the regular bloods.

395
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:12,169
None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated,
cotton-picking niggers, here.

396
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,957
Her child, man.

397
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,175
Please.

398
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,372
For God's sake, are you not sentimental
in the least?

399
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,130
My sentimentality extends
the length of a coin.

400
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,799
God, please.

401
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:26,719
Now do you take this lot, Mr. Ford,
or do you pass on them?

402
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:30,473
Please, please. Please.

403
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,183
I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.

404
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,351
Sold, Eliza and Platt.

405
00:31:33,418 --> 00:31:34,736
I will not go without my children!

406
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:35,853
Goddamn sniveling Wench!

407
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,220
You will not take them from me!

408
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,024
God damn you! Get her out of here, Cape!

409
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,901
Please! No! No!

410
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,694
Get her out of here, god damn it!

411
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,823
Platt, get your fiddle.
Play, play, play something.

412
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,076
I will give you something to cry about,
you goddamned witch!

413
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,412
Get her out of here, Cape! Out, now!

414
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,040
Mama! Mama! Mama!

415
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,960
Yes.

416
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,838
Mr. Ford, a pleasure.

417
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:20,690
Did you bring all those niggers?

418
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:23,109
Two of them? You got two?

419
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,819
Mr. Chapin.

420
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,905
This one's crying. Why is this one crying?

421
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,699
Separated from her children.

422
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,284
- Oh, dear.
- It couldn't be helped.

423
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,702
Poor, poor woman.

424
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,120
- Mr. Chapin.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,746
Tomorrow, you have to take these two

426
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,373
up to the mill and start them working.

427
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,749
For now, make them adequate.

428
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,717
Fix them a meal and have them rest
themselves.

429
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,044
Yes, sir.

430
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,172
Come on, now.

431
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,883
Come on! Don't dawdle!

432
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,802
Something to eat, and some rest.

433
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,409
Your children will soon be forgotten.

434
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,000
For all of you raw niggers
that don't know...

435
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:25,546
my name is John Tibeats,
William Ford's chief carpenter.

436
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:29,091
You will refer to me as «Master».

437
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,970
Mr. Chapin is the overseer
on this plantation.

438
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:37,683
You, too, will refer to him as «Master».

439
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,728
So, clap your hands.

440
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,984
Like this. Come on.

441
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,112
Come on, now. Clap your hands.

442
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,536
~~Nigger run, nigger flew.~

443
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,080
~~Nigger tore his shirt in two.~

444
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:01,582
~~Run, run, the pattyroller will get you.~

445
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,793
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

446
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,216
"That's right. Like you mean it."

447
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,427
~~Nigger run, run so fast.~

448
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,930
~~Stove his head in a hornet's nest.~

449
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,057
~~Run, run, the pattyroller will get you.~

450
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,227
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

451
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:24,313
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~the pattyroller will get you.~

452
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,649
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

453
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,653
~~Some folk say a nigger don't steal.~

454
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,989
~~I caught three in my corn field.~

455
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,324
~~One has a bushel and one has a peck.~

456
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,660
~~One has a rope, ~
~~it was hung around his neck.~

457
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,246
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~the pattyroller will get you.~

458
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,665
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

459
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:45,001
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~the pattyroller will get you.~

460
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,837
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

461
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,339
~~Hey, Mr. Pattyroller, don't catch me.~

462
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,842
~~Catch that nigger behind that tree.~

463
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:55,344
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~the pattyroller will get you.~

464
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,722
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

465
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,016
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~the pattyroller will get you.~

466
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,351
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~well, you better get away.~

467
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,687
~~Run, nigger, run, ~
~~the pattyroller will get you.~

468
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,856
~~Run, nigger, run well, ~
~~you better get away.~

469
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:10,151
«I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac...»

470
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,612
«and the God of Jacob.»

471
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,531
«And when the multitude heard this,»

472
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:18,367
«they were astonished at his doctrine.»

473
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,163
«And then one of them,
which was a lawyer...»

474
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,541
«asked him a question, tempting him.»

475
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,766
"The creek is plenty deep enough to sail."

476
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,477
Even with a boat full of load.

477
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:27,844
The distance from the work area

478
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,273
to the point on the latter bayou...

479
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,990
is several miles by water fewer than land.

480
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,935
It occurs to me that the expense
of transportation

481
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,335
would be materially diminished...

482
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,444
«Materially diminished?»

483
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,571
If we use the waterway.

484
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:40,491
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

485
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,287
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

486
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,623
Let the man says his piece.

487
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,460
It's a scheme. Plenty of engineers
have schemed similarly.

488
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:54,171
The passes are too tight.

489
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,633
I reckon them at more than 12 feet
at their most narrow.

490
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,301
Wide enough for a tub to traverse

491
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:00,845
if a team of niggers cleared it out.

492
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,764
And you know what of transport
and terraforming?

493
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,641
I labored repairing the Champlain canal...

494
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:09,145
on the section over which
William van Nortwick was superintendent.

495
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,189
With my earnings, I hired several
efficient hands to assist me...

496
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,649
and entered into contracts for

497
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,487
the transportation
of large rafts of timber...

498
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,951
from Lake Champlain to Troy.

499
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,492
Well, I'll admit to being impressed
even if you won't.

500
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,579
Collect a team. See what good you can do.

501
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,922
"- You good?
- Clear it out!"

502
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,299
Two, three...

503
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,346
~- Too late ~
~-  for me. ~

504
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,558
~~- I live ~
~- or die. ~

505
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:50,853
~~- Lay down ~
~- and cry. ~

506
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,106
~~- Hey, boy, ~
~- I'm tired. ~

507
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:57,359
~~- My lord. ~
~- Sometimes. ~

508
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,780
~~- I'm strong ~
~- Yes, sir. ~

509
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:04,325
~~- I'm tall ~
~- Yes, sir ~

510
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,490
~~- My lord. ~
~- Sometimes. ~

511
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,291
Platt, you are a marvel.

512
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,675
What took you so long?

513
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,303
Thank you, Master Ford.

514
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,197
Platt.

515
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:04,635
My great thanks, Master Ford.

516
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:06,887
No, my thanks to you.

517
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,348
And it is the least of it.

518
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:12,768
I hope it brings us both
much joy over the years.

519
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:44,633
God!

520
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,639
Eliza.

521
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:56,979
Eliza.

522
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,731
Stop!

523
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:01,150
Stop your wailing!

524
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,029
If you let yourself be overcome

525
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:06,614
by sorrow, you will drown in it.

526
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,490
Have you stopped crying for your children?

527
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:13,829
You make no sounds, but
will you ever let them go in your heart?

528
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,002
They are as my flesh.

529
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,171
Then who is distressed?

530
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,174
Do I upset the master and the mistress?

531
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,676
Do you care less about my loss
than their well-being?

532
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,178
Master Ford is a decent man.

533
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:30,471
He is a slaver!

534
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:31,598
Under the circumstances.

535
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,474
Under the circumstances, he is a slaver.

536
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,684
But you truckle at his boot.

537
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,478
You luxuriate in his favor.

538
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,355
I survive!

539
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,565
I will not fall into despair!

540
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,692
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford!

541
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,654
I will keep myself hearty
until freedom is opportune!

542
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,864
Ford is your opportunity?

543
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,409
You think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest?

544
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,244
But he does nothing for you.

545
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,579
Nothing.

546
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,500
You are no better than prized livestock.

547
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,418
Call for him. Call!

548
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,712
Tell him of your previous circumstances,

549
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,048
and see what it earns you, Solomon.

550
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,386
So, you've settled into your role
as Platt, then?

551
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:15,557
My back is thick with scars...

552
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:18,060
for protesting my freedom.

553
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,645
Do not accuse me.

554
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:24,066
I accuse you of nothing. I cannot accuse.

555
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:27,152
I have done dishonorable things
to survive...

556
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,322
and for all of them, I have ended up here.

557
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:33,867
No better than if I stood up for myself.

558
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,745
God, forgive me.

559
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,707
Solomon, let me weep for my children!

560
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:52,177
«Whosoever, therefore, shall humble»

561
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,430
«himself as this little child...»

562
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,767
«the same is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven.»

563
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:03,856
«And who so shall receive one
such little child in my name...»

564
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:05,858
I cannot have that
kind of depression about.

565
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:08,193
«But who so shall offend
one of these little ones...»

566
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,196
«it were better for him that
a millstone were hanged about his neck...»

567
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:16,118
«and he were drowned
in the depth of the sea.»

568
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,203
Amen.

569
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:19,913
"Amen."

570
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,803
Make them boards flush.

571
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,138
They are, sir.

572
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,307
No, they is no such thing.

573
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:43,062
They are as smooth to the touch
as a yearling's coat.

574
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,566
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

575
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,821
It's all a matter of perspective, sir.

576
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:55,124
From where you stand,
you may see differently,

577
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,784
but the hands are not mistaken.

578
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:01,580
I simply ask that you use all your senses
before rendering judgment.

579
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:06,335
Oh, my, you are a brute.

580
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,421
You are a dog.

581
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,758
And no better for following instruction!

582
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,135
I do as ordered.

583
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:16,386
Then you'll be up at daybreak.

584
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,348
You will procure a keg of nails
from Chapin...

585
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,517
and commence to putting on clapboards.

586
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:22,851
Yes, sir.

587
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,983
Make them boards flush.

588
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,370
"No, please! Please, Sam!"

589
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,872
"Where am I going? Where am I going, Sam?"

590
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,875
"Solomon! Solomon!"

591
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,710
"Solomon!"

592
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,338
"Solomon!"

593
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,052
"Solomon!"

594
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,811
"When I say I had my Master's favor,
you understand."

595
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:09,523
And for nine years...

596
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,569
he blessed me with every comfort
and luxury in life.

597
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,196
Silks and jewels...

598
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,824
and even servants to wait upon us.

599
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,328
Such was our life.

600
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,373
And the life of this beautiful girl
I bore for him.

601
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:31,712
But Master Berry's daughter...

602
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,549
she always looked at me
with an unkind nature.

603
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:40,053
And she hated Emily, no matter she
and Emily were flesh of flesh.

604
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,850
As Master Berry's health failed,

605
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,602
she gained power of the household...

606
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:49,738
and eventually, I was brought to the city
under the false pretense...

607
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,566
of our free papers being executed.

608
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:58,906
My poor children.

609
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:40,614
I thought I told you to commence
to putting on clapboards.

610
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:44,493
Yes, Master, I'm about it.
These have all been replaced.

611
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,913
And didn't I tell you
to get a keg of nails?

612
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,748
And so, I did.

613
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,917
So, you did.

614
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,671
God damn you. I thought
you knowed something!

615
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,339
I did as instructed.

616
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,717
If there's something wrong,
it's wrong with the instruction.

617
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:03,178
You black bastard.

618
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,600
You goddamn black bastard.

619
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,811
Strip your clothes.

620
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,314
Strip.

621
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:16,858
I will not.

622
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:32,541
You will not live to see another day,
nigger!

623
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,668
Help!

624
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,717
Murder!

625
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:45,012
I'm sorry!

626
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,889
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

627
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,519
What is the matter?

628
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,187
What is the matter?

629
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,440
Master Tibeats wants to whip me

630
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:57,983
for using the nails you gave me.

631
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,987
This ain't done by half.

632
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:04,656
I will have flesh.

633
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:07,075
And I will have all of it!

634
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:11,830
Do not stir.

635
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:15,709
Do not leave the plantation.
If you run, I cannot protect you.

636
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,753
Stay here.

637
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:25,070
Gentlemen, whoever moves
that nigger is a dead man.

638
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:29,866
I am the overseer on this plantation.

639
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,744
William Ford holds the mortgage on Platt.

640
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,664
If you hang him, he will lose his debt.

641
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,500
You have no claim to his life.

642
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,502
As for you two...

643
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:43,672
if you have any regard
for your own safety...

644
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,798
I say, be gone!

645
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:50,220
You got no cause!

646
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:53,849
Platt is mine, and mine to do with
as I please!

647
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,934
If you touch...

648
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:23,094
"Sam!"

649
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,089
"Fetch the mule. Get Master Ford."

650
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:23,266
Platt. Poor Platt.

651
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:55,340
I believe Tibeats is skulking
about the premises somewhere.

652
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:58,718
He wants you dead, and he will have it so.

653
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,096
It's no longer safe for you here.

654
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:05,058
And I don't believe you will remain
passive if Tibeats attacks.

655
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:08,269
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.

656
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,355
He will take charge...

657
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,711
Master Ford.

658
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:37,841
You must know that I'm not a slave.

659
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,342
I cannot hear that.

660
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,469
Before I came to you, I was a freeman.

661
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,305
I'm trying to save your life!

662
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:48,017
And I have a debt to be mindful of.

663
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,439
And that is to Edwin Epps now.

664
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,400
And he is a hard man.
Prides himself on being a nigger breaker.

665
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,611
But truthfully, I could find no others
who would take you.

666
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:01,698
You've made a reputation of yourself.

667
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:07,162
Whatever the circumstances,
you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

668
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,875
But I fear no good will come of it.

669
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,399
«And that servant...»

670
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,111
«which knew his lord's will...»

671
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,949
Which knew his lord's will.

672
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:51,706
«...and prepared not himself...»

673
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,877
Prepared not himself.

674
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:02,592
«...neither did according to his will...»

675
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,722
«shall be beaten with many stripes.»

676
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,517
Do you hear that?

677
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,519
Stripes.

678
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,897
That nigger that don't obey his lord...

679
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:18,107
That's his master, do you see?

680
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:23,613
That there nigger shall be beaten
with many stripes.

681
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,035
Now, «many» signifies a great many.

682
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:33,414
40, 100, 150 lashes.

683
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:39,671
That's scripture.

684
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,605
"Pick that cotton."

685
00:55:57,772 --> 00:55:59,691
"Move along, now."

686
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:04,779
"Come on, Edward! Drive them niggers!"

687
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,949
"Pick that cotton! Move along, now."

688
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:10,618
"What are you doing, boy? Come on!"

689
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,665
240 for Bob.

690
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:18,084
What you got for James?

691
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,628
295 pounds.

692
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:23,840
That's real good, boy. That's real good.

693
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,593
182 for Platt.

694
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:31,097
How much can even an average nigger
pick a day?

695
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,515
200 pounds.

696
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:34,559
This nigger ain't even average.

697
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:38,646
512 pounds for Patsey.

698
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:41,482
512!

699
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,404
You menfolk got no shame
letting Patsey out-pick you.

700
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,534
The day ain't yet come she swung lower
than 500 pounds.

701
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:57,332
Queen of the fields, she is.

702
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,541
"138 pounds..."

703
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,460
I ain't done, Treach.

704
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:04,756
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate
on the work Patsey done?

705
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:06,466
"Yes, sir."

706
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,180
Damn queen.

707
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:16,684
Born and bred to the field.

708
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,605
A nigger among niggers.

709
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,692
And God gave her to me.

710
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,783
A lesson in the rewards
of righteous living.

711
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,954
All be observant to that.

712
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,040
All!

713
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,377
Now, Treach. Now speak.

714
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:46,089
138 pounds for Phebe.

715
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,884
Hit 145 yesterday. Pull her out.

716
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:52,720
206 pounds for George.

717
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,056
How much he pick yesterday?

718
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:57,558
"229."

719
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:58,893
Get him out.

720
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,478
Come on, get.

721
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:03,815
"Come on."

722
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:05,775
"Come on, boy, move!"

723
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,009
Get up!

724
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,636
We dance tonight! Get up!

725
00:59:56,803 --> 00:59:58,304
Get your fiddle, Platt. Get up!

726
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:00,515
Come on! Get, get, get!

727
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,517
Come on, Platt. Come on!

728
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,323
Come on, where's your merriment?
Move your feet!

729
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,421
"Sell her."

730
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:33,589
"What's all this?"

731
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:36,259
You will sell the negress.

732
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:38,219
Sell little Pats?

733
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:41,097
She picks with more vigor
than any other nigger.

734
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:42,396
Choose another to go.

735
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,058
No other.

736
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:45,560
Sell her.

737
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:47,311
I will not.

738
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:51,524
You will remove that black bitch
from this property...

739
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,610
or I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.

740
01:00:58,364 --> 01:01:00,658
Back to that hog's trough
where I found you?

741
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:07,498
Do not set yourself up against Patsey,
my dear.

742
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,254
Because I will rid myself of you

743
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,256
well before I do away with her.

744
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:24,724
What you looking at?

745
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:27,685
Damn woman.

746
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,563
I won't have my mood spoiled.

747
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,815
I will not.

748
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:35,032
Dance.

749
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:36,903
Dance, I said!

750
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:42,950
Come on!

751
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:46,454
Pick it up, Platt. Play that fiddle, boy.

752
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,116
"Platt."

753
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:27,453
Yes, Mistress?

754
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:32,041
"Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?"

755
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:33,918
I can, ma'am.

756
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,087
This is a list of goods and sundries.

757
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:39,173
You will take it to be filled
and return immediately.

758
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,550
Take your tag.

759
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,511
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.

760
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:44,679
Yes, Mistress.

761
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,933
Where you from, Platt?

762
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,311
I told you.

763
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:54,230
Tell me again.

764
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:55,773
Washington.

765
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:56,899
Who were your master?

766
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:57,984
Master name a Freeman.

767
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,902
Was he a learned man?

768
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,321
I suppose so.

769
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:03,906
He learn you to read?

770
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,994
A word, here or there.

771
01:03:08,377 --> 01:03:10,088
But I have no understanding
of the written...

772
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:12,331
Don't trouble yourself with it.

773
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,294
Same as the rest. Master brought you here
to work, that's all.

774
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:20,131
Any more will earn you 100 lashes.

775
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:27,114
Come here, boy.

776
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,452
Come on.

777
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:49,303
Where you going, boy?

778
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,972
On my way to Bartholomew's.

779
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:54,392
Sent by Mistress Epps.

780
01:04:58,187 --> 01:05:00,147
You best get there, then.

781
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:02,817
Get there quick.

782
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:53,200
Any trouble?

783
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,870
No, ma'am. No trouble.

784
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,305
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

785
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:57,765
Good morning, Master Shaw.

786
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:00,392
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?

787
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,769
You may.

788
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:13,864
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

789
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:15,616
Nigger Platt.

790
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,576
Patsey, Master wishes you to return.

791
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,370
The Sabbath day, I is free to roam.

792
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:22,540
Master sent me running to fetch you,
said no time should be wasted.

793
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,416
Drink of tea?

794
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,460
Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.

795
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:28,629
Would you know
of Master Epps's consternation...

796
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:31,966
to be any lessened
with your timely return?

797
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,927
Anger's his constant condition.

798
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:35,894
Sit.

799
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,639
Sit and drink the tea that I offered.

800
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:45,896
What'n be Epps's concern?

801
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,483
I'd rather not say.

802
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:54,321
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
All things in moderation.

803
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,117
As you are aware...

804
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:04,164
Master Epps is a man of hard countenance.

805
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:06,667
You know he has ill feeling
towards your husband.

806
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:08,085
He do.

807
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,088
Master Epps has somehow come to believe...

808
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:15,259
that Master Shaw is something
of a Lothario.

809
01:08:16,844 --> 01:08:19,305
A misguided belief, no doubt.

810
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:20,639
No doubt...

811
01:08:20,806 --> 01:08:22,933
if not born out of truth itself.

812
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:26,770
I meant no disrespect.

813
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:28,981
He ain't heard you.

814
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,609
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.

815
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:38,157
Got no cause to worry
for my sensibilities.

816
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:43,495
I ain't felt the end of a lash
in more years I can recall.

817
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,748
I ain't worked a field, neither.

818
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:48,167
Where once I served...

819
01:08:48,334 --> 01:08:51,253
now, I have others serving me.

820
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:54,465
The cost to my current existence...

821
01:08:54,632 --> 01:08:57,760
be Master Shaw broadcasting
his affection...

822
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,763
and me enjoying
the pantomime of his fidelity.

823
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:06,560
If that what keep me from
cotton picking niggers, that what it be.

824
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:10,439
A small and reasonable price
to be paid, for sure.

825
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:17,446
I know what it like to be the object

826
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,157
of Master's predilections
and peculiarities.

827
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,952
A lusty visit in the night...

828
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:26,580
or a visitation with the whip.

829
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,500
Take comfort, Patsey.

830
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,877
The good Lord will manage Epps.

831
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:36,882
In His own time, the good Lord
will manage them all.

832
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:40,427
The curse of the pharaohs
were a poor example...

833
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:43,514
of what wait for the plantation class.

834
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:50,604
This is nice.

835
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,493
"Pats. Patsey!"

836
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,328
Do not look in his direction. Continue on.

837
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:08,706
"- Patsey!"
- Found her, Master.

838
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,500
And brought her back, just as instructed.

839
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:16,213
What did you just now tell her?

840
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,048
What did you say to Pats?

841
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,968
No words were spoken, none of consequence.

842
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,346
You're a liar.

843
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,640
You damn liar.

844
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,685
I saw you talking with her.

845
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:32,187
Tell me.

846
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,524
I cannot speak of what did not occur.

847
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:37,568
I'll cut your black throat!

848
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:38,861
Master!

849
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:40,821
You come here.

850
01:10:41,096 --> 01:10:42,456
- Master Epps.
- I said come here!

851
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:43,889
I brought her back, just like you...

852
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,702
- Come here!
- Master!

853
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:49,913
Master.

854
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:54,835
I got her, just as instructed.

855
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,212
Master Epps!

856
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,006
You stay away from Pats, boy.

857
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,555
Master Epps.

858
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,250
It's the Lord's day.

859
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,588
Ain't nothing Christian in us carrying on
like this.

860
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,013
I concede to you.

861
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:52,017
In the name of valor...

862
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:54,895
help your master to his feet.

863
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:00,692
I'm gonna kill you!

864
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:02,694
What's the fuss?

865
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,530
Master Epps believed Patsey and me

866
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:06,323
to be in conversation when we were not.

867
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,125
I tried to explain,
but it's led to all this.

868
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:08,974
What is it?

869
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:12,037
You can't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?

870
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:13,956
You are a no-account bastard.

871
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,041
A filthy, godless heathen.

872
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,836
My bed is too holy for you to share.

873
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,087
What's he been telling you?

874
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:21,588
Of your misbegotten ways.

875
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,757
And he would know what of anything?

876
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,760
I ain't even spoken with him today.

877
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:29,429
You lying nigger, Platt.

878
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:31,181
Have I?

879
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:34,768
Have I?

880
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,773
There. There's all the truth he got.

881
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:42,025
Damn nigger.

882
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,138
Patsey.

883
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:34,341
"A moment from the dancing."

884
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:37,761
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

885
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:40,680
Thank you, Mistress.

886
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:41,845
Thank you, Mistress.

887
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,017
There will be none for you, Patsey.

888
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:47,020
You see that?

889
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:50,190
You see that look of insolence
she give me?

890
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:52,526
I seen nothing but her turn away.

891
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,903
Are you blind or ignorant?

892
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,364
It was hot, hateful scorn.

893
01:16:57,531 --> 01:16:59,616
It filled that black face.

894
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,440
You tell me you didn't see it...

895
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:05,539
it's because you choose not to look,
or are you saying I lie?

896
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:08,041
Whatever it was, it passed.

897
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:11,461
Is that how you are with the niggers?

898
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:15,215
Letting every ill thought fester
inside them?

899
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:17,384
Look at them.

900
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:19,719
They foul with it.

901
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:21,972
They foul with their hate.

902
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:26,726
You let it be, it's gonna come back to us
in the dark of night.

903
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,436
You want that?

904
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:31,857
You want them black animals leave us

905
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:34,651
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

906
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:36,194
Oh...

907
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:40,073
You are manless.

908
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,909
A damn eunuch if there ever was.

909
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:45,328
If you won't stand for me, I pray you'd

910
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,247
at least be a credit to your own kind...

911
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:49,624
and beat every foul thought from them.

912
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:01,094
Beat it from them!

913
01:18:18,278 --> 01:18:19,112
Eat.

914
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,990
Fill yourselves.

915
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,034
And then we dance.

916
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:31,708
I said, eat.

917
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:47,974
"Platt."

918
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,061
Platt, you awake?

919
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:55,899
I am.

920
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:59,236
I have a request.

921
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:01,905
An act of kindness.

922
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:07,869
I secreted it from the mistress.

923
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:10,379
Return it.

924
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:12,165
It yours, Platt.

925
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,168
For what cause?

926
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:19,506
All I ask, end my life.

927
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:23,927
Take my body to the margin of the swamp.

928
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:27,097
Take me by the throat,
hold me low in the water...

929
01:19:27,264 --> 01:19:29,933
until I is still and without life.

930
01:19:30,517 --> 01:19:32,269
Bury me in a lonely place of dying.

931
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,229
I will do no such thing.

932
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,190
The gory detail with which you speak...

933
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:39,859
I thought on it long and hard.

934
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:43,196
It is melancholia.

935
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,282
Nothing more.

936
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,244
How can you fall into such despair?

937
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:52,455
How can you not know?

938
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:58,545
I ain't got no comfort in this life.

939
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,884
If I can't buy mercy from you...

940
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:07,137
I'll beg it.

941
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:08,888
There are others.

942
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:11,391
- Beg them.
- I'm begging you.

943
01:20:11,558 --> 01:20:12,726
Why?

944
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:17,230
Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an ungodly request?

945
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:19,399
There is God here!

946
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:23,653
God is merciful...

947
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,448
and he forgive merciful acts.

948
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:29,326
Won't be no hell for you.

949
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:32,662
Do it.

950
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:40,795
Do what I ain't got the strength
to do myself.

951
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,961
"It's a plague."

952
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:24,005
"It's cotton worm."

953
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:26,966
"It's a plague. It's damn biblical."

954
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:31,012
"Two seasons God done sent
a plague to smite me."

955
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:36,976
"What I done that God hates me so?"

956
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,318
It's that godless lot.

957
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:49,030
They brought this on me.

958
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:51,491
I bring them God's word and heathens

959
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,868
they are, they bring me God's scorn.

960
01:21:57,539 --> 01:21:58,540
"Damn!"

961
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,417
"Damn you!"

962
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:03,211
"Damn all y'all!"

963
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:31,990
Judge.

964
01:22:32,282 --> 01:22:33,825
Mister Epps.

965
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,414
I am deeply saddened to hear
about your misfortune.

966
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,083
Your price don't reflect your concern.

967
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:45,170
Listen up.

968
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:47,714
You're Judge Turner's for the season.

969
01:22:47,839 --> 01:22:49,674
More, if need be, until my crops return.

970
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,760
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.

971
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:55,847
Don't bring no biblical plagues to him,
you hear?

972
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,099
Or I'll take it out on your skin.

973
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,518
Get out.

974
01:23:52,245 --> 01:23:54,414
Get off the porch.
You ain't supposed to be on the porch.

975
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:55,740
Get off the porch.

976
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:03,790
Platt, is it?

977
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:05,291
Yes, sir.

978
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,461
You cultivate cane previously?

979
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:10,129
No, sir, I have not.

980
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:12,465
It comes to you quite naturally.

981
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:13,633
Are you educated?

982
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,679
No, sir. Niggers are hired to work,
not read or write.

983
01:24:19,514 --> 01:24:21,140
You play the fiddle.

984
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:23,434
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

985
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:26,980
Willard Yarner, a planter up the bayou...

986
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:30,441
celebrates his anniversary
in three weeks' time.

987
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:32,860
I'll hold out your name to him.

988
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,613
What you earn is yours to keep.

989
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:37,365
Yes, sir.

990
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:39,284
Mind yourself, Platt.

991
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:57,255
Whoa!

992
01:27:03,845 --> 01:27:05,179
Joyous day.

993
01:27:05,972 --> 01:27:07,974
Joyous day.

994
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:10,893
Dark times is behind us.

995
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,480
Clean living and prayer done
lifted the plague!

996
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:19,736
As thick and white as New England snow.

997
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:24,073
Now, my niggers is returned to me.

998
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:31,080
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

999
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:39,505
Did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?

1000
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,927
You won't stand idle, boy.

1001
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:47,346
Not on my land.

1002
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:51,893
Much work to do!

1003
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,023
Days of old long since, huh?

1004
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:05,448
Joyous.

1005
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:08,910
Joyous, indeed! Whoo!

1006
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:12,914
Let's go find something sweet for you.
Hmm?

1007
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:14,165
Mmm-hmm.

1008
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:16,633
Candy.

1009
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:18,002
Candy?

1010
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:21,422
~~Oh, pick this cotton.~

1011
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:22,589
~Pick this cotton.~

1012
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:24,926
~~Oh, pick this cotton.~

1013
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:27,220
~Oh, pick that cotton.~

1014
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:29,138
~~Man ain't mean, boys.~

1015
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,848
~Man ain't mean, boys.~

1016
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:33,017
~~Man ain't mean, boys.~

1017
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:34,268
~Man ain't mean.~

1018
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:36,896
~~Oh, work this cotton.~

1019
01:28:37,063 --> 01:28:38,064
~Work this cotton.~

1020
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:40,983
~~Oh, work this cotton.~

1021
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,276
~Work this cotton.~

1022
01:28:42,443 --> 01:28:45,029
~~Oh, work ain't hard, boys.~

1023
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,531
"George."

1024
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:48,449
"180 pounds."

1025
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:50,201
Patsey.

1026
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:52,787
520 pounds for Patsey.

1027
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:55,748
That's my girl. Don't ever let me down.

1028
01:28:56,082 --> 01:28:57,291
Platt?

1029
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,710
160 pounds.

1030
01:29:01,462 --> 01:29:03,047
Armsby?

1031
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:05,508
64 pounds.

1032
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:12,306
A good day's labor
would average 200 pounds.

1033
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:13,850
Yes, sir.

1034
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:21,232
I'm sure in time, you'll develop
as a picker.

1035
01:29:21,649 --> 01:29:23,651
But it takes effort, boy.

1036
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:27,321
Put some damn effort into it.

1037
01:29:27,488 --> 01:29:28,288
Yes, sir.

1038
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:30,408
Take them out, get to whipping.

1039
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,958
"It's a tragedy."

1040
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:41,836
How does such come to pass?

1041
01:29:42,837 --> 01:29:46,048
Working a field and picking cotton
like a lowly hand.

1042
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:48,968
I'm of a damn sight better station.

1043
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:52,096
I worked as an overseer, you know.

1044
01:29:52,263 --> 01:29:53,681
I did not know, sir.

1045
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:55,349
Not «sir».

1046
01:29:56,017 --> 01:29:57,852
Just «Armsby».

1047
01:29:58,728 --> 01:30:00,897
I'm not owed more than any other
in the field.

1048
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:04,025
How did you arrive at such a place,
if I may ask?

1049
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,028
Ask, it's just conversation.

1050
01:30:09,155 --> 01:30:12,116
I became a little too dependent on
the whiskey...

1051
01:30:12,283 --> 01:30:14,744
a little too undependable on the job.

1052
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:18,789
Now, before you say
I'm just a sorry drunkard...

1053
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:21,083
let me state my case.

1054
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:24,128
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

1055
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,339
it is no easy chore on the spirit.

1056
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:30,009
I say, no man of conscious...

1057
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:32,637
can take the lash to another human day
in and day out...

1058
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:35,181
without shredding at his own self.

1059
01:30:36,182 --> 01:30:38,351
Takes him to a place...

1060
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:43,022
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

1061
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,859
or he finds some way to trample
his guilty sensations.

1062
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,362
So, I trampled.

1063
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:51,447
With frequency.

1064
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:56,118
I gave in to tales of wealth
and prosperity.

1065
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:03,876
But such profitable outcomes are reserved
for plantation masters.

1066
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:07,672
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.

1067
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:14,679
Now, all I want is to earn a decent wage
and get myself home.

1068
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:48,963
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.

1069
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:53,926
Just a few picayunes,
but all I have in the world.

1070
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:57,930
I promise them to you
if you will do me the favor I require.

1071
01:31:58,097 --> 01:32:02,143
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

1072
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:03,769
Uh...

1073
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,105
What is it you ask?

1074
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,441
First, your word, sir.

1075
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:10,151
On my honor.

1076
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:14,280
It's a simple enough request.

1077
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:17,450
I only ask that you deposit a letter

1078
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:19,326
at the post office in Marksville...

1079
01:32:19,493 --> 01:32:22,955
and that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

1080
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:28,627
A patron is what I require, sir.

1081
01:32:35,176 --> 01:32:36,010
I'll do it.

1082
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:39,555
And I'll accept whatever
payment's offered.

1083
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:44,852
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

1084
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:47,480
I will do so...

1085
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:50,816
but fair compensation is all I ask.

1086
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:02,244
Draw up your letter.

1087
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,872
We'll meet again in two days?

1088
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:08,375
In two days.

1089
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,671
Thank you.

1090
01:34:30,291 --> 01:34:32,084
Well, boy...

1091
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:37,089
I understand I got a learned nigger
that writes letters.

1092
01:34:38,174 --> 01:34:41,260
Tries to get white fellas to mail them.

1093
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,269
Armsby told me today...

1094
01:34:50,436 --> 01:34:52,938
the devil was among my niggers.

1095
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:57,568
That I had one that needed watching...

1096
01:34:57,735 --> 01:35:00,070
or he would run away.

1097
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:03,908
When I asked him why...

1098
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:08,287
he said you come over to him...

1099
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:11,290
waked him up in the middle of the night...

1100
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:14,126
and wanted him to carry a letter...

1101
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:17,129
to Marksville.

1102
01:35:22,218 --> 01:35:24,637
What do you got to say to that?

1103
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:29,225
There's no truth to it.

1104
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,644
You say.

1105
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:36,106
How could I write a letter
without ink or paper?

1106
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:40,778
Who am I gonna write to?
I got no friends living as I know of.

1107
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:43,572
That Armsby...

1108
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:48,494
That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow.

1109
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:53,249
Didn't he want you to hire him
as an overseer?

1110
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:56,752
Well, that's it.

1111
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:00,329
He wants to make you believe
we're all gonna run away...

1112
01:36:00,339 --> 01:36:02,841
so you'll hire him as an overseer.

1113
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,720
He believes you're a soft soap.

1114
01:36:07,596 --> 01:36:10,057
And he's given to such talk.

1115
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:14,687
Made this story out of whole cloth...

1116
01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:17,564
because he wants a situation.

1117
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:25,406
It's all a lie, Master.

1118
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:32,871
It's all a lie.

1119
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:43,048
I'll be damned.

1120
01:36:49,096 --> 01:36:51,849
Were he not free and white, Platt.

1121
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:56,270
Were he not free and white.

1122
01:38:14,181 --> 01:38:16,266
~~Sun gonna set here. ~

1123
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:18,185
~Under the mountain.~

1124
01:38:18,352 --> 01:38:20,396
~~Sun gonna set here.~

1125
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,272
~Under the mountain.~

1126
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:24,316
~~Sun gonna set here.~

1127
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:26,443
~Under the mountain~

1128
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:29,071
"Edward!"

1129
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:30,864
"Get him water."

1130
01:38:38,205 --> 01:38:39,665
Get up!

1131
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:41,834
Get up!

1132
01:38:48,507 --> 01:38:49,883
Nigger, get up!

1133
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:58,267
"What you looking at, boy?"

1134
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,687
"Keep picking, boy!"

1135
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:18,203
I just wanna say something
about Uncle Abram.

1136
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,543
He was a good man...

1137
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:28,130
"and he always looked out for us
ever since we were little."

1138
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:30,549
"God love him."

1139
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:33,802
"God bless him. God keep him."

1140
01:39:34,887 --> 01:39:36,263
Amen.

1141
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:54,948
~~Went down to the River Jordan.~

1142
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:58,285
~~Where John baptized three.~

1143
01:39:58,452 --> 01:40:01,455
~~When I woke the devil in hell.~

1144
01:40:01,622 --> 01:40:04,416
~~Said Johnny baptized me.~

1145
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:08,086
~~I said roll, Jordan, roll.~

1146
01:40:08,587 --> 01:40:11,089
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1147
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:14,259
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1148
01:40:14,426 --> 01:40:16,970
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1149
01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:20,516
~~Well, some say John was a Baptist.~

1150
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,268
~~Some say John was a Jew.~

1151
01:40:23,435 --> 01:40:25,812
~~But I say John was a preacher~

1152
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:28,941
~~'Cause my Bible says so too.~

1153
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:32,611
~~I said roll, Jordan, roll.~

1154
01:40:32,778 --> 01:40:35,280
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1155
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:38,450
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1156
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:40,369
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1157
01:40:40,536 --> 01:40:41,954
~~Hallelujah.~

1158
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,831
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1159
01:40:44,998 --> 01:40:47,626
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1160
01:40:47,793 --> 01:40:50,837
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1161
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:52,839
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1162
01:40:53,006 --> 01:40:54,216
~~Hallelujah.~

1163
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:57,302
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1164
01:40:57,469 --> 01:41:00,138
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1165
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:03,350
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1166
01:41:03,517 --> 01:41:05,519
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1167
01:41:05,686 --> 01:41:07,020
~~Everybody say.~

1168
01:41:07,187 --> 01:41:10,065
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1169
01:41:10,232 --> 01:41:12,651
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1170
01:41:12,818 --> 01:41:15,821
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1171
01:41:15,988 --> 01:41:17,864
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1172
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:19,157
~~Oh, children.~

1173
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:22,160
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1174
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:24,746
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1175
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:27,833
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1176
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,751
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1177
01:41:29,918 --> 01:41:31,253
~~Hallelujah.~

1178
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:34,172
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1179
01:41:34,339 --> 01:41:36,842
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1180
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:39,886
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1181
01:41:40,053 --> 01:41:42,514
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1182
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,119
"Right to the end."

1183
01:42:12,628 --> 01:42:14,171
Hey, Bass.

1184
01:42:15,088 --> 01:42:16,548
Oh, no, no, no.

1185
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:19,176
No shame in taking respite from the heat.

1186
01:42:19,343 --> 01:42:21,053
Drink, shade.

1187
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,805
It's ungodly for travelers,
hearty or otherwise.

1188
01:42:28,894 --> 01:42:29,978
What's funny?

1189
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:33,857
Epps, I merely mean to finish
the work at hand, as requested.

1190
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:35,817
And as paid for.

1191
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:37,778
If something rubs you wrongly...

1192
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:40,864
I offer you the opportunity
to speak on it.

1193
01:42:44,117 --> 01:42:46,745
You ask plainly, so I will tell you
plainly.

1194
01:42:47,537 --> 01:42:51,750
What amused me just then was your concern
for my well-being in this heat...

1195
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,961
when, quite frankly, the condition
of your laborers...

1196
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:56,328
«The condition of my laborers?»

1197
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:58,423
"It is horrid. It's all wrong."

1198
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,841
"All wrong, Mr. Epps."

1199
01:43:00,008 --> 01:43:02,260
They ain't hired help.

1200
01:43:02,427 --> 01:43:03,470
They're my property.

1201
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:05,305
You say that with pride.

1202
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,140
I say it as fact.

1203
01:43:09,226 --> 01:43:11,895
If this conversation
concerns what is factual

1204
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:14,690
and what is not, then it must be said...

1205
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:17,984
that there is no justice nor righteousness
in their slavery.

1206
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:20,946
But you do open up
an interesting question.

1207
01:43:22,114 --> 01:43:23,532
What right have you to your niggers,

1208
01:43:23,657 --> 01:43:25,033
when you come down to the point?

1209
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:26,743
- What right?
- Mmm.

1210
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:30,205
I bought them. I paid for them.

1211
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:32,332
Of course you did, and the law says

1212
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:34,251
you have the right to hold a nigger.

1213
01:43:34,418 --> 01:43:36,378
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.

1214
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:39,047
Suppose they pass a law taking away

1215
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:41,216
your liberty, making you a slave.

1216
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:42,509
Suppose.

1217
01:43:42,676 --> 01:43:44,302
That ain't a supposable case.

1218
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:45,887
Laws change, Epps.

1219
01:43:46,054 --> 01:43:48,140
Universal truths are constant.

1220
01:43:48,306 --> 01:43:51,143
It is a fact, a plain and simple fact...

1221
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:54,521
that what is true and right
is true and right for all.

1222
01:43:54,688 --> 01:43:56,690
White and black alike.

1223
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:00,152
You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

1224
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:03,155
I'm only asking, in the eyes of God,
what is the difference?

1225
01:44:05,157 --> 01:44:06,877
You might as well ask
what the difference is

1226
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,327
between a white man and a baboon.

1227
01:44:10,537 --> 01:44:13,331
I seen one of them critters in Orleans.

1228
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:15,876
Know just as much as any nigger I got.

1229
01:44:16,168 --> 01:44:17,836
"Listen, Epps."

1230
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:19,671
"These niggers are human beings."

1231
01:44:19,838 --> 01:44:22,198
"If they are allowed to climb no higher
than brute animals..."

1232
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,010
"you and men like you
will have to answer for it."

1233
01:44:26,011 --> 01:44:28,180
There is an ill, Mr. Epps...

1234
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:30,724
a fearful ill resting upon this nation.

1235
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,352
And there will be a day of reckoning yet.

1236
01:44:36,938 --> 01:44:39,608
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass...

1237
01:44:39,775 --> 01:44:41,860
better than any man I know of.

1238
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:46,615
You'd argue that black was white,
or white, black...

1239
01:44:46,782 --> 01:44:49,034
if anybody would contradict you.

1240
01:44:51,036 --> 01:44:54,414
A fine supposition if you lived among
Yankees in New-England.

1241
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:56,249
But you don't.

1242
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:01,880
You most assuredly do not.

1243
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:29,783
"I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!"

1244
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,578
"Patsey!"

1245
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:36,957
"Pats!"

1246
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:39,084
"Where is she?"

1247
01:45:39,835 --> 01:45:41,253
"Where's Pats?"

1248
01:45:41,419 --> 01:45:43,755
"Where is she, damn it? Where is she?"

1249
01:45:45,715 --> 01:45:48,593
Phebs, where is she? Where is Patsey?
Where is she?

1250
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,053
What you standing there for?

1251
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:51,420
We know nothing of her, Master.

1252
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,082
Know nothing of what?
We know nothing of...

1253
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:55,477
Of what? Where has she gone?

1254
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,601
She run off, ain't she?

1255
01:45:56,768 --> 01:45:57,769
I don't know, Master.

1256
01:45:57,936 --> 01:45:59,479
- Where is she?
- I don't know, Master.

1257
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:02,607
You know, you know, you know!

1258
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:03,608
You know!

1259
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:05,443
No, I don't!

1260
01:46:07,612 --> 01:46:09,656
You miserable black dogs.

1261
01:46:09,823 --> 01:46:12,284
You stand like the deaf and dumb.

1262
01:46:14,077 --> 01:46:15,453
Speak!

1263
01:46:30,635 --> 01:46:32,304
She gone.

1264
01:46:34,681 --> 01:46:36,641
My Pats is gone.

1265
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:55,493
Run off? Run off, did you?

1266
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,660
Master Epps... You miserable wench.
Where you been?

1267
01:46:57,787 --> 01:46:59,164
I been nowhere!

1268
01:46:59,331 --> 01:47:00,415
Lies to your misdeeds!

1269
01:47:00,582 --> 01:47:01,903
The Sabbath day, Master. I took me

1270
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:03,198
a walk to commune with the Lord.

1271
01:47:03,335 --> 01:47:04,735
Bring the Lord into your deceptions?

1272
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:06,234
You're coming from Shaw's plantation.

1273
01:47:06,296 --> 01:47:07,589
- No!
- Master Epps.

1274
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:09,132
Now, you speak?

1275
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:11,476
Now that you want to add to her lies,
you find your tongue!

1276
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:13,762
I went to Master Shaw's plantation.

1277
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:15,347
Ah! You admit it.

1278
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,973
Yes, freely.

1279
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:18,975
And you know why?

1280
01:47:19,142 --> 01:47:21,686
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1281
01:47:22,187 --> 01:47:26,191
Mistress Epps won't even grant me
no soap to clean with.

1282
01:47:26,775 --> 01:47:30,362
I stink so much, I make myself gag!

1283
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:36,868
500 pounds of cotton.

1284
01:47:37,035 --> 01:47:39,037
Day in, day out!

1285
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:41,039
More than any man here.

1286
01:47:41,206 --> 01:47:43,291
And for that, I will be clean.

1287
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:45,168
That's all I ask.

1288
01:47:45,335 --> 01:47:48,380
This, here, what I went to Shaw's for.

1289
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:50,882
Liar.

1290
01:47:51,049 --> 01:47:54,636
The Lord knows that's all!

1291
01:47:54,803 --> 01:47:55,720
You're a liar.

1292
01:47:55,887 --> 01:47:59,307
And you, blind with your own covetousness!

1293
01:48:00,183 --> 01:48:02,310
I don't lie, Master.

1294
01:48:02,811 --> 01:48:06,064
If you kill me, I'll stick to that.

1295
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:08,400
I'll fetch you down.

1296
01:48:09,234 --> 01:48:11,277
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1297
01:48:11,736 --> 01:48:12,821
Treach.

1298
01:48:14,864 --> 01:48:16,366
Run and fetch some line.

1299
01:48:16,533 --> 01:48:17,701
Edward!

1300
01:48:19,327 --> 01:48:22,330
Strip her. Strike her bare
and lash her to the post.

1301
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,851
You done this to yourself, Pats.

1302
01:48:54,612 --> 01:48:55,780
"Do it."

1303
01:49:00,869 --> 01:49:03,079
"Strike the life from her."

1304
01:49:09,294 --> 01:49:10,712
Beat her.

1305
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:14,591
Give her the whip! Give it all to her!

1306
01:49:15,884 --> 01:49:18,845
Platt, you come here and you beat her now.

1307
01:49:21,306 --> 01:49:22,390
Platt!

1308
01:49:25,185 --> 01:49:26,436
Come here!

1309
01:49:28,188 --> 01:49:30,356
"I'd rather it you, Platt!"

1310
01:49:31,316 --> 01:49:33,068
You strike her.

1311
01:49:33,943 --> 01:49:35,361
Strike her.

1312
01:49:57,675 --> 01:49:59,260
He pantomimes.

1313
01:49:59,886 --> 01:50:02,305
There's barely a welt on her.

1314
01:50:02,764 --> 01:50:05,141
That's what your niggers make of you...

1315
01:50:05,308 --> 01:50:07,477
a fool for the taking.

1316
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:14,400
"Strike her, Platt. Strike her!"

1317
01:50:31,126 --> 01:50:32,544
You will strike her.

1318
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:34,420
You will strike her until her ﬂesh

1319
01:50:34,546 --> 01:50:36,256
is rent and meat and blood flow equal...

1320
01:50:36,422 --> 01:50:39,217
or I will kill every nigger in my sight.

1321
01:50:39,384 --> 01:50:40,885
You understand me?

1322
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:43,888
Strike her! Strike her!

1323
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:29,934
"Until I say no more.
I ain't said nothing!"

1324
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:41,154
Give me the whip!

1325
01:51:42,155 --> 01:51:43,364
Get up!

1326
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,469
Thou devil!

1327
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:08,556
Sooner or later...

1328
01:52:09,224 --> 01:52:11,809
somewhere in the course of eternal

1329
01:52:11,976 --> 01:52:14,562
justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!

1330
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:23,029
Sin? There is no sin.

1331
01:52:24,489 --> 01:52:27,408
Man does how he pleases with his property.

1332
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:36,751
At the moment, Platt,
I'm of great pleasure.

1333
01:52:36,918 --> 01:52:38,753
You be goddamn careful I don't want to

1334
01:52:38,878 --> 01:52:40,672
come and lighten my mood no further.

1335
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:00,478
Master Bass.

1336
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,940
I want to ask you what part of the country
you come from.

1337
01:55:05,149 --> 01:55:07,026
No part of this land.

1338
01:55:08,111 --> 01:55:10,154
I originate from Canada.

1339
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:12,698
Now, guess where that is.

1340
01:55:12,865 --> 01:55:14,784
I know where Canada is.

1341
01:55:15,618 --> 01:55:17,370
I've been there myself.

1342
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:24,127
Montreal...

1343
01:55:24,293 --> 01:55:27,338
and Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.

1344
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:29,340
Well-traveled for a slave.

1345
01:55:29,507 --> 01:55:30,550
How came you here?

1346
01:55:32,635 --> 01:55:34,303
Master Bass...

1347
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:40,017
if justice had been done,
I never would have been here.

1348
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:46,149
How's this?

1349
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:48,234
Tell me all.

1350
01:55:53,698 --> 01:55:55,867
I'm afraid to tell you.

1351
01:55:57,535 --> 01:56:00,663
Every word you speak is a profound secret.

1352
01:56:08,212 --> 01:56:09,881
Your story...

1353
01:56:10,548 --> 01:56:12,008
it is amazing.

1354
01:56:12,175 --> 01:56:14,177
And in no good way.

1355
01:56:18,931 --> 01:56:22,560
Do you believe, sir, in justice,
as you said?

1356
01:56:23,728 --> 01:56:25,271
I do.

1357
01:56:25,438 --> 01:56:29,233
That slavery is an evil
that should befall none?

1358
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:33,863
I believe so.

1359
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:35,948
If you truly do...

1360
01:56:37,742 --> 01:56:40,786
then I ask, I beg...

1361
01:56:43,456 --> 01:56:46,250
that you write my friends in the north...

1362
01:56:46,626 --> 01:56:49,420
acquainting them of my situation...

1363
01:56:50,796 --> 01:56:55,092
and beseeching them
to forward free papers.

1364
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:01,766
It would be...

1365
01:57:04,769 --> 01:57:07,605
an unspeakable happiness...

1366
01:57:09,232 --> 01:57:11,275
to see my wife...

1367
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:16,072
and my family again.

1368
01:57:21,953 --> 01:57:25,331
I traveled this country
for the best part of 20 years...

1369
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:28,918
and my freedom is everything.

1370
01:57:29,085 --> 01:57:33,422
The fact that I can walk out of here
tomorrow brings me great pleasure.

1371
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:38,302
My life doesn't mean much to anyone.

1372
01:57:39,637 --> 01:57:43,307
It seems yours might mean a lot
to a whole lot of people.

1373
01:57:45,059 --> 01:57:49,522
But what you ask of me, sir, scares me.

1374
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:54,527
And I must say, lam afraid.

1375
01:57:55,653 --> 01:57:57,989
Not just for you, but for me.

1376
01:58:07,164 --> 01:58:09,333
I will write your letter, sir.

1377
01:58:09,775 --> 01:58:11,094
And if it brings you your freedom,

1378
01:58:11,127 --> 01:58:12,367
it will be more than a pleasure.

1379
01:58:12,378 --> 01:58:14,338
It will have been my duty.

1380
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:17,508
Now, would you kindly hand me
those shingles?

1381
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:53,247
"Platt!"

1382
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:55,708
"Where's the boy called Platt?"

1383
02:00:59,003 --> 02:01:00,379
Come here, boy.

1384
02:01:22,526 --> 02:01:24,278
"Your name is Platt, is it?"

1385
02:01:26,071 --> 02:01:27,364
Yes, sir.

1386
02:01:28,032 --> 02:01:29,575
"You know that man?"

1387
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:48,969
Mr. Parker.

1388
02:01:49,637 --> 02:01:51,138
"Say again?"

1389
02:01:53,182 --> 02:01:55,017
Mr. Parker.

1390
02:01:55,476 --> 02:01:58,145
"That man received a letter
compiling many accusations."

1391
02:01:58,312 --> 02:02:00,147
You look me in the eye...

1392
02:02:00,815 --> 02:02:02,495
and on your life,
you answer me truthfully.

1393
02:02:02,566 --> 02:02:04,235
"Have you any other name than Platt?"

1394
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:06,403
Solomon Northup is my name.

1395
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:07,770
"Sheriff, what's all this?"

1396
02:02:07,905 --> 02:02:09,281
It's official business.

1397
02:02:09,448 --> 02:02:10,741
"My nigger, my business."

1398
02:02:10,908 --> 02:02:12,535
Your business waits.

1399
02:02:12,701 --> 02:02:13,786
Tell me of your family.

1400
02:02:14,119 --> 02:02:15,538
I have a wife, two children.

1401
02:02:15,704 --> 02:02:16,580
What the hell?

1402
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:18,793
"- What are your children's names?"
- Margaret and Alonzo.

1403
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,643
"What was your wife's name
before her marriage?"

1404
02:02:20,650 --> 02:02:21,851
Anne Hampton. I am who I say.

1405
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:22,861
Where you going, Platt?

1406
02:02:23,462 --> 02:02:25,382
Who authorized you to interfere
with my property?

1407
02:02:25,506 --> 02:02:26,590
My authority.

1408
02:02:26,757 --> 02:02:28,092
Platt, you come back here. Platt!

1409
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:29,927
You come back here, boy.

1410
02:02:30,928 --> 02:02:32,096
Boy.

1411
02:02:34,557 --> 02:02:36,976
- You unhand him.
- Platt is my nigger!

1412
02:02:37,142 --> 02:02:38,561
He is Mr. Solomon Northup.

1413
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:39,603
You say.

1414
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:42,231
You come here, unfamiliar to me,
and make claims.

1415
02:02:42,398 --> 02:02:44,118
I get no doubts.
The man is Solomon Northup.

1416
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:46,485
The hell he is! He's my nigger,
and I'll fight you for him!

1417
02:02:46,652 --> 02:02:47,945
As is your right.

1418
02:02:48,112 --> 02:02:50,313
As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you
in the courts.

1419
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:52,783
Your decision. Unhand him.

1420
02:02:53,517 --> 02:02:55,127
I know you had some hand in this, Platt.

1421
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,620
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

1422
02:02:56,787 --> 02:02:57,913
Pay him no mind.

1423
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,456
I paid good money for this nigger.

1424
02:02:59,582 --> 02:03:00,958
Courthouse got papers to prove it!

1425
02:03:01,125 --> 02:03:02,918
And we got papers proving he's free!

1426
02:03:03,085 --> 02:03:04,893
I own you. You belong to me.
You hear me, Platt?

1427
02:03:04,962 --> 02:03:06,088
Unhand him!

1428
02:03:06,255 --> 02:03:08,465
You'll have 200 stripes across your back
by sundown!

1429
02:03:08,632 --> 02:03:09,758
Platt!

1430
02:03:09,967 --> 02:03:11,802
"Get my horse, Treach."

1431
02:03:20,936 --> 02:03:22,146
Get away from him, Pats.

1432
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,316
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.

1433
02:03:25,482 --> 02:03:27,443
Solomon, we need to make haste.

1434
02:03:29,153 --> 02:03:30,154
No.

1435
02:03:30,738 --> 02:03:32,072
Solomon.

1436
02:05:09,003 --> 02:05:11,171
I'll apologize...

1437
02:05:13,257 --> 02:05:15,259
for my appearance.

1438
02:05:17,845 --> 02:05:19,763
But I have had...

1439
02:05:20,723 --> 02:05:22,683
a difficult time...

1440
02:05:23,684 --> 02:05:26,395
these past several years.

1441
02:05:31,275 --> 02:05:32,609
Margaret.

1442
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:39,908
Alonzo.

1443
02:06:11,065 --> 02:06:12,775
Who is this?

1444
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:15,819
He's my husband.

1445
02:06:17,321 --> 02:06:18,489
Husband.

1446
02:06:19,323 --> 02:06:22,659
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1447
02:06:24,453 --> 02:06:26,663
We have much acquainting to do.

1448
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:28,165
Yes, sir.

1449
02:06:29,416 --> 02:06:33,462
And this is your grandson.

1450
02:06:34,296 --> 02:06:37,466
Solomon Northup Staunton.

1451
02:06:47,684 --> 02:06:49,269
Solomon.

1452
02:06:55,526 --> 02:06:56,819
Anne...

1453
02:06:59,196 --> 02:07:00,989
forgive me.

1454
02:07:04,535 --> 02:07:08,038
There is nothing to forgive.

1455
02:11:39,351 --> 02:11:42,771
~~Went down to the River Jordan.~

1456
02:11:42,938 --> 02:11:46,108
~~Where John baptized three.~

1457
02:11:46,274 --> 02:11:49,277
~~When I woke the devil in hell.~

1458
02:11:49,444 --> 02:11:52,239
~~Said Johnny baptized me.~

1459
02:11:52,406 --> 02:11:55,867
~~I said roll, Jordan, roll.~

1460
02:11:56,368 --> 02:11:58,912
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1461
02:11:59,079 --> 02:12:02,040
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1462
02:12:02,207 --> 02:12:04,793
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1463
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,338
~~Well, some say John was a Baptist.~

1464
02:12:08,505 --> 02:12:11,091
~~Some say John was a Jew.~

1465
02:12:11,258 --> 02:12:13,635
~~But I say John was a preacher~

1466
02:12:13,802 --> 02:12:16,763
~~'Cause my Bible says so too.~

1467
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:20,434
~~I said roll, Jordan, roll.~

1468
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:23,103
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1469
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:26,273
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1470
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:28,191
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1471
02:12:28,358 --> 02:12:29,734
~~Hallelujah.~

1472
02:12:29,901 --> 02:12:32,654
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1473
02:12:32,821 --> 02:12:35,407
~Roll, Jordan, roll.~

1474
02:12:35,574 --> 02:12:38,660
~My soul will rise in heaven, Lord.~

1475
02:12:38,827 --> 02:12:40,662
~For the year when Jordan roll.~

1476
02:12:40,829 --> 02:12:42,038
~~Oh, roll now.~
