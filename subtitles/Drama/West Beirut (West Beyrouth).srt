1
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,513
If you want any tickets,

2
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,111
you'll have to go round
to the front of...

3
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,754
Well, I suppose it'll be alright.

4
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,871
What the hell am I doing around here?

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,798
They walk in here and...

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,588
Let's see. I hope I got...

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,595
Three?

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,197
That'll be seven dollars...

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,478
...and 50 cents.

10
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,751
No.

11
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,872
Frank?

12
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,518
Frank sent us.

13
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,754
Did you bring a horse for me?

14
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,033
Well, looks like we're...

15
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,555
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

16
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,391
You brought two too many.

17
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,991
Pa!

18
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,031
Look!

19
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,149
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

20
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,478
Timmy.

21
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,716
Maureen, look.

22
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,839
What you doing there?

23
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,837
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,428
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

25
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,950
Patrick's already left
for the station.

26
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,752
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,075
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

28
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,478
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,078
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,634
But these are
the same slices as usual.

31
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,031
Yeah, sure.

32
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,713
As usual.

33
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,516
Maureen.

34
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,233
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,751
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,915
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,270
Who knows?

39
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,516
Patrick!

40
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,631
Wait a minute!

41
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,239
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean 'em.

42
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,755
The train'll come in and there
won't be no one to meet your mother.

43
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,632
Our mother died six years ago.

44
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,670
Go now, or you'll really be late.

45
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,677
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How will I recognize her?

46
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,836
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

47
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,637
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

48
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,431
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

49
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,636
and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

50
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,912
I'm gonna get
some fresh water from the well.

51
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,878
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

52
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,959
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>

53
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,037
<i>And down the mountain side</i>

54
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,752
<i>The summer's gone</i>

55
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,115
<i>And all the roses fall...</i>

56
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,711
Maureen!

57
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,198
What are we gonna do with this one,
Frank?

58
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,519
Now that you've called me by name...

59
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,831
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?

60
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,318
And the prices are good.

61
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,789
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

62
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,956
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

63
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,832
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

64
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,195
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?

65
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,039
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

66
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,628
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

67
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,637
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

68
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,997
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

69
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,315
I got a whole train to unload.

70
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,352
Alright,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

71
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,755
Come on!

72
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,599
What's the name
of the place you wanted to go?

73
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,039
Sweetwater.

74
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,832
Brett McBain's farm.

75
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,474
McBain? Yeah, sure.

76
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,830
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

77
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,396
tilling sand for years
out in the middle of nowhere.

78
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,557
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

79
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,389
could call that stinking piece
of desert Sweetwater.

80
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,272
Sweetwater!

81
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,074
A little more to the right.

82
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,395
Higher.

83
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,954
Hold it there.

84
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,077
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

85
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,034
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

86
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,674
Slow down.
What's the matter with you?

87
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,072
Watch out down there!

88
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,189
Slow down!

89
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,715
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

90
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,990
Don't the train stop?

91
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,038
What can I do for you, ma'am?

92
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,754
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

93
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,271
Water? That word is poison
around these parts

94
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,516
ever since the days
of the great flood.

95
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,598
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

96
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,553
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

97
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,911
You sure can. Just happen
to have a full tub at the back.

98
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,953
You're lucky. Only three people
have used it this morning.

99
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,674
Used it one at a time
or all together?

100
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,509
I can tell
you're accustomed to fine living.

101
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,677
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

102
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,268
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

103
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,231
- You've been there?
- No.

104
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,794
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

105
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,070
You know, she...

106
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,038
Jug.

107
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,632
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

108
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,113
Do you know
how to blow music from that?

109
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,308
Pick it up.

110
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,551
You!

111
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,670
You don't know how to play.

112
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,592
Try this one.

113
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,435
Take it.

114
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,837
Go on.

115
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,479
Here.

116
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,988
Bravo.

117
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,392
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.

118
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,273
It's alright. You're right on time.

119
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,917
To bury my escort.

120
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,710
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

121
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,513
The gun.

122
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,590
You interested in fashions,
Harmonica?

123
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,719
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

124
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,876
They were waiting for a train.

125
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,037
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

126
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,554
So?

127
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,553
Inside the men,
there were three bullets.

128
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,951
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

129
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,991
For two reasons.

130
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,634
One, nobody around these parts

131
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,991
got the guts to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's, man.

132
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,878
Two, Cheyenne's, man,
don't get killed.

133
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,911
That surprise you?

134
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,758
Yeah.

135
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,835
Well, you know music.

136
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,953
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

137
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,872
All the way up to six, if I have to.

138
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,590
And maybe faster than you.

139
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,432
Yeah, go on.

140
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,676
Play, Harmonica.

141
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,519
Play, so you can't bullshit.

142
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,438
Only, watch those false notes.

143
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,793
Like so?

144
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,389
This cousin of mine keeps writing me
to come down to New Orleans.

145
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,115
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

146
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,959
I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

147
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,389
It's too full
of fast men and loose women.

148
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,988
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

149
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,077
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet simple country life.

150
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,118
He's Timmy.

151
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,115
Yes.

152
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,231
Dear God.

153
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,431
On the day...

154
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,592
On the very day of your wedding.

155
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,676
Poor little miss.

156
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,511
Mrs.

157
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,352
Mrs. McBain.

158
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,358
But we all... We thought...

159
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,633
I know.

160
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,719
It was to be a surprise today.

161
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,115
Brett McBain and I were married.

162
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,310
A month ago.

163
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,159
In New Orleans.

164
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,670
I am the resurrection and the life.

165
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,236
He who believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

166
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,478
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Amen.

167
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,633
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

168
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,110
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

169
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,074
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

170
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,156
Cheyenne's hand.

171
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,155
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

172
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,669
We'll make 'em tell us
before we hang 'em.

173
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,957
Let's get moving.

174
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,479
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.

175
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,235
No, Sam.

176
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,716
You go back.

177
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,230
You don't want
to stay out here alone.

178
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,639
Why not?

179
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,512
This is my home.

180
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,433
You know, Wobbles...

181
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,914
...I’m kinda mad at you.

182
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,956
Frank wasn't there.

183
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,714
He sent three friends.

184
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,400
I don't know nothing, I swear.

185
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,877
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

186
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,197
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

187
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,790
- I swear to you that I...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.

188
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,153
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

189
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,953
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

190
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,073
That was always one
of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

191
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,918
I don't know. I swear.

192
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,192
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

193
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,675
I don't know nothing.

194
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,951
Who's there?

195
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,353
Did you make coffee?

196
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,838
Make it.

197
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,316
Didn't sleep a wink.

198
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,638
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

199
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,596
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

200
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,996
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

201
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,830
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

202
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,990
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

203
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,357
Idiots.

204
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,198
What the hell?

205
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,153
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

206
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,355
Be like killing a priest.

207
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,789
A Catholic priest, that is.

208
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,717
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

209
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,119
See, I ain't
the mean bastard people make out.

210
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:56,554
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me...

211
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,831
...it fires me up.

212
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,314
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

213
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,274
...ain't a nice thing to see.

214
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,470
Especially for a lady.

215
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,758
But you're too smart to make him mad.

216
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,279
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

217
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,676
Yeah.

218
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,313
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

219
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,591
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me...

220
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,913
...so they can hang this thing
around my neck...

221
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,036
...I don't like it none.

222
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,196
But I can understand it.

223
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,998
What I don't understand is why.

224
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,592
Neither do I.

225
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,350
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

226
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,868
Yeah.

227
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,469
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

228
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,670
Round. Yellow.

229
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,237
You know the kind.

230
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,310
You rap 'em on a stone...

231
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,755
...and they go "ding".

232
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,995
Maybe.

233
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,556
But I didn't find them.

234
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,997
By the way,

235
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,830
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

236
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,474
He's somebody you'd remember.

237
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,994
Instead of talking, he plays.

238
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,519
And when he'd better play, he talks.

239
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,109
You know, when you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

240
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,759
Sure. You're an expert.

241
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,073
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

242
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,598
Of course I have.

243
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,392
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

244
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,035
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

245
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,878
And even call in your men.

246
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,639
Well, no woman ever died from that.

247
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,673
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

248
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,950
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

249
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,516
With just another filthy memory.

250
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,795
You make good coffee, at least.

251
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,833
Not bad.

252
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,030
Congratulations.

253
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,039
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

254
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,072
I only told you to scare them.

255
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,078
People scare better
when they're dying.

256
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,954
And can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre?

257
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,673
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

258
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,072
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

259
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,510
Let's say
this is something I didn't plan on.

260
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,392
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

261
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,035
You know that.

262
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,039
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

263
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,232
and before my eyes rot,

264
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:21,639
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

265
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,069
I know where you got on board.

266
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,509
I was there, too, remember.

267
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:37,349
To remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

268
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,794
Well, there were a few.

269
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,079
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

270
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,713
And fast.

271
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,549
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

272
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,994
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

273
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,271
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

274
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,873
I watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

275
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,589
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain.

276
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,599
But you,
you just got a little more hasty.

277
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,670
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

278
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,155
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

279
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,713
A lot.

280
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,350
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

281
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,395
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

282
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,874
You'll end up giving orders.

283
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,870
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

284
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,353
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

285
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,040
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

286
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,670
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

287
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,114
It's almost like holding a gun.

288
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,358
Only much more powerful.

289
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,072
You see, staying with you, I...

290
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,352
...I’m beginning to think big, too.

291
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,633
This McBain business...

292
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,071
...has given me ideas.

293
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,634
I'm sorry for you, Frank.

294
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,910
You're doing your best.

295
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,149
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

296
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,029
Why?

297
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,553
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

298
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,715
This is one of them.

299
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,310
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

300
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,275
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

301
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,957
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

302
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,197
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

303
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,155
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

304
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,954
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

305
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,318
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you."

306
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,034
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

307
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,594
And then you happen to meet
a man like this,

308
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,472
who looked like a good man.

309
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,239
Clear eyes, strong hands.

310
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,191
And he wants to marry you.

311
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,390
Which doesn't happen often.

312
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,432
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

313
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,631
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans."

314
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,672
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country."

315
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,314
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all."

316
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,596
"Take care of a house. Do something.
What the hell?"

317
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,957
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain.

318
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,835
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

319
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,116
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

320
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,720
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

321
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,434
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

322
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,030
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

323
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,276
You deserve better.

324
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,232
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

325
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,755
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

326
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,919
She was the biggest whore
in Alameida

327
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,998
and the finest woman that ever lived.

328
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,390
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month...

329
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,034
...he must have been a happy man.

330
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,756
What do you want?

331
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,274
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

332
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,835
This isn't the time to leave.

333
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,636
Give me some water.

334
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,590
From the well.

335
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,199
I like my water fresh.

336
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,316
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

337
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,159
A sound? Like what?

338
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,913
Like that.

339
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,912
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

340
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,078
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

341
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,634
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

342
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,957
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

343
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,957
I remember very well.

344
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,878
Is there something I can do for you?

345
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,632
Yes.

346
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,949
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

347
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,913
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

348
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,508
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

349
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,757
I got my own worries, and all I want
is to be left in peace.

350
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,919
Tell Frank I want to negotiate
with him. Personally.

351
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,670
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

352
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,429
Whatever business you have with
Frank, keep it far away from here.

353
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,030
I know, but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

354
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,277
I thought I should come over here
and tell you about it.

355
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,356
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

356
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,755
Sure, but you know
I'm mighty careful.

357
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,950
No one could have followed me.

358
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,833
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

359
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,315
To listen unseen
and to watch unheard.

360
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,558
You should learn
to live as if you didn't exist.

361
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,910
You've known me a long time, Frank.

362
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,917
You know you can trust me.

363
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,632
Wobbles.

364
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,758
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

365
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,273
The man
can't even trust his own pants.

366
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,033
Let's get out of here.

367
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,437
The end of the line.

368
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,355
Yeah.

369
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,393
Get him on board.

370
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,311
Tie him up.

371
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,518
Wait, Frank.

372
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,073
I didn't...

373
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,633
So, nobody followed you?

374
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,430
No. You gotta believe me.

375
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,994
So, this is the way I can trust you.

376
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,793
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

377
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,070
- Get out.
- No, Frank.

378
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,358
Get out.

379
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,790
Frank, wait!

380
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,358
I told you to keep quiet.

381
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,873
Did Logan and Jim
take care of the woman?

382
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,116
Someone took care of them.

383
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,595
We found them out at McBain's place.

384
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,598
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.

385
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,269
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

386
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,675
First three, then two.

387
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,839
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

388
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,038
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

389
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,669
What do you want?

390
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,836
Who are you?

391
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,918
Dave Jenkins.

392
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,229
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

393
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,278
Calder Benson.

394
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,315
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

395
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,236
You ought to know better than anyone.

396
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,759
You killed 'em.

397
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,315
Who are you?

398
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,590
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!
