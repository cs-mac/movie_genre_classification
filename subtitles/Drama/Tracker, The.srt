1
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,400
The passenger list, sir.

2
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,000
Very good.

3
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,645
Who are the guys Edmond, Brooke soldier?

4
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
Three brothers, sir. All for Africa
broadcast on the same date.

5
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,160
My birthday, sir.

6
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
Is that so?

7
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
Unbelievable ...

8
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
Sir ...?

9
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,320
What is he doing here?

10
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Go back to the coast.

11
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,800
Let this guy take apart the customs, of
Diemen, South African Boer.

12
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,800
Accompanied him here.

13
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Tell him ...
Tell him ...

14
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,920
Major Carlysle that he wants to talk.

15
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,880
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,720
This is, give me another.
- Yes sir.

17
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Brooke! Where are you going to so many
hurry?

18
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,400
I asked one of the Boers
guide.

19
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,360
The Major wants to see him.
- Let me see.

20
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,360
We had to hang them all,
or not?

21
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,280
Instead of a safe haven ...
- Name?

22
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,760
Goddamn!

23
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,160
With me, Brooke.

24
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,280
The next.

25
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,480
Hey!

26
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,240
Mr. van Dijmen?
- Diemen.

27
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
van Diemen.

28
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,285
Hello sir of Dijmen,
what about U. ..

29
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,000
all the way to our remote
corner of the earth?

30
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,200
Curious.

31
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,280
Curious?

32
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,840
You must be very curious to
thousands of miles to travel ...

33
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,880
Sure I'm curious!

34
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,760
Very eager for news of finding out why
you two have crossed oceans ...

35
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:19,120
the British to help my farm
to burn.

36
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,520
Arjan van Diemen ...

37
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
And I thought the war was over.

38
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
Not for you, you murdering bastard, you
under arrest.

39
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,480
Give it away.

40
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,000
Give him his gun back!

41
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
NOW, YOU IDIOT!

42
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
Put your weapon away.

43
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,440
Do you know who this is?
- That's it, thank you Saunders!

44
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,520
Let me not to report lying!

45
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,845
Go back to the harbor, Brooke.

46
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
Give the soldiers a real hero's welcome.
- Yes sir.

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
My apologies for the unworthy reception,
Mr. van Diemen.

48
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Saunders was with me in South Africa.

49
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,720
Apparently he forgot that the war
over. That you understand it?

50
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,120
So you really exist?

51
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I led a cavalry section for
nearly two years searching for U.

52
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,320
Haunted by all you Transvaal
while you cause chaos.

53
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,280
And you, sir.
You could not even catch a poor farmer?

54
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
What's your plan here, van Diemen? You
very far from home. - You too.

55
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
No, this is my home now.

56
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
Home.

57
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,040
Brits seem to your home
Today half the globe to be.

58
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,400
Are U. .. planning to buy some land here?

59
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
Maybe ... You want to start again
farmers?

60
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,280
No, we did not have enough left you,
right?

61
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,960
Well, for what it's worth
Mr. van Diemen ...

62
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,840
I hope you find
you are looking for here.

63
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,560
Come here ...

64
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,960
What is this?

65
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,200
This is a piece of home.

66
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,600
What do you mean home?

67
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
The home of my grandfather.

68
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Sometimes he cried so.

69
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Looks like sand to me.
Red sand.

70
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,200
You're beautiful.

71
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,440
There are a lot nicer in this city.

72
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,880
Some officers are women ...
- No, no, I've seen many women.

73
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Huahine and Tahiti ...

74
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,040
there could be a princess.

75
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Hey hands off, well I can hear them running.

76
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,960
Belongs to the rank, Corporal Drake.

77
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,400
Watch out, Teddy.

78
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Do not call me Teddy, you ...

79
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,040
There's a lantern in the stables!

80
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I will get good cigars!

81
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,240
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

82
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
If the young Lucy is not.

83
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,640
And a damn wild.

84
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,640
What are you doing here?
Apart from the obvious?

85
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,440
I do not know you ...
You know him? - Never seen.

86
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,400
I wonder where his money
gets.

87
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,880
You were not interested in horses
do you?

88
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,280
He talks to you!

89
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,120
Do you think he speaks English?

90
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,640
You may not come here.
Army property.

91
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,000
I say we beat him.

92
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,160
And you undergo your punishment like a good
wanted.

93
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,080
Keep it up!

94
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,400
I will teach our women
fool around.

95
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,680
What did you say?
- Leave him alone you asshole!

96
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,080
You had to take your beating, boy.

97
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,160
Jesus, you fucking ...

98
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,720
You ... You've done it. You did
murdered.

99
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,480
You fucking killed him!

100
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
I'll get a doctor.

101
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,480
Get a doctor!

102
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,760
So you went into the shed and he was you
just like that?

103
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,280
Yes, sir.
- No response?

104
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,240
Well, we asked what he doing
was ...

105
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
We thought he on the horse
had foreseen. - And that was it?

106
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Levin?

107
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,560
That was how it went.

108
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,960
Was that how it went?

109
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,240
Yes, that was how it went.

110
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,640
He came from the whaler
arrived yesterday. - Sergeant Leybourne!

111
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,680
I do not think he comes close, sir.

112
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
Let us take care of that.
He is seen along the coast.

113
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,320
I need 5 men and horses.

114
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,200
He is on foot, so we will
soon have overtaken him.

115
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,480
And dogs?
- No, not dogs!

116
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,040
This is not a blood sport and I do not want
there is one.

117
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,600
Local explorer who ...
- Mr Bryce, sir.

118
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
Yeah, Bryce. I want him here ready to
go within the hour.

119
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,960
We leave at dawn, care for it.

120
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
van Diemen.

121
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
You have not seen anything I assume?

122
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,040
We could use a good sleuth.

123
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,560
The reward is 100 sovereigns.
100 sovereigns alive, 25 dead.

124
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,280
That's a lot of money.

125
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
See that guy?

126
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,480
He has British officers slaughtered.

127
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,560
I want to rig not my area.

128
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,440
You do not worry about it
Sergeant-Major. You're not coming.

129
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,400
You and Levin are not corporal
condition for anything to hunt.

130
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,280
You two go back to the barracks.

131
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I guess I am clear!

132
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,640
Yes, sir.

133
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,400
Yesterday when I arrived at the port have
I have not seen whaler.

134
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,160
They left without him during the
noon tide.

135
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,560
The captain wants to hang himself. Walked
screaming at everyone ...

136
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,800
if she had seen him.
I almost had him locked up.

137
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,400
Why was he so angry?

138
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,360
Well, he had lost his harpoenist.

139
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,280
Harpoon a good man
gold today.

140
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,080
These were all his possessions?
- Yes, and his equipment there.

141
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,800
That?
- Yes.

142
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Okay, dismount. Sergeant Leybourne,
the horses ...

143
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:30,800
rest are required for
a few minutes.

144
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
Mr. Bryce? What is it?
- Maori.

145
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,720
Look. All the weight on the toes.
No heel print.

146
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,840
Weight's right ... according to the distance ...
about its length.

147
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
This is it.

148
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
If he continues to follow the coast, he
Dunny's Point reach, like a boat ...

149
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,200
and the sea on his way you know it.

150
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
Barker soldier!
- Sir!

151
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,840
Go back to the cliff and see if we are to ...

152
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
abutment to the flood arrives.
- Yes, Sir!

153
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
Mr. van Diemen, is there a problem?

154
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,240
It is not him.

155
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,240
No disrespect to Mr. Bryce, but
Our man is accustomed to wearing shoes.

156
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,400
This man, whoever he was ...
never wore shoes.

157
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,560
Major Respectfully, I do not think our
man just a sailor.

158
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,440
I think he gets home.

159
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,320
If we go, we have around
can we cut off before the flood.

160
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,240
Thank you, Barker.

161
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Well. In the stirrups!

162
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,840
van Diemen!

163
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,360
Van Diemen!

164
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,360
Damn! Barker! Get his horse.
- Yes, Sir!

165
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,400
Bryce?

166
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,760
Mr. Bryce?

167
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,320
Your man left with no inventory, no?
- That's right.

168
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
You'd like Mr. van Diemen.

169
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,680
Raupo bread.

170
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,600
Maori corn bread ...
How would he get it?

171
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,360
Look at the size of this fire.

172
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,840
Whoever it was, he was in no hurry.

173
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,680
Mr. Bryce, You tell me now
We have all day to follow the wrong man?

174
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,280
Same build, same height,
Maori wrong.

175
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,840
We had to fuck dogs
entail.

176
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,040
We go back and start where
Mr. van Diemen disappeared.

177
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,200
And you know that you think can?

178
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,360
I now have two tracks to follow ...

179
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,760
instead of one.
- Then we better hurry, right?

180
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
You've fished, huh?

181
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,000
Head ... feet ...

182
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,920
So you knew I loved watching you ...
Good.

183
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,560
You have made shoes yourself, huh?
Smart guy.

184
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,280
The horses will not help us much
From now on, Major.

185
00:28:40,315 --> 00:28:41,920
Okay, thank you Mr. Bryce.

186
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,920
Barker soldier! You bring the horses
back to the barracks in the morning.

187
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:49,280
Yes, sir.

188
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,440
Crowther, we love your horse for the
luggage.

189
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,920
Do not move unless I say so.

190
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,840
I said, do not move!

191
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,560
Stand still!

192
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,280
Stop!

193
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Shut up!

194
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,880
Goddamn!

195
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,400
That's better, not true.

196
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,960
How much they pay for me?

197
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,960
How much?

198
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,240
100 sovereigns alive, 25 dead.

199
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
25?

200
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,320
Many people would be happy with 25.

201
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,360
Luckily I got you.

202
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,240
If I have to kill you, I will do that.

203
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,380
Anyway, anyone who
25 is satisfied ...

204
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:00,440
would probably be too stupid
to find me.

205
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,560
Yes, indeed.

206
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,760
That's 75 sovereigns difference
living and dead.

207
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,600
What about this, how much you give me
if I promise myself not to choke?

208
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
Walk it now.

209
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,400
What are you reading?

210
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,880
Hey, I asked you something.

211
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,320
That the wicked will perish.

212
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,760
"The enemies of the Lord disappear
the fat of lambs. "

213
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,080
"But the righteous shows mercy and
feeding. "

214
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,000
The 37th Psalm.

215
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,440
I have a lot of time in the
Mission school.

216
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,400
There I learned to read.

217
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,760
You're trained.
- Does it matter?

218
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
Maybe ...
- Why?

219
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,160
Because education is the difference between
civilized man and the wild.

220
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
There are no wanted here.

221
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,480
The missionaries taught us all
read. All.

222
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,920
My father was your Bible from cover to
cancel cover.

223
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,640
You can not know your enemy, he said,
until you know his god.

224
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,520
Has he found our god?
- Yes. He has met him.

225
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,440
In a sling.

226
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,720
So what is my life worth now?
125 sovereigns?

227
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,440
I am not a murderer.

228
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,440
You get a fair trial.

229
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I get a fair execution.

230
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,440
What is that?
Let's see.

231
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,000
You can trust me.

232
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,000
Wife, daughters ... beautiful.
- Yes.

233
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,160
How old are they, your daughters?
- 8, 6 and the twins.

234
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,600
And where do they live? In the city?

235
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,320
No, they do not live.

236
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,680
They are buried somewhere in South Africa.

237
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,000
They say if children die, they remain
for all children.

238
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,560
You can not start and the story does not
finish.

239
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,320
That's not good.

240
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
That's not good for your soul.

241
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,960
Stop here.

242
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,120
Okay, let's continue.

243
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,720
It's just mango. That you can eat.
You did not know, huh?

244
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,400
Anyway, you're not educated.

245
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
You see this? Makamaka.

246
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,000
Just chew and your throws
your bowels for days out.

247
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,960
That I do not have to tell
do you?

248
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,285
"His blessing covers the earth
like a river ...

249
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,480
and like a flood the
dry land is drunk '

250
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,080
I would build a raft for us ...

251
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,800
"So his wrath inherit the nations, as
He finds water in brine. "

252
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,920
Stop.

253
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,400
Sit.

254
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,240
Do not move.

255
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm not moving.
- Turn around.

256
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,000
Slowly!

257
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,720
Drop the gun.

258
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,280
Drop the gun!

259
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,720
No.

260
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,000
What?
LET FALL!

261
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,040
No!

262
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
I'll shoot you ...

263
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,120
You know ...

264
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,720
when I travel I always leave the room
free, in case accidents happen.

265
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,840
Before you've loaded, I have a ball
between your eyes.

266
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,440
You're lying.

267
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,560
Frankly, I'm not sure.

268
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,320
I am quite careless of the
last day.

269
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,280
Anyway ...

270
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,520
We will not know until you do
trigger.

271
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
I do not believe you.
- Also good.

272
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,040
And I'll pull the trigger.
- Good.

273
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,280
If you are right, I am dead, I
equal then you die.

274
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,120
Until you pull the trigger, we know that
not.

275
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,680
Drop it!

276
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,280
No!

277
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,800
Drop it!

278
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,920
You let it fall.

279
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,380
I let nothing fall!

280
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,800
I let nothing fall.

281
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
Well ...

282
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,840
We walk to the shore.

283
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,880
Keep your hands where I can see.

284
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,000
No!

285
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,765
No!

286
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,760
I pull the trigger!

287
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,800
I take the gamble.

288
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,040
My legs are cold!

289
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,760
You'd have to stay where
dry.

290
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,000
You're the most annoying
I have ever known.

291
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,240
I'd have to murder
that reason alone!

292
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,960
I thought you were a murderer?

293
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,080
I am no different, I would have immediately
shot!

294
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,160
In that case, you would be dead.

295
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
That we do not know, do you?

296
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,000
I would like to swim.
- No!

297
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,760
They come apart along ...
- Stay there!

298
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,520
and then there are two.
- Both, two men.

299
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,800
Okay, which side?
- This way.

300
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,520
Is that your wife?

301
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,200
What language is this?

302
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,520
I told you, I'm from
South Africa.

303
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
You're one of the Farmers ...

304
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,480
Sounds like our bush language.

305
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,800
Farmer.

306
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,440
That means farmer.

307
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,120
You are the strangest I have ever farmer
encountered.

308
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,320
You fought against the British, right?

309
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,080
My grandfather led our people from the
British.

310
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,400
He was a great leader.
A warrior!

311
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,200
But he lost ...

312
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,000
just like you.

313
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,120
And that brought shame on our nation.

314
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,840
And we were "tangata hara" ...

315
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,960
sinners. Rebels.

316
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm not lost.

317
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,720
Why are you here in my country?

318
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,680
Where is your farm, farmer?

319
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,640
You fought the British and you lost
Also, right?

320
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,000
You lost!

321
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,080
And that's not all it?

322
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,520
Where did you learn to sense?

323
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,480
Daarby.

324
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
What do you mean, Daarby?

325
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,760
My father's servant.

326
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,240
Old Hottentot.

327
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,960
Hottentot ...

328
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,720
Hottentot!

329
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,640
What is a Hottentot?

330
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,600
South African Bushman.

331
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,080
One Bushman, I've never seen.

332
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,560
You'll never see. They are
all gone. Almost.

333
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,000
Like me ...

334
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,040
As stupid as they are, they'll do
get.

335
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,640
And probably shoot.

336
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,520
If I were in your shoes ...

337
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,320
so what ...

338
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,640
I would worry more that they're
will find.

339
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,720
You can not forever escape.

340
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,920
One of us ZLA found. Pray that it
I'm not.

341
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,760
but I'm not the one on the
flight.

342
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,120
You are the one that flight.

343
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,240
And I think ...

344
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,320
I think you have your soul
left.

345
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,160
Now, pull it apart before I break your neck.

346
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,800
You know, if you sit long at sea
all men can shoot.

347
00:46:04,835 --> 00:46:08,160
If someone comes along do not we throw him
on board at the next port.

348
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,400
With you, I think we are not to
next port waited.

349
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,920
Your wife ... how did she die?

350
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,440
Was she ill?

351
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,480
She was sick of you?

352
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,080
Sorry, I did not say.

353
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,800
Run.

354
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,040
What is this?

355
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,360
Biltong.

356
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,520
I'd rather die of hunger ...

357
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,040
Flat here ...

358
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,560
And here.

359
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,920
Blood.

360
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,040
Fighting, or ...

361
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,120
Which way?

362
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,880
Come on.

363
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,480
Would not it be easier to
wait until the water has dropped?

364
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,440
No. I take no risks with the rain.

365
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,360
Not in this fucking country.

366
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,200
It does not rain!

367
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,440
I'm a sailor! I can again
predicted using the water color.

368
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,800
I lied, okay? I lied!

369
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,000
You take me back
to be hung ...

370
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,880
for something I did not even have!

371
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,880
What would you do it? What?

372
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,485
Mr. Silently now huh?

373
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,440
If you say another word, I hang yourself
to that tree!

374
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,000
You lie too!

375
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:58,480
You're lying all by saying nothing. All
not what you say is a lie!

376
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,520
The hell are you talking about?

377
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,440
This is only the second question me
have asked.

378
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,160
And you will answer it!

379
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,600
But you just say that if you hang me
I say another word?

380
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,800
Your wife ...
She died in that war is not it?

381
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,360
That's none of your.

382
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,640
It is true huh?
- None of your business.

383
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,960
I just ask.
- Why ...

384
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,160
No ...

385
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,120
I ...
- She is not dead in that war.

386
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,240
But you said ...
- I do not know how she died, okay?

387
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,560
When that us Brits could not sporty
beat ...

388
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,320
Lord Kitchener sent his troops
our farms to burn.

389
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,880
He drove our women and children
cattle ...

390
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,520
to these camps with barbed wire.

391
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,360
I do not know how they died.

392
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,040
Disease, hunger ... There is no one
who can tell.

393
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,080
We both hate the British.
- I hate the British do not.

394
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,960
Yes.
- I hate the British are not!

395
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,800
I hated my god for a time.

396
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,720
I stood naked before him, I scolded him.

397
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,080
I was so angry.

398
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,160
I thought ...

399
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,600
I knew him.

400
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,560
Then I remembered.

401
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,080
God had not created the wild in me.

402
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,360
"Though he slay me,
I would not hope? "

403
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,160
"Nevertheless, my roads
Defend his face. "

404
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,920
I still think
You hate the British.

405
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,840
You think I'll release.

406
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,080
I do not know. - You think that if
You can make like you and me ...

407
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,160
I would release you.

408
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,480
I fought for something.

409
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You are a criminal.

410
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,920
I am not a criminal.

411
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,040
You walk on my land!

412
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,080
My Tipunas have the mountains and rivers
a name.

413
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,680
It's my bloodline.

414
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,480
And I saved your life, thumbtack.

415
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,040
It's about respect.

416
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,480
I'll tell you what respect is.

417
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,720
During the war my men cut off the
index fingers ...

418
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:04,560
of the heroic British officers off.

419
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,200
Only the heroic. Those who
respect earned.

420
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,160
Do you understand?

421
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,320
That's what I did with people I
respected.

422
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,440
That leaves little hope for me, right?

423
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,120
Hope kills idiots like you every day.

424
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,040
Sergeant, Corporal Crowther send to
barracks for new supplies.

425
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:37,120
This takes a lot longer
than I had hoped.

426
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,440
Let Crowther see where you think we
Tonight will be because I do not know.

427
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,560
It will be a rough estimate Major.
- That I'm sure, Mr. Bryce.

428
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,600
Do you think he is, sir?
That van Diemen?

429
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,200
Without a doubt.

430
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,600
Are the stories they tell about him
where?

431
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,080
About the massacres of M.E.?

432
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,040
Let me say, without
we reward ...

433
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:10,400
it unlikely
have to execute.

434
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
I think that would have deserved
, sir.

435
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,400
Drake was a good man.
- Drake was a monkey dressed.

436
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,320
A disgrace to his uniform and rank.

437
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,880
Apologies, sir, but ...

438
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,320
He did not deserve to die
as he did.

439
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,640
No, you're right.
He did not.

440
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
You have not yet seen action, either
soldier?

441
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,600
No, sir.

442
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,880
Not as such. Not yet.

443
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,360
I hope there.

444
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,480
A warning.

445
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,560
Be sure that your kids if you
ask what you did ...

446
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,160
what you did to your country
defend ...

447
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,600
you can answer them with dignity
business.

448
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,400
What do you mean, sir?

449
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,480
If he survives, he will be honest
trial.

450
00:54:05,515 --> 00:54:07,480
If he is guilty,
he will be hanged.

451
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,280
There will be an example.

452
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,080
Teairra Rua Maimo.

453
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,120
Rua Maimo path.

454
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,080
Spiritual guard.

455
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,680
He is known for its people
who are at risk to save.

456
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,640
What?

457
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,280
This. The Pakeha Townsend called the Gorge.

458
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,360
Let me see.

459
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,600
Listen, you can pull your gun and me
shoot.

460
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,040
Doubt it not.

461
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,880
I will shoot you.

462
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,720
The ball will cost you 75 sovereigns.

463
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,080
Nice.

464
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,840
North ...

465
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,760
South ...

466
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,160
East ...

467
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,440
Oops!

468
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,320
Come on.
Come come come.

469
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,360
I am not much for that idea.

470
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,600
I let you fall.

471
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,600
Let me fall.
- I drop down.

472
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,400
Let go! Let me fall!

473
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,240
I swear I'll shoot you!

474
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,040
You can try.

475
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,160
But to get to your weapon, you'll
rope with one hand to let go.

476
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:36,160
I'll break your bloody neck as you jump.

477
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,280
Or you can fall down with me.

478
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,920
And with the luggage, your gun and your
fat ass you can sink and drown!

479
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,040
I'll shoot you when you fall!

480
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,640
You might miss, and I could
drown.

481
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,840
Rua Maimo would have saved me.

482
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,640
But we will not know, right?
Until you let me fall.

483
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Would you fight me? Come!

484
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,200
Arise!

485
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,640
I am innocent!

486
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
What is wrong with you using?

487
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,520
I'm just trying to uphold the law.

488
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,960
You're a liar!

489
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,880
This has nothing to do with the law!

490
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,160
It is money! You have sold your soul.

491
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,960
You know me to hang
for something I did not even have!

492
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,040
There were witnesses!

493
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,440
Soldiers!

494
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,685
And the woman!

495
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,440
She is a Pakeha woman. And I am a Maori.

496
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,240
They were soldiers who did!

497
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,120
And the soldiers who were my father
hung.

498
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,000
I had to watch.

499
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,605
Then they turned my head
and forced me ...

500
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,440
to see how the father
my friend hung up.

501
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,920
If you kill me, kill yourself. They
will find you.

502
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,520
No matter how long, how many years it takes.

503
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,880
Oh, what a couple of years worth.

504
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,680
What are a couple of years worth of a
condemned man?

505
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,280
Do it!

506
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,680
DO IT!

507
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,560
You can not kill.

508
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,800
You can not.

509
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,120
Everything good?

510
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,000
Pretty good, Mr. Bryce. Thank you

511
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,680
Damn Hori.

512
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,440
That's enough!

513
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,280
That's enough, Mr. Bryce. Unless you allow him
to the city to wear.

514
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,440
Sergeant, tie him up.

515
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,880
Grab the rope.

516
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,920
Mr. van Diemen, you have a clear
few tough days behind.

517
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,280
Yes, sir.

518
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,560
'm Not afraid.

519
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,920
The 100 sovereigns for U.

520
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,960
Commendable.

521
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,120
Come, get up.

522
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,080
Stand up, damn wild!

523
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,840
Arise, murdering bastard!

524
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,920
Major, with your consent. If you are
hands bound before him ...

525
01:02:54,955 --> 01:02:57,960
he goes easier.
And faster.

526
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,440
Sergeant, do what Mr. van Diemen
suggests.

527
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,360
I did not expect to see you until I
back, Sergeant Major.

528
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,845
Crowther said Corporal Your orders
were ...

529
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,140
me to return soon
with new supplies.

530
01:03:41,175 --> 01:03:43,400
I am sure that no corporal
said.

531
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,760
But now you're here, we need only
with it.

532
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,120
But remember well, Sergeant Major. This is
No retaliation.

533
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Hard bastards, right?

534
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,200
My family ...

535
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,560
They fought wars in the country. 30
years ago.

536
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,720
Good fighters.
Smart as weasels.

537
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,320
If you do a wicked war dance
will do ...

538
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,080
their Haka ...

539
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,400
crying like a pack of wild dogs ...

540
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,920
then you know you are in trouble.

541
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Furious.

542
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,240
And the women are worse.
- Excuse me.

543
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,000
I should know.

544
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,680
I am a married.

545
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,000
Some meat ...

546
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,120
Thank you.

547
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,480
You must have been a good soldier.
- I've never been a soldier.

548
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,000
Okay, if we rebel
The British stopped ...

549
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,240
but that was short.

550
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,960
And you fought for your country and
for your freedom.

551
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
That makes a man a soldier.

552
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,240
Fighting for my freedom?

553
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,600
Well, that's so or not?

554
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,520
I'll tell you what for
I fought freedom.

555
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,360
Late one morning ...

556
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,520
The day after New Year ...

557
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,240
I was driving out to my farm.

558
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,480
Then I saw Daarby for the last time.

559
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,000
He hung on the tree of the neighbor.

560
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,000
The British had him hanged?
- No ...

561
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,680
not the British.

562
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,320
My neighbor had him hanged.

563
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,760
To steal from a branch.

564
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,680
82 years old ...

565
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,960
No ancient Bushman would
steal from the whites.

566
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,640
My friend ...

567
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,680
hung on the tree.

568
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,400
He had him six months suspended ...

569
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,400
as an example.

570
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,920
Do you have avenged him?

571
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,000
No ...

572
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,200
I waged war ...

573
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,120
and fought for the rights of those
asshole do it again.

574
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,800
That's the freedom I fought for.

575
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,880
Without freedom we are nothing.

576
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,520
When she hung up my grandfather
he shouted at me.

577
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,280
You have to liberate us all
these Hara.

578
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,480
This shame.

579
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,080
I ran away.

580
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,720
That's different ...

581
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
You was just a boy.

582
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,440
Therefore, they've never hung.

583
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,640
I was not big enough.

584
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,440
The soldiers threw the bodies
Just a hole.

585
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,520
I could not decently buried.

586
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,240
So I ran away.

587
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,480
But I knew in my heart that I
to come back ...

588
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,280
and she was free.

589
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,920
So why did you come back?

590
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,440
Because you have family honor
violated when you ran away?

591
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,760
I had almost made it ...

592
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,040
It is just beyond that ridge.

593
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,200
But you stopped me one.

594
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,400
You stopped me one.

595
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,640
You and your Daarby.

596
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,080
Saunders, I think the prisoner
without your attention to.

597
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,760
The ropes were cut, see?

598
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,560
He has something to do with ropes ...

599
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,280
He has something with cords?

600
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,960
You knew?

601
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,080
You have to let him go!

602
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,320
It was hard enough to catch him ...

603
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,800
do you really think I had
I let go again?

604
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,600
Well, I'll tell you one thing ...

605
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,120
someone has to let him go.

606
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,320
And fast.

607
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,360
He also cut his bracelet.

608
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,760
What is he, Sergeant?

609
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,880
The Wild have been good between them,
but he's fine.

610
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,400
Mr. Bryce!

611
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,760
How long?

612
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,040
Two, maybe three hours.

613
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,320
But he is in bad shape.

614
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,600
He leaves a good trail
and will not get far.

615
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,920
van Diemen!

616
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,840
Mr. Bryce knows what he is talking about.

617
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,840
Excuse me gentlemen, but I
have a bone to pick.

618
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,040
Okay, here we leave the camp.

619
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,760
Mr. Carlysle.

620
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,560
I hope that this is important Saunders.
- I just wanted to ask Mr. ...

621
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,280
Now that the prisoner was armed, we can ...
- Armed?

622
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,400
How armed?

623
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,640
Did you not tell the sergeant Leybourne?

624
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,560
The prisoner has escaped
with Renwick's rifle.

625
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,680
Unfortunately, it seems that the
leukigheden of law ...

626
01:13:49,715 --> 01:13:52,560
luxury that we no longer
can afford.

627
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,400
You have permission to shoot.

628
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,120
But, this is not a game.

629
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,965
There is no place for sports.

630
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,040
I care for a court-martial for everyone
who did not with the first shot kills.

631
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,040
Understood?

632
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,320
Mr. Bryce.

633
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,000
Mr. Bryce.

634
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,360
He could have gone both ways.

635
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,880
If we take the wrong ...

636
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,120
Mr. Bryce, tell me ...
- I love it!

637
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,920
Do that, and fast!

638
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,000
This is a holy place.

639
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,760
The house of Rua Maimo.

640
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,240
I came here with my grandfather when I was
was small.

641
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,480
I had to wait outside while he
Cave went ...

642
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,280
with our spiritual protectors
talk.

643
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,280
Now it's my turn.

644
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:10,360
Time to the mana of my ancestors
cash.

645
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,720
There is only one way out.
You know this area.

646
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,080
Bryce is our lost track, but not for
long.

647
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,280
We need to get you out of here.

648
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,200
Believe me, they'll shoot you now.

649
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,600
I'm still wondering why you
index fingers cut off by British soldiers.

650
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:44,040
God says it is a sin to someone
dead.

651
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,360
Unless your home and family protection.

652
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,760
The weather prevented good men
sinned.

653
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,120
Bryce is better than you thought!

654
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,720
There's enough coverage. If we split
we can around it.

655
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,120
They can not continue.

656
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,520
They have given us yet.

657
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,120
I can not run, I can not climb ...
There is no way around them. - You have to!

658
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,960
I can not run!

659
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,800
We may not have to run.

660
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,440
It's your life.

661
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,640
No! It is your life.

662
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,640
And I'm not a murderer.

663
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,920
We can fight.
Yes?

664
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,240
You have a thing for me.

665
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,160
lets big.

666
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,800
No.
- You should.

667
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,360
I do not.

668
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,320
You gotta help me on my journey to
Hawaiki.

669
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,520
What? - This is the
final resting place for our people.

670
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,280
Let them hang me!

671
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,880
I do not want to die like my forefathers,
hanging on a pole!

672
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,920
Without mana, without dignity.

673
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,560
Saunders, Bryce, take the right.

674
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,640
Sergeant, with me.

675
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,960
van Diemen?

676
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,720
Another trophy for justice
of his highness.

677
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,680
He had courage. He should get respect.

678
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,400
I do not know if Saunders same opinion,
van Diemen.

679
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,840
I have some left for him.
- Fuck off.

680
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,120
I'd rather have his head.
- Before you pay the price.

681
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,040
We must take the corpse.

682
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,560
Let him at least buried.

683
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,920
We can not leave here!

684
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,400
Sorry Mr. van Diemen, there is enough
this wasted time.

685
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,520
I ordered the sheets that you asked
did, sir.

686
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,280
It will be long before your wife
arrives.

687
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,680
He's alive!

688
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,440
Sergeant! Sergeant Leybourne!

689
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,400
I want a man in every port
on the ...

690
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:32,680
lookout for a Maori
without the right index finger.

691
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,080
Now damn it! I want him arrested
are alive and brought here.

692
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,080
van Diemen ...

693
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,080
Major ...

694
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,480
I heard you left.
- This country does not interest me anymore.

695
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,080
Australia.

696
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,640
There is a place called "Van Diemen's
Landing ".

697
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,200
That is to me.

698
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,800
Will you leave without your reward?

699
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,960
25 sovereigns.

700
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,600
It could have been four times.

701
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,200
He's alive, right?

702
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,000
As always should have been
for you ...

703
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,880
he shouted, not even when
You cut off his finger.

704
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,680
I assume that you have your reasons ...

705
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,480
I think I will never understand
they are.

706
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,040
It's a lot of money.

707
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,600
The blessing of the generals.

708
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,320
You were there or not ...?

709
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,960
Have you ordered?

710
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,120
Have you ordered my farm
to burn?

711
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,560
No, I did not.

712
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,880
Tell me ...

713
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,360
there was someone in the house?

714
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,320
When you burning?

715
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,160
No.

716
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,480
I can assure you.

717
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,040
Sir!

718
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,360
We are ready!

719
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,680
The captain wants to leave.

720
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,880
Major ...

721
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,280
van Diemen ...

722
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,520
You know that I sent messengers to every
Port've sent?

723
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:10,360
Each whaling station?

724
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,160
Ever seen that one?

725
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,720
Maybe you did a few weeks
given, perhaps a few days.

726
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,080
I really hope it was worth.

727
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:41,360
Do you know what life means a few days
for a condemned man?

728
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,640
