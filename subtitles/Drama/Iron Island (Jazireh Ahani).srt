1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
In the name of God

2
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Wait.

3
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,942
IRON ISLAND

4
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
It's old,

5
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,920
but it's in good shape.

6
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,840
The rent is reasonable too.

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,360
It comes with everything.

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,480
See.

9
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
It stands like a rock.

10
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Meraj!

11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Give me that megaphone.

12
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Here you go, Captain.

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,960
Meraj!

14
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,840
Where the hell are you?

15
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,320
Lower the lift!

16
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Hey, Meraj!

17
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,680
Let go!

18
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
What's the matter?

19
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,600
What's wrong with you assholes?

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Fighting like animals.

21
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,080
This bastard wrote to my sister.

22
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,720
He's lying, I didn't.

23
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,200
You've fucked up... and you too.

24
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
Haven't I told you
to stay away from this girl?

25
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,480
If I catch you fighting
one more time

26
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,080
I'll throw you in the sea.

27
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Go home.

28
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,640
Get to your work!

29
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,040
Hurry up. Let's go!

30
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,120
Meraj, I've told you
not to leave the lift!

31
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,520
Go get the people down there.

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Tell the guy to use the ladder. Hurry.

33
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
What is it?

34
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Put your shoes on.

35
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Make some tea.

36
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,760
Kid, I've told you a hundred times
that girl isn't right for you.

37
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,680
You don't have anyone.

38
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,560
God knows where
you would've ended up

39
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,720
if I hadn't brought you here.

40
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,520
I put you to work
to earn some money.

41
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,480
To make something of yourself.

42
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,440
She's engaged.

43
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,760
Her dad's very protective.

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,520
When he gets back from the sea,

45
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,120
he'll put you in your place.

46
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,800
He wants to marry off his daughter

47
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,320
to have one less mouth to feed,

48
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
not to add another one.

49
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,720
I have a job... an income.

50
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,120
You call this a job?

51
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
An income?

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,440
- Who's her fiance?
- Never you mind.

53
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,800
- She wants to marry me.
- You both fucked up!

54
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Captain Nemat, they're here.

55
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,240
Hurry up and get this phone working.
People are waiting.

56
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,120
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello there.

57
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,560
- How many children do you have?
- Six, Captain.

58
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,840
Great. May God protect them.
Big family.

59
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,240
- That's life, Captain.
- Stay here.

60
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,440
Look out, girl. Be careful.

61
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,760
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello there.

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,320
- Stay here with us.
- Yes, yes.

63
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,880
I'll give you a job
here on the ship.

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,040
You'll go to work in the morning,
come home after sunset. How's that?

65
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,320
Hello, Captain.

66
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,000
Hello, Haj Khanoom.
You got rid of the bakery?

67
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,360
- I don't have any flour.
- What do you do with it all?

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,440
You keep bringing in new tenants.
So, I bake more.

69
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,920
That's fine, stop whining.
I'll get you more flour.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you, Captain.

71
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,080
No more payments due.

72
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,000
We're even now.

73
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,120
Hey, kid, look out.
Watch your step.

74
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,120
All your kids are girls too.
You have to find husbands for them.

75
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,280
If you stay here
I'll find them good husbands.

76
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Not those penniless punks.
Suitable husbands!

77
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,920
I'll get good prices for you.

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,200
Everything's in order here.

79
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,240
They'll live a happy life together.

80
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
How much is the rent, Captain?

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,160
No rent, my dear sir.

82
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,480
Anything we charge

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,000
is spent on the ship and
it's deducted from your salary.

84
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll show you what you need to do

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,240
and teach you how to do it.

86
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,800
- Hi, Uncle Sadegh.
- Hi there, Captain.

87
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,800
- How are you, Uncle?
- I'm fine.

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,400
What do all animals need

89
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,200
in order to breathe?

90
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
They need air.

91
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,040
Second graders, be quiet.

92
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
First graders, tell me
how many syllables.

93
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,520
Two syllables.

94
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,680
- The first syllable?
- Dosh...

95
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,440
- The second syllable?
- Man.

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Read it.

97
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,400
D... o... sh...

98
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,920
ma... n.
(enemy)

99
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
Uncle,

100
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
I'd like to go to war
and fight the enemy.

101
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
Pay attention.

102
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,840
The war has long ended.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
You mean there'll be no more wars?

104
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
Pay attention, students.

105
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,520
War isn't a good thing.

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,680
May there never be a war
anywhere in the world.

107
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,600
My dad told me
we have to kill the enemy.

108
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,640
Uncle, where is the world?

109
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Where we are now
is part of the world.

110
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,600
So, we're in the world.

111
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,760
Uncle, but this is an oil tanker.

112
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,280
Pay attention, students.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,280
We're inside the ship,
the ship is in the sea,

114
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,080
and the sea is in the world.

115
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,280
So, we're all in the world.

116
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,800
- Understand?
- Yes.

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,560
Uncle, my dad lost his leg in the war.

118
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,360
Uncle, who's the enemy?

119
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,000
You can relax.
Everything's at hand.

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,560
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello there.

121
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,240
Hello, teacher.

122
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Please.
This is the classroom.

123
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,640
The kids can start right away.

124
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Education is more necessary
to them than food.

125
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,160
I've brought you
four wonderful students.

126
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,960
Here's the paper.

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,360
Thanks, but the school
is getting very crowded.

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,400
Praise the Lord.
Thank God for that.

129
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
This teacher is truly kind.

130
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
A hard worker.

131
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,680
You're kind. Thank you.

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
So, I'll leave these
students with you.

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
These are old newspapers again.

134
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,360
Abdolkarim, what's the difference?
Just read it for fun.

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,520
Let's go, my dear sir.

136
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
Bye for now.

137
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,000
- I need to talk to you, Captain.
- Okay, fine.

138
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,000
- It's important.
- Do come and see me.

139
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,600
I'll come to see you.

140
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,160
- It's important. I have to see you.
- Okay, fine.

141
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,160
Can you read or write?

142
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
How about you?

143
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,880
And you?

144
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
You?

145
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,960
I need to speak to Private Mohammad.

146
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,040
Yes, his wife wants to speak to him.

147
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Hi, Mohammad, how are you?

148
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,440
Hold on, hold on.

149
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,000
Hi. How are you?

150
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,880
She's fine too.
I'm holding her.

151
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,800
Your mom's fine too.
Everyone says hello.

152
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,840
I've got you some dates.

153
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,560
When are you coming?

154
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,680
The Captain looks after us.

155
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,440
Okay, okay.
I'm waiting for you.

156
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Bye.

157
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,360
Thank you.

158
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,200
- Should I put it on your account?
- Yes.

159
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Next.

160
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Dial this number for me.

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,600
Make up your mind.

162
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
I only have this one room.

163
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,680
It belonged to a guy
who used to work here.

164
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,640
He made good money,
set up his own house.

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,560
Now he's living a comfortable life.

166
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,200
- Here you go. This is it.
- Thank you.

167
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,960
I'll have them give you
a large carton,

168
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
so you can make a divider.

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,760
Clean it up,
put a carpet here

170
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,480
and live a lifetime of comfort.

171
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,200
Hello there.

172
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
How are you?

173
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,040
Here are your new neighbors.

174
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,720
They can give you anything
you need for the cleaning.

175
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,920
They're good people.
They look out for each other.

176
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,400
I'll take care of your job right away.
Now get on with your life.

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,320
Send some money.

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,520
I have no money.

179
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,880
I got cut off. Dial again.

180
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,200
He got the message.
He has to send money.

181
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,480
- Put it on my account.
- I can't.

182
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,000
You owe me money.

183
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,360
I don't have any.

184
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,560
I don't care. You owe a lot.

185
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,080
I have no money.

186
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,080
- What'll I tell the Captain?
- I'll talk to him.

187
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,800
- Right, you talk to him.
- Yes, yes.

188
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Next person.

189
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Dial this number.

190
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,400
Hi.

191
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,160
Is this Captain Abdallah's raft?

192
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,680
I want to speak to Issah.

193
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
I'm his son.

194
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

195
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,400
- I need to change the oil.
- So, do it.

196
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,400
- We have no oil.
- I'll send you some.

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Hello there.

198
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,960
Hello there.
God bless you.

199
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,360
Hi, Bibi Khanoom.
How are you?

200
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
In pain.

201
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Is it your knee?

202
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Use this ointment every night.
It'll take care of it.

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,160
- Here you go. Bye.
- Thank you.

204
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,160
God willing, you'll get better.

205
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,480
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

206
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,520
Do something, Captain.
We have no oil.

207
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
- Oil?
- We have no lamps.

208
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,240
I'll have them bring you some
from the reservoir.

209
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Thanks.

210
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Bye.

211
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,360
These burkas are ready.

213
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,760
- How many are there?
- Eight.

214
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,000
- Should I put it on your account?
- Yes, please.

215
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Fine, eight burkas

216
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
for Mrs. Ommalbani.

217
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,960
Hi, Captain.

218
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Hi there.

219
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,880
Does she still have a fever?

220
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
- Is she feeling any better?
- No, Captain.

221
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,440
- How about yourself?
- Thank you. I'm okay.

222
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,800
- Any news from your husband?
- No news.

223
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,360
It's been eight months now.

224
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,920
I'll give you to your mom.
Calm down.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,400
God willing, he'll come back
one of these days with good news.

226
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,520
Thank you.

227
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,320
Be careful,
you're about to give birth.

228
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,520
Give her one of these pills
every morning

229
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,760
and a spoon of this syrup every night
before she goes to sleep.

230
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,120
Good. She's quiet now.

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,960
Thanks, you've calmed her down.

232
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll put it on your account.

233
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm so grateful.

234
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Bye.

235
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
- Hi.
- Hi there.

236
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,160
- Kid, why aren't you at school?
- He's sick.

237
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
Sick? Kids have to go to school.

238
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,960
- God willing, he'll go tomorrow.
- Make sure he does.

239
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,960
- Hi, Captain Nemat.
- Hi, Uncle Abdolkarim.

240
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Wait, Captain.

241
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,200
I need to talk to you.

242
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,960
You've probably
invented something again.

243
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
You better see it up close.

244
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Come with me, Captain.

245
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,000
- What's this?
- The machine I've designed.

246
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
One end of this rope's tied
to a float in the sea.

247
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
The other end is tied to this weight.

248
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,360
As the float rises,
the weight will drop.

249
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,320
When does it rise?
When the ship sinks in the water.

250
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,560
The ship's sunk this much
over the last two months.

251
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,800
What do you think?

252
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,760
You've said for years
the ship's sinking.

253
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,120
We haven't seen a thing.

254
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,680
Thank God, this ship is
still standing like a rock.

255
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,000
It's sunk two meters
since a few years ago,

256
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,560
but it can't be seen
with the naked eye.

257
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,360
Give me a break.

258
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,840
When the tide is low, eight meters
of the ship is out of the water.

259
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,200
You say it's sunk two meters
in the last few years.

260
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,440
Who cares what happens
in a hundred years?

261
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
Captain Nemat,

262
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,360
if this continues, the ship will sink.

263
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,800
Instead of having
these negative thoughts

264
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,360
and the nonsense that you put
in poor children's heads,

265
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,240
you should think of
something useful,

266
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,040
something that would make
them successful in the future.

267
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,080
Captain Nemat
to the Phone Company.

268
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,280
- Captain, they're calling you.
- Who is it?

269
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,360
Hello there.

270
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,400
You shouldn't have called me here.

271
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,920
I told you that I'd
contact you myself.

272
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,080
What do you mean
it doesn't concern me?

273
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,600
No, I can't do this.

274
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,840
What do you mean?
Where the hell should I tell them to go?

275
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,920
You're forcing me.

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,280
I said this six months ago,
I said it two months ago,

277
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
and I'm telling you now.

278
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,040
What's in it for these people?

279
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,840
Will you give them a place to sleep?
A piece of land?

280
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,160
Do you have any idea
what will happen to them?

281
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,440
No, sir. I can't.
No, it can't be done.

282
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,000
Then go and talk to the people
you bought it from.

283
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,120
You don't care what
will happen to these people?

284
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,040
All you think of
is your end of the deal.

285
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,960
I won't do this.

286
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,680
I won't evacuate this ship.

287
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,720
And you can't do anything about it.
Do whatever you want.

288
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Akbar!

289
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Where are you?

290
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Get over here.

291
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,720
How's it going?

292
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,600
We're having a problem.
The steel's too thick.

293
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,480
Hurry up.
You're wasting time.

294
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,000
Move the ones you've
already taken apart on deck.

295
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,680
Here, this is for the guys.
It's for this week.

296
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,040
I've deducted what they owed.

297
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,200
Sign here.

298
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,080
Hurry up. There's no time.
Hurry. Let's go.

299
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,720
Move it. Hurry!

300
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Akbar!

301
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,000
Uncle Sadegh, what do you see
in the sun? I can't see a thing.

302
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,240
I've been looking for years in vain.

303
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,240
And you want to see
something in five minutes!

304
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,760
Don't move away
from the lift, understood?

305
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,960
From sunrise to sunset.

306
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,920
Men use the ladder.
Women and children use the lift.

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,480
Got it?

308
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Good.

309
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,360
Have you told them
to shut off the generator?

310
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,120
Yes, Captain. I have.

311
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,560
Lower the lift. Go ahead.

312
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,440
At 9:30 p.m.,

313
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,240
the generator will be shut off.

314
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Get your IDs ready.
IDs. Get them ready.

315
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,720
Hurry, get your IDs ready.

316
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,400
- What for?
- The Captain needs them.

317
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,920
- What for?
- To get green cards.

318
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,160
We already have ours.

319
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,320
The Captain knows people.
He can get as many as he wants.

320
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,680
He'll sell them and deduct it
from your rent, okay?

321
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,560
- Maybe he should get it himself.
- Okay, wait.

322
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,520
IDs. Get them ready.

323
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,720
Get your IDs ready.

324
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:16,435
It'll get there.
Just wait a bit.

325
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:18,175
Okay, okay.

326
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:21,015
It'll be there in one or two days.

327
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:23,535
All right, okay.

328
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:27,735
It was the asphalt makers.
Hurry up.

329
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:30,135
Yes, Captain.
I'll tell Akbar.

330
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:31,615
- Counted them?
- Yes.

331
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:34,735
I got the new neighbors' IDs, too.

332
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,575
Go and hide yourself somewhere.

333
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,535
If he finds you, he'll kill you.

334
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:02,615
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

335
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,775
Welcome back.
How was the sea?

336
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:07,775
I had a phone call.
Was there a problem here?

337
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,895
They probably just wanted to say hi.

338
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:11,895
Hi. How are you?

339
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,975
Bye, Captain.

340
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,615
How are you, Baby Fish?

341
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,455
There are no fish here.

342
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:46,735
From the sea. They come in
through that hole in the corner

343
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:50,575
and they can't get back...

344
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,775
to the sea.

345
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:55,855
Ah, it got away.

346
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,335
Give me your net, I'll help you.

347
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:12,295
Here you go.

348
00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:30,895
Father,

349
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:33,015
please forgive me!

350
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:46,575
Let her go!

351
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:22,495
My honor's at stake. Go inside.

352
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:25,775
I didn't raise my daughter
to dishonor me.

353
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,215
Let her go.
Have mercy on her.

354
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,895
Leave me alone.
What is it to you?

355
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:34,455
She's my daughter!

356
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:37,455
I'll kill her if I want to!

357
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:42,295
You bastard!

358
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,895
Come out, you filthy bastard!

359
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:48,015
I'll find you!

360
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:53,055
We listen to everything you say.
You know that, Captain.

361
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:56,415
I come here once
every two weeks.

362
00:26:57,295 --> 00:27:01,495
I'm at sea all the time,
working like a slave.

363
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:09,735
Take these away.

364
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:16,415
I told you not to leave her like this.

365
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:19,455
Marry her off.

366
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:26,255
The guy I'm telling you about

367
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,775
is a decent man.

368
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:31,775
It's true that she'll be away,

369
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:34,575
but at least you'll know she's safe.

370
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,175
She's taken care of.

371
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:40,455
This guy has money.
He's dependable.

372
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:44,975
I'll get you something too.

373
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,335
Whatever you say.

374
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:54,775
I say, let her go.

375
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:58,615
This guy's a good man.
What do you say?

376
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:03,455
- Do you agree?
- Whatever's the will of God.

377
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,535
Shall I proceed?

378
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:09,535
You know best. I trust you.

379
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:14,055
But I'm leaving on a raft tomorrow.
I have to go to sea.

380
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:17,615
I want no embarrassment later on.
I want to be proud.

381
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,975
I guarantee that you'll be proud.

382
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:23,415
And your daughter
will be settled down.

383
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:33,375
You can relax.
Don't worry a bit.

384
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:37,095
When you get back,
there's one less mouth to feed

385
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:40,255
and God willing,
you'll even gain something.

386
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:41,895
Meraj!

387
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:44,695
Go and rest assured.

388
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,335
Hey, Meraj!

389
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:48,735
Come and lower the lift.

390
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,455
It's 9:30 p.m.

391
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:55,655
The generator will be shut off.

392
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:13,175
Should I hand you over to her father?

393
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:18,975
Should I?

394
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:23,735
Or maybe I should beat
the hell out of you myself!

395
00:32:38,735 --> 00:32:41,535
This is the end, Ahmad.

396
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,775
Yesterday when he left,

397
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:49,975
he asked me to look after her
in his absence.

398
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:52,135
I swear to God,

399
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:54,895
if you mess things up one more time

400
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,655
or set your foot
where it shouldn't go,

401
00:32:57,855 --> 00:33:02,695
I'll kill you, and the seagulls
will fly over your grave.

402
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,615
Understood?

403
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,495
The key.

404
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:31,695
Now go downstairs.

405
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,975
Tell Akbar that
the Captain has sent you.

406
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:41,975
He knows what to do,

407
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:45,895
and you'll obey him.

408
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:48,815
Go!

409
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,815
You can't come aboard, sir.

410
00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:02,335
I'm responsible. I just can't.

411
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,135
Go call the Captain.

412
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,495
He's not here.

413
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:08,695
Look, we have an official notice.

414
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:11,415
You shouldn't resist.

415
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,655
I don't know.
Come back tomorrow

416
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,575
When the Captain is here.

417
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:18,015
Let us come up.

418
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:20,255
We'll do our job and then leave.

419
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:22,575
And what is your job?

420
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:25,215
- Are you Captain Nemat?
- Yes, I am.

421
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,575
- Hello.
- Hello there.

422
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:31,655
We have an official
evacuation notice for the ship.

423
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,775
Evacuation?

424
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,815
You think you can just throw us out?

425
00:34:36,895 --> 00:34:39,975
Where do you think you're going?

426
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:43,615
I'll explain to you
when I get up there.

427
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:46,735
Wait. I won't allow this.

428
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:50,095
Hey, people!

429
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:54,975
They Want to throw you
out of your home!

430
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:57,935
Come and defend yourselves!

431
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:04,055
The sea

432
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:05,695
is beautiful

433
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:08,375
and spectacular.

434
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:10,215
The ship

435
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:12,975
is in the sea.

436
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:19,815
The ship...

437
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:22,135
sinks more...

438
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,575
in the sea every day.

439
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,655
Life...

440
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,975
in the ship...

441
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,095
is beautiful.

442
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,815
- Did you write it down?
- Yes.

443
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,215
I've already told you.

444
00:36:49,295 --> 00:36:51,695
No, it can't be done.

445
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,455
What?

446
00:36:53,535 --> 00:36:56,455
You're going to use force?

447
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,775
Go ahead. Do it.

448
00:36:58,855 --> 00:37:00,855
Listen, listen.

449
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:02,975
You can bring a tank.

450
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:06,175
You can use a rocket if you want.

451
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:08,415
Look, these people need homes.

452
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:10,975
They want a life.

453
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:14,775
Their children were born here,
they grew up here.

454
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:19,815
You expect them to leave just
like that? No rights, no nothing.

455
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,775
That's fine. You're welcome.

456
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:30,295
We have nothing to talk about.

457
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:34,855
Listen, they can call a meeting
when they have something to discuss.

458
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:37,455
We have nothing to discuss.

459
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:43,615
Okay, I'll come.
We can have a cup of tea.

460
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:47,575
But tea won't resolve our problem.

461
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:52,295
Okay, okay. I'll come.
I'll definitely come.

462
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,495
Good-bye.

463
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,615
Get closer to the lift.

464
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:20,575
I'm watering my flower,
my dear flower.

465
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:22,895
I'll teach it patience.

466
00:39:22,975 --> 00:39:25,175
No one has watered it.

467
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,855
That's why it's gone dry.

468
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:29,175
Hi, Uncle Jalal.

469
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:30,975
Hi, Baby Fish.

470
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:32,375
- How are you?
- Fine.

471
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:36,935
- How many fish have you got?
- I don't know. Probably 10 or 20.

472
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:52,397
Your goat given birth yet?

473
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,637
No, she hasn't. One of these days.

474
00:39:58,197 --> 00:39:59,557
Hi, Uncle Sadegh.

475
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,117
Hi, Baby Fish.

476
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:02,877
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

477
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:06,797
- Seen what you wanted to see?
- I haven't found anything yet.

478
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:09,717
God willing, I'll soon find it.

479
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:42,117
What's up, Akbar?

480
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:44,837
Stop, stop!

481
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,277
The damn thing
has broken the drill.

482
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:49,157
But I think it'll work.

483
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:51,517
I hope it's the right place.

484
00:40:51,597 --> 00:40:52,837
Go, pour some water.

485
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,917
More.

486
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:44,637
Akbar!

487
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:48,117
- What happened?
- It's done, Captain.

488
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:52,517
Hassan, switch on the pump.

489
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:54,437
Switch it on!

490
00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:56,637
Switch the pump on.

491
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,110
It's working, Akbar. It's working.

492
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,710
Move it. Let's get the barrels.

493
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,990
"The aggressive nature
of the enemy and our duties.

494
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,990
Our world is a world of phenomena
and in facing any phenomena,

495
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,830
we have to get to know it first.

496
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,790
Meaning we have to know

497
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,990
the key elements
of its nature and its goals."

498
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,510
That's good.
Give it to the next person.

499
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,670
"We then have to discover

500
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,710
ways of resisting it,
based on a precise methed..."

501
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,830
Not "methed" - "method".
Give it to the next person. Next.

502
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,430
"Floods are one of
the destructive phenomena

503
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,510
which have to be handled."

504
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,110
All rise.

505
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,870
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,310
Sorry, teacher, we have to
end the class. Kids, follow me.

507
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,870
They have a class, lessons to learn.

508
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,990
Where are they going?

509
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,470
This is a class.

510
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,190
Fill the barrels half way.
Half way!

511
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,710
No more, no less.

512
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,870
That's enough. That's half.

513
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,390
Pull it up!

514
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,910
Everyone ready.

515
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,030
Parviz.

516
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:36,950
Hurry up, kids. Quick.
Let's go.

517
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:32,229
Do something!
I can't deliver the baby!

518
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:35,709
We have to take her to a hospital!

519
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:44,909
Ali Mansour,
turn on the generator!

520
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:51,109
Wait, her husband's not here.
Put the burka on her face.

521
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:14,189
God, please help me.

522
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:28,789
God, do you hear my cry?

523
00:54:42,709 --> 00:54:44,829
What is this?

524
00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:48,829
What are you doing?

525
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:53,029
You worthless losers!

526
00:54:55,149 --> 00:54:57,469
You have no shame?

527
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:19,909
The ship is in the sea.

528
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,069
The sea is vast.

529
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:26,669
The sea is beautiful

530
00:55:26,749 --> 00:55:29,109
and spectacular.

531
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:31,509
Did you write it down?

532
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:58,695
- Hi.
- Hello.

533
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,415
I want to see Mr. Razequinia.

534
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:02,895
Which one?

535
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:06,695
I don't know. The one who's
in the ship scrapping business.

536
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:09,575
They're all in that business.

537
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:13,295
You probably need to see someone
in charge of acquisitions.

538
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,935
Go and make a U-turn,

539
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:19,855
take the coastal road
and after 20 kilometers, make a right.

540
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:23,055
There you can ask anyone
for the breaker's yard.

541
00:56:23,135 --> 00:56:24,375
You can find him there.

542
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:26,815
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

543
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:04,215
I'm looking for Mr. Razequinia.

544
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,295
Over there.

545
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:26,495
Be careful, careful.
Go ahead, move.

546
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:34,815
When you're done here,
go and cut up that pipe too.

547
00:57:52,295 --> 00:57:53,815
Hey Parviz.
Hey, Moslem.

548
00:57:53,895 --> 00:57:57,095
Be careful with the steel parts.
Don't play around.

549
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:04,175
How many times must I tell you
not to drop them in the water?

550
00:58:29,695 --> 00:58:31,495
- Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:35,135
- Is Captain Nemat here?
- No. Can I help you?

552
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:37,135
I've got some stuff for him.

553
00:58:37,215 --> 00:58:39,535
Right. He told me something about it.

554
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:40,775
Wait here.

555
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:42,415
No problem.

556
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:46,535
Ali, Ahmad, take the stuff
from the pickup truck and put it

557
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:48,615
in the boat.

558
00:59:21,655 --> 00:59:24,095
What's all this stuff for?

559
00:59:24,175 --> 00:59:25,535
A wedding.

560
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:29,495
But this is a classroom,
the students will be here.

561
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:33,295
There's no room for them.

562
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:37,055
Where should I put 'em?
I can't put 'em in the cabins.

563
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:51,895
Meraj, lower the lift.

564
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,575
Hi, Captain.

565
01:04:08,655 --> 01:04:10,655
Hi there.

566
01:04:33,775 --> 01:04:35,335
Anything else, Captain?

567
01:04:35,735 --> 01:04:38,375
Thanks.
I hope I can return your kindness.

568
01:04:38,455 --> 01:04:40,455
Good-bye, Captain.

569
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:44,095
Let me know
if you need anything.

570
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:07,775
Is this what I get
for all my kindness?

571
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:11,975
You steal my boat.

572
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:15,335
Where in the sea did you want to go?

573
01:05:24,895 --> 01:05:27,175
Say you've fucked up.

574
01:08:37,695 --> 01:08:40,295
Forgive him. He's young.
Let him go.

575
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:49,055
If I let him go,
there'll be chaos on this ship.

576
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,055
I fucked up!

577
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:24,615
I'm sorry, Captain!
For God's sake!

578
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:27,935
I fucked up!

579
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:33,415
Please, Captain!

580
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:55,895
I'm sorry.

581
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:02,495
We'll give the ship

582
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,055
so we can get ourselves some land.

583
01:10:06,895 --> 01:10:09,255
We want to live on dry land.

584
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,575
As the teacher says,

585
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:14,935
this ship's sinking every day.

586
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:18,535
We have to leave as
quickly as possible.

587
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:21,095
I Want you to help each other

588
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:24,735
so We can build a town on dry land.

589
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:27,175
A town...

590
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:29,615
With a house

591
01:10:29,695 --> 01:10:32,375
for each one of you.

592
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,375
We Won't let go of each other.

593
01:10:34,455 --> 01:10:36,615
We're used to one another.

594
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:39,175
You all have to give me

595
01:10:39,255 --> 01:10:41,735
power of attorney,

596
01:10:41,815 --> 01:10:44,655
so I can take care of the land.

597
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:49,415
There are still some problems,
but they can be solved.

598
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,495
They just need following up.

599
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:54,535
As long as I'm With you,
you needn't Worry.

600
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:56,975
- What's your name?
- Bahram.

601
01:10:57,055 --> 01:10:59,055
You can go.

602
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,415
Attention, residents!

603
01:11:07,575 --> 01:11:11,815
If you haven't signed the power
of attorney papers, please do so.

604
01:11:11,895 --> 01:11:16,535
Dear residents, please sign
your power of attorney papers.

605
01:11:21,015 --> 01:11:23,015
Next.

606
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:27,655
Ameneh.

607
01:11:27,735 --> 01:11:29,095
Good job, Ameneh.

608
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:30,375
Can I read it?

609
01:11:30,455 --> 01:11:33,375
Just sign here, Abdolkarim.

610
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:37,375
You can read it later
when we have our land.

611
01:11:37,855 --> 01:11:40,575
Can I sign in my husband's name?

612
01:11:40,655 --> 01:11:44,295
Your husband? Sure, go ahead.

613
01:11:44,495 --> 01:11:46,335
What's his name?

614
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,135
Abbas.

615
01:11:48,255 --> 01:11:51,815
I'm going to get it
notarized immediately.

616
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,575
Yes, sir.

617
01:11:53,695 --> 01:11:57,775
They can come
tomorrow morning at 10:00

618
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:00,655
to collect it completely.

619
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:02,175
Yes.

620
01:12:02,255 --> 01:12:05,615
Everybody has agreed.
All of them, yes.

621
01:12:06,775 --> 01:12:09,095
Uncle Sadegh, come down.

622
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:12,855
I won't! What do you want?

623
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:15,815
You're wasting our time.
Come down!

624
01:12:15,895 --> 01:12:17,375
I won't come down.

625
01:12:17,455 --> 01:12:20,255
You can leave if you want.

626
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:22,695
We're all going on a pilgrimage

627
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:26,055
to Shah-e-Shahid.
There's a sun over there too.

628
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:28,455
Women and children, use the lift.

629
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:31,175
Men, use the ladder.

630
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:38,895
Amoo Jalal, where are you
taking that goat? Take it back.

631
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:54,135
The boats that are full can leave.

632
01:14:38,455 --> 01:14:41,015
What are you doing here, kid?

633
01:14:41,095 --> 01:14:45,015
Come on up.
Why didn't you leave with the rest?

634
01:14:45,095 --> 01:14:48,095
- I was fishing.
- Fishing?

635
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,255
What are these?

636
01:14:52,975 --> 01:14:54,655
Why did you do that?

637
01:14:54,735 --> 01:14:57,175
Poor fish.

638
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:02,935
Let them grow bigger, and then
we'll catch them and eat them.

639
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:15,735
Attend the pilgrimage.
Gather for the pilgrimage.

640
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:21,975
Pray for the lands.

641
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:25,535
Attend the pilgrimage.
Please go ahead.

642
01:15:32,175 --> 01:15:35,415
Welcome.
Isn't Mr. Hachemnia coming?

643
01:15:35,495 --> 01:15:38,015
No. We're here to collect the ship.

644
01:15:38,095 --> 01:15:40,775
What about the check and the rest?

645
01:15:40,855 --> 01:15:44,055
We have it. We'll inspect the ship.

646
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:48,095
After drafting an inventory,
we'll be at your service.

647
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,175
Are there any people here?

648
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:53,335
No, they're all gone, evacuated.

649
01:16:50,415 --> 01:16:54,015
Here are the official
power of attorney papers.

650
01:16:56,175 --> 01:16:58,495
It's all in order.
Give him the check.

651
01:16:58,575 --> 01:17:01,415
- There you go.
- Good-bye.

652
01:17:01,495 --> 01:17:03,495
Take care.

653
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:09,495
Come here, kid. Come.

654
01:17:12,135 --> 01:17:13,575
I hope

655
01:17:13,655 --> 01:17:15,615
all your prayers are heard.

656
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:17,695
Keep the faith.

657
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:22,215
Come on, let's go see the lands.

658
01:17:41,772 --> 01:17:43,772
Hurry up, kid.

659
01:17:48,442 --> 01:17:51,362
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

660
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:09,788
Go on, kid. Hurry, we're late.

661
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:12,868
Hey, wait!

662
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:15,868
Where are you going,
you little rascal?

663
01:18:24,148 --> 01:18:26,348
Let's go, we have no time.

664
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,388
Take her to the shrine.

665
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,308
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi there.

666
01:19:51,254 --> 01:19:53,254
Hi there.

667
01:19:54,494 --> 01:20:00,094
I'm so very sorry to keep
you all waiting for so long.

668
01:20:02,614 --> 01:20:04,254
Listen, listen.

669
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:07,054
I took the money for you.

670
01:20:07,134 --> 01:20:10,774
Thank God,
all the problems are solved.

671
01:20:11,054 --> 01:20:14,894
This land that you're standing on

672
01:20:14,974 --> 01:20:17,854
will be yours one day.

673
01:20:17,934 --> 01:20:19,934
It'll belong to all of you.

674
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:23,734
We'll build a town here.

675
01:20:24,054 --> 01:20:26,014
You know what kind of town?

676
01:20:26,094 --> 01:20:29,934
Come along.
Come and I'll show you.

677
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:32,014
Come, come.

678
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:37,414
Hi, Uncle Sadegh.

679
01:20:37,494 --> 01:20:39,494
How are you?

680
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:43,014
We'll build a park here,

681
01:20:43,094 --> 01:20:45,534
a big park

682
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:48,574
for the kids to play in.

683
01:20:50,174 --> 01:20:52,774
We'll build a school here,

684
01:20:53,294 --> 01:20:56,254
a school for our dear teacher

685
01:20:56,334 --> 01:20:59,334
to teach our children.

686
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:34,694
I'll wait until you're done
with your pilgrimage.
