00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,536
You're on time for work!

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,902
What's wrong?

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,681
What are you talking about?
I'm always on time for work.

18
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,313
I couldn't say that with a
straight face. (Laughs) Sit.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,895
Ohhh. So, late last night
I came to check on Josh.

20
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,867
I sat there as that boy
poured his heart out.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,312
Until I finally convinced him to go over
to Gabi's and to tell her how he felt.

22
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,046
Go big or go home!

23
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:03,116
That's what I said.

24
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:06,345
So what happened?

25
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:09,716
That's what I'm going to find out. She
could be up there with him right now.

27
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,769

00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:33,304
(Giggles)

29
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:37,251
Oh, I knew it! I said go for
it. Now all is well with...

30
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,309
Hey, good morning, everybody.

31
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:39,244
What the...

32
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:42,323
How'd you do that?

33
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,572
My hair?

34
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:45,620
What do you think? It's
an updo for the "I do."

35
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:48,890
Well, now it's an "I
don't." The wedding's off.

36
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,658
What? What do you mean "the wedding's off"?

37
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:52,026
You didn't know?

38
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,569
Uh, Josh didn't "talk" to you last night?

39
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,326
No, no! I had no idea! What happened?

40
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,285
He found out that blanket
was from you, not Caroline.

41
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:00,285
I don't know how.

42
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,004
What?

43
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,810
No! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

44
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,535
He was not supposed to find that out.

45
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,460
I mean, I mean, for a minute
I wanted him to find out,

46
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,891
but then I realized I shouldn't tell him

47
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:14,753
and I couldn't tell him and
I was finally okay with that.

48
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,065
You know, everything was
good. And everybody was happy.

49
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,946
Oh, God! Josh, he must be beside himself.

50
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,987
He's beside something, all right.

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,912
He must hate me. God, I have to
tell him why I did what I did.

52
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,447
Gabi, wait!

53
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,578
Josh.

54
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:43,257
God, what is it with that guy?

55
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,026
Every time he breaks up with Caroline,
he ends up in bed with a blonde.

00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,454
and then has sex with

I mean, not that I care.

what am I doing here? What is happening?

(Laughs) You know?

What is happening?

72
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:28,035
I'll tell you what's happening.

73
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,285
I was canceling the flowers

74
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:34,041
from Andre, the super hot florist
with the jawline of a Greek statue.

75
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:37,144
And he asked me out for drinks.

76
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:42,108
Look at me rising from the
ashes of this wedding disaster,

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,708
like a flaming phoenix.

78
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:48,836
Which is coincidentally the name of
the bar we're having drinks at tonight.

79
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,573
Morning.

80
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,531
Oh my God. Josh, I'm so sorry

81
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:56,824
about all this. I just need you to know

82
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,478
the only reason I didn't
tell you about the blanket...

83
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,413
No, Gabi, please. Stop.

84
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,414
You did me a favor.

85
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:02,748
Without you, I never
would have realized that

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,753
Caroline wasn't the right girl
for me. But enough about me.

87
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:05,889
What did you gals get into last night?

88
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,283
Yolanda? Nothing. Gabi?

89
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:11,814
Did you do anything, ah...

90
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,719
Crazy last night?

91
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,980
Uh... nope.

92
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,397
Totally uneventful.

93
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,431
Really?

94
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:19,499
'Cause, I mean...

95
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,435
Totally uneventful would
mean that nothing happened.

96
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:25,305
Something must have happened.
You're an exciting young person.

97
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:27,440
Fine. Um...

98
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,477
Cooper flew in from China and
surprised me in the middle of the night.

99
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:33,060
Both: Cooper?

100
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,341
What?

101
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:40,353
Cooper from China? With
the glasses? Last night?

102
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:42,388
Do you believe this, Yolanda? Neither do I.

103
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,834
So...

104
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:47,026
(Stutters) Are you guys in
love? Do you love him? Yes?

105
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,601
No? I mean, should I be happy for you? I
need to know if I should be happy for you.

106
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:52,852
You now what, I think it's
important to know who to be happy for

107
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,520
and who's just gonna be alone.

108
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:58,403
Why did Cooper fly in last night?

109
00:04:58,404 --> 00:04:59,337
Why? Why?

110
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,649
Uh... well he bought me a
present and he couldn't wait

111
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,783
to see my face when I opened it.

112
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:06,785
Oh ma God!

113
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,457
Are you hearing this, Yolanda?

114
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:12,526
Chills. I have chills.

115
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,540
This is just the most
romantic thing I've ever heard.

116
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,231
Yeah.

117
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:18,923
The only thing that would
have been more romantic

118
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:21,491
is if he climbed up my fire escape
with roses in the pouring rain.

119
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,554
(Laughs)

120
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,438
Yeah.

121
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:26,472
Who does that?

122
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,744
Well,

123
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:32,794
sounds like we both had, ah,
wildly romantic nights last night.

124
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,274
Now I know this is gonna sound
crazy, but you know that feeling you

125
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,587
get when you meet someone and
you have that instant connection?

126
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:38,899
I had that with Laura.

127
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,367
It's Lauren.

128
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:41,268
I know that.

129
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,071
I call her Laura for short.

130
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,206
Yeah.

131
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,540
I believe this one's
definitely gonna go somewhere.

132
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,207
- Is she staying for breakfast?
- Nope.

133
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,546
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

134
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:01,648
Is Cooper here?

135
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:02,549
Nope.

136
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,252
Josh called off his wedding.

137
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,253
What?

138
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:07,749
Yeah.

139
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,351
He found out the blanket was from me.

140
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,499
Uh, how?

141
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,546
Who cares? Do you know what this means?

142
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,488
When Josh found out that I was the one

143
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,551
that spent all those weeks recreating
his special childhood blanket,

144
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,467
he realized I was the
one that knows his heart,

145
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,573
which means I'm the reason he called
off the wedding! Now what am I gonna do?

146
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,302
Hm, what do you mean what are you gonna do?

147
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,222
Sofia, last night I was freaking out

148
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:29,840
that Josh was getting married
because I had feelings for him.

149
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,453
Yeah, and then Cooper came in
and swept you off your feet,

150
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:34,344
and now you're back together with Cooper.

151
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,921
(Sighs) I know, I know.

152
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:38,082
But then Josh, he called off
his wedding because of me!

153
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:39,772
Which means he has feelings for me!

154
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:40,984
For me!

155
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,906
Oh, no, no, no. No, no,
no, no. No, it doesn't.

156
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:49,218
Oh, really? Then explain to me why
last night he had sex with a girl

157
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,748
who looks exactly like me.

158
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:54,280
Do you hear yourself?

159
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,111
I do.

160
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:02,401
What is happening? You
know? What is happening?

161
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,302
Okay.

162
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:04,931
Okay.

163
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:07,564
Look, I know you're confused.
You had feelings for Josh.

164
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:09,822
And if Josh had come here
last night declaring his love

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,382
for you, it would be a different story.

166
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:12,213
But he didn't.

167
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,428
- Yeah.
- Who did?

168
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:16,669
Cooper. Yeah, I know. I
know, you're so right, Sofia.

169
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,510
You're so smart.

170
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,065
Well, we are who we are.

171
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:19,932
(Sighs)

172
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,569
I just wish I had a sign.

173
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,007
- (Knocking)
- (Gasps)

174
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,438
I'm done. Nice tux.

175
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:31,653
Thank you.

176
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,008
Never been to a black tie wedding before.

177
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,209
Finley.

178
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,112
Cooper Finley.

179
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:40,714
- I have a huge surprise for you.
- Sit down.

180
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:42,738
So you know how I'm supposed
to go back to China tonight?

181
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,706
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I traded in my first class ticket

182
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,644
for two coach tickets.

183
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,745
Two what-what?

184
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,357
I know, first class for a
programmer. Pretty sweet, right?

185
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:55,461
Anyway, I figured while Josh
was away on his honeymoon,

186
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,806
you could spend three
weeks with me in China!

187
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,964
It's such an amazing place.

188
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,833
Everything in this apartment is from there.

189
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,335
Mmm, I don't know.

190
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:12,935
I mean, what if she gets lost...

191
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,429
do they have any signs there?

192
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,854
Cooper... Wow! I mean,

193
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:21,185
that's the sweetest thing I've
ever heard, but I-I-I can't go.

194
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:22,439
Josh called off his wedding.

195
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,335
What? Why?

196
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,958
- Oh, don't ask.
- It's complicated.

197
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,373
Um... so, you know, I can't
really ask for three weeks off.

198
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:33,210
But since Josh was gonna give you the
time off anyway, maybe he'll let you go.

199
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:36,079
Plus it's not like you're the
reason he called off the wedding.

200
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,038
Oh. Uh-huh.

201
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,753
Yeah, that's a really good point.

202
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,822
Great.

203
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,487
Now, if I leave before I wrinkle
maybe I can get a refund on this tux.

204
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,359
Okay.

205
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:48,924
Gabi, please ask Josh. It will
be the best time you've ever had.

206
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,738
That we've ever had.

207
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,347
Bye.

208
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:00,637
Well...

209
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,305
Cooper gave me my sign.

210
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Well, thank God.

211
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:05,609
Yeah, now all I need is a sign from Josh.

212
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:08,311
What?

213
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,883
I'm gonna ask Josh if I
can go to China with Cooper,

214
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,046
and if he lets me, it means he
doesn't have feelings for me.

215
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,358
But if he says no, it means
he does have feelings for me.

216
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,295
Okay, and then what? What
if Josh has feelings for you?

217
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,477
And then I w... I don't know.

218
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:29,721
Oh, hey, baby. How are you feeling?

219
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,022
How am I feeling?

220
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:32,968
I want to go on a bike ride
and I can't find my other glove.

221
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:36,504
Okay, well let me help you.
When's the last time you saw it?

222
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:37,505
This is all your fault.

223
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,911
I didn't lose your damn glove.

224
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:44,107
Your fault that I went
over to Gabi's like a fool.

225
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:46,741
"Go big or go home," you said.
That doesn't make sense! I was home!

226
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:52,614
May I remind you that I told
you to go tell Gabi how you feel.

227
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,162
Not to creep outside around
her apartment and then run away.

228
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:57,986
I did not run away.

229
00:09:58,526 --> 00:09:59,526
I snuck away.

230
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:02,940
What was I supposed to do?
She was making out with Cooper.

231
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,634
(Scoffs) Trust me, that
didn't mean anything.

232
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:08,070
That girl has feelings for you.

233
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,757
Hey, guys. Um...

234
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,170
Josh, can I talk to you for a minute?

235
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,705
Alone.

236
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,893
So, what's up?

237
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:23,953
I wanted to ask you something.

238
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,302
But first, how are you doing?

239
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:28,004
Good!

240
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:28,905
Good.

241
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,065
How are you?

242
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:33,409
Good!

243
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:34,344
Good.

244
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,213
I'm gonna go.

245
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,342
Wait, Gabi. Um...

246
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,418
I needed to talk to you
about something, too.

247
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,308
You did?

248
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:46,805
Yeah.

249
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:50,955
I-I want you to know that girl
from last night was just a...

250
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,988
oh, rebound. Yeah, I know.

251
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,775
You know, I mean, today was
supposed to be your wedding day.

252
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:56,675
But it's not.

253
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,279
Because I called it off.

254
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:00,170
Right.

255
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,072
Which is, um...

256
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,282
It's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

257
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:07,644
- Should we sit?
- I can sit.

258
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,579
- Let's sit.
- I need to sit.

259
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,972
Josh, um...

260
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,403
I wanted to ask you something, but...

261
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,433
First I want you to know no matter
what you say, I'm totally gonna be fine.

262
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,565
So no pressure. You know.

263
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,280
- Just say...
- I'm good. Don't stop, you're doing great.

264
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,182
Okay. Um...

265
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:31,751
I was wondering...

266
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:33,887
Um...

267
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,546
Now that you called off the wedding...

268
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:36,476
Yeah?

269
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,945
How you feel about me...

270
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,419
How I feel about you?

271
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:42,820
Taking three weeks off and
going to China with Cooper?

272
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,531
Gabi, I feel the same way.

273
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:45,633
- What?
- Hmm?

274
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,182
About... China (Scoffs)

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,562
As Cooper does.

276
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:54,068
I love China.

277
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,895
(Chuckles)

278
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:57,475
I mean, yeah, you...
don't miss the-that wall.

279
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,277
It's, uh... it's great.

280
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:06,759
Oh, okay. Well I just thought maybe
since you're not going on your honeymoon,

281
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,330
that maybe you wanted
me to stay here with you

282
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:13,170
and not go away with Cooper.

283
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,071
No! No, no, no.

284
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,906
Go to China. You should go.

285
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,575
Go with Cooper.

286
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,410
Go! And you know what?

287
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,823
China gets cold, so why
don't you take that with ya.

288
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:29,541
Thanks.

289
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,939
Well, I got my sign.

290
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,581
Uh, final sign? Or you-still-
need-three-more-signs sign.

291
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,681
I asked Josh if I could
go to China with Cooper,

292
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:54,578
and he said it was fine, which means
that he doesn't have feelings for me.

293
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:56,008
Which is actually kind of a relief.

294
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,798
You know, it means I'm
meant to be with Cooper.

295
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,840
Well, are you okay with that?

296
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,284
So...

297
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:03,815
Are you going to China?

298
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:08,693
Does that answer your question?

299
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,616
Not sure. Tell me one more time.

300
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:12,550
Okay.

301
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,713
- Hey, baby...
- Not now, Yolanda.

302
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,759
I'm writing code.

303
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,985
You know, keeping the money flowing so I
can continue to pay you to give me advice.

304
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,085
Look, Josh, I know that...

305
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,173
remember when you told
me "go big or go home"?

306
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:31,883
Well, now I'm telling you,

307
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,208
"go home."

308
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:36,612
Okay.

309
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:43,863
- (Sighs)
- (Door closes)

310
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:46,785
So...

311
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,697
Will I make Andre happy?

312
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,943
Very!

313
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:54,185
'Cause you're not going.

314
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,195
You're staying with Josh tonight.

315
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:57,456
No, I'm not.

316
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,984
I'm meeting Andre.

317
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,871
Not tonight.

318
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,039
Yes, tonight.

319
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,541
Andre is riding the "E" train.

320
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:05,475
That's me.

321
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:08,628
You stay with Josh.

322
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,058
I would, but he doesn't want me to.

323
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,049
Josh needs you.

324
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,156
Ugh...

325
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:16,693
Everybody wants a piece of me.

326
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,330
Hey, buddy.

327
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,652
How's it going?

328
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,019
You don't need me here tonight, right?

329
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,621
My life sucks.

330
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,093
Oh...

331
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,844
Oh, I know!

332
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,435
Maybe you need to get out.

333
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:41,741
You know, go to a bar.

334
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:43,020
Get your drink on.

335
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:43,955
Take your mind off things.

336
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,623
No way.

337
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:48,634
The last thing I want to do is
be anywhere where there's women.

338
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,852
You stay right here.

339
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,205
And let all the nice boys buy you drinks.

340
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:59,903
Oh, there's my date.

341
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,638
Andre!

342
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,127
Hey, handsome!

343
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,178
Elliot told me everything.

344
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:11,599
I'm a florist, that practically makes
me a licensed psychologist. Spill.

345
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,041
I'm good.

346
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,610
Yeah, he's good.

347
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:15,544
You sure?

348
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,445
He's sure.

349
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,595
It all started when Gabi
began working for me.

350
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:26,178
So...

351
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,145
How are you feeling?

352
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,915
Amazing. Like everything's
the way it's supposed to be.

353
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,717
Uber is here.

354
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:32,684
You got everything?

355
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,583
I got everything I need right here.

356
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:36,354
Aw... Can you have it out there?

357
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,092
Okay, bye.

358
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,689
- See you later!
- Bye, have so much fun!

359
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,590
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:05,068

368
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:06,630
I really appreciate you
getting me through this.

369

370
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:09,218
Okay. All right, bye.

00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,637

Gabi! Gabi!

378
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:25,115
Your passport.

379
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,484
Gabi: Yeah, it's right here in my hand.

Oh, Cooper!

384
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:33,918
You forgot your glove.

385
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,559
Cooper: I wear mittens!

386
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,872
Oh!

387
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,906

390
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:49,769
Josh, something weird, Kaminski.

391
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,440
Oh my God!

392
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,270
So I'm running, right?

393
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,511
I get all the way up the fire
escape in the pouring rain

394
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:02,866
with roses.

395
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,163
Oh my God, just like <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

396
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:07,847
More like pretty boring.

397
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:08,848
Shh!

398
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:10,080
And then I look inside,

399
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:12,902
- and I see...
- Josh.

400
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,366
Is that Gabi?

401
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,222
(Crowd gasps)

402
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,902
No, it's her roommate, Sofia.

403
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,704
Oh.

404
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:19,939
What are you doing here?

405
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,476
Well, you didn't answer your phone so I
called Elliot, he said that you were here,

406
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,793
and that your middle name is
Xander, with an "X," aka JXK.

407
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,237
My glove! Where'd you find this?

408
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,325
On our fire escape.

409
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:35,051
Nope, that's not my glove.
Definitely not my glove.

410
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,764
He's lying, it is his...

411
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:38,566
Big glove.

412
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,991
Big hands.

413
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:45,060
Anyway, he was there last night on
the fire escape in the rain with roses.

414
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,013
Did you just out me?

415
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,848
I'm sorry, but I'd like a happy ending.

416
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:48,915
Duly noted.

417
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,560
Okay, so you did come over last night?

418
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,121
(Stammers)

419
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:57,938
Technically, I wouldn't call standing
outside in the rain "coming over."

420
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,232
(Sighs)

421
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:02,091
I just needed to talk to Gabi.

422
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,055
Why?

423
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,691
Have you not seen <i>Pretty
Woman? </i> He loves her.

424
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,006
I don't know if it's love. I...

425
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:10,662
Well then what the hell is it?

426
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,430
She's getting on a plane
with Cooper right now

427
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,669
because I told her that if
you had feelings for her,

428
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,129
you would have come over last night.

429
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,333
And you did.

430
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,838
(Gasps)

431
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,151
Wait.

432
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,318
Are you saying that
Gabi has feelings for me?

433
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,962
Come on, Josh. You had no idea?

434
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:26,713
The pretty ones are never smart.

435
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,789
(Chuckles)

436
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:31,028
I don't believe... I've got to call her.

437
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,106
No!

438
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,908
Go to her!

439
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,844
Leave your tab open and go to her.

440
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:40,402
No, yeah, Josh. He's-he's right.
She has to know everything.

441
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:43,617
And if she still wants to go with
Cooper... fine, but... She needs to know.

442
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:46,921
Run! Run like the wind to that airport.

443
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:48,900
Get out of here now.

444
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:51,722
Good luck.

445
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:55,893
You too.

446
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,224
Josh: Excuse me.

447
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:05,027
Pardon me. I'm sorry, this
is a matter of life and death.

448
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,663
Yeah, he has to tell a
girl he might like her.

449
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,531
Hi.

450
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:15,204
Can you tell me if Gabi Diamond has
checked in to flight YL125 to Beijing?

451
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,814
I'm sorry sir, but I can't
give out that information.

452
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:18,915
All right, fine. I get that.

453
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:21,707
But have you seen <i>Pretty Woman?</i>

454
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,133
Gabi. China. Ticket. Buy a ticket!

455
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,968
I'm sorry, you're too late.
That flight's already boarding.

456
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,903
(Sighs) Okay. Well, now
you have to call her.

457
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,707
Gabi!

458
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,173
- Josh?
- Yeah?

459
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:38,116
- On the phone.
- Yes.

460
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,173
Pretty ones are never smart.

461
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:44,106
This is Jin Mao Tower.

462
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:44,813
Wow.

463
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,875
Oh, and remember the sneezing
panda from the Internet?

464
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:48,577
- Yeah.
- Here he is all grown up.

465
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:49,979
(Gasps) Oh, cute.

466
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:54,179
Attendant: <i>Final boarding call
for flight YL125 to Beijing.</i>

467
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:57,281
Oh, hey, we should put our
phones on airplane mode.

468
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:59,557
Oh, right. Yeah, we should do that.

469
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:01,885
How would one do that?

470
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,971
It's ringing.

471
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,677
I got her voicemail. What do I say?

472
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:14,029
Say everything.

473
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,446
Hey, Gabi.

474
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,081
Um...

475
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,050
I'm calling you from...

476
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:26,120
The airport, actually.

477
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,689
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm at the airport.

478
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,560
Good question.

479
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,692
You-You always ask good questions.

480
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:37,030

<i>You're the person that I wanted to see.</i>

483
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,385
I even ran up your fire escape with roses.

484
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:49,523
Um...

485
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:52,579
I didn't know what I was
going to say, but I knew that

486
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:55,563
I needed to see you, and
then I saw Cooper and you.

487
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,462
<i>And look, if you're happy with Cooper,</i>

488
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:01,031
<i>just disregard this whole message.</i>

489
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,117
<i>But...</i>

490
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,526
<i>I-If you think you might,</i>

491
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,514
<i>like, be happier with me...</i>

492
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,031
<i>Call me back.</i>

493
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:13,700
<i>This is Josh, by the way.</i>

494
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:20,517
I can't believe I'm in China.

495
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,629
If six-year-old Gabi digging a hole

496
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:24,635
could see me now...(Chuckles)

497
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:27,128
Oh, don't turn your phone on.

498
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,214
Why? How am I supposed
to check my messages?

499
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,602
Well, if you don't have
an international data plan,

500
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,239
it will cost you thousands of dollars.

501
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:33,842
Oh, I don't have those.

502
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,590
Who's gonna call me anyway?

503
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:42,365
You know, in China they always kiss twice.

504
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:43,308
Oh. Okay.

505
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:47,562
