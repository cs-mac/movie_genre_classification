1
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:30,390
You're the worst
doorman I ever saw in my life!

2
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:35,230
<i>I don't want you working here no more.
Take off your uniform.</i>

3
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,532
You don't even know
how to wear a uniform!

4
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,606
Someone told me the other night...

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,609
you killed his appetite
for my New York cream cheesecake.

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,410
Really first-class French restaurants
don't carry New York cream cheesecake.

7
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,110
<i>Change your clothes and get out.!</i>

8
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,710
- I'm gonna have to have my money.
- Money for what?

9
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,722
I don't pay for vacation.

10
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,521
You owe me money 'cause I worked last night
till 4:00 a.m., and I'm working tonight...

11
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,823
Get out of here! I call the cop.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,558
I call 9-1-1.
They come real fast for business!

13
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:11,035
- You can't not pay me. - Go back
where you belong, in Greenwich Village.

14
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,096
You don't have the class
to be an uptown doorman!

15
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,738
<i>And you write things
in that book of yours.</i>

16
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,339
What the hell are you writing
all the time?

17
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,837
- I hope you're not going to grouse at me.
- Joanna.

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,850
I love you.

19
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,786
I love you too.

20
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,292
- Why haven't you been answering the phone?
- Am I not answering the phone?

21
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,864
All right. I'm coming over.

22
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,072
Our creature of the night.

23
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,925
Why are you shaking?

24
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,996
- I'm what?
- Shaking. You're shaking.

25
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,794
- Why are you shaking?
- I'm not shaking.

26
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,630
You were shaking the phone
when you called me.

27
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,696
<i>Well, I got a lot to shake about.</i>

28
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,367
- You got my money?
- Your money?

29
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,004
- You owe me a lot of money! - Which you are
obviously still obsessing about.

30
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,082
<i>Well, how long
you owe me the money?</i>

31
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,276
I actually heard your teeth
scraping together on the phone.

32
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,184
You owed me that money since May 28.
You think that's right?

33
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,417
You owe someone like me that kind of money,
who hasn't got a dime?

34
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,757
Who's scrounging, even scraping
his teeth together on the phone...

35
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,858
...'cause you owe him that dough?

36
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,799
You think that's decent? You're a dog,
you owe someone like me that kind of money.

37
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,358
You owe someone like me that kind
of money when it's so cold out...

38
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,201
when I'm walking around freezing
'cause I got no money?

39
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,709
<i>- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, I don't want any coffee.!</i>

40
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,269
No! I want what's due me. I don't want
to walk around in a rag of a coat.

41
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,407
See? I want something
warm and decent.

42
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,545
<i>Harry, you are not shaking
because I owe you that money.</i>

43
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,056
- No? Why am I shaking?
- Because you are out of control.

44
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,287
I am not out of...
Don't. Jake, don't do that.

45
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,729
You change the subject, then attack,
then disembowel me psychologically.

46
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,165
I disembowel you psychologically?

47
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,831
- Don't do that, Jake.
- Harry, you're not upset about the money.

48
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,840
I am obviously very upset about it.

49
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,775
<i>You're always upset and enraged,
and you think that gives you the right...</i>

50
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,778
to be habitually hysterical.

51
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,543
- I think it's boring. - You think it's boring,
I scrape my teeth together on the phone?

52
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,848
Yes, I do, Harry. Almost everybody
has trouble with their teeth.

53
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,422
It's no accomplishment.

54
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,420
- Why is it so stifling in here?
- It is in no way stifling in here.

55
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,690
<i>It is. It's thick. It's dense in here.</i>

56
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,766
So open a window.

57
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,858
I gotta open a window.

58
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,496
All your equipment... you wouldn't
have it if it wasrt for my money.

59
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,905
<i>That's only 10 percent true.</i>

60
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,274
It's insanity, the way you
stuff yourself in here like this.

61
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,213
It's four stories down.
I hope you're not gonna jump.

62
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,275
If I was gonna jump,
would I worry about the height?

63
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,584
<i>- Okay. What do you need to open this window?
- More than good intentions.</i>

64
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,624
It's bolted closed.

65
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,991
Why the hell do you tell me to open
a window when you know it's bolted?

66
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,998
- Harry, you're hysterical.
- I'm not hysterical.

67
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm indignant.

68
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,071
<i>And you care only marginally
about the money.</i>

69
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,505
What's really on your mind is whether
or not I've read your precious new book.

70
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,941
That is not what...
what's on my mind.

71
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,377
Oh, fine, because I haven't read it.

72
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,746
I gave you the book a month ago, Jake.
Over a month ago.

73
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,979
Where have you been for over a month?
I was starting to worry about you.

74
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,682
<i>- Why haven't you read it?
- But it's not on your mind.</i>

75
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,157
<i>- Why haven't you read it?
- Look, let's get back to the money.</i>

76
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,160
Why haven't you read the book?

77
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,958
Because reading every new effort
by Harry Levine...

78
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,964
isn't all I have to do in life.

79
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,398
I'll take it back. Okay.

80
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,970
<i>- Where is it?
- I don't know. It's under something.</i>

81
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,370
<i>Look, I will find it and I will read it,
sojust relax.</i>

82
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,205
<i>- Don't fuck with me, Jake.
- Nobody's fucking with you.</i>

83
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,939
<i>- Don't fuck with my mind!
- Nobody's fucking with your mind.</i>

84
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,515
I will not have you
fucking with my mind.

85
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,880
<i>I wouldn't wanna fuck with your mind.</i>

86
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,545
Things have been a little hectic
around here.

87
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,055
<i>Hectic? What way hectic?</i>

88
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,853
<i>- Hectic, hectic.
- What do you mean, hectic?</i>

89
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,656
<i>- You had sittings?
- There has been some activity, yes.</i>

90
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,823
<i>- You had sittings.
- In other words, we're back to the money again.</i>

91
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,628
- I suppose we are.
- But you're not sure.

92
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,996
<i>- I'm sure.
- Are you sure?</i>

93
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,126
<i>- Yes.
- Isn't that why you came?</i>

94
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,137
Why I came.

95
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,537
<i>Didrt you come for the money?
Or did you come about the book?</i>

96
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,007
- I came. Yes.
- Yes what?

97
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,705
I came for something.
L- l... What do you...

98
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,544
- You're shaking again.
- I'm not shaking.

99
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,175
- Your knee is shaking.
- Your legs are shaking.

100
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,584
- It's your nerves, honey.
- It's my nerves.

101
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,157
- Steady yourself.
- I'm steady.

102
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,394
So, what, you had sittings?

103
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,396
All right. All right.

104
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,592
You wanna know whether or not
I've made any money, right?

105
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,295
Okay. Sit down, sit down.

106
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,564
Let us put this thing to rest forever.

107
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,972
Now, exactly how much is it
I'm supposed to owe you?

108
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,342
On May 28, on my MasterCharge card...

109
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,781
you borrowed 500 bucks for that...
that equipment, right?

110
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,785
- If you say so.
- You dispute it?

111
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,685
<i>Take it easy.
I am not disputing anything.</i>

112
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,986
You say I owe it, I owe it.
Go ahead. Continue.

113
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,795
Okay.

114
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:55,027
- You paid July.
- Take it easy.

115
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:59,468
This is gonna be a very complicated
financial discourse, I can tell.

116
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,040
Okay. You paid July.

117
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,269
- You want some coffee?
- No, no. No coffee.

118
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,938
You paid July. Yeah.

119
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,141
- No? No? Yes?
- Yes, I'll take coffee.

120
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,346
- How do you want it?
- I want it with milk.

121
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,582
- I don't have any.
- You don't have milk?

122
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,592
- No. No milk.
- What do you have for it?

123
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,754
I have nothing.
I have black coffee.

124
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,628
- You have any tea?
- How do you want it?

125
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,100
- Do you have any tea?
- I don't believe I do, but I might.

126
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,671
- Give me the coffee.
- Excellent.

127
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,900
Okay.
Continue about the money.

128
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,943
Okay, you paid July,
you paid August, September.

129
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:43,948
Twenty bucks each time, plus
the one-and-a-half percent interest...

130
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,950
<i>on the unpaid balance.</i>

131
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,112
<i>Now, for five months, since it's now
February, you haven't paid a dime...</i>

132
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,689
so you owe me $440...

133
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,918
plus the interest for five months...

134
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,985
which is five times $6.60...

135
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,997
or $33.

136
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,590
<i>So you owe me, all told...</i>

137
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:07,332
$473, altogether.

138
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,340
Fork it over.

139
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll take a look at those figures,
if I may.

140
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,145
So, uh, who's been making
the payments the last five months?

141
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,148
I've been making the payments.

142
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,708
- Doesn't that bring the interest down every month?
- It does.

143
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,052
- So how can I owe you $33...
- Let's cut the interest in half.

144
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,682
- We may need a computer.
- Forget the interest. We'll waive it.

145
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,023
No, I'm not waiving it in any manner.

146
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,654
I want to pay you
exactly what I owe you.

147
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,233
No more, but certainly no less.

148
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,826
Unfortunately, I have no money at all.

149
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,066
Jake, I'm walking around
without a dime.

150
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,666
- Let's not be dramatic.
- I got $1.50 to my name.

151
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,874
Hey, hey. I am as dry
as a Steinbeck dust bowl.

152
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,713
The last leaf has blown away.
That's from O. Henry.

153
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,583
Sometimes he talks
the way some people write.

154
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,681
<i>This man I started working for last night...
Is it all right if I talk?</i>

155
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,386
Sure.

156
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,555
- He has the lowest...
- Who?

157
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,226
The man that I started working for last night
where I take the photographs at the nightclub...

158
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,360
<i>the man who has the concession.</i>

159
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,234
- What about him?
- His name is Jacob Maneim.

160
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,434
He's very, very serious,
but completely crazy.

161
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,171
I think you'd enjoy meeting him.

162
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,510
<i>What's the limit on that credit card?</i>

163
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,052
The limit is $500.

164
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:31,249
Well, you're a man of means! You only
owed 340, so you still have 160 to draw on.

165
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,053
You don't think I'm up to the limit again?

166
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,027
- You tell me you had sittings.
- Inquiries.

167
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,063
But you've been too busy
to read my manuscript.

168
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,963
I have not been in a reading vein.

169
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,037
- No? Have you opened it?
- No.

170
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,571
- I don't believe that.
- Why don't you believe it?

171
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,301
Because it's not like you. And if you'd
opened it, you'd have finished it.

172
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,309
You're a little cocksure of yourself.

173
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,902
- I don't believe you haven't read it.
- I haven't opened it.

174
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,574
I haven't read it.
I don't have your money. Anything else?

175
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:01,141
- You have any tranquilizers?
- I don't take tranquilizers.

176
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,090
What happened to your tranquilizers?

177
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,319
Gone. Tonight.

178
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,895
You didn't swallow them all at once,
did you?

179
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,430
No. If I did, would I be here
asking for more?

180
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,830
- Ever think of such a thing?
- No.

181
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,402
<i>- Do you ever think of it?
- No.</i>

182
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,403
- Everybody thinks of it.
- Then everybody thinks...

183
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,473
<i>- From time to time.
- I'm not suicidal.</i>

184
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,042
- So what happened to your tranquilizers?
- I was opening the vial.

185
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,112
My hands shook so badly,
I spilled them all down the drain.

186
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,273
- So go back to your doctor.
- It's my dentist.

187
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:34,614
I'm a grinder. Says one morning I'm gonna
wake up with a mouth full of white dust.

188
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,847
I owe him too much money.

189
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,655
I gotta get my hands on some money.

190
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:40,354
I gotta get my hands on some money.

191
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,927
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here tonight anyway?

192
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,656
Arert you supposed to work
Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights?

193
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,665
- I was fired.
- When?

194
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,167
- Tonight.
- Morris fired you?

195
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,102
- Maurice, yes.
- You don't do what a doorman do!

196
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,503
- "Does."
- Does what?

197
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,668
- "Does," not "do."
- Does not do what?

198
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,941
Does not do what you don't do?
You don't do nothing!

199
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,515
<i>You got to bow. You got to scrape.</i>

200
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,713
"Good evening, sir."
"Would you like a cab, sir?"

201
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,619
"Please, sir, do me the honor
of walking on my face."

202
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:16,684
<i>"Bonsoir, madame. Bonsoir, monsieur."
That's a doorman.!</i>

203
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,856
- Fucking French.
- What did you do?

204
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,865
Nothing.

205
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,731
He said I wasrt servile enough.

206
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,772
I didn't demean myself enough
in a manner befitting a doorman...

207
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,773
of a chic French restaurant.

208
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,503
- He wanted I should bow and scrape more.
- He didn't really say that.

209
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,408
- He said that exactly.
- You're making it up.

210
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,981
I'm not making it up.
That's what he said.

211
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:42,076
There comes a point in life when one will
no longer bow and scrape, doesn't there?

212
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,887
Oh, I don't know. Does there come a point
when one says, "I will no longer whine"?

213
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,519
Who's whining? Where were you last night?
I called till 2:00 in the morning.

214
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,860
I heard nothing but the usual
vague clanging in my head.

215
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,696
- You were out on a date.
- A date?

216
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,033
Yeah, you were out with a girl,
spending my money.

217
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,267
Listen, if I so much as talk to a girl...

218
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,139
she either laughs and runs away
or runs away laughing.

219
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,078
- Thank you. I called till 2:00 in the morning.
- I wasrt answering.

220
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,947
- Why not?
- Same reason you called. No money.

221
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,350
How did you know
I was calling about money?

222
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,787
<i>What else does anybody ever call for?
Certainly not to offer it.</i>

223
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:23,521
Besides, I was too depressed,
and I wasrt answering the phone because...

224
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,722
because nobody ever calls!

225
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,790
Don't persecute me.
I'm a thing of shreds and patches.

226
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,462
- I'm a dying man.
- And me... what am I?

227
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,940
- Is this a dying man contest?
- I'm literally a thing of shreds and patches.

228
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,773
Look. Look at this coat.
Ratty, purposeless. I hate it.

229
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,976
<i>So it's old. I can still see where it
was once a coat of real distinction.</i>

230
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,076
Distinction? It's a rag.
It was never a coat of distinction.

231
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,418
Even in the beginning,
this was a coat without cachet.

232
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,050
<i>- I hate that fuckir coat.
- Pick it up.</i>

233
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,458
- Pick it up!
- I hate this coat!

234
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,966
Pick the coat up! I don't want it on my floor!
I scrubbed that floor today.

235
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,934
<i>No wonder you drove your woman away.</i>

236
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,131
You throw things on the floor like that
when you and Joanna were together?

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,801
- What difference does it make?
- Stop! Ooh!

238
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,209
Yeah, once in a while. A shoe.

239
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,781
<i>How you must have terrorized
that poor angel.</i>

240
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,147
<i>- Why can't I have a decent coat?
- Stop whining.! The coat is fine.</i>

241
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,348
I have to wear this damnable sweater
underneath just to stay warm.

242
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,584
<i>That's a beautiful garment.
That's a Mexican sweater.</i>

243
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,752
It's a thousand years old.

244
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,330
Well, then it's valuable.
It's pre-Columbian.

245
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,161
- It's utterly dethreaded.
- And so are you.

246
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,226
Walk into Bigelow's drugstore to weigh myself,
I'm ashamed to take off my coat.

247
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,499
I can't even determine
how much I'm losing.

248
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,302
I don't know what you're
complaining about.

249
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,207
<i>You got a credit card, a Mexican sweater.
The world's at your feet.</i>

250
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,440
- I live like a tramp.
- You live like an artist.

251
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,711
You laze around, write a few lines...

252
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,286
<i>strike up some conversations
in coffee shops.</i>

253
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,015
<i>I'd say you've got things worked out
pretty well for yourself.</i>

254
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,956
This morning I'm shaving,
I notice this thing under my left eye.

255
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,824
What kind of a thing? I see nothing.

256
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,692
- Like a pouch.
- A what?

257
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,390
- Pouch.
- A what?

258
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,967
A bag under my eye, all right?

259
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,537
It was frightening.
I didn't know how to get rid of it.

260
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,572
Should've called the Marsupial Society.

261
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,369
I did my laundry instead.

262
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,309
<i>What happened to the pouch?</i>

263
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,347
It went away, I thought.
I went to the supermarket.

264
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,146
<i>Great big bag, laundry bag, canvas bag.</i>

265
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,243
<i>- She thought, uh...
- Who thought?</i>

266
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,722
She thought...
The supermarket cashier.

267
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,522
- She said...
- We don't take cans till 10:00.

268
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,926
<i>I said...</i>

269
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:43,024
This is my laundry. I want to buy soap.

270
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,696
<i>- She said...
- We don't redeem cans until 10:00.</i>

271
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,773
It's not cans. It's... It's my laundry.

272
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,848
I want to buy soap.

273
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,885
- We don't redeem cans until 10:00.
- These aren't cans.

274
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,113
<i>I got into this rage.</i>

275
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,589
I'm looking at her. She's looking at me.

276
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,660
<i>Really staring right at me.</i>

277
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,855
<i>I thought, "She's looking at the pouch."</i>

278
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,932
<i>So I felt my face.</i>

279
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,366
<i>It was gone, but she was staring.</i>

280
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,994
Jake, the episode unnerved me.

281
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,198
I sat for a full hour afterward...

282
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,606
<i>Abingdon Square playground...
feeling my face, freezing.</i>

283
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,407
<i>I was sure I had
some kind of disfigurement.</i>

284
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,482
As it is,
I think people are looking at me.

285
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,541
Anyway, this woman... I'm going into
this supermarket for years. She knows me.

286
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,918
I'm the guy who says thank you to all
the people who are supposed to say thank you.

287
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,991
<i>This morning, she didn't know me.</i>

288
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,788
<i>Thought I was a Washington Street
can collector.</i>

289
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,420
<i>- Then this afternoon, on my way to Chinatown...
- What?</i>

290
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,624
<i>- Forget it.
- No. What?</i>

291
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,166
I just didn't know if I had enough money
to buy a Gai-mai bao.

292
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,833
- A what?
- Hey, young man. You Gai-mai bao?

293
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,911
- You wanna split a Gai-mai bao?
- Sure.

294
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,105
- One Gai-mai bao.
- Oh, sure.

295
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,642
- Did I just put sugar in here?
- I don't know.

296
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,052
Anyway, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

297
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,023
It's just that he... he's really
kind of down, depressed...

298
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:18,790
Gai-mai bao! No more Har Gau?
No Shumai? NoJuk today?

299
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,956
<i>- No, no.
- You no hungry today?</i>

300
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,590
<i>- Not today.
- Ahh.</i>

301
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,501
He's upset. So he was very what?

302
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,507
He has a very firm opinion
of everything he's read...

303
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,407
and he can be very negative,
caustic...

304
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,503
like a critic.

305
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,048
- Do you want to meet him?
- No.

306
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,608
It's a coconut peanut butter bun.

307
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,314
How the hell did you ever get
a credit card in the first place?

308
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,984
I don't know. You live long enough.

309
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,221
You never apply for one,
and then they appear as if by magic.

310
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,696
You really have no money.

311
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,359
Jar full of pennies.

312
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,801
- My folks were always dragging out hidden pennies.
- Here.

313
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,874
<i>Mi pennies, su pennies.</i>

314
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,875
Oh, that's impressive, Jake.

315
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,606
A month before my mother died,
she said to me, "Harry, you're 43.

316
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,514
"You're gonna be 50 before you know it.
Put some pennies away.

317
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,212
You're gonna be just like your father was."
This is great, Jake.

318
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,654
Well, who knows? Maybe you'll make
some dough with that new book of yours.

319
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,784
- Think it's got a chance?
- Well, I don't know. That's why I came here.

320
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,422
- I wanted your opinion on that.
- Don't rush me.

321
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,161
As Tolstoy said,
"Everything comes to him who waits."

322
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,329
That was all right for Tolstoy's general.
He had nothing but time.

323
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,236
- Uh-oh. Whoo!
- What's with your legs?

324
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,242
Muscle tension. Oh!

325
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,778
I had a spasm in the middle of the night,
almost had me screaming.

326
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,283
- Hmm.
- I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't get some money.

327
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,876
You don't get it.

328
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,887
What don't I get?

329
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,685
You don't get that I'm 42
and I have nothing...

330
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,124
and I never had anything...

331
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,322
and every time I wake up, I think...

332
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,629
"I'm gonna be exactly like what
my brother said about my father."

333
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:09,037
- What did he say?
- "Nothing but a long record of failure."

334
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,541
He's a schmuck.

335
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,908
My brother. Oh, God.
What a fucking bum.

336
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:19,313
<i>- Oh, please, please. Don't start with your brother now.
- Why shouldn't I start?</i>

337
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,445
All the combined and wretched prophets
of heart disease and stroke...

338
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,424
serve only to support
his vile taste in art and aesthetics.

339
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,928
Not a dime to nourish my talent.
Not that I'd want it anyway.

340
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,931
- It's just a thought.
- Forget him, will you? Will you let it go?

341
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,399
- What do you got here?
- Hey, don't go in there.

342
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,936
<i>- I'm just. Ohh! Jake.
- There's nothing in there. There's just... Please.</i>

343
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,302
<i>Please, stay out of there, will you, Harry?</i>

344
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,002
Till the day they died,
my folks were proud I was a writer.

345
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,636
They'd brag to anyone who'd listen
I was a writer.

346
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,911
<i>Unlike my brother, who sorrows for me,
'cause what? I'm not a winner.</i>

347
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,680
<i>- Let him go!
- He doesn't let me go.</i>

348
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,415
He comes over and he cries.

349
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,491
<i>Real tears.</i>

350
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,583
He comes to my room, he says...

351
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,162
<i>"When I think of the way
you have to live...</i>

352
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,459
<i>"without a house, a home, furniture...</i>

353
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,002
<i>"I laid awake all night, crying,
thinking about you coming back...</i>

354
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,799
<i>to this dark, lonely room
without furniture. "</i>

355
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,567
I didn't know I didn't have furniture
till he told me.

356
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,667
You think he'd cough up a chair
or something.

357
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,746
Maybe he can't cough up
a chair or something.

358
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,510
Maybe a chair or something
sticks in his throat. Maybe he's broke too.

359
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,710
He's a heart surgeon.

360
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,117
<i>He gave his heart to science.</i>

361
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,157
<i>Why don't you leave the poor guy at peace?
So he's got a few bucks.</i>

362
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,783
<i>So he doesn't read
the New York Review of Books.</i>

363
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,919
What a remarkable idea...

364
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,295
that one's relatives should be
supportive of one's aesthetics.

365
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,891
And financially supportive.
Even more remarkable.

366
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,836
He behaved the same way with my father,
and the old man wasrt any kind of artist.

367
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,407
Please, don't go on about things
you don't know.

368
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,842
- Why don't you just finish your coffee and go home?
- I don't wanna go home.

369
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,913
"I don't wanna go home."

370
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,244
Don't you have
a support system someplace?

371
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,615
What does that mean?
I hear it constantly.

372
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,553
"Support system." I don't understand it.
What does it mean?

373
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,887
It means, don't you have anybody
whose balls you can break...

374
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,893
<i>because your friends
don't want you to break theirs?</i>

375
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,158
<i>- What friends?
- You read the Times today?</i>

376
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,326
- Only the comics.
- Armand Gottlieb won the National Book Award.

377
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,700
<i>I couldn't finish it.</i>

378
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,739
Hey, don't do that!
You wanna blow us up?

379
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,571
Why don't you put some of those
8- by-10's in the envelopes, huh?

380
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,669
Armand Gottlieb
keeps award-winning company.

381
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,509
What's that mean?

382
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,413
Gottlieb's a thoroughgoing fraud.

383
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,783
<i>He steals front story from Balzac,
back story from Conrad...</i>

384
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:41,757
some wind from Thomas Wolfe
and a little social catchall from Dreiser.

385
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,624
He wins everything in sight,
but everything in sight he steals.

386
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,925
Who knows that?

387
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,262
I do.

388
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,709
<i>What do you wanna do, sit around here
all night? Because you can't.</i>

389
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,748
I'm wiped out.

390
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,546
I'm exhausted from being exhausted.

391
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:11,213
What does it mean
when you can't fall asleep?

392
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,382
Severe depression.

393
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,087
- When you wake up constantly?
- Severe anxiety.

394
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,096
- Any remedy?
- Death.

395
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,998
- Something less exotic, please.
- Doesn't sound exotic to me.

396
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,838
- Let's go have some coffee.
- Why, Harry?

397
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,067
Because we're young, it's the Village,
we're happy, we're in love.

398
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,610
Arert we, Jake?

399
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,011
Wanna take a walk to Chinatown?

400
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:42,314
- Chinatown? No, I decidedly do not.
- Why not?

401
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,651
Because it's 1:30 in the morning.

402
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,192
Because it's February.
Because it's freezing outside.

403
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,785
Because I don't like Chinatown.
Because we don't have any money.

404
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,297
It's brisk. It's a nice walk.

405
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,994
Come on. We'll get some coffee with milk.
We got enough money for that.

406
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,630
You don't need coffee, Chinese or otherwise.
Give me that cup.

407
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,208
- Look at yourself.
- The worst coffee I've ever had.

408
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,405
You're shaking, trembling.
You need to be clubbed, not prodded.

409
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,141
- Chinese coffee puts me at peace.
- Oh, please.

410
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,343
I had a cup of java there once.
Did anything but put me at peace.

411
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,353
My stomach did flip-flops for days.

412
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,015
You had to be in a border area.
What street were you on?

413
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,456
Street? What? Who knows?
Chinatown... acid.

414
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,460
You must have been in a border area.

415
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,396
I wasrt reading maps. All I know is I
could have opened a drain with the stuff.

416
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,196
<i>That's the point. If the coffee had acid,
you couldn't have been in Chinatown.</i>

417
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,271
You were obviously in a border area.

418
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,135
Couple of Chinese just sitting around
the joint. Greeks running it.

419
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,835
<i>- You know that for a fact?
- Yes.</i>

420
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,913
<i>- How?
- Chinese worship their stomachs and everything they put in 'em.</i>

421
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,208
When it comes to coffee, it's the freshest.

422
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,752
- Oh, I get it. They grind it from the bean.
- That's pretentious.

423
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,185
Only they use the very best beans.

424
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:54,156
<i>And it's brewed fresh,
in Silex pots only.</i>

425
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,386
Glass, never an urn.

426
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,725
You know the final touch?

427
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,889
Soy sauce.

428
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,899
Cream.

429
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:07,131
<i>Real cream.
Some places, not many... half and half.</i>

430
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,207
<i>That's as far as they'll descend.</i>

431
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:13,209
<i>But most places? Cream. Throw the whole
quart at you. Wouldrt that give you a lift?</i>

432
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:17,179
No, for me the Chinese
are not escapist entertainment.

433
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,182
They're crammed into sweatshops...

434
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,582
<i>and obscure poverty.</i>

435
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,484
They should be glum and depressed.
It depresses me that they're not.

436
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:28,355
<i>They have hope. They inspire me.
I admire them, really.</i>

437
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,224
<i>You do not.
You feel superior to them. Isn't that it?</i>

438
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,321
- No matter how broke you are.
- Nonsense.

439
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,924
- I like their spirit.
- Please.

440
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,708
So you got wrappers for these pennies?

441
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,607
There's a paper bag
around here someplace.

442
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,681
No, I don't want to walk around
with a paper bag full of pennies.

443
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,182
Who's gonna see you?
It's 1:30 in the morning.

444
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,913
I'm gonna see me. Others are...
This is New York at 1:30.

445
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,455
I don't want a bag!

446
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,551
I think you're gonna have to leave, Harry.

447
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,759
- Why? What's the rush?
- I have a customer coming in. I have a sitting.

448
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,565
- At this hour?
- She's a little late.

449
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,640
- What time was she due?
- 6:00.

450
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,038
- It's almost 2:00.
- She's an actress.

451
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:22,978
She's working in Jersey as a go-go dancer
while she perfects her theatrical hysteria.

452
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,345
You been waiting here for her since 6:00?

453
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,111
<i>- That's right.
- Doing what?</i>

454
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,778
- Reading.
- Reading.

455
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,688
But you werert in the reading vein,
I thought.

456
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:38,923
<i>One need not be in a reading vein
for Tolstoy's Letters.</i>

457
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,466
Tolstoy puts any civilized man
in the vein.

458
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,467
<i>Do I unnerve you?</i>

459
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,168
<i>You have that capacity, yes.</i>

460
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,266
- I ran into two friends of yours the other day.
- I find that highly doubtful.

461
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,608
The two Irvings.
Your bosses from the club, remember?

462
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:59,013
<i>They asked me how you were doing
in theatrical photography.</i>

463
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,244
They want me to reopen the concession.

464
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,346
Listen, anybody asks you how I'm doing,
you tell 'em I'm doing marvelously well...

465
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,789
<i>I adore theatrical photography...</i>

466
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:12,352
and I will never again be interested in
nightclub photographic concessionairing.

467
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:17,401
Why not? At least you had a place to go,
people to see, besides me.

468
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,369
For 30 years I sojourned in nightclub hell.

469
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,940
<i>Is this supposed to be
a fucking photograph?</i>

470
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,373
<i>My grandmother took
a better picture with a Brownie.!</i>

471
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,308
I am finally risen.

472
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,744
You know Sarah, the belly dancer?

473
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,976
She told the two Irvings that
she came here to be photographed...

474
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,814
<i>and that you groaned
all during her session.</i>

475
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
Because she was killing me.

476
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,556
- Stop groaning.
- Stop belching.

477
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,566
I'm paying. I can belch.

478
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,568
I had too much falafel last night.

479
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,901
<i>And I'm paying for that tonight.</i>

480
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,237
That's it. Put your rags on.
The sessiors over.

481
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,369
Boy, have I had a belly full of you.

482
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,880
- She said the phone rang, you answered...
- Death house.

483
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:08,419
'Cause she was killing me!

484
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,318
Jake, when was the last time
you had a customer?

485
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,051
I mean,
someone who actually showed up...

486
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,059
besides Sarah.

487
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,459
Two months ago.

488
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:23,159
<i>And since you left the club six months ago
to go into theatrical photography...</i>

489
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,601
how many customers
have you had altogether?

490
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,605
Four.

491
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,370
- But you like these people, these show people.
- I loathe them.

492
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,570
Oh, I thought you liked them.

493
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,909
<i>- I loathe them.
- Really?</i>

494
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,109
At their worst, nightclub patrons
are merely drunk and vomitory...

495
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,209
but actors and actresses!

496
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,220
<i>Magnificent.!</i>

497
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,587
<i>You are cleaving my heart
with your Elizabethan tragica.!</i>

498
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,092
I can actually see the grave open.

499
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,995
Now let me hear it open.
Speak to me, Hamlet. Speak!

500
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,432
To be or...

501
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,435
not to be.

502
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:04,167
Ah, bravo, noble prince! Bravo!

503
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,767
Now the dagger.
Bring it up towards your heart. That's it.

504
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,313
Now press the point in deeper.

505
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,646
Deeper! Deeper!

506
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,053
Sometimes I actually dream
of slipping a chisel...

507
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,786
underneath their preening choppers
and dislodging them one by one.

508
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,990
How do they come by this
remorseless enthusiasm for misery?

509
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,466
Mercy, honey. Arert you even
a little bit nervous?

510
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,027
- I only did the masks.
- Only did the masks?

511
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,040
What is Greek tragedy
without the masks?

512
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,373
She's a nervous wreck.
She's all a-twitter. She just hides it well.

513
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,777
The way your work has grown, I'm sure
they're going to be absolutely glorious.

514
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,146
I just want to serve the play.

515
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,981
Honey, you are on the brink of
an artistic breakthrough. I can just feel it.

516
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,647
- I was telling Jake...
- Will you can the magnolia juice?

517
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,656
She hasn't been to the plantation.

518
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,784
Jake, why did they use
those masks anyway?

519
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,991
They were a visual aid, and they also
contained a kind of a voice box...

520
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,330
<i>so an audience of up to 10,000
could see and hear.</i>

521
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,562
This theater really only holds about...

522
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,662
<i>- Thirty people, I think.
- Thirty.</i>

523
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,970
- So what is this production all about?
- Pretension.

524
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:16,877
<i>It's about giving artists likeJoanna,
you know, a chance to do her stuff.</i>

525
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,814
- Easy there, Hotspur. We know you love her.
- Yeah, well.

526
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,819
- Your lover was about to belt me.
- Shh.

527
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,689
<i>You citizens of Cadmus.!</i>

528
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:32,854
He must speak home,
that in the ship's prow...

529
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,761
watches the events...

530
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,834
<i>and guides the rudder.!</i>

531
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,200
- Why is he screaming?
- Hush, honey. I just love your masks.

532
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,830
Great prince of the Cadmaeans,
I, a messenger...

533
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,502
<i>come bringing a clear word
from the army of matters there.</i>

534
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,570
<i>I, myself, too, have seen
the things I speak of.</i>

535
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:55,619
O Zeus and Earth and gods
that guard the city...

536
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,248
<i>my father's curse, mighty evil spirit.!</i>

537
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,953
It's killing my eardrums.
This is all the fault of rock and roll.

538
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,793
- Your masks are just beautiful.
- They're incredible. They're incredible.

539
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,026
<i>The chorus of Theban women
must be heard.</i>

540
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:14,093
<i>- Not by me.
- My sorrow is great and fearful...</i>

541
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,231
therefore, I cry aloud.

542
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,311
The army has left the camp
and is gone!

543
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,574
- So am I.
- I think they're just trying to be authentic.

544
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,149
I know. I love your masks.
They're great, really.

545
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,378
He was going to take
costume pictures after the show.

546
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,115
Behold the rushing river,
the great tide of horsemen.

547
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,920
- I'll be in the Acropolis, the diner around the corner.
- Shh!

548
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,052
<i>O misery.!</i>

549
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,132
Maybe you'd like them better
if more of them came.

550
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,292
Yeah, naturally.

551
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,030
I need bigger ads.
I gotta raise my prices.

552
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,370
Jake, I think you should learn a little something
about theatrical photography first.

553
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,944
Hey, fella, don't get high hat on me.
This is America.

554
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,513
- You are what you say you are.
- Well...

555
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,607
Eh, don't give me "well."
You are what you say you are.

556
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,983
You oughta learn that, too, because
you're totally off on a wrong bat.

557
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,988
Oh, really? How?

558
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,685
You think a writer should merely write,
and that's naive crap.

559
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,820
A writer's primary activity
is promoting.

560
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,195
<i>No. Look at Norman Mailer.</i>

561
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,794
You hang around Chinatown. Who's gonna
see you there? Not even the Chinese.

562
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,032
- That's the way I like it.
- Get your hands on some money.

563
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,632
- Money.
- Then promote yourself, and the rest will follow.

564
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,975
<i>And I mean real money,
not the few pennies I owe you.</i>

565
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,347
<i>See, you can't sleep in bohemia
and commute to the real world.</i>

566
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,445
It doesn't work that way.
And don't give me that blank look!

567
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,855
There is real money out there for you.
I wish I could say the same.

568
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,727
<i>- Really?
- Yeah, big money practically staring you in the face.</i>

569
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,130
Have you seen your lost love lately?

570
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,241
No. Why?

571
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,209
What did Joanna take with her
when she ran out on you?

572
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,711
Joanna... All right.
At least hold on to your keys.

573
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,806
Nothing.

574
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,375
- I don't want the keys.
- Wait a minute. Wait. Here. You'll be in the neighborhood.

575
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,389
- Then I'll call you.
- Joanna, just take the keys.

576
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,220
- You'll need them.
- How am I gonna need them?

577
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,454
You'll meet another sweet thing.

578
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,021
- No.
- Joanna. Jo...

579
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,005
<i>Guilt. She ran off with guilt...</i>

580
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,842
<i>which is one step removed from gelt.</i>

581
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:41,408
What are you suggesting?
I filch guilt money from Joanna?

582
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,646
Well, you should make an ignoble try.

583
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,019
<i>- Can you?
- Naturally.</i>

584
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,184
- Naturally?
- Harry, you sit on a very high moral plane.

585
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,193
I'm merely trying to get along.

586
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,264
Well, why don't you
squeeze money out of Mavis?

587
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,357
You love to tell me how loaded she is.
Why don't you extort from her?

588
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,959
<i>Mavis is, yes, exquisitely rich.</i>

589
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:04,201
Unfortunately, she doesn't begin to
appreciate the concept of the word "guilt."

590
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,208
Maybe that's because you left her.

591
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,608
<i>- There are other won'thy guilts, Harry.
- Really?</i>

592
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,511
She just doesn't take the cue,
and I do feed it to her.

593
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,709
Relentlessly tell her she's guilty.

594
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,286
<i>- Of what?
- What does it matter? It doesn't matter.</i>

595
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,356
All that matters is there's no real payoff.

596
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,449
And I have to sleep with her
for a lousy C-note.

597
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,585
She gives you a hundred
to sleep with her?

598
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:28,961
I find it in my pocket on my way home,
along with a chocolate caramel.

599
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,695
But it's not an easy buck,
I assure you.

600
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,328
And any more than that,
I have to move back in.

601
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,408
- Jake, do you want a divorce?
- No.

602
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,341
- Do you want to move back in?
- No.

603
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,606
Do you still love me?

604
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,176
I have no idea what you mean
by that question.

605
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:51,415
- How much did she inerit?
- Stop snooping. Plenty.

606
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:55,458
- Only you're not gonna move back in to get it.
- My, aren't you the wag?

607
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,790
Why? Because it's a compromise?

608
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,864
Well, it's a compromise
I'm not prepared to make.

609
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,490
Not that I'm against
compromise per se, but...

610
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,501
I'm against compromise per se.

611
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,539
Once you start,
you inevitably turn into phlegm.

612
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,040
- Where did you hear that?
- What?

613
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,444
That "phlegm" business.
You heard that from me.

614
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:21,541
I did? When?

615
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:25,611
A couple of years ago. That's something
I was saying a lot two years ago.

616
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,521
- You stole that from me.
- I stole your phlegm business.

617
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,094
- Right out of my mouth.
- You want it back?

618
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,221
<i>- Yes, exactly. I want it back.
- I have been using it.</i>

619
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,960
But you have no right to use it.

620
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,059
It is in no way public domain.

621
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,300
<i>My words are my words, always!</i>

622
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,570
They are not free
for random manipulation...

623
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,872
and tawdry circulation!

624
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,076
<i>In other words,
there is no open season on my words.!</i>

625
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,676
<i>Not any longer!</i>

626
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,660
You're pretty upset, Maneim.

627
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,565
I won't use the phrase again.

628
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,747
Look, uh, I don't know
how to do this...

629
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,544
without seeming unduly hurtful...

630
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,279
which I'm not inclined to be...

631
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,378
but, uh...

632
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,550
I think I oughta tell you bluntly
what I think of your new work.

633
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,124
Sure. Why not?

634
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,462
- It doesn't satisfy me.
- But you haven't read it.

635
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,866
I gave both your books toJake.

636
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,565
He compared them
with Nathanael West's first two books.

637
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,810
He didn't go into it, but...

638
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,812
he would like you to read two short stories
he wrote when he was a boy.

639
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,975
<i>I think the time has come
for you to try something else.</i>

640
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,316
- You have any suggestions?
- About what?

641
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:09,758
- About the book.
- About your new book, I have no suggestions.

642
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,885
Then why do you say
"try something else"?

643
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,663
- I mean exactly what I said.
- You mean try another book?

644
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,331
- I mean exactly what I said.
- You mean try another book?

645
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,493
<i>I mean, try something else.</i>

646
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,663
<i>- Try what?
- Harry, it's almost 2:00 in the morning.</i>

647
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,570
I have not paid my rent in three months.

648
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:28,008
<i>The landlord is lying in wait for me
with a rock and a sling.</i>

649
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:33,072
- I can't afford to have you in here kicking up a row.
- Don't fuck with my mind!

650
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,783
- What'll you have?
- Uh, double espresso.

651
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,417
Whoa! Arert you the brave one?
I'll have an American coffee.

652
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,190
We don't have American coffee.
This is Caf Dante.

653
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,698
Oh, this is Caf Dante.

654
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,963
Do you have anything
like a Caf Americano?

655
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,302
- Whipped cream?
- Whipped? No, I think lightly disciplined will do.

656
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,308
You got it.

657
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,378
Not one of your haunts, this place.

658
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,947
No, I'm strictly
for one-armed Greek diners.

659
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,710
But your lady said you liked it here.

660
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,116
- I like the painting.
- Ahh.

661
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,985
<i>Dante on first seeing Beatrice.</i>

662
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,957
But you notice,
he's got his eye on both dames.

663
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,187
<i>It only looks that way.</i>

664
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,732
- Yeah, he's checkir 'em both out.
- No, not for me.

665
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,029
What are you, City College of New York?

666
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,127
No college. No.

667
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,505
- Oh, I'm really nervous now.
- No. Really?

668
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,342
<i>Harry, I did like your first two books.
You know that.</i>

669
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,478
I mean, they were sharp, flinty,
crazy in all the right ways.

670
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:49,389
<i>And workmanlike. You are a worker,
so you deserve a break.</i>

671
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,088
<i>But I simply cannot give you
the nod on this one.</i>

672
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,496
<i>L- It's a mess.
The whole thing just flies apart.</i>

673
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,228
It fails utterly.

674
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:05,435
Why? Why?

675
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,603
- Joanna says you work day and night.
- I'm not very facile.

676
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,546
Hmm.
Why not be more like Trollope?

677
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,049
- Anthony Trollope?
- Yeah.

678
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:18,349
Trollope wrote more words in his lifetime
than all the other English writers put together.

679
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,424
This was his unswerving routine.

680
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,187
7:00 to 11:00 every morning,
he worked without respite.

681
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,059
Then the rest of the day, he had fun.

682
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:31,294
I very much like those two, uh,
stories that you gaveJoanna.

683
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,893
Oh, mere autobiography.

684
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,132
No, l-I really...
The writing was wonderful.

685
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,404
My writing's always wonderful.
There just isn't enough of it.

686
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:44,880
<i>Which is why I'm still taking
dyspeptic pictures in inelegant nightclubs.</i>

687
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,644
- So what else have you written?
- Nothing.

688
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,720
Nothing?

689
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,916
You wrote those two stories
when you were young... a boy, right?

690
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,323
Yeah, I've had a little bit
of a block since then.

691
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,776
<i>Harry, pull out the zinger.</i>

692
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,124
<i>Harry, pull out the zinger.</i>

693
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,665
<i>- I tell you as a friend.
- What?</i>

694
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,735
<i>The zinger, the poison dart.</i>

695
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,771
See it sticking out of you a mile away.
That's why you can't write or think.

696
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,932
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

697
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,841
Your lady love... She stuck it to you,
and now you're stuck with it.

698
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,779
<i>- Get rid of it.
- Why did you lie... about having read the book?</i>

699
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,976
Were you in any shape when you
walked in here to deal with anything?

700
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,454
- When did you read it?
- I read it, I read it. Does it matter when?

701
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,650
I don't know. Maybe.

702
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,852
Maybe it doesn't.

703
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:35,261
Could you just tell me something?
Talk to me honestly about it.

704
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,665
It's riddled with chaos.
It oozes disease.

705
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,464
That was helpful.

706
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,132
So, uh, nothing much happened
with those two books of yours?

707
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,835
Well, last week I was at the Strand.

708
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,935
You know, nine miles of books.

709
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,879
The world's greatest collection
of out-of-print books?

710
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,941
<i>They didn't know me. Wanted to know
if Harry Levine was a living author.</i>

711
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,920
- Listen, you mind if I'm honest?
- No.

712
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,823
<i>I think your work could be
a little more personal.</i>

713
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,726
<i>- Well...
- That's really the kind of writer you are, you know.</i>

714
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:11,291
<i>- You're right.
- After all, it's what made Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe.</i>

715
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,302
It's certainly Hemingway's appeal.

716
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,965
Not his sorry aping of Gertrude Steirs
dilettante maunderings.

717
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:21,010
<i>And it's what finally turned the tables
for Nathanael West...</i>

718
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,239
and, without doubt, Henry Miller.

719
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,373
I do write in the first person.

720
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,452
Well, that's a stylistic decision.

721
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,486
You mind if I get a little pushy?

722
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,785
Harry, the answer to love is love.

723
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,917
- Pull out the zinger.
- I don't have a zinger in me.

724
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:40,428
- Do you ever meet a woman?
- Several knockouts per day.

725
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,523
- I see no evidence of that.
- I meet women, Jake.

726
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,499
<i>- I see no evidence of it.
- Well, I meet them.</i>

727
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,503
They usually say things
that turn me off.

728
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,766
Like she's never heard
ofTheodore Dreiser?

729
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:53,366
No. Usually some crack
about how tiny my room is.

730
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,775
- Which Joanna never cared about.
- No, she adored it.

731
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,939
<i>You arejust such a grouse.</i>

732
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,506
I'm not a grouse.
You know a grouse is a bird? I'm a grouser.

733
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:06,420
Well, stop it.
I think that this place, it is terrific.

734
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,685
You know, it's not tiny, it's cozy.

735
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,250
- I could do wondrous things with it.
- Like what?

736
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,423
- I could paint it.
- Yeah.

737
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,093
- Yeah, paint the ceiling.
- That's a start.

738
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,602
Could paint the floor.

739
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,434
<i>- Paint the floor?
- Paint it yellow.</i>

740
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,033
<i>- Paint it yellow?
- Yeah, like that van Gogh painting you like so much.</i>

741
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:30,910
She loved it. She used to say,
"We have a wonderful life."

742
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,540
We have such a wonderful life.

743
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,313
<i>After all, for her it was
a room she was passing through.</i>

744
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,980
<i>To you it's a closet you're nailed into.</i>

745
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,614
<i>Our little cave.</i>

746
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:46,458
<i>Our little prison from the world,
you and I, alone.</i>

747
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:51,092
Speak of court news, right?
Who's in, who's out.

748
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,105
<i>How does that go from King Lear...</i>

749
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,265
<i>when he talks to Cordelia,
his daughter?</i>

750
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,334
Like two creatures in a gilded cage
will say about what the world was...

751
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,414
and stuff like that.

752
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,313
How does it go? It's a cookbook.

753
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,852
- I'm getting older.
- Poor baby.

754
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,923
<i>Most men my age are having
their first heart attacks.</i>

755
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,923
They're starting to cut back.

756
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,426
You don't have to worry about heart disease.
You've never eaten well enough.

757
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,657
Harry likes cream cheese
and radish sandwiches on white bread.

758
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,326
- Oh, mercy!
- It's this city, this wretched metropolis you seem to adore.

759
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,996
<i>- It feeds me.
- It feeds on you.</i>

760
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,505
On all of us,
and it shits out the leavings...

761
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,304
which fertilize absolutely nothing.

762
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,708
- But there are places.
- Really? Where?

763
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,476
Do you have any idea what you can
still do with three dollars a week...

764
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:43,610
- in certain parts of Central America?
- No.

765
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,918
You can purchase
a 12-year-old certified virgin...

766
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,221
who will cook for you,
clean for you, revere you...

767
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,989
satisfy all your erotic needs.

768
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,658
Yes, there are still some truly
civilized places in this world.

769
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,167
- Did I hear "Central America"?
- No.

770
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,136
<i>He went down there two years ago,
stayed for two days.</i>

771
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,300
The heat was unbearable
and the so-called cuisine beneath contempt.

772
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,538
- Oh, oh, oh! Do you see that house?
- Yeah.

773
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,706
<i>That is the house where, allegedly...</i>

774
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,342
- Booth plotted the assassination of Lincoln.
- Mercy.

775
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,750
<i>- I get pains.
- Really?</i>

776
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,823
Awful pains.

777
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:23,484
- Where?
- Forget it.

778
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,861
No, please, tell me. Where?

779
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,129
No, please, tell me. Where?

780
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,856
You really wanna know?

781
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,494
I'm sitting in a chair,
and I could swear there's a tack...

782
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,904
<i>a fiery tack,
sticking right into my buttock.</i>

783
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,537
<i>As though someone took a tack,
roasted it red hot...</i>

784
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,415
<i>and put it on a chair
just so I could sit on it.</i>

785
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,588
It's like a shot just went up me.

786
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,665
Like a shot.

787
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,009
It was like a shot went up me.

788
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,610
Like a shot went right up me.

789
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,223
But I don't think that's a heart attack.

790
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,554
<i>Or I'm out on the street, walking.</i>

791
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,096
My legs start to cramp up in the back,
right above the knee...

792
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,789
<i>like a vise is grabbing me.</i>

793
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,924
I simply cannot walk.
I'd go to a doctor if I could afford it.

794
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,402
But I know it's nothing.
You think it's nothing?

795
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,066
<i>You think it's something?
What do you think? Be honest.</i>

796
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,643
You don't mind my being honest?

797
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,976
- No.
- Some people mind it.

798
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,743
Generally, I don't mind.

799
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:58,413
- Your first book's about whom, your father?
- My uncle, actually.

800
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,285
An incident in his life.

801
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,121
- And the second one's your older brother.
- No, actually, he's my friend.

802
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,196
A very close friend of mine.

803
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,924
And your next?

804
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,899
I'm thinking of this political thing
that's been on my mind.

805
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,028
<i>Apolitical thing?
Write a letter to the Times instead.</i>

806
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:19,872
<i>Then sit down and write a memoir
in third person about yourself...</i>

807
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,377
and about everybody you love and hate.

808
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,572
Don't be shy with the venom.

809
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:28,515
That's what I'd do if I were you,
which, lucky for you, I'm not.

810
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,215
Joanna told me you've taken some
extraordinary photographs of old people.

811
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:37,225
- Very old people.
- Jews without money. There are some, you know.

812
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:41,491
- I've heard.
- So, uh, are the two of you gonna get married?

813
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,589
I don't know. Maybe.

814
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,003
<i>- I'll need a bigger place.
- Why?</i>

815
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,903
<i>Sounds like fun, from what she tells me.</i>

816
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,314
- Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
- Huh?

817
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:07,015
<i>Do you think maybe you couldjust,
like, do, uh, maybe two less chips...</i>

818
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,184
per every 15-second interval?

819
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,229
I think you're in serious trouble...

820
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,028
and not primarily of a physical nature.

821
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,763
I'm a little tense because of money.

822
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,066
You're tense because of money?

823
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,073
Yes, because of money.

824
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,373
<i>But not because of the nine million cups
of coffee, the relentless womanizing...</i>

825
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:34,576
<i>the fits of anxiety, the hopeless depression,
the nocturnal tooth-gnashing...</i>

826
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,644
<i>and the utterly debilitating,
drenching sweats?</i>

827
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,225
You're just describing yourself, Jake.

828
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,420
But I function. You haven't been right
sinceJoanna skipped out on you.

829
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,987
- I've done all right.
- You have in no way "done all right."

830
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,567
Your behavior when she left
was utterly psychotic.

831
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,466
<i>I must tell you, I seriously considered
trying to have you committed.</i>

832
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,631
<i>- I was heartbroken.
- Don't give me any alibis.</i>

833
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,869
How many times did I find you sitting
in Sheridan Square Park crying your eyes out?

834
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,606
Once.

835
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,945
How many times did you stumble into my
darkroom at the club 2:00 in the morning...

836
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,950
tears streaming down your face?

837
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,418
Once. Twice.

838
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,785
Twice too often.
Wasrt fair to me either.

839
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,089
<i>There's only so much friends should
be expected to endure for friends.</i>

840
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,663
But you don't see beyond your own needs.

841
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,665
You've got a real streak of cruelty in you.

842
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,394
Probably whyJoanna left you.

843
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,801
- Do you have that table of five?
- Just coming out of the dryer.

844
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,431
Give me a hand.

845
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,602
<i>Do you, uh... Do you want to have
a drink when we close up?</i>

846
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,976
What about our boy?
Where's he?

847
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,812
I don't know. Home, I guess.

848
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,480
You sure he won't mind you
stepping out with me?

849
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,491
Maybe he should, uh, live alone.

850
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,221
That's what I keep thinking.
What do you think?

851
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,628
Well, it might solve your problem,
but it won't solve his.

852
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:59,862
- What do you mean?
- He had a well-placed agent.

853
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,838
She sold a couple of books.
He got a nice advance.

854
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,377
Somebody printed them.
These things happen.

855
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,378
<i>But they're not likely to happen again.</i>

856
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,917
<i>What I'm saying is, he probably
is not gonna get much happier...</i>

857
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,885
which brings us back to you.

858
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,889
<i>- Why?
- Why? You know why.</i>

859
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,653
A smile, I've noticed,
is your weapon of choice...

860
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,560
<i>and I don't think anybody has
the right to take it away from you.</i>

861
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,791
I was never cruel deliberately.

862
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,800
I got angry, yes...

863
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,996
<i>because living penniless
in Greenwich Village at age 42...</i>

864
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,233
was not my idea of romance
and excitement.

865
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,778
One winter she wore a coat so beat,
she had to put it on in three parts.

866
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,403
<i>She loved it. I did not like it.</i>

867
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,314
<i>To me, La Bohme was just another opera
at Lincoln Center I couldn't afford to see.</i>

868
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:51,387
Hey, come on, wait!
I didn't mean anything bad.

869
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,718
- I know.
- Am I a bad person?

870
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,793
Just 'cause I say something that gets you mad,
that doesn't make me a bad person.

871
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,123
- No, it does not.
- But I am on edge all the time.

872
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,891
I'm afraid to speak 'cause I never know
when you're going to explode.

873
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,991
<i>Come here. You know, Joanna...</i>

874
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:08,731
<i>Telling me that the day
F. Scott Fitzgerald died...</i>

875
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,273
only 40 copies of his book were sold...

876
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:15,607
<i>while today Gatsby alone sells 300,000
a year doesn't make me feel good.</i>

877
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,045
I only meant that time works things out,
and I just...

878
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:24,451
<i>I took the wrong example
for what I wanted to say.</i>

879
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,545
Why do you wear that coat?

880
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,923
<i>I mean, why do you insist
on wearing that coat?</i>

881
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:35,362
- We can't afford...
- I bet I can sew it better.

882
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:48,143
<i>Yeah, well, the bottom line is,
she wasrt happy, and now she's happy.</i>

883
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,906
Guy she's with is a palooka.

884
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,481
<i>The bottom line is, you two couldn't
make do with each other...</i>

885
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,880
and she makes do with him very well,
palooka or not...

886
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,215
<i>I suppose because she loves him.</i>

887
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,618
You don't know that.

888
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,816
- She's with him.
- You don't know that she loves him.

889
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,951
- She is with him.
- He wasrt honest with her.

890
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,962
<i>Come on.
Stop being such an ingenue.</i>

891
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,929
He wanted her. Let her go.

892
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,762
Made believe he didn't have a dime
'cause he knew...

893
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,564
that would work
on her romantic sympathies.

894
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,266
<i>Yeah, so she moved in with him,
and it turned out he had a couple ofbucks.</i>

895
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,843
- Millions.
- He didn't have millions.

896
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,742
He had hundreds of thousands,
had hidden stocks, apartments.

897
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,283
I warned her. She made him out
to be the big romantic loser.

898
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,343
He wasrt. He was a fake. He was a winner
with money and a penthouse.

899
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,618
<i>So.! And she stayed with him.
What a fool.</i>

900
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,353
<i>She could still be in that airless room
with you always raging at her.</i>

901
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:42,523
<i>I have nothing,
and I never had anything.!</i>

902
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,829
- I didn't always rage at her.
- You raged at her quite a lot.

903
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,904
Hi, honey.

904
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,874
It was real busy tonight.

905
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,613
College freshmen.
Girls with peanuts in their hair.

906
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:11,258
Jake says he's starting on a new story.

907
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,329
You shamed him.

908
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,767
I was looking for some notes
on an envelope...

909
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,896
so I couldn't find it.

910
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,474
I do like the way you put
my paintings on exhibit.

911
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,271
Everything was wedged in so tight.

912
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,347
Yeah. I can make
some attractive boxes.

913
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,916
I think that might be a good idea.

914
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,691
I can move out.

915
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:48,252
<i>There is that residence on 11 th Street
for unmarried ladies...</i>

916
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,333
little ballet dancers, things like that.

917
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,663
And just come and see you.

918
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,398
Why do we have sheets
on the windows?

919
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,441
Because, sweetheart, those old drapes
you had were falling apart.

920
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,341
So you threw them out, put up sheets?

921
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,209
<i>Why do we have to have sheets
on the windows?</i>

922
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,842
<i>Do you know what that does to me...</i>

923
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,887
<i>to have sheets on a window?</i>

924
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,752
Other people have shades.
They have drapes.

925
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,224
I have sheets!

926
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,795
Do you understand
what that makes me feel?

927
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:23,889
<i>I'm not one of them privileged brats
from Westchester...</i>

928
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,730
who thinks living down and out
in Greenwich Village is cool!

929
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,100
<i>No, I'm a grown-up.!</i>

930
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,265
- I didn't understand.
- You never do.

931
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:36,402
<i>I didn't think. Tomorrow I can go
and buy some nice shades for five dollars.</i>

932
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,308
<i>- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.</i>

933
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,909
- No.
- I really do.

934
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,716
I don't think so.

935
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,224
I didn't always rage at her. Goddamn it,
don't rag me aboutJoanna that way.

936
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,228
Do I rag you about Mavis?

937
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,766
<i>- Do I rub your nose in it? And I could.
- You couldn't.</i>

938
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,461
<i>- I wouldn't.
- You couldn't, boychik, because I am in control.</i>

939
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,470
<i>- Of whom?
- Of myself.</i>

940
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:06,770
<i>You think I'd let Mavis do to me
whatJoanna did to you?</i>

941
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:11,074
Only last week she was here
with one of her infernal curry dinners.

942
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:14,207
I pinned her to that chair
for four solid hours.

943
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,684
I heaped a load of abuse on her
so heavy and so relentless...

944
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:21,655
she finally had to crawl
out the door on all fours.

945
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,751
And I never repeated a word.
And she deserves it, you know?

946
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,457
<i>She's the one always starting
these little truth-telling sessions...</i>

947
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,557
but I finish them up, pal.

948
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,865
I feed it up to her hot and plenty.

949
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,939
I relentlessly hit her with...

950
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,941
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

951
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,511
<i>Guilty.!</i>

952
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,672
- Of what?
- She ruined my life.

953
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,717
She ruined your life?

954
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:53,778
Huh. You think I would have been
a nightclub photographer all these years...

955
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,757
if it hadrt been for her?

956
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,885
I would have been a writer.

957
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,988
<i>- I mean, I am a writer, but I would have been...
- A professional writer.</i>

958
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,794
Yes, exactly.

959
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,768
<i>The problem is,
even if you have the requisite coin...</i>

960
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,339
there really is no place to go,
is there?

961
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,465
<i>- Well...
- Come on. Let's face it, kid.</i>

962
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,770
Every place you go,
you've already been.

963
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,676
Every door you rap on
is one you just walked out of.

964
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,181
It's all the same stale hash.

965
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,547
<i>- Well...
- What kind of a life is it anyway?</i>

966
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,416
What is it, after all?
You toss and turn.

967
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:30,084
You scratch and wheeze a bit, then one
morning you wake up dead, if you're lucky.

968
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,525
<i>- Well...
- So what's the point, huh?</i>

969
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,563
I mean, there really is no point.

970
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,225
And if there is no point, and there
really isn't, then what's the point?

971
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,860
- Well...
- Oh, you see this house?

972
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,666
Hart Crane lived in that house...

973
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,054
<i>just before he committed suicide.</i>

974
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:46,336
<i>Just before he committed suicide.</i>

975
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:49,037
<i>Jake, you're the brightest...</i>

976
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,943
<i>You're certainly the most literate person
I've ever known. You are not a writer.</i>

977
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,506
<i>I'm sorry to say this.
It pains me to say it.</i>

978
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:59,418
You're a photographer,
a superb one when you wanna be.

979
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,014
But two six-page stories
do not a writer make.

980
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:06,391
- Two published stories.
- At 19. Nothing since.

981
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,954
Because she sucked the life out of me,
drained me dry.

982
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,524
<i>Took me all around the world.
Moving, moving all the time.</i>

983
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,571
<i>Endless rounds of parties.
Ships, trains, planes.</i>

984
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:19,301
<i>Made me incapable of movement now...</i>

985
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,309
<i>artistic or physical.</i>

986
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,209
<i>And you loved it.
The way you and Mavis lived in those...</i>

987
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,613
<i>You told me often enough
about the cars, the apartments...</i>

988
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,242
the hand-tailored garments,
the trips to wherever.

989
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:33,754
Okay, good. You had it.
You enjoyed it. Wonderful.

990
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:37,987
But now this wild wrinkle that you
could have been a writer if only.

991
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,494
Jake, never.
Never could have been a writer.

992
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:45,125
<i>Would you have lived the way I have lived
all these years, to be a writer, Jake?</i>

993
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,260
Oh, there we have it. Don't we?

994
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,168
- You gotta think about that.
- The magic, secret, hidden word.

995
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,264
Say it, and the duck comes down.

996
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,435
<i>- You mean I wouldn't have suffered?
- No, I don't mean that.</i>

997
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,013
Yes, you do.
You mean that exactly.

998
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,241
You mean I wouldn't have
worn your badge...

999
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,878
the merit badge of the starving bohemian
writer of old-time Greenwich Village...

1000
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,650
- Yes.
- Who, by the way, is at least 40 years out of date...

1001
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,750
and who remains only the major hero
of his decidedly minor tragicomedy.

1002
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,024
Jake, you wanna write?
There's a typewriter.

1003
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,531
<i>Turn it on.</i>

1004
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,330
<i>That's what it comes down to.</i>

1005
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,406
It's simple.

1006
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:33,315
How 'bout if I finally clear the air...

1007
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,817
and tell you exactly what I think
of this new book of yours?

1008
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,691
What?

1009
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,987
I think that it's a warning...

1010
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:49,053
a warning that you are sick, beaten
and ready to go right over the edge...

1011
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,929
which is why, as your friend,
I counsel you...

1012
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,698
Give up this game. Throw it over
and find a new one while you still can.

1013
00:57:55,805 --> 00:58:00,071
<i>Because you cannot ever...
will not ever make it in this market.</i>

1014
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,576
Are you seriously saying
I have no talent?

1015
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,647
No, I'm saying something far worse.

1016
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,239
You have no money,
and you have had no money for so long...

1017
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,546
it has seriously affected your mind.

1018
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,588
It has made hash of your soul...

1019
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,057
<i>which is why your lady love was able
to get to you so poisonously.</i>

1020
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,754
This book you wrote is the grisly proof.

1021
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,024
I don't say these things with relish.

1022
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,107
Look... Look at your shoelaces.

1023
00:58:24,142 --> 00:58:25,972
I have shoelaces.

1024
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:27,838
<i>Yes, but look at them.</i>

1025
00:58:27,944 --> 00:58:31,141
<i>Beaten, hopeless, shredding themselves
with utter despair...</i>

1026
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:33,875
<i>and shameful fatigue.</i>

1027
00:58:33,983 --> 00:58:36,315
I tie the broken pieces together because...

1028
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:39,786
<i>Because it's a major crisis
to buy a new pair.</i>

1029
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:43,120
Because you can't face the realization
that even a new pair of shoelaces...

1030
00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:45,194
means comparison shopping!

1031
00:58:47,597 --> 00:58:49,690
You're saying I look like a bag man.

1032
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,858
Who said you look like a bag man?

1033
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,636
This afternoon,
on my way to Chinatown...

1034
00:58:56,739 --> 00:59:00,402
<i>- I got thrown up against the wall...
- Up against the wall!</i>

1035
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,705
<i>By five plainclothes cops...</i>

1036
00:59:02,812 --> 00:59:04,780
<i>then dragged down to the precinct...</i>

1037
00:59:04,881 --> 00:59:07,349
<i>like a piece of Times Square sleaze...</i>

1038
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,350
because, it turns out...

1039
00:59:09,452 --> 00:59:12,148
<i>I look just like some horror...</i>

1040
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,655
who killed five people out in Queens.

1041
00:59:14,757 --> 00:59:17,225
<i>Showed me a photo.</i>

1042
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:18,918
<i>"Kind of mean,"I said.</i>

1043
00:59:19,028 --> 00:59:22,054
"Mean?" this cop says to me.

1044
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:25,532
He's practically subhuman,
and you're his twin.

1045
00:59:25,635 --> 00:59:30,265
<i>Jake, this guy
was the meanest, seediest...</i>

1046
00:59:30,373 --> 00:59:33,467
most cretinous-looking creature
I ever laid eyes on.

1047
00:59:33,576 --> 00:59:37,376
I tell ya, after I left there,
I started looking in mirrors.

1048
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,380
<i>I passed mirrors
I didn't know existed.</i>

1049
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:42,974
I got home, I started looking
in every mirror in my house.

1050
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:44,985
But mirrors lie, don't they?

1051
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:47,521
Whoever looks at himself in a mirror?

1052
00:59:47,623 --> 00:59:49,523
Pictures, they don't lie.

1053
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,253
<i>- The camera tells all.
- That's what I thought.</i>

1054
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:55,387
So I went midtown,
one of them penny arcades...

1055
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:57,693
<i>where everything
costs a buck and a half.</i>

1056
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,065
<i>Went into the photo booth there.</i>

1057
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,469
<i>You spin the stool to the right height,
flash goes on and you die.</i>

1058
01:00:05,975 --> 01:00:08,205
<i>Took my picture for hours.</i>

1059
01:00:09,645 --> 01:00:11,613
<i>Changing my hair around
different ways...</i>

1060
01:00:11,714 --> 01:00:13,306
<i>seeing what that would do.</i>

1061
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:16,317
<i>People in the arcade
thought I was absolutely nuts...</i>

1062
01:00:16,419 --> 01:00:20,253
<i>which is really saying something,
when you consider where I was.</i>

1063
01:00:20,356 --> 01:00:23,792
<i>I'm down to a buck and a half.
I simply cannot go home.</i>

1064
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:26,760
<i>So I start walking uptown.</i>

1065
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:29,423
<i>Least you're going up. Right?</i>

1066
01:00:29,532 --> 01:00:33,593
Strips and strands of these
monstrous-looking photos I just took...

1067
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:36,365
<i>hanging out of my pockets.</i>

1068
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:39,441
Have you been uptown lately, Jake?
Have you seen it?

1069
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:43,142
<i>- What happened?
- The '80s, Harry.</i>

1070
01:00:43,246 --> 01:00:45,077
<i>That's what happened.</i>

1071
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:48,776
<i>Hundreds and hundreds
of these cunning cafs...</i>

1072
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:50,785
<i>and cavernous restaurants...</i>

1073
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:54,015
<i>filled to bursting
with these bright-eyed young people...</i>

1074
01:00:54,123 --> 01:00:57,752
<i>living the high life,
laughing, feeling beautiful...</i>

1075
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,125
<i>eating salads...</i>

1076
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:03,130
<i>and looking out at me looking in...</i>

1077
01:01:03,232 --> 01:01:07,601
<i>like I was something that crawled
out of a half-opened can.</i>

1078
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:10,970
<i>So I started walking downtown.</i>

1079
01:01:11,073 --> 01:01:13,041
<i>I thought the walk would calm me.</i>

1080
01:01:13,142 --> 01:01:15,804
I got home, I was shaking.

1081
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:17,812
Jake, I was shaking.

1082
01:01:17,914 --> 01:01:22,078
<i>My whole body was shaking so bad
I had to lie down.</i>

1083
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:24,379
<i>Then I got up...</i>

1084
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:27,285
went to work and got fired...

1085
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,518
for not bowing and scraping enough.

1086
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:33,026
I mean, what the hell am I,
a monkey?

1087
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:35,620
But this guy...

1088
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:38,131
in the police photo...

1089
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:41,135
I mean,
he really had a subhuman look.

1090
01:01:41,237 --> 01:01:44,035
Whatever that means.

1091
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,199
I'm supposed to be his twin.

1092
01:01:48,144 --> 01:01:51,477
Could such a thing develop, you think?

1093
01:01:52,548 --> 01:01:54,516
I mean...

1094
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:03,924
What's happening to me, Jake?

1095
01:02:04,026 --> 01:02:08,087
What's happening is,
you're gonna be 50 before you know it...

1096
01:02:08,197 --> 01:02:10,097
and you know it.

1097
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:12,429
Not gonna have a dime,
and you know it.

1098
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:15,197
<i>Gonna bejust like Mom said...
just like Pop...</i>

1099
01:02:15,304 --> 01:02:17,204
<i>and you know it.!</i>

1100
01:02:17,306 --> 01:02:20,241
<i>And that's what's on your face.</i>

1101
01:02:20,343 --> 01:02:24,302
<i>- How much money do you need?
- More.!</i>

1102
01:02:56,879 --> 01:02:59,245
<i>The truth is, you're getting older.</i>

1103
01:02:59,348 --> 01:03:01,248
<i>I'm old already.</i>

1104
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:05,150
<i>In 10 years you'll really be older,
and I'll probably be five years dead.</i>

1105
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:07,154
<i>I don't know.</i>

1106
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:10,657
A lot of important artists
don't make it till later in life.

1107
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,660
Yeah, Europeans.

1108
01:03:12,762 --> 01:03:15,663
And one American...
Grandma Moses.

1109
01:03:15,765 --> 01:03:18,666
Should have gone to college,
gotten a degree.

1110
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:21,999
At least then you can teach something,
even if you don't know anything.

1111
01:03:22,104 --> 01:03:25,335
I always thought that business
of having something to fall back on...

1112
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:27,341
showed a real lack of obsession.

1113
01:03:27,443 --> 01:03:30,344
Listen, maybe it's not too late
to change, try something else.

1114
01:03:30,446 --> 01:03:32,346
Try advertising.

1115
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:34,348
I loathe advertising.

1116
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,351
Bunch of trendy fucks
in running clothes...

1117
01:03:37,453 --> 01:03:39,353
spreading disease and dementia.

1118
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:42,356
- Somebody has to do it.
- Not me!

1119
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:45,256
<i>Besides, I've done it.
I tried to get in. They won't let me in.</i>

1120
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:47,261
I'm too old for them.

1121
01:03:47,363 --> 01:03:50,332
What about those afternoon television dramas?
Any age limit on those writers?

1122
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:54,597
You need real, in-depth superficiality for
those things. That takes years to develop.

1123
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:57,968
How 'bout Hollywood?
Lot of gray-chested wonders out there.

1124
01:03:58,074 --> 01:04:01,976
<i>Hollywood? You can't be old out there
unless you've been young out there.</i>

1125
01:04:02,078 --> 01:04:04,569
- Besides, I have no rsum.
- No rsum?

1126
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,309
You've published two remaindered novels,
even though they can't be found...

1127
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:11,318
<i>a bunch of stories,
a couple of fellowships.</i>

1128
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,479
<i>And you've worked in 29 restaurants.</i>

1129
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:19,152
You know, all I ever really wanted to do
was write what was in my heart.

1130
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:21,661
What an unseemly idea...

1131
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:23,664
especially at your age.

1132
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:28,965
If writing what's in your heart means
writing your heart out for nothing...

1133
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:31,972
What do you want to be
in 10 years, Harry?

1134
01:04:32,074 --> 01:04:35,737
One of those brilliantly autodidactic
Greenwich Village dishwashers?

1135
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:40,111
<i>Some Bleecker Street pearl diver
with your hands in boiling-hot water...</i>

1136
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:43,447
while you mouth off
about Shaw and Proust?

1137
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:45,816
It is a possibility, you know.

1138
01:04:45,921 --> 01:04:49,379
It is out there,
looming in the distance.

1139
01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:51,983
<i>Try something else.! Anything.!</i>

1140
01:05:00,503 --> 01:05:04,234
You don't think my book
could make any dough, do you?

1141
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,174
Its entire landscape
is barren and pedestrian...

1142
01:05:08,277 --> 01:05:11,678
<i>its ensemble of players, uh...</i>

1143
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:15,511
a monumental collection
of insufferable bores.

1144
01:05:15,618 --> 01:05:17,518
I think they're colorful.

1145
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,612
<i>The originals, perhaps.
The reproductions are washed-out and dull.</i>

1146
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:23,214
Not the...
Not the two main characters though.

1147
01:05:23,325 --> 01:05:25,225
<i>No, you're right. I'm wrong.</i>

1148
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:27,557
Your two central inventions
are not boring.

1149
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:31,565
They are, nonetheless, even more
artistically defective than the others.

1150
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:34,568
- In what way?
- In that they are preposterous, unreal...

1151
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,365
and utterly contrary to nature.

1152
01:05:36,472 --> 01:05:40,101
<i>Show me. Give me an instance
where anything in the book...</i>

1153
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:44,043
is incredible or whatever you said...
contrary to nature.

1154
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:46,376
This Abraham Singer character,
for instance.

1155
01:05:46,482 --> 01:05:48,382
He lacks reality in every instance.

1156
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:52,614
He is an utterly unique character,
but he's a real character.

1157
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:56,282
He is fancy and highfalutin
and unforgivably childish.

1158
01:05:56,392 --> 01:05:59,293
I mean, this is supposed to be
a 50-year-old man?

1159
01:05:59,395 --> 01:06:01,829
How? Like no 50-year-old
I've ever come across.

1160
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:03,831
- He has a certain...
- And his sidekick!

1161
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:05,833
<i>The cretinous Mr. Morris Frankel.!</i>

1162
01:06:05,935 --> 01:06:08,233
<i>This is supposed to be
a 44-year-old man?</i>

1163
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:11,898
He talks, behaves
like a 44-month-old retard.

1164
01:06:12,007 --> 01:06:15,170
You honestly believe
any of this book really works?

1165
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:18,178
<i>- I think it works, yes.
- Well, I don't see it.</i>

1166
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,578
<i>The two characters
you supposedly based on us...</i>

1167
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:23,447
they're just such
phenomenally ludicrous buffoons!

1168
01:06:23,552 --> 01:06:26,612
Well, I simply don't see it that way, Jake.

1169
01:06:26,722 --> 01:06:29,953
Singer, my shadow figure,
there's no end to his verbal pretension.

1170
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:32,755
<i>Ohh, let me have the book, Jake.</i>

1171
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,297
Such breathy, fluffy prose
just issues from him.

1172
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:39,196
- I would like my book back.
- What made you think you could get away with it?

1173
01:06:39,301 --> 01:06:41,633
<i>- It works. - What
made you... - It works.</i>

1174
01:06:41,737 --> 01:06:44,797
It does not work!

1175
01:06:49,612 --> 01:06:54,140
I mean, this guy is such
a fluffy, blowing, complaining...

1176
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,549
endlessly breathy, postprandial fart!

1177
01:06:57,653 --> 01:06:59,450
<i>A- Am I like that?</i>

1178
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:01,989
Who knows?
Maybe I am. I don't know.

1179
01:07:02,091 --> 01:07:04,389
A- And this other nitwit...
your character.

1180
01:07:04,493 --> 01:07:07,394
What an ingenue.
So much gushing and simpering.

1181
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:10,056
"We sat in the bagel caf...

1182
01:07:10,165 --> 01:07:12,326
<i>"speaking of art and literature...</i>

1183
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:15,198
<i>"of Henry Miller and Anais Nin
in Paris.</i>

1184
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:17,829
"We began to chew each other's fingers...

1185
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,033
"and through her fingers,
through the cream cheese...

1186
01:07:20,142 --> 01:07:22,042
I could feel her temperature rising."

1187
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:25,375
What is that? Is that art? Is it sex?

1188
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:27,813
Is it kosher cuisine, or a house call?

1189
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:29,884
Have you no shame?

1190
01:07:31,186 --> 01:07:34,087
Do you know, I actually thought, Jake...

1191
01:07:34,189 --> 01:07:36,248
that you would be, uh...

1192
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:40,920
- What?
- Touched by the two of us.

1193
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:44,656
Amused, even. Pleased.

1194
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,500
You trot me out as some pompous,
coffee-house phony...

1195
01:07:49,605 --> 01:07:52,130
some gaseous, abject failure...

1196
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:55,176
and you thought I would be
touched, amused, pleased?

1197
01:07:55,277 --> 01:07:58,007
Well, I don't see it that way,
so maybe, uh...

1198
01:07:58,113 --> 01:08:00,911
You don't see it that way because
that would require a little empathy.

1199
01:08:01,016 --> 01:08:02,881
You're saying I have no empathy?

1200
01:08:02,985 --> 01:08:05,215
You are a pathological hypochondriac...

1201
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:08,586
meaning, you are completely
and utterly self-obsessed.

1202
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:10,921
I'm not pathological.

1203
01:08:11,026 --> 01:08:14,393
<i>You are probably without parallel
in the Encyclopedia of Abnormal Psychology.</i>

1204
01:08:14,496 --> 01:08:16,088
<i>- Not true.
- Not true?</i>

1205
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:19,099
<i>How about the time you nearly
drove me crazy for a month...</i>

1206
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:22,864
<i>worrying whether you were gonna die
because your father had high blood pressure.</i>

1207
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:25,872
<i>Went out and bought
that ridiculous blood pressure machine...</i>

1208
01:08:25,974 --> 01:08:28,875
<i>took your blood pressure all night
till it was above normal.</i>

1209
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:32,606
<i>Then you came in here the next day with
blotches all over your arm from the cuff...</i>

1210
01:08:32,715 --> 01:08:35,616
<i>and thinking it was
some kind of red gangrene.</i>

1211
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:39,085
- My father did develop high blood pressure.
- When he was 82!

1212
01:08:39,188 --> 01:08:42,089
A- A-And the cancer of the knuckle?

1213
01:08:42,191 --> 01:08:44,284
- The knuckle cancer?
- Ehhh.

1214
01:08:44,393 --> 01:08:48,591
We spent the whole weekend looking
for a knuckle specialist... a "knuckelist"?

1215
01:08:48,697 --> 01:08:52,394
<i>Oh, oh, oh, and the cancer of the palm?</i>

1216
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:55,766
- It kept growing.
- It was a callus!

1217
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:58,772
Jesus Christ, if I had 1/10th
of your physical stamina...

1218
01:08:58,874 --> 01:09:02,571
I would have risen above every obstacle
to become a truly great novelist.

1219
01:09:02,678 --> 01:09:05,146
- What an alibi.
- Alibi? Ali...

1220
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:09,650
Tolstoy, when he was 80,
could run a mile at full clip.

1221
01:09:09,752 --> 01:09:11,652
- It's right there in the letters.
- Well...

1222
01:09:11,754 --> 01:09:13,654
There is no art without sinew.

1223
01:09:13,756 --> 01:09:16,156
Nothing's seriously wrong
with your health, Jake.

1224
01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:19,159
I am dying on my feet.

1225
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:22,162
I am rotting in my slipper socks.

1226
01:09:22,264 --> 01:09:25,165
And you, you... you're perfect.
You're perfect.

1227
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:27,167
You walk through the streets...

1228
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:30,170
dragging yourself around
like some haunted shadow figure...

1229
01:09:30,272 --> 01:09:32,433
from some Dostoyevskian
netherworld.

1230
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,533
But it's all a phony romantic pose.

1231
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:39,045
<i>Empathy? Your own brother, when he reads
this book, he'll never speak to you again.</i>

1232
01:09:39,148 --> 01:09:41,048
<i>And you don't give a damn.</i>

1233
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,516
<i>- He'll get over it.
- And will I?</i>

1234
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:46,383
Suppose I told you I would
never speak to you again.

1235
01:09:46,488 --> 01:09:48,956
I can't imagine that.

1236
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:53,460
It never occurred to you
that I might feel...

1237
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:56,725
maligned, damaged, betrayed?

1238
01:09:56,832 --> 01:10:00,495
<i>Jake, you knew right from the start
this book featured our lives.</i>

1239
01:10:00,602 --> 01:10:02,467
You were forever asking me...

1240
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:05,165
- So, how's that book coming?
- What book is that, honey?

1241
01:10:05,274 --> 01:10:07,799
Oh, he's writing a valentine
to the two of us.

1242
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,310
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I don't understand that.

1243
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:15,179
It's a jokey little novel with a couple
of nutty Greenwich Village types.

1244
01:10:15,284 --> 01:10:18,981
- Based on the two of you?
- Well, so he claims, but he'll never capture the real me.

1245
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:22,079
Is this to be one of
your more humorous efforts?

1246
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:25,092
Uh, well, uh, maybe. I hope so.

1247
01:10:25,194 --> 01:10:27,094
I'm in it.

1248
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:30,256
I'm a struggling artist who lives with
her boyfriend, a very struggling writer.

1249
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:32,424
<i>Really? You've seen it?</i>

1250
01:10:32,534 --> 01:10:35,094
- I've seen him writing it.
- And me.

1251
01:10:35,204 --> 01:10:38,071
- Am I in it?
- Uh...

1252
01:10:39,274 --> 01:10:41,538
<i>It could be arranged.</i>

1253
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:43,611
- Oh, I wanna be in it. Please!
- Okay.

1254
01:10:43,712 --> 01:10:45,543
Harry, how would you portray me?

1255
01:10:45,647 --> 01:10:47,945
Well, how would you
want to be portrayed, Mav?

1256
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,847
As your anchor.

1257
01:10:49,952 --> 01:10:52,921
<i>Uh, make her my lead weight.</i>

1258
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:55,751
But I never dreamed... I mean...

1259
01:10:57,593 --> 01:10:59,561
What?

1260
01:11:00,796 --> 01:11:03,458
Things you said, things you quoted...

1261
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:06,466
things you had no license,
no right to quote...

1262
01:11:06,568 --> 01:11:08,058
Like what?

1263
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:12,470
Personal things
about my mother and my father...

1264
01:11:12,574 --> 01:11:14,474
that miserable Bronx apartment...

1265
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:20,105
<i>the illnesses I suffered as a child
and the mark they left on me later...</i>

1266
01:11:20,215 --> 01:11:23,343
<i>that whole passage about
my mother screaming in agony...</i>

1267
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:27,388
<i>as, night after night,
my father ravished her...</i>

1268
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:31,255
<i>the whole shameful incident when she
threw my books out the window.</i>

1269
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,225
My books.

1270
01:11:33,328 --> 01:11:36,991
<i>How I had to leave school at 15,
the school that I loved so much...</i>

1271
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:40,432
<i>to go to work in that Copa darkroom...</i>

1272
01:11:40,536 --> 01:11:43,937
<i>making more money a week
than my old man.</i>

1273
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:49,366
Things that I said to you
in... in passing...

1274
01:11:49,478 --> 01:11:52,174
in... in private.

1275
01:11:52,281 --> 01:11:55,842
I mean, how do you even remember
those things so exactly?

1276
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:58,442
I have a talent for that kind of thing.

1277
01:11:58,554 --> 01:12:00,454
You have a talent.

1278
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:03,457
You have a talent
to be a court stenographer.

1279
01:12:03,559 --> 01:12:05,459
You stole my life!

1280
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:09,156
How do I steal your li... How can
someone do that? L-I don't understand.

1281
01:12:09,264 --> 01:12:12,165
<i>I don't know. How do you do it?
What, do you wear a wire?</i>

1282
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:15,794
Are you wired now? Do I read everything
I said tonight in your next draft?

1283
01:12:15,938 --> 01:12:19,135
How could I steal
what really happened?

1284
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:22,142
You sanctimonious hypocrite!
I could wring your goddamn neck!

1285
01:12:22,244 --> 01:12:26,305
You'll throw anybody and everybody
to the dogs to make a quick buck.

1286
01:12:26,415 --> 01:12:28,610
No. No, no.
There were two motives here.

1287
01:12:28,717 --> 01:12:31,618
<i>The first was quick profit.
The second was to punish everybody...</i>

1288
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,621
What is all this "profit" business?
What are you talking about?

1289
01:12:34,723 --> 01:12:36,714
Nobody's read the damn thing but you.

1290
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:39,726
We don't know that anyone's
gonna publish it, now, do we?

1291
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:42,729
When a cagey writer squeezes out
this kind of salacious shit...

1292
01:12:42,831 --> 01:12:45,163
there's always somebody
who'll rush to put it on paper.

1293
01:12:45,267 --> 01:12:47,030
Salacious. How is it salacious?

1294
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:49,695
You got Greenwich Village
sex and mayhem...

1295
01:12:49,805 --> 01:12:52,433
<i>intimate, devastating family relationships...</i>

1296
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:54,736
<i>And... and more Greenwich Village
sex and mayhem.</i>

1297
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:58,370
- And?
- And nothing. You know what you wrote.

1298
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,972
Are you saying you think
I could make money with this book?

1299
01:13:02,084 --> 01:13:04,143
Well, there's always that possibility.

1300
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:06,720
- How much?
- Eight zillion dollars.

1301
01:13:06,822 --> 01:13:08,722
What am I, the oracle at Delphi?

1302
01:13:08,824 --> 01:13:13,056
So you're saying you think I might have
actually written a popular book here?

1303
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:15,061
<i>Well, it's trashy, isn't it?</i>

1304
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:18,064
So naturally there's a possibility
of popularity.

1305
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,566
<i>So, why should I go into advertising...</i>

1306
01:13:20,669 --> 01:13:24,969
to keep from winding up a Greenwich Village
dishwasher, a Bleecker Street pearl diver?

1307
01:13:25,073 --> 01:13:27,041
Why?

1308
01:13:29,044 --> 01:13:32,275
<i>- I would like you to withdraw this book.
- Oh, that's fancy talk.</i>

1309
01:13:32,381 --> 01:13:35,544
Withdraw it from what? From whom?

1310
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:37,209
From contention.

1311
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:39,082
It's not in contention.

1312
01:13:39,187 --> 01:13:41,917
- Well, it will be.
- I certainly hope so.

1313
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:45,619
<i>But do you think that the few pennies
you'll make from this...</i>

1314
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,628
will make up for all the pain
that it'll cause if it comes out?

1315
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,630
Pain?

1316
01:13:50,732 --> 01:13:53,633
I'm walking around
with $1.50 to my name, Jake.

1317
01:13:53,735 --> 01:13:56,203
- No, there are other concerns.
- To other people, sure.

1318
01:13:56,304 --> 01:14:00,070
<i>Look, all I'm saying is, just wait
a little longer to become successful.</i>

1319
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:04,543
But I'm walking around with $1.50!

1320
01:14:04,646 --> 01:14:07,911
You have held out this long.
You can hold out a little longer.

1321
01:14:08,016 --> 01:14:10,917
For the last, what is it,
hour and a half...

1322
01:14:11,019 --> 01:14:13,886
all you've been telling me,
if I'm hearing correctly...

1323
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:16,617
is stop everything
and go after the money.

1324
01:14:16,725 --> 01:14:18,716
- But not this way.
- Not what way?

1325
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:20,590
Not... cynically!

1326
01:14:20,696 --> 01:14:23,062
Oh. I should go into advertising.

1327
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,059
Jake, you really take my breath away.

1328
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:30,832
I mean, with all your heart you believe
there's only one way to make money.

1329
01:14:30,939 --> 01:14:33,567
<i>- Oh? Oh? What way is that?
- Any way.</i>

1330
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:36,667
- No. I don't subscribe to that.
- Why? Because of principles?

1331
01:14:36,778 --> 01:14:40,339
<i>- Precisely.
- But you have no principles. Where are they?</i>

1332
01:14:40,449 --> 01:14:44,351
From the moment you started reading this book,
you knew I could do something with it.

1333
01:14:44,453 --> 01:14:47,980
- And what did you do? You tried to talk me out of it.
- Because of the damage you'd do.

1334
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:50,354
Oh, you are such a liar, Jake!

1335
01:14:50,459 --> 01:14:53,155
<i>- A li...
- I never knew that about you, that you are such a liar.!</i>

1336
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:58,631
I thought you were crazy, I thought you
were contrary, unduly critical at times...

1337
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:03,137
<i>but I believed everything you said
had weight and was truthful.</i>

1338
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:05,138
But you lie, Jake. You lie.

1339
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,301
You lied tonight. You lied about what
you thought my book's chances might be.

1340
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:13,108
You lied about having read it.

1341
01:15:13,215 --> 01:15:16,673
- You lied, probably, about what you thought of it too.
- Absolutely not! No, no, no.

1342
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:20,482
Aside from anything else...
anything else... it's lousy writing!

1343
01:15:20,589 --> 01:15:23,490
- It's the best thing I've ever written.
- No. It's lousy.

1344
01:15:23,592 --> 01:15:26,720
- It may be the best thing I'm ever gonna write, Jake.
- But it's no good!

1345
01:15:26,828 --> 01:15:29,319
<i>- What's your stake in that?
- Stake?</i>

1346
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:31,831
<i>- Don't flatter yourself. I have no stake.
- Oh, no?</i>

1347
01:15:31,933 --> 01:15:35,869
I mean, it just...
i- i-it offends my sensibilities.

1348
01:15:35,971 --> 01:15:37,871
It's shoddy workmanship, that's all.

1349
01:15:37,973 --> 01:15:41,238
- I like it.
- Sure, you like it. You think you'll make money with it.

1350
01:15:41,343 --> 01:15:43,243
<i>No, no. I love the book.</i>

1351
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:46,178
I love what it's about.
I love the people in it.

1352
01:15:46,281 --> 01:15:49,182
Even the people I don't love, I love,
but not as much as the people I love.

1353
01:15:49,284 --> 01:15:51,343
And you think you'll make money with it!

1354
01:15:51,453 --> 01:15:53,853
<i>No, you think I'll make money with it!</i>

1355
01:15:53,955 --> 01:15:57,118
That's your problem, that I might make m...
I'd like to make money with it.

1356
01:15:57,225 --> 01:16:00,991
I hope I make money with it. I'd enjoy
making money with it. I did not set out to m...

1357
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:04,588
And what difference would it make,
in any case, if I did?

1358
01:16:04,699 --> 01:16:10,228
It would mean that you had deliberately
set out to profit from other people's pain!

1359
01:16:12,808 --> 01:16:14,708
You prove it.

1360
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,745
You say something like that...
prove it.

1361
01:16:17,846 --> 01:16:20,280
- I don't have to prove anything.
- No, you have to prove it.

1362
01:16:22,117 --> 01:16:24,347
You see this? This is film.

1363
01:16:24,452 --> 01:16:27,853
This is negative.
I can turn this into positive.

1364
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:29,856
Proof positive. Proofs.

1365
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:33,086
<i>Is that a play on words?
Am I a sophist? Do I give a shit?</i>

1366
01:16:33,195 --> 01:16:35,595
No! Here, you prove everything.

1367
01:16:35,697 --> 01:16:38,689
But if you could prove it, Jake...
That's all I'm saying.

1368
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,700
If you could prove it.

1369
01:16:40,802 --> 01:16:45,535
- Prove what?
- That I wrote this book with malicious profit in my heart.

1370
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:50,703
<i>If you could prove that, and prove it
with an argument that I could swallow...</i>

1371
01:16:50,812 --> 01:16:52,939
Not all this wind...
something of substance.

1372
01:16:53,048 --> 01:16:54,640
Yeah? Then?

1373
01:16:54,749 --> 01:16:59,083
Then I would take this manuscript
and burn it.

1374
01:16:59,187 --> 01:17:01,883
<i>I would burn it.</i>

1375
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,890
I'd walk on the ashes.

1376
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:07,928
But you gotta hold up your end.
You gotta convi... What are you doing?

1377
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:10,930
I'm trying to keep my hands and eyes busy...

1378
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:13,933
because what's left of my brain knows
there's nothing won'th listening to.

1379
01:17:14,069 --> 01:17:17,232
All right,
I did not write this book...

1380
01:17:17,339 --> 01:17:19,807
with malicious profit in my heart...

1381
01:17:19,908 --> 01:17:22,240
nor did I write this book
to make money.

1382
01:17:22,344 --> 01:17:26,508
But I'll tell you something,
if it's got anything... anything at all...

1383
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:30,642
I will do whatever I can to push it...

1384
01:17:30,752 --> 01:17:33,243
to shove it, to move it out...

1385
01:17:33,355 --> 01:17:37,985
because I cannot live this way, Jake,
a day longer...

1386
01:17:38,093 --> 01:17:41,585
<i>a moment longer
than I absolutely have to.</i>

1387
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:43,357
I cannot, Jake!

1388
01:17:43,465 --> 01:17:47,663
<i>- And how do you want to live, in a word?
- In a word?</i>

1389
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:52,070
How do I want to live, in a word?
Space.

1390
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,141
I want space.

1391
01:17:56,778 --> 01:18:01,272
Do you know there are nights I make
and unmake my convertible bed...

1392
01:18:01,383 --> 01:18:03,180
<i>half a dozen times?</i>

1393
01:18:03,285 --> 01:18:07,016
<i>I go out, I come in a dozen times a night.
It's the room.</i>

1394
01:18:07,122 --> 01:18:09,352
<i>- Everything's a room.
- Oh, no. No, Jake.</i>

1395
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:14,060
You don't understand.
It is no longer a room to me.

1396
01:18:14,162 --> 01:18:17,131
It has become, for me,
an oppression.

1397
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,469
I can't fix it up.

1398
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:24,470
I can't sand it down.
I can't paint over it.

1399
01:18:24,572 --> 01:18:27,473
I simply cannot live in it anymore.

1400
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:31,033
Half the people in the world
would kill for your room.

1401
01:18:31,146 --> 01:18:33,046
Any room.

1402
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:35,048
I know that, Jake.

1403
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,550
<i>I see 'em every day on the street.</i>

1404
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:41,053
<i>- It's got nothing to do with me.
- Why? Because you call yourself"artist"?</i>

1405
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:44,057
<i>You wanna know where I've been
the last four weeks? I'm gonna tell you.</i>

1406
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,150
I've been with a girl.

1407
01:18:46,261 --> 01:18:50,027
<i>First girl sinceJoanna. A golden girl
from the golden West. Now she's gone.</i>

1408
01:18:50,131 --> 01:18:52,565
Bimbos tend to be fleet of foot.

1409
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:55,761
She's not a bimbo. She's an interesting
person. I met her in the library.

1410
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,667
<i>What, she was looking
for references?</i>

1411
01:18:57,772 --> 01:19:03,039
<i>She told me she was here in New York
on a desperate, last-ditch search for fiber.</i>

1412
01:19:03,144 --> 01:19:06,944
<i>- But she didn't really use those words.
- She did. Something like that.</i>

1413
01:19:07,048 --> 01:19:09,949
<i>She stayed with me in my room
for almost five weeks...</i>

1414
01:19:10,051 --> 01:19:14,317
<i>and then one day she said, "Listen, honey,
I think you're swell in a lot of ways...</i>

1415
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:17,755
<i>but how much fiber
can one person stomach?"</i>

1416
01:19:17,859 --> 01:19:21,090
<i>She told me I was destined
to be poor the rest of my life.</i>

1417
01:19:21,196 --> 01:19:23,096
It was a neurotic sickness with me.

1418
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,635
<i>She said I was always gonna live this way...
in a room without sun...</i>

1419
01:19:27,736 --> 01:19:29,636
because I had the habit.

1420
01:19:29,738 --> 01:19:32,798
<i>Told me I looked cute enough
under a thin sheet...</i>

1421
01:19:32,907 --> 01:19:35,808
but that every time
she saw me in clothes...

1422
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:39,311
a stronger wedge
was driven between us...

1423
01:19:39,414 --> 01:19:42,315
that no amount of sexual frenzy
on her part...

1424
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:45,875
could make up for
the lack of wardrobe on mine.

1425
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:48,888
<i>Told me the first time
she saw me walk into the library...</i>

1426
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,153
<i>she thought I might be a bag man
coming in from the weather.</i>

1427
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:57,493
She said, "Harry, how are you gonna be
a successful writer without the clothes?

1428
01:19:57,599 --> 01:20:00,500
<i>Harry, how are you gonna win
without the clothes?"</i>

1429
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:03,435
<i>She said,
"Harry, I don't think you wanna win,"</i>

1430
01:20:03,538 --> 01:20:06,405
<i>this girl from L.A.</i>

1431
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:09,477
Last thing she said to me
before she left...

1432
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:14,640
<i>She took my hand gently, she looked
into my eyes tenderly, she said, "Harry..."</i>

1433
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:17,741
Harry, I love you.

1434
01:20:19,187 --> 01:20:21,246
I really do love you.

1435
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:26,685
Get some money.

1436
01:20:31,866 --> 01:20:34,767
But what she said or didn't say
doesn't matter.

1437
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:36,996
<i>- But she...
- The only thing that matters...</i>

1438
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:40,336
<i>She said what you've been saying for the
last hour and a half. That's what she said.</i>

1439
01:20:40,442 --> 01:20:43,002
Yeah, but she's as much of a fraud
as I am, right?

1440
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:45,705
No! She's right, Jake. Look at me.

1441
01:20:45,814 --> 01:20:49,545
<i>I'm no 18-year-old with a street guide
of Greenwich Village in my mitt...</i>

1442
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:51,551
and a six-pack ofTrojans in my wallet...

1443
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:54,144
trying to nickel-and-dime it
on Pepsi and pizza.

1444
01:20:54,255 --> 01:20:58,555
Look at me!
I'm a middle-aged man.

1445
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:02,323
I mean, suppose I get sick.
I mean, really sick.

1446
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,796
Where do I go? Public clinic?

1447
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:07,459
<i>Clogged to suffocation.</i>

1448
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:10,561
You're dead from the delay before they
ever get around to maltreating you.

1449
01:21:10,672 --> 01:21:13,573
I gotta think of things like...
I'm of an age!

1450
01:21:13,675 --> 01:21:16,610
<i>I gotta stop kidding myself,
romancing my...</i>

1451
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:18,838
<i>You're right, I kid myself,Jake.</i>

1452
01:21:18,947 --> 01:21:20,744
That's my whole thing with the Chinese.

1453
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:23,750
<i>Kicking the old gong around
down there in Chinatown...</i>

1454
01:21:23,852 --> 01:21:25,877
<i>while the world passes me by...</i>

1455
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:28,888
kidding myself
I'm somehow part of the spirit...

1456
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:31,891
that no one's judging me down there
for my money...

1457
01:21:31,993 --> 01:21:35,895
when the truth is that every time I walk into
one of those joints down on Mott Street...

1458
01:21:35,997 --> 01:21:39,296
it's strictly the price of the beverage
that counts.

1459
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,334
That's all I'm judged for!

1460
01:21:41,436 --> 01:21:45,930
<i>Because I couldn't squeeze
a single drop of that dark brown juice...</i>

1461
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,201
out of my exotic Oriental chums...

1462
01:21:48,309 --> 01:21:50,209
if I didn't have the coppers.

1463
01:21:53,114 --> 01:21:54,877
Joanna... same thing.

1464
01:21:54,983 --> 01:21:57,178
<i>Lived with me
for six and a half years...</i>

1465
01:21:57,285 --> 01:21:59,947
but when she walked,
she walked upstairs.

1466
01:22:00,054 --> 01:22:03,046
<i>She does live in a penthouse.
I don't fault her.</i>

1467
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:07,356
She's a nice girl. More than that,
she is the love of my life.

1468
01:22:07,462 --> 01:22:11,364
<i>But she did not leave me
for another basement.!</i>

1469
01:22:14,402 --> 01:22:17,894
Call it all the sour grapes you want,
Jake, and a lot of it is...

1470
01:22:18,006 --> 01:22:21,908
but I'll tell you something...
I put in the time...

1471
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:24,979
and an awful lot of it
my best time.

1472
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:31,074
I still don't have
five fucking bucks in hand!

1473
01:22:35,023 --> 01:22:37,924
And unless I somehow...

1474
01:22:38,026 --> 01:22:40,859
manage to recut the stone...

1475
01:22:40,962 --> 01:22:45,365
it does look like I'm slated to go
out of here without a dime.

1476
01:22:46,935 --> 01:22:49,199
Just like Mom and Pop.

1477
01:22:49,304 --> 01:22:51,772
Because I got the zinger in me, boy.

1478
01:22:51,873 --> 01:22:53,773
Well, that's hardly news.

1479
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:56,639
<i>No, no, I don't mean the one
you're talking about.</i>

1480
01:22:56,744 --> 01:22:58,644
I don't mean romantically.

1481
01:22:58,746 --> 01:23:01,772
I'm talking about the one you're born with.
You know the one I mean.

1482
01:23:01,883 --> 01:23:05,250
<i>Or you should know.
The one in there.</i>

1483
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:08,187
Deep down.

1484
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:12,055
The one that keeps telling you
over and over and over again...

1485
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,723
that no matter what you do,
how hard you try, how long you go at it...

1486
01:23:17,832 --> 01:23:23,327
<i>that nothing good can ever, will ever,
should ever happen for you.</i>

1487
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:26,339
<i>And unless I do something...</i>

1488
01:23:26,441 --> 01:23:30,639
<i>to dissolve it...
this thing, this zinger...</i>

1489
01:23:30,745 --> 01:23:32,645
to waste it...

1490
01:23:32,747 --> 01:23:36,444
<i>and unless I do it now,
while I'm able...</i>

1491
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:39,315
<i>it's gonna waste me, Jake.!</i>

1492
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,684
<i>It is gonna kill me.</i>

1493
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:46,158
It is gonna kill everything good
around me, Jake.

1494
01:23:47,395 --> 01:23:49,363
<i>That I know.</i>

1495
01:23:50,999 --> 01:23:54,696
<i>And the one thing I have that
can maybe make the difference...</i>

1496
01:23:54,802 --> 01:23:56,497
I have right here.

1497
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:59,164
And you wanna take it away from me?

1498
01:23:59,274 --> 01:24:01,174
<i>Why?</i>

1499
01:24:01,276 --> 01:24:04,734
<i>Because you're upset.
Because you're angry.</i>

1500
01:24:04,846 --> 01:24:08,509
Because maybe you're a little jealous.

1501
01:24:11,085 --> 01:24:14,145
<i>- This is nothing but sentimental drivel.
- It's drivel?</i>

1502
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:16,155
- Yes.
- What do you mean, drivel?

1503
01:24:16,257 --> 01:24:19,351
- You stole my life.
- I stole your life?

1504
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:23,226
And no amount of overwrought
rationalization will alter that fact.

1505
01:24:23,331 --> 01:24:25,231
I did not steal your life, Jake.

1506
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:28,268
I merely put it to some imaginative use.

1507
01:24:28,369 --> 01:24:30,496
Shouldrt I have first crack at that?

1508
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:33,699
I thought that's what you had
for 50 years!

1509
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:53,286
Jake, isn't this all because I did it?

1510
01:24:54,429 --> 01:24:56,920
<i>I mean, I was actually able...</i>

1511
01:24:57,031 --> 01:24:59,124
to write this book?

1512
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:02,691
And if that's the case, Jake,
and I think it is...

1513
01:25:04,405 --> 01:25:06,373
then I understand.

1514
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:09,643
I sympathize.

1515
01:25:11,245 --> 01:25:13,213
I empathize with you.

1516
01:25:14,582 --> 01:25:18,143
But I simply cannot
do anything about it.

1517
01:25:20,755 --> 01:25:25,192
I'm not gonna change a word of it
or withdraw it.

1518
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:28,854
How could I do a thing like that
if it meant hurting the book?

1519
01:25:28,963 --> 01:25:30,931
<i>Would you?</i>

1520
01:25:33,267 --> 01:25:35,132
Would you?

1521
01:25:38,773 --> 01:25:43,176
I never meant to wrong you, Jake...

1522
01:25:43,277 --> 01:25:46,371
or to hurt you, to use you, ever.

1523
01:25:46,481 --> 01:25:48,449
I mean, that's a given.

1524
01:25:51,419 --> 01:25:53,751
I just...

1525
01:25:53,855 --> 01:25:57,814
I don't know how to put things right with you,
Jake. I just don't know how to do it.

1526
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,028
Get out of here.

1527
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:05,631
- Okay.
- I mean it, Harry. Get out of here.

1528
01:26:05,733 --> 01:26:07,860
- But I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

1529
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:10,301
Completely finished. Out.

1530
01:26:14,075 --> 01:26:17,135
We both know nothing's
gonna happen with this book.

1531
01:26:17,245 --> 01:26:19,145
It won't make a dime, Jake.

1532
01:26:19,247 --> 01:26:22,148
I meant what I said, Harry.
I want you out of here.

1533
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:26,016
<i>But if the miracle occurs and something...
anything should happen...</i>

1534
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,521
you don't think I'd take care of you?

1535
01:26:29,624 --> 01:26:32,855
That I would share with you?
I would put that in writing.

1536
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,860
Now you wanna pay me?

1537
01:26:34,962 --> 01:26:37,726
- It's not a payment.
- No, it's a payoff.

1538
01:26:37,832 --> 01:26:40,733
- No, it's not, Jake. What are you talking about?
- No, come on. Come on!

1539
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:43,736
- I want you out of here!
- It's for whatever you regard as your material.

1540
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,635
I don't want your money!

1541
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,402
I don't want your scummy money!
Get out!

1542
01:26:48,509 --> 01:26:51,410
- Why is it now scummy?
- Get out!

1543
01:26:57,084 --> 01:27:00,053
I hope you're not gonna
get violent, Jake.

1544
01:27:02,089 --> 01:27:03,989
Uh, I'll take my manuscript.

1545
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:06,821
You want your manuscript?

1546
01:27:06,928 --> 01:27:10,364
Here! Here's your manuscript!
Go ahead! Take it!

1547
01:27:10,465 --> 01:27:14,367
- That's very gracious of you.
- Don't bother to pick up your trash. I'll take care of it.

1548
01:27:14,469 --> 01:27:16,767
You'll find it
in your garbage can tomorrow.

1549
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:19,362
- I've got another copy.
- You're such a dog.

1550
01:27:19,474 --> 01:27:22,272
No, no, not even, because a dog
is mars best friend.

1551
01:27:22,376 --> 01:27:24,276
You're your best friend's worst enemy.

1552
01:27:24,378 --> 01:27:26,346
Best friend, Jake?

1553
01:27:28,082 --> 01:27:30,983
Jake, I don't think we were ever friends.

1554
01:27:31,085 --> 01:27:32,985
Were you my friend tonight?

1555
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:35,180
There's nothing in your heart
but money.

1556
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:37,223
Everything on the block's for sale.

1557
01:27:37,325 --> 01:27:40,226
- Only the goods.
- Ha! Who told you you had the goods?

1558
01:27:40,328 --> 01:27:42,728
- Who do you think?
- You don't have the goods.

1559
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:45,128
You only have the spoils.

1560
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:47,201
Whatever.

1561
01:27:49,237 --> 01:27:51,762
At least I'm not shaking anymore.

1562
01:28:13,861 --> 01:28:14,910
How you doing, Levine?

1563
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:15,960
How you doing, Levine?

1564
01:28:16,063 --> 01:28:19,328
<i>You don't have to answer. I know
how you're doing. You're doing terribly.</i>

1565
01:28:19,433 --> 01:28:22,800
<i>Come on. Sit down, pull up a waitress
and let's talk things over.</i>

1566
01:28:22,904 --> 01:28:26,271
- How'd you know it was me?
- Oh, I'd spot you in a million.

1567
01:28:26,374 --> 01:28:28,274
Yeah?

1568
01:28:28,376 --> 01:28:30,367
Like looking into
my own cracked mirror.

1569
01:28:30,478 --> 01:28:33,504
You've got despair scratched
all over your New York mug.

1570
01:29:40,915 --> 01:29:43,713
- Hello, kid.
- Hello, Barney.

1571
01:29:43,818 --> 01:29:46,013
- Good to see you, mate.
- You too.

1572
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:49,248
How about a drink?
Coffee? A little seltzer?

1573
01:29:49,357 --> 01:29:51,416
Uh, a seltzer'd be fine.

1574
01:29:54,328 --> 01:29:57,661
Lovely note you sent me.
I was very flattered.

1575
01:29:57,765 --> 01:30:01,724
Oh. Those poems were great, Barney.

1576
01:30:01,836 --> 01:30:05,033
<i>I was flattered you sent 'em to me.
They should be in print.</i>

1577
01:30:05,139 --> 01:30:07,539
<i>The Atlantic's publishing
the one about my father.</i>

1578
01:30:07,642 --> 01:30:09,507
Oh. That's a beautiful poem.

1579
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:12,875
- I worked on it six months.
- It shows.

1580
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:15,676
And some obscure and foolish press...

1581
01:30:15,783 --> 01:30:18,752
wants to republish my book
of sea poems.

1582
01:30:18,853 --> 01:30:22,220
Should've never gone out of print, those poems.

1583
01:30:24,325 --> 01:30:27,226
Barney, any work around here?

1584
01:30:27,328 --> 01:30:30,957
<i>They're always looking for waitresses
that don't wanna make any money.</i>

1585
01:30:31,065 --> 01:30:32,965
I mean for me.

1586
01:30:33,067 --> 01:30:35,968
<i>Oh. Well...</i>

1587
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:37,970
There is something as of last night.

1588
01:30:38,072 --> 01:30:40,131
- Really?
- But I don't know if you'd want it.

1589
01:30:40,241 --> 01:30:43,369
W- Why? Is it porter?

1590
01:30:43,477 --> 01:30:45,570
- Not quite.
- Washing dishes?

1591
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,773
<i>- That's all we have at the moment.
- Could I get it?</i>

1592
01:30:47,882 --> 01:30:49,747
Sure, you could get it. But...

1593
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:52,444
<i>- But what?
- Washing dishes?</i>

1594
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:56,455
You got two book jackets
on the wall of dishonor.

1595
01:30:56,557 --> 01:30:58,491
<i>- Is that what you call it?
- Yeah.</i>

1596
01:30:58,592 --> 01:31:01,493
- I'm on it.
- Well, then I'm in good company.

1597
01:31:01,595 --> 01:31:03,495
Ah.

1598
01:31:03,597 --> 01:31:07,624
- So, who would I see for this?
- Show up about 4:00 and talk to Lester.

1599
01:31:07,735 --> 01:31:09,635
- Oh, that's good.
- If you want it.

1600
01:31:12,006 --> 01:31:13,974
I want it.

1601
01:31:14,075 --> 01:31:18,307
So, uh... what do I owe you?

1602
01:31:18,412 --> 01:31:20,312
Hundred bucks.

1603
01:31:20,414 --> 01:31:23,383
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you again, mate.

1604
01:31:36,397 --> 01:31:39,298
<i>Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

1605
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,801
<i>Look, this is no fun. I thought
it might be fun, but it is no fun.</i>

1606
01:31:42,903 --> 01:31:46,236
<i>Maybe I'll laugh about this later on,
but right now I can't even smile...</i>

1607
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:48,740
because I'll wind up
with a frozen rictus.

1608
01:31:48,843 --> 01:31:51,744
- My rictus isn't freezing. Come on. Let's go.
- Come on. Let's turn around.

1609
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:53,746
Turn around?
We're halfway to Brooklyn!

1610
01:31:53,848 --> 01:31:58,308
- And what happens when we get there?
- We turn around and walk back.

1611
01:31:58,419 --> 01:32:01,650
- No, we take a cab back.
- Oh, what's a...

1612
01:32:01,756 --> 01:32:04,657
If Thomas Wolfe can do it,
I can do it, you can do it.

1613
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:07,660
- The question is, why should I do it?
- Why?

1614
01:32:07,762 --> 01:32:11,163
Because you get over your block
and you can write again.

1615
01:32:11,265 --> 01:32:13,165
Did you know that Thomas Wolfe...

1616
01:32:13,267 --> 01:32:16,168
would walk back and forth
on this very bridge night after...

1617
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:20,604
And then finally, one night a torrent
of words just gushed out of him...

1618
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:23,268
<i>and he wrote, uh,
Of Time and the River.</i>

1619
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:26,813
Listen: "A stone, a leaf...

1620
01:32:26,914 --> 01:32:28,814
"an unfound door.

1621
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:31,817
"Of a stone, a leaf...

1622
01:32:31,919 --> 01:32:34,251
and all the forgotten faces."

1623
01:32:34,355 --> 01:32:38,257
<i>Beautiful. But that's from
Look Homeward, Angel.</i>

1624
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:41,817
What difference? It's still Wolfe!

1625
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:30,208
