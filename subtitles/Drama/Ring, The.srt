1
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,479
The world is changed.

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,520
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,079
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,479
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,640
Much that once was...

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,359
...is lost.

7
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,920
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,519
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,519
Three were given to the Elves.:

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,319
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,319
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.:

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,319
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,920
And nine...

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,040
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

15
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,920
...who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,480
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,719
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,920
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,640
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,760
...to control all others.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,760
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
...and his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,680
One Ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,080
One by one...

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,759
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,840
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,800
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,439
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,039
Victory was near.

31
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,319
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,479
...could not be undone.

33
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,919
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,400
...when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,520
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,279
The Ring passed to Isildur...

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,519
...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,240
But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,839
...are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,519
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

42
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,519
It betrayed Isildur to his death.

43
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,279
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

44
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,720
...were lost.

45
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,680
History became legend...

46
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,759
...legend became myth.

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
And for
two and a half thousand years...

48
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,480
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

49
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,759
Until, when chance came...

50
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,399
...it ensnared a new bearer.

51
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,399
My precious.

52
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,040
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,000
...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

54
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,040
And there it consumed him.

55
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
It came to me.

56
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,639
My own. My love. My own.

57
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,319
My precious.

58
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,120
The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.

59
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,040
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

60
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

61
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,920
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

62
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,920
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,800
...whispers of a nameless fear.

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,160
And the Ring of Power perceived...

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,040
...its time had now come.

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,879
It abandoned Gollum.

67
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,839
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

68
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,079
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

69
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,279
What's this?

70
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,839
A Hobbit.

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,680
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

72
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,560
A ring.

73
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,519
Lost!

74
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,480
My precious is lost!

75
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,920
For the time will soon come...

76
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,120
...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

77
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,360
The Shire...60 years later

78
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,040
Down from the door where it began

79
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,360
And I must follow if I can

80
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,279
The road goes ever on and on

81
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,800
Down from the door where it began

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,759
Nowfar ahead the road has gone

83
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,000
-And I must follow if I can
-You're late.

84
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,800
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

85
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,000
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

86
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,800
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

87
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,120
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

88
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
What news of the outside world?
Tell me everything.

89
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,079
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.

90
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,600
Most unnatural.

91
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,439
Well, what can I tell you?

92
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,879
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.

93
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,600
Full of its own comings and goings.

94
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,519
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.

95
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,639
For which I am very thankful.

96
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,360
It's Gandalf!

97
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,000
The long-expected party.

98
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,480
How is the old rascal?

99
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,919
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

100
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,000
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

101
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,840
Well, that should please him.

102
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,279
-Half the Shire's been invited.
-Gracious me.

103
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
-He's up to something.
-Oh, really?

104
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,360
All right, then. Keep your secrets.

105
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,919
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

106
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Indeed.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,159
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,360
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

109
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,960
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

110
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,080
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

111
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,279
Oh, really?

112
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,519
Gandalf! Gandalf!

113
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,600
Fireworks, Gandalf!

114
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,120
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!

115
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Gandalf?

116
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,399
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am l, dear boy.

117
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
So am I.

118
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,000
No, thank you!

119
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,960
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

120
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,559
And what about very old friends?

121
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,240
Gandalf?

122
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,200
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!

123
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,279
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,879
You haven't aged a day.

125
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,200
Come on, come in!

126
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,639
Welcome, welcome.

127
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,240
Oh, here we are.

128
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,200
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

129
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,039
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

130
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,120
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

131
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,519
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

132
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,240
Just tea, thank you.

133
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,000
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

134
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,360
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

135
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,559
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

136
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,000
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

137
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,919
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart....

138
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,440
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

139
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,360
I've just found some sponge cake.

140
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,399
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--

141
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,639
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.

142
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,879
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at all.

143
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,720
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

144
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm not at home!

145
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,039
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

146
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,080
...never giving me a moment's peace.

147
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

148
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,240
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

149
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

150
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,559
All the arrangements are made.

151
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh, thank you.

152
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,519
Frodo suspects something.

153
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,039
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

154
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,759
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

155
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,960
You will tell him, won't you?

156
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,720
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.

157
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
I know.

158
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,840
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

159
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,720
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

160
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,440
The woods, the fields.

161
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,879
Little rivers.

162
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,720
I am old, Gandalf.

163
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,080
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

164
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,600
I feel thin.

165
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,440
Sort of stretched...

166
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,840
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

167
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,360
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

168
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,639
And I don't expect I shall return.

169
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,799
In fact, I mean not to.

170
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,279
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

171
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
Gandalf, my old friend...

172
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,360
...this will be a night to remember.

173
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,279
Hello, hello.

174
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

175
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,799
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

176
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,720
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.

177
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
Go on!

178
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,960
So there I was...

179
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,039
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

180
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,159
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

181
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,639
...about howthey were
going to cook us.

182
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,639
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

183
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,039
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

184
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,639
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

185
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,039
...and turned them all to stone!

186
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
Quickly.

187
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,399
Up they go!

188
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,279
No, the big one.

189
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,000
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

190
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,600
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!

191
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,360
This was your idea.

192
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,720
Watch out for the dragon!

193
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,160
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

194
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,519
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.

195
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,119
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

196
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,119
I might've known.

197
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,720
Speech, Bilbo!

198
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,920
Speech!

199
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,039
Speech!

200
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,319
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

201
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,200
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

202
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,799
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

203
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,960
...Hornblowers...

204
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,720
...Bolgers...

205
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,559
...Bracegirdles...

206
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,240
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!

207
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,359
Today is my 111th birthday!

208
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,599
Happy birthday!

209
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,880
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

210
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,880
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

211
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,400
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

212
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,000
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

213
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,839
I have things to do.

214
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,000
I've put this off far too long.

215
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,440
I regret to announce this is the end!

216
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm going now.

217
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,519
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

218
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,000
Goodbye.

219
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,839
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

220
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,279
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

221
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,319
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

222
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,559
It was just a bit of fun.

223
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,319
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

224
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,039
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.

225
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,799
As often as I can spare them.

226
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,079
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?

227
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,480
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.

228
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,799
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

229
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,680
No. Wait, it's...

230
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,640
...here in my pocket.

231
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

232
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,119
Yet, after all, why not?

233
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,359
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-I think you should leave the ring behind.

234
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,839
Is that so hard?

235
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,319
Well, no.

236
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,039
And yes.

237
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

238
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,799
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

239
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,000
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

240
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
It's mine.

241
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,759
My own.

242
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,920
-My precious.
-Precious?

243
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,880
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

244
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,559
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

245
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,359
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

246
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,319
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!

247
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:28,559
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

248
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,279
I am not trying to rob you.

249
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,759
I'm trying to help you.

250
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,079
All your long years,
we've been friends.

251
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,519
Trust me as you once did.

252
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,079
Let it go.

253
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,440
You're right, Gandalf.

254
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,079
The ring must go to Frodo.

255
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,200
It's late. The road is long.

256
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,759
Yes, it is time.

257
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,279
The ring is still in your pocket.

258
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,440
I've thought up an ending for my book:

259
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,839
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

260
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,319
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

261
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,680
Goodbye, Gandalf.

262
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,880
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

263
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,440
The road goes ever on and on

264
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,200
Until our next meeting.

265
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,920
It's mine. My own.

266
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,400
My precious.

267
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,440
Riddles in the dark.

268
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,039
Bilbo!

269
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,720
Bilbo!

270
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,039
My precious.

271
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,720
Precious.

272
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,279
He's gone, hasn't he?

273
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,880
He talked for so long about leaving...

274
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,720
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

275
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,839
Gandalf?

276
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,359
Bilbo's ring.

277
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,960
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

278
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,119
He's left you Bag End.

279
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,000
Along with all his possessions.

280
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,000
The ring is yours now.

281
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,839
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,160
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?

283
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,480
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.

284
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,799
I don't understand.

285
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
Neither do I.

286
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,319
Keep it secret.

287
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,200
Keep it safe.

288
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,839
Shirel

289
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,119
Bagginsl

290
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,559
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

291
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,960
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

292
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,680
...and the finding
of the Ring of Power. "

293
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,799
It has come to me.

294
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,319
The One Ring. It shall be"
an heirloom of my kingdom.

295
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,799
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

296
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,640
...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

297
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,240
It is precious to me...

298
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,599
...though I buy it with great pain.

299
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,640
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

300
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,480
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

301
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,559
A secret now
that only fire can tell. 

302
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,240
Shire.

303
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,319
Baggins.

304
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,720
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

305
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,759
That way.

306
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,799
-Good night.
-Good night.

307
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,759
Good night, Sam.

308
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,200
Is it secret? Is it safe?

309
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,799
What are you doing?

310
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,319
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

311
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,640
It's quite cool.

312
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,680
What can you see?

313
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,680
Can you see anything?

314
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,640
Nothing.

315
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,200
There's nothing.

316
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
Wait.

317
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,759
There are markings.

318
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,480
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

319
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,119
There are few who can.

320
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,319
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

321
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,920
Mordor!

322
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,079
In the common tongue, it says:

323
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,680
"One Ring to rule them all...

324
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,119
...One Ring to find them...

325
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,400
...One Ring to bring them all...

326
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,559
...and in the darkness bind them."

327
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,079
This is the One Ring...

328
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,359
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

329
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,400
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

330
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,599
Bilbo found it.

331
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,920
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.

332
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,440
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

333
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,880
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

334
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,759
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

335
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,279
The Ring has awoken.

336
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,079
It's heard its master's call.

337
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,039
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

338
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,519
No, Frodo.

339
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,599
The spirit of Sauron endured.

340
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,880
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

341
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,279
Sauron has returned.

342
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,119
His Orcs have multiplied.

343
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,200
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

344
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,960
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

345
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
He is seeking it.

346
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,039
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

347
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
For the Ring yearns above all else...

348
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,359
...to return to the hand
of its master.

349
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,240
They are one...

350
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,440
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

351
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,599
Frodo...

352
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,960
...he must never find it.

353
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,119
All right.

354
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,559
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

355
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,279
No one knows it's here, do they?

356
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,920
Do they, Gandalf?

357
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,200
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

358
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,240
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

359
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,480
But the enemy found him first.

360
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,559
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

361
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,039
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words.:

362
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,279
Shire!

363
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,000
Baggins!

364
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
Shire.

365
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,920
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

366
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,599
Who goes there?

367
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,480
Take it, Gandalf!

368
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,839
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

369
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,319
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

370
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,759
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

371
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,359
I dare not take it.

372
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,000
Not even to keep it safe.

373
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,000
Understand, Frodo...

374
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,160
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

375
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,799
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

376
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,200
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

377
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,519
No, it can't.

378
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,000
What must I do?

379
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,960
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?

380
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,319
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

381
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,599
Bree.

382
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,480
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...

383
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,039
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

384
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,799
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

385
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,880
I don't have any answers.

386
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,680
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

387
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,920
He'll know what to do.

388
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,240
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

389
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,839
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

390
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,640
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

391
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,319
I can cut across country
easily enough.

392
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,000
My dear Frodo.

393
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,200
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

394
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,160
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

395
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,599
And yet, after a hundred years...

396
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,760
...they can still surprise you.

397
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,559
Get down.

398
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,679
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

399
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,159
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

400
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,679
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

401
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,599
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!

402
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,840
Nothing important.

403
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,280
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

404
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,039
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

405
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,239
No?

406
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,480
Perhaps not.

407
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,000
I've thought of a better use for you.

408
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,559
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

409
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,119
Be careful, both of you.

410
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,039
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

411
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,079
Birds, beasts.

412
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,519
Is it safe?

413
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,440
Never put it on...

414
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,880
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

415
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,519
Always remember, Frodo...

416
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,039
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

417
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,440
It wants to be found.

418
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,480
This is it.

419
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,880
This is what?

420
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,159
If I take one more step...

421
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,360
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

422
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
Come on, Sam.

423
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,760
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

424
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,920
-"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
-"Going out your door.

425
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,320
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

426
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,480
...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to. "

427
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,719
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

428
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,480
The hour grows late.

429
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,119
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

430
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,639
...seeking my counsel.

431
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,679
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

432
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,079
My old friend.

433
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,880
Saruman.

434
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,360
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.

435
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,320
So the Ring of Power has been found.

436
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,559
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

437
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,880
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

438
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,679
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

439
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,360
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

440
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,960
Time?

441
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,400
What time do you think we have?

442
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,559
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

443
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,840
He cannot yet take physical form...

444
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,639
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

445
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,119
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

446
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:21,360
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

447
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,840
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

448
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,800
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

449
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,400
The Eye of Sauron.

450
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,079
He is gathering all evil to him.

451
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,960
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army
great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

452
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,599
You knowthis?

453
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,519
How?

454
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,679
I have seen it.

455
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,159
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

456
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,280
Why?

457
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,360
Why should we fear to use it?

458
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,679
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

459
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,920
We do not know who else
may be watching.

460
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,039
The hour is later than you think.

461
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,480
Sauron's forces are already moving.

462
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,280
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

463
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,599
The Nine?

464
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,719
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

465
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,480
...disguised as riders in black.

466
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,480
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.

467
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,119
And kill the one who carries it.

468
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,079
Frodo!

469
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,360
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

470
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,800
There are none who can.

471
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,800
Against the power of Mordor...

472
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,480
...there can be no victory.

473
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,440
We must join with him, Gandalf.

474
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,920
We must join with Sauron.

475
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,000
It would be wise, my friend.

476
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Tell me...

477
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,039
...friend...

478
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,400
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

479
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,920
I gave you the chance...

480
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,559
...of aiding me willingly...

481
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,719
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

482
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,519
Mr. Frodo?

483
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,840
Frodo? Frodo!

484
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,280
-I thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?

485
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,360
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?

486
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,880
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

487
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,559
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

488
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,400
Frodo.

489
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,840
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.

490
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,360
Get off him.

491
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,239
Come on, Frodo.

492
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,239
What's the meaning of this?

493
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,599
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

494
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,800
You get back here!

495
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,039
Get out of my field!

496
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,920
You know what's gonna happen
when I catch up with you?

497
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,960
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

498
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,199
And some cabbages.

499
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,159
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

500
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,239
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...

501
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,519
...he's clearly overreacting.

502
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,119
Run!

503
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,480
Oh, that was close.

504
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,519
I think I've broken something.

505
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,760
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

506
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,440
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut.

507
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,800
-Shortcut to what?
-Mushrooms!

508
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,639
That's mine.

509
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,840
That's nice, Merry.

510
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,280
Here's a nice one, Sam.

511
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,920
I think we should get off the road.

512
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,039
Get off the road!

513
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,639
Quick!

514
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,239
Be quiet!

515
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,960
What was that?

516
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,760
Anything?

517
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,880
Nothing.

518
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,719
What is going on?

519
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,920
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

520
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,199
Get down!

521
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,599
I have to leave the Shire.

522
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,840
Sam and I must get to Bree.

523
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,360
Right.

524
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,880
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

525
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,119
Run!

526
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,159
This way! Follow me!

527
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:21,639
Run!

528
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,039
Get the rope, Sam!

529
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,039
Frodo!

530
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:42,119
Run, Frodo!

531
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,480
Go!
-Hurry!

532
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:46,159
Frodo, come on!

533
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,000
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!

534
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,400
-Howfar to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

535
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,840
Come on.

536
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,880
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

537
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,000
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

538
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,400
-What business brings you to Bree?
-We wish to stay at the inn.

539
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,559
Our business is our own.

540
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,119
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

541
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,719
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

542
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,639
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

543
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,880
Can't be too careful.

544
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,119
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

545
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,719
Excuse me.

546
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,559
Good evening, little masters.

547
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,400
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

548
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,400
Mister...?

549
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:58,639
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

550
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,280
-Underhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

551
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,480
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?

552
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,559
Gandalf.

553
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,960
Oh, yes...

554
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,159
...I remember. Elderly chap.

555
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,320
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

556
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,400
Not seen him for six months.

557
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,199
What do we do now?

558
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:33,320
Sam...

559
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,280
...he'll be here. He'll come.

560
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,920
Get out of my way!

561
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:43,760
What's that?

562
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,360
This, my friend, is a pint.

563
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,079
It comes in pints?

564
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,000
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!

565
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,800
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

566
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:06,639
Excuse me.

567
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,239
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

568
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,559
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

569
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,159
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

570
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,599
Strider.

571
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,239
Baggins.

572
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:45,000
Baggins.

573
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,039
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

574
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,559
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

575
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,679
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

576
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,000
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

577
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,039
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.

578
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,719
You cannot hide.

579
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,519
I see you.

580
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:54,760
There is no life...

581
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,079
...in the void.

582
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,679
Only...

583
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:00,960
...death.

584
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,400
You drawfar too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

585
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,840
What do you want?

586
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

587
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,320
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.

588
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,000
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

589
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:28,760
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

590
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:31,719
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?

591
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,880
Yes.

592
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,840
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

593
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,119
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

594
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:49,679
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

595
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,639
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

596
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,880
They're coming.

597
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,159
What are they?

598
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,280
They were once Men.

599
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:20,639
Great kings of Men.

600
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,840
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

601
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,400
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

602
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,800
One by one, falling into darkness.

603
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,400
Nowthey are slaves to his will.

604
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:37,280
They are the NazgûI.

605
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,119
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

606
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,239
At all times they feel...

607
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,280
...the presence of the Ring...

608
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,800
"...drawn to the power of the" One."
They will never stop hunting you.

609
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,159
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.

610
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,079
How do we knowthis Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

611
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,400
We have no choice but to trust him.

612
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,880
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

613
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:18,159
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.

614
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,400
We're going to see the Elves.

615
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:42,760
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?

616
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,519
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.

617
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,840
What about second breakfast?

618
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,119
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

619
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,360
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

620
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,519
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouldn't count on it.

621
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,320
Pippin!

622
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,480
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

623
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,920
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

624
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:30,639
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

625
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,320
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

626
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:42,599
We have work to do.

627
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,960
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

628
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,119
Rip them all down.

629
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,199
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SûI.

630
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,360
We shall rest here tonight.

631
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:17,840
These are for you.
Keep them close.

632
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:20,440
I'm going to have a look around.

633
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,559
Stay here.

634
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,079
My tomato's burst.

635
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,119
Could I have some bacon?

636
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,199
Want a tomato, Sam?

637
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,079
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

638
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,840
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!

639
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,880
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

640
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,639
Go!

641
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,360
Back, you devils!

642
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,599
Frodo!

643
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:13,360
Oh, Sam.

644
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,800
Strider!

645
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,679
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

646
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,880
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

647
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,239
Hurry!

648
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,239
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

649
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,280
Hold on, Frodo.

650
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,719
Gandalf!

651
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,559
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

652
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,000
Is he going to die?

653
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:54,880
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

654
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,400
-They're close.
-Sam, do you knowthe Athelas plant?

655
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,000
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.

656
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,199
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

657
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,480
It may help to slowthe poisoning.
Hurry!

658
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:27,320
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

659
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,079
Frodo.

660
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,920
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

661
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,039
Hear my voice...

662
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,360
Come back to the light.

663
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,119
Who is she?

664
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:12,440
Frodo.

665
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,000
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.

666
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:20,280
He's not going to last.

667
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,039
We must get him to my father.

668
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:26,480
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

669
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:32,519
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

670
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:35,840
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

671
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:37,599
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.

672
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,760
The Road is too dangerous.

673
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,239
What are they saying?

674
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,360
If I can get across the river...

675
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:46,079
...the power of my people
will protect him.

676
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:48,639
I do not fear them.

677
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,440
Arwen...

678
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:02,719
...ride hard. Don't look back.

679
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,719
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

680
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,319
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

681
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,680
If you want him, come and claim him.

682
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:01,720
No. No!

683
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,079
Frodo, no.

684
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:09,479
Frodo, don't give in.

685
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,560
Not now.

686
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:24,439
What grace is given me...

687
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:26,880
...let it pass to him.

688
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,159
Let him be spared.

689
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,720
Save him.

690
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,560
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.

691
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,239
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

692
01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:00,720
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.

693
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:05,279
And you're lucky to be here too.

694
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,800
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

695
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,920
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

696
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:23,640
What happened, Gandalf?

697
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,720
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.

698
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,920
I was delayed.

699
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,800
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

700
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,199
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

701
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,079
Embrace the power of the Ring...

702
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,119
...or embrace your own destruction!

703
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,039
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

704
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:05,039
Only one who can bend it to his will.

705
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,680
And he does not share power.

706
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,640
So you have chosen death.

707
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:39,960
Gandalf? What is it?

708
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,600
Nothing, Frodo.

709
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,079
Frodo!

710
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:48,680
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!

711
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,479
Sam has hardly left your side.

712
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,800
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

713
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,039
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

714
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,920
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

715
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:53,199
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.

716
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:55,000
Bilbo.

717
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,560
"There and Back Again:

718
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,439
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

719
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:10,760
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...

720
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:14,720
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

721
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,399
...visit Lake-town...

722
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,840
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

723
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:26,000
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

724
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,319
I miss the Shire.

725
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,640
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

726
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,399
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

727
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,680
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

728
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,720
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

729
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,039
My dear boy.

730
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,760
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?

731
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,279
No harm in being prepared.

732
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:18,920
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-I do.

733
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:21,880
-More than anything.
-I did.

734
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:23,880
It's just....

735
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,159
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

736
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,840
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

737
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,239
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

738
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,039
Off home.

739
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:41,960
You are right, Sam.

740
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,680
We did what we set out to do.

741
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:49,720
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

742
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,920
I am ready to go home.

743
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,600
His strength returns.

744
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:04,279
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

745
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,239
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

746
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,000
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

747
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,399
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

748
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,840
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

749
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,479
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

750
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,319
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

751
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,640
Our list of allies grows thin.

752
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,039
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

753
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,720
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

754
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,279
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

755
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,920
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

756
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:47,439
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

757
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,760
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

758
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,159
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

759
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,920
Gandalf...

760
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,640
...the Ring cannot stay here.

761
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,439
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

762
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,279
They must decide now how to end it.

763
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:33,680
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

764
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:37,760
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

765
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,880
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

766
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:47,119
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

767
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:49,119
Men?

768
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,039
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

769
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:57,479
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

770
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,119
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

771
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:02,880
I was there, Gandalf.

772
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,279
I was there 3000 years ago...

773
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,119
...when Isildur took the Ring.

774
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:19,039
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

775
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:23,920
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

776
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:28,960
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

777
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:32,560
...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

778
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,199
Cast it into the fire!

779
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,840
-Destroy it!
-No.

780
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:47,199
Isildur!

781
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,159
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

782
01:18:56,119 --> 01:19:00,159
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

783
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:04,560
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

784
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,399
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

785
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,800
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

786
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:18,079
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

787
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:20,319
He has chosen exile.

788
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,640
The shards of Narsil.

789
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,279
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

790
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:07,239
It's still sharp.

791
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,720
But no more than a broken heirloom.

792
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:47,359
Why do you fear the past?

793
01:20:48,199 --> 01:20:53,359
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

794
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,840
You are not bound to his fate.

795
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:01,159
The same blood flows in my veins.

796
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:06,479
The same weakness.

797
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:11,760
Your time will come.

798
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:16,239
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

799
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:21,520
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

800
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,960
Not over you... not over me.

801
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,960
Do you remember when we first met?

802
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:47,680
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

803
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,640
Long years have passed.

804
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:55,479
You did not have the cares
you carry now.

805
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,840
Do you remember what I told you?

806
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,239
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

807
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:13,960
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

808
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,920
And to that I hold.

809
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,560
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

810
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,479
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

811
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,199
I choose a mortal life.

812
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,600
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

813
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,079
...like my heart.

814
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:05,800
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

815
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,800
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

816
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:15,079
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

817
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,640
You will unite, or you will fall.

818
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,960
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

819
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:28,079
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

820
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,199
So it is true.

821
01:23:56,039 --> 01:24:00,079
-The doom of Man.
-It is a gift.

822
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:03,279
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

823
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,199
Why not use this Ring?

824
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,319
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

825
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,439
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

826
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,760
...are your lands kept safe.

827
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,680
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

828
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,479
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

829
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:29,960
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

830
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:33,520
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

831
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,760
This is no mere Ranger.

832
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:40,199
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

833
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,479
You owe him your allegiance.

834
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:49,239
Aragorn.

835
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,600
This is Isildur's heir?

836
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,479
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

837
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:01,840
Sit down, Legolas.

838
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:07,800
Gondor has no king.

839
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,279
Gondor needs no king.

840
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,199
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

841
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,520
You have only one choice.

842
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,920
The Ring must be destroyed.

843
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,439
What are we waiting for?

844
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:50,039
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

845
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:54,239
...by any craft that we here possess.

846
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,720
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

847
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,600
Only there can it be unmade.

848
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,159
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

849
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:11,119
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

850
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,960
One of you...

851
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:17,520
...must do this.

852
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:23,840
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

853
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,239
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

854
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,960
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

855
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:37,239
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

856
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,960
It is a barren wasteland...

857
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:43,600
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

858
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,479
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

859
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:51,800
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

860
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,279
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

861
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:58,960
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

862
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:03,640
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

863
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,840
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

864
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,159
Never trust an Elf!

865
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:19,880
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

866
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:23,000
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

867
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,159
I will take it.

868
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:47,479
I will take it.

869
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:55,960
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

870
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,920
Though...

871
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,640
...I do not knowthe way.

872
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,760
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

873
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,199
...as long as it is yours to bear.

874
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:23,159
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

875
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,199
...I will.

876
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:30,520
You have my sword.

877
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,199
And you have my bow.

878
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,159
And my ax.

879
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,800
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

880
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,279
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

881
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,079
...then Gondor will see it done.

882
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,079
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...

883
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:07,000
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

884
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,359
We're coming too!

885
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:13,960
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

886
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,439
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

887
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,000
...mission.

888
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,640
Quest.

889
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:22,000
Thing.

890
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,399
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

891
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,760
Nine companions.

892
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:33,199
So be it.

893
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,479
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

894
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:38,800
Great!

895
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:41,199
Where are we going?

896
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,960
My old swordl

897
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:53,800
Sting.

898
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,119
Here, take it. Take it.

899
01:30:00,439 --> 01:30:04,159
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

900
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,800
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

901
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,399
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

902
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,960
Here's a pretty thing.

903
01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:17,600
Mithril.

904
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:22,560
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

905
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,880
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

906
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,520
My old ring.

907
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,520
I should very much like...

908
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,560
...to hold it again, one last time.

909
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:04,720
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

910
01:31:05,079 --> 01:31:08,960
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

911
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:16,279
I'm sorry for everything.

912
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:30,319
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

913
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,119
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

914
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:37,720
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

915
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,560
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

916
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:44,319
Move your feet.

917
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,800
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

918
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,359
Faster!

919
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:52,279
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

920
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:55,079
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

921
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,560
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

922
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:02,880
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

923
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:08,199
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

924
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,119
Sorry!

925
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,199
Get him!

926
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,000
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

927
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:25,720
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

928
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,680
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

929
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,520
It's moving fast.

930
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,800
Against the wind.

931
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,560
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

932
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,399
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

933
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:13,119
Spies of Saruman.

934
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,000
The passage south is being watched.

935
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,279
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

936
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:35,039
Frodo!

937
01:34:53,239 --> 01:34:55,439
Boromir.

938
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,720
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

939
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,920
...over so small a thing.

940
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,880
Such a little thing.

941
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:09,479
Boromir!

942
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:12,600
Give the Ring to Frodo.

943
01:35:22,039 --> 01:35:24,000
As you wish.

944
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,640
I care not.

945
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:05,079
So, Gandalf, you tried
to lead them over Caradhras.

946
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,680
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

947
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,800
If the mountain defeats you...

948
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,239
...will you risk
a more dangerous road?

949
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:32,920
There is a fell voice on the air.

950
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,399
It's Saruman!

951
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,399
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

952
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,359
No!

953
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:55,880
We must get off the mountain!

954
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:00,520
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

955
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,960
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

956
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,680
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

957
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,640
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

958
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:16,039
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

959
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:21,560
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

960
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:27,000
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm.:

961
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:31,600
Shadow and flame.

962
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,399
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

963
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,119
Frodo?

964
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:49,800
We will go through the mines.

965
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,439
So be it.

966
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:01,479
The walls...

967
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:04,119
...of Moria.

968
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,720
Well, let's see.

969
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,239
Ithildin.

970
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,079
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

971
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,439
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

972
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:43,479
-Speak, friend, and enter."
-What do you suppose that means?

973
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,199
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

974
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:20,600
Mines are no place for a pony.

975
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,720
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

976
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,479
Go on, Bill. Go on.

977
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:32,439
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

978
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,439
Do not disturb the water.

979
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,479
Oh, it's useless.

980
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,720
It's a riddle.

981
01:41:00,359 --> 01:41:03,359
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

982
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:06,479
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

983
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,119
Mellon.

984
01:41:26,439 --> 01:41:31,119
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

985
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:37,039
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

986
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,439
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

987
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,119
And they call it a mine.

988
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:46,159
A mine!

989
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:50,399
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

990
01:41:56,279 --> 01:41:57,760
NO....

991
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,560
No!

992
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:04,600
Goblins.

993
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:12,479
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

994
01:42:13,479 --> 01:42:15,960
Now, get out of here. Get out!

995
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,920
-Frodo!
-Help!

996
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:22,640
Strider!

997
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:25,520
-Help!
-Get off him!

998
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,680
Aragorn!

999
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:37,600
Frodo!

1000
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:03,920
Into the mines!

1001
01:43:04,119 --> 01:43:07,199
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!

1002
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:12,960
Run!

1003
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:32,640
We now have but one choice.

1004
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:37,520
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1005
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,680
Be on your guard.

1006
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:43,159
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1007
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:46,760
...in the deep places of the world.

1008
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:58,159
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1009
01:43:58,319 --> 01:44:02,000
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1010
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:27,079
Pippin.

1011
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,399
I have no memory of this place.

1012
01:44:51,399 --> 01:44:52,760
-Are we lost?
-No.

1013
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,399
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.

1014
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,000
-Merry?
-What?

1015
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,000
I'm hungry.

1016
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:14,159
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

1017
01:45:14,359 --> 01:45:18,319
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

1018
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,520
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...

1019
01:45:23,239 --> 01:45:24,800
...or was set loose.

1020
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:35,640
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1021
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,279
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1022
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,359
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1023
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,720
Pity?

1024
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,520
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1025
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:52,359
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1026
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,159
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1027
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,239
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1028
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:05,279
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1029
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:11,479
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1030
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:15,000
...before this is over.

1031
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:20,159
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1032
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,720
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1033
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,119
I wish none of this had happened.

1034
01:46:33,319 --> 01:46:38,119
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1035
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,159
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1036
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,479
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1037
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,199
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1038
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:56,800
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1039
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,039
And that is an encouraging thought.

1040
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:06,079
It's that way.

1041
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:08,439
-He's remembered.
-No.

1042
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:12,279
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1043
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:17,520
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1044
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:35,720
Let me risk a little more light.

1045
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:42,159
Behold...

1046
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:47,600
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1047
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,239
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1048
01:48:17,159 --> 01:48:18,800
Gimli!

1049
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,439
No!

1050
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,000
Oh, no.

1051
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,920
No.

1052
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,840
"Here lies Balin...

1053
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:47,199
...son of Fundin...

1054
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:50,000
...Lord of Moria."

1055
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:52,680
He is dead, then.

1056
01:48:54,359 --> 01:48:55,960
It's as I feared.

1057
01:49:13,479 --> 01:49:16,279
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1058
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:20,960
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1059
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:24,520
We have barred the gates...

1060
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:27,520
...but cannot hold them for long.

1061
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:30,439
The ground shakes.

1062
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,359
Drums...

1063
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,960
...drums in the deep.

1064
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:41,319
We cannot get out.

1065
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:46,920
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1066
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:51,000
We cannot get out.

1067
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,720
They are coming.

1068
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,800
Fool of a Took!

1069
01:50:39,159 --> 01:50:42,800
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1070
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,239
Frodo!

1071
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:12,840
Orcs.

1072
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,520
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1073
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:30,199
They have a cave-troll.

1074
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:46,439
Let them come!

1075
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:50,359
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1076
01:53:36,359 --> 01:53:39,000
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1077
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,199
Frodo!

1078
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:19,199
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1079
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:21,920
Frodo!

1080
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:07,039
Frodo!

1081
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,119
Oh, no.

1082
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:16,000
He's alive.

1083
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:21,199
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1084
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:23,520
You should be dead.

1085
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:26,079
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1086
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,840
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1087
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,479
Mithril.

1088
01:56:40,199 --> 01:56:42,680
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1089
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:50,279
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1090
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,279
This way!

1091
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,600
What is this new devilry?

1092
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:34,720
A Balrog.

1093
01:58:35,079 --> 01:58:38,039
A demon of the ancient world.

1094
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:42,479
This foe is beyond any of you.

1095
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,119
Run!

1096
01:58:52,199 --> 01:58:53,600
Quickly!

1097
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,800
Gandalf.

1098
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:12,880
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1099
01:59:14,279 --> 01:59:16,680
The bridge is near.

1100
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:22,600
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1101
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,199
Gandalf!

1102
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,880
Merry! Pippin!

1103
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:23,000
Sam!

1104
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:28,720
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1105
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,039
Not the beard!

1106
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,560
Steady.

1107
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:51,119
Hold on!

1108
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:12,479
Hang on!

1109
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,560
Lean forward!

1110
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:28,399
Steady.

1111
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:30,800
Come on!

1112
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,399
Now!

1113
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,680
Over the bridge!

1114
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,399
Fly!

1115
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:37,159
You cannot pass!

1116
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:38,840
Gandalf!

1117
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:47,640
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1118
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:52,239
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1119
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,680
Go back to the Shadow.

1120
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:15,439
You shall not pass!

1121
02:03:41,479 --> 02:03:45,239
-No! No!
-Gandalf!

1122
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:54,920
Fly, you fools!

1123
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,960
No!

1124
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,920
Aragorn!

1125
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,600
Legolas, get them up.

1126
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,319
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1127
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:16,000
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1128
02:05:16,199 --> 02:05:19,399
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1129
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:23,439
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1130
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,039
On your feet, Sam.

1131
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:28,760
Frodo?

1132
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:32,359
Frodo!

1133
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:25,159
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1134
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:29,880
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1135
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:32,479
An Elf-witch...

1136
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,760
...of terrible power.

1137
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:38,399
All who look upon her...

1138
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,319
...fall under her spell.

1139
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:41,760
Frodol

1140
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:45,920
And are never seen again.

1141
02:06:46,119 --> 02:06:50,399
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1142
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:54,199
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1143
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:56,039
Mr. Frodo?

1144
02:07:01,159 --> 02:07:06,520
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1145
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:11,039
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1146
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:22,880
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1147
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:25,960
Haldir of Lorien.

1148
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,439
We come here for help.

1149
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,560
We need your protection.

1150
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:35,840
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.
We should go back.

1151
02:07:36,039 --> 02:07:41,680
You have entered the realm of the Lady
of the Wood. You cannot go back.

1152
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,359
Come. She is waiting.

1153
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:55,880
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1154
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:57,880
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1155
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:01,800
For I much desire to speak with him.

1156
02:09:03,399 --> 02:09:06,439
He has fallen into Shadow.

1157
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:14,039
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1158
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:17,720
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1159
02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:20,800
...to the ruin of all.

1160
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,399
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1161
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:46,039
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1162
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:49,960
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1163
02:09:52,359 --> 02:09:54,199
Tonight, you will sleep....

1164
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:57,640
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1165
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,800
...one who has seen the Eyel

1166
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,359
A lament for Gandalf.

1167
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:21,439
What do they say about him?

1168
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:26,560
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.

1169
02:10:29,159 --> 02:10:31,319
Take some rest.

1170
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:34,319
These borders are well-protected.

1171
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:37,000
I will find no rest here.

1172
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:42,560
I heard her voice inside my head.

1173
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:46,359
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1174
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:51,800
She said to me,
"Even nowthere is hope left."

1175
02:10:53,159 --> 02:10:55,880
But I cannot see it.

1176
02:10:57,119 --> 02:10:59,520
It is long since we had any hope.

1177
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:11,399
My father is a noble man.

1178
02:11:12,119 --> 02:11:14,199
But his rule is failing...

1179
02:11:17,239 --> 02:11:19,760
...and our people lose faith.

1180
02:11:21,319 --> 02:11:24,479
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1181
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:28,039
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1182
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,680
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1183
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:36,399
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1184
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:40,079
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1185
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:44,039
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1186
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:48,960
Have you ever been called home...

1187
02:11:49,159 --> 02:11:52,680
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1188
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:56,399
I have seen the White City...

1189
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,159
...Iong ago.

1190
02:11:59,079 --> 02:12:03,800
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1191
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:07,560
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1192
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:11,159
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1193
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:18,119
Will you look into the mirror?

1194
02:13:18,319 --> 02:13:19,760
What will I see?

1195
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,880
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1196
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:27,479
For the mirror...

1197
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:30,119
...shows many things.

1198
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,319
Things that were...

1199
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:37,960
...things that are...

1200
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:40,600
...and some things...

1201
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,199
...that have not yet come to pass.

1202
02:15:06,399 --> 02:15:09,079
I know what it is you saw.

1203
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:13,800
For it is also in my mind.

1204
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:19,439
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1205
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:26,359
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1206
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,159
He will try to take the Ring.

1207
02:15:30,359 --> 02:15:32,239
You know of whom I speak.

1208
02:15:33,239 --> 02:15:37,720
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1209
02:15:39,159 --> 02:15:41,479
If you ask it of me...

1210
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:44,800
...I will give you the One Ring.

1211
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,880
You offer it to me freely.

1212
02:15:52,319 --> 02:15:56,079
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1213
02:16:02,199 --> 02:16:05,319
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1214
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:09,439
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1215
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:12,960
Treacherous as the sea!

1216
02:16:13,479 --> 02:16:18,159
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1217
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,920
All shall love me...

1218
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,840
...and despair.

1219
02:16:37,319 --> 02:16:41,479
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1220
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:44,120
...and go into the West...

1221
02:16:44,319 --> 02:16:48,600
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

1222
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:56,000
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1223
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:58,360
...is to be alone.

1224
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:02,239
This task was appointed to you.

1225
02:17:02,719 --> 02:17:05,760
And if you do not find a way...

1226
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:08,520
...no one will.

1227
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:11,920
Then I know what I must do.

1228
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,600
It's just...

1229
02:17:16,719 --> 02:17:18,879
...I'm afraid to do it.

1230
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:27,159
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1231
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:37,760
Do you know howthe Orcs
first came into being?

1232
02:17:38,479 --> 02:17:41,719
They were Elves once.

1233
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:46,079
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1234
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:49,280
...tortured and mutilated.

1235
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:54,719
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1236
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,719
And now...

1237
02:17:58,120 --> 02:17:59,959
...perfected.

1238
02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:03,680
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1239
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:07,760
...whom do you serve?

1240
02:18:07,959 --> 02:18:10,360
Saruman!

1241
02:18:30,319 --> 02:18:33,600
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1242
02:18:33,799 --> 02:18:36,639
You do not know pain.
You do not knowfear.

1243
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:39,680
You will taste Man-flesh!

1244
02:18:44,479 --> 02:18:48,040
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1245
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:52,239
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1246
02:18:53,959 --> 02:18:55,200
Kill the others.

1247
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,079
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1248
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:28,520
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1249
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:31,520
...our most beloved star.

1250
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:46,959
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1251
02:19:47,159 --> 02:19:51,120
...when all other lights go out.

1252
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:27,360
Frodo.

1253
02:21:29,159 --> 02:21:30,559
The Argonath.

1254
02:21:33,879 --> 02:21:37,479
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1255
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:40,040
My kin.

1256
02:22:55,799 --> 02:22:57,959
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1257
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:00,600
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1258
02:23:00,799 --> 02:23:04,120
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1259
02:23:04,479 --> 02:23:08,159
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1260
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:11,440
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1261
02:23:11,639 --> 02:23:14,600
And after that, it gets even better.

1262
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,760
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1263
02:23:19,959 --> 02:23:21,280
That is our road.

1264
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:25,840
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1265
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,680
Recover my--

1266
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:32,440
-We should leave now.
-No.

1267
02:23:32,639 --> 02:23:36,879
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1268
02:23:37,079 --> 02:23:40,399
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1269
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:44,440
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1270
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:49,000
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1271
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:55,600
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1272
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:57,719
Where's Frodo?

1273
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:24,200
None of us should wander alone.

1274
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,559
You, least of all.

1275
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:30,079
So much depends on you.

1276
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:32,959
Frodo?

1277
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,239
I know why you seek solitude.

1278
02:24:42,959 --> 02:24:46,200
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1279
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,920
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1280
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:54,000
There are other ways, Frodo.

1281
02:24:54,159 --> 02:24:57,840
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1282
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:01,719
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1283
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,879
Warning? Against what?

1284
02:25:05,079 --> 02:25:07,120
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1285
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:10,840
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1286
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,680
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1287
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:19,559
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1288
02:25:21,079 --> 02:25:23,000
-lf you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1289
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:27,760
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1290
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:32,639
What chance do you think you have?

1291
02:25:32,879 --> 02:25:37,360
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1292
02:25:37,559 --> 02:25:41,079
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1293
02:25:43,159 --> 02:25:45,120
You fool!

1294
02:25:45,319 --> 02:25:49,159
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1295
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:52,040
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1296
02:25:52,239 --> 02:25:53,440
-Give it to me!
-No!

1297
02:25:53,639 --> 02:25:55,399
-Give it to me!
-No.

1298
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:04,719
I see your mind.

1299
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:07,760
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1300
02:26:07,959 --> 02:26:09,719
You will betray us!

1301
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:13,000
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1302
02:26:13,399 --> 02:26:16,920
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1303
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,159
Frodo?

1304
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,799
Frodo.

1305
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:36,559
What have I done?

1306
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,360
Please, Frodo.

1307
02:26:38,559 --> 02:26:41,120
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1308
02:27:27,719 --> 02:27:29,079
Frodo?

1309
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:33,239
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1310
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:35,159
Stay away!Frodo!

1311
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,920
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

1312
02:27:52,239 --> 02:27:54,639
Would you destroy it?

1313
02:27:59,399 --> 02:28:01,280
Aragorn.

1314
02:28:04,559 --> 02:28:06,799
Aragorn.

1315
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:10,319
Elessar.

1316
02:28:17,639 --> 02:28:20,879
I would have gone with you to the end.

1317
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:24,280
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1318
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,600
I know.

1319
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:36,159
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1320
02:28:39,799 --> 02:28:41,440
Go, Frodo!

1321
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:45,719
Run.

1322
02:28:45,959 --> 02:28:47,559
Run!

1323
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:12,760
Mr. Frodo!

1324
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:23,360
Find the halfling!

1325
02:29:24,879 --> 02:29:27,319
Find the halfling!

1326
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:32,280
Elendil!

1327
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:39,959
Aragorn, go!

1328
02:30:00,799 --> 02:30:02,079
Frodo!

1329
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:04,159
Hide here. Quick!

1330
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:06,159
Come on!

1331
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:10,520
What's he doing?

1332
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:16,440
He's leaving.

1333
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:23,840
-No!
-Pippin!

1334
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:30,799
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1335
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:34,319
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1336
02:30:34,719 --> 02:30:36,239
-Over here!
-This way!

1337
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:48,879
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

1338
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:39,239
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1339
02:32:03,079 --> 02:32:04,159
Run!

1340
02:35:15,239 --> 02:35:16,760
No.

1341
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:23,280
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

1342
02:35:23,559 --> 02:35:25,479
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1343
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:28,719
I let Frodo go.

1344
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,879
Then you did what I could not.

1345
02:35:32,799 --> 02:35:35,959
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1346
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:40,559
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1347
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:42,959
I did not see it.

1348
02:35:43,159 --> 02:35:46,239
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

1349
02:35:46,959 --> 02:35:49,079
You fought bravely.

1350
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:51,920
You have kept your honor.

1351
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:54,319
Leave it.

1352
02:35:54,799 --> 02:35:56,680
It is over.

1353
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:02,799
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1354
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:06,120
...and my city to ruin.

1355
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:12,959
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1356
02:36:13,159 --> 02:36:16,680
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1357
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:20,040
...nor our people fail.

1358
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:22,280
Our people.

1359
02:36:25,959 --> 02:36:27,920
Our people.

1360
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:51,760
I would have followed you, my brother.

1361
02:36:53,239 --> 02:36:55,120
My captain.

1362
02:36:57,639 --> 02:36:59,479
My king.

1363
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:20,479
Be at peace...

1364
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:22,760
...son of Gondor.

1365
02:38:00,280 --> 02:38:02,000
Frodo!

1366
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:23,879
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1367
02:38:25,079 --> 02:38:27,959
I wish none of this had happened.

1368
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:33,479
So do all who live
to see such times...

1369
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:37,000
...but that is not for them to decide.

1370
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:39,680
All you have to decide...

1371
02:38:39,879 --> 02:38:44,440
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1372
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:14,079
Frodo, no!

1373
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:15,799
Frodo!

1374
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:19,079
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1375
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:24,399
Go back, Sam!

1376
02:39:24,879 --> 02:39:28,280
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1377
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:31,200
And I'm coming with you!

1378
02:39:31,639 --> 02:39:33,959
You can't swim!

1379
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,239
Sam!

1380
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:45,879
Sam!

1381
02:40:25,159 --> 02:40:27,799
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1382
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:32,280
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1383
02:40:33,319 --> 02:40:35,840
And I don't mean to.

1384
02:40:36,079 --> 02:40:38,200
I don't mean to.

1385
02:40:39,799 --> 02:40:41,520
Sam.

1386
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:57,440
Come on.

1387
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:29,079
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1388
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:48,159
-You mean not to followthem.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1389
02:41:51,399 --> 02:41:56,079
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1390
02:42:07,479 --> 02:42:10,520
Not if we hold true to each other.

1391
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:16,120
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1392
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:22,079
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1393
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:25,440
We travel light.

1394
02:42:25,639 --> 02:42:27,280
Let us hunt some Orc.

1395
02:42:30,399 --> 02:42:32,079
Yes!

1396
02:42:50,559 --> 02:42:51,719
Mordor.

1397
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:55,559
I hope the others find a safer road.

1398
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:58,920
Strider will look after them.

1399
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:03,079
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1400
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:05,680
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1401
02:43:05,879 --> 02:43:07,399
We may.

1402
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:10,399
Sam...

1403
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:16,360
...I'm glad you are with me.
