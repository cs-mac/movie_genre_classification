1
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,800
In fact, the only thing I do care about is
the fact that I can't care about anything.

2
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,700
Seriously, where is me?

3
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,900
My name is Wesley Gibson.

4
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,100
My dad worked out my mom when I was seven days old.

5
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,400
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked in my baby blue eyes and ask himself:

6
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,100
Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?

7
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,700
Do we get a consignment by me at twenty-eights?

8
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,700
Yeah. Do you have the numbers of front paper?

9
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,800
Relax. I your name will come up you'll be dead already.

10
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,000
We had some unexpected losses recently.

11
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,500
We'd like to know.

12
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,000
Where our competitor is getting his ammunition.

13
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,900
It's clean.

14
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
Meaning?

15
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,900
Meaning it's untraceable.

16
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,100
Get down!

17
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,500
No one leaves the fraternity, Cross.

18
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,700
I have a new prospective on a fraternity.

19
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Careful. You don't destroying something has been around for a 1000 years.

20
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,100
It's already destroyed. He broke the code.

21
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,100
I have to stop this.

22
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Really?

23
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,100
You know this.

24
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,200
So why you don't face me yourself?

25
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Never send a sheep to kill a wolf.

26
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,700
They were just a decoys.

27
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,000
Good bye, Mister X.

28
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,800
Never send a sheep to kill a wolf.

29
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,100
They were just a decoys.

30
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
Wesley!

31
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,500
What is it?

32
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,400
What do you mean what is it? Listen!

33
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,600
How am I supposed to sleep by that fucking rocket?

34
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,700
When we'll gonna move so we don't have to wake up at that shit?

35
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
I gotta like it.

36
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,200
It helps to drain out the sound of your annoying fucking voice.

37
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,700
Now please let me sleep.

38
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,200
Have you ever thought about our talk?

39
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah.

40
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Which one?

41
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Perfect.

42
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,900
That's perfect.

43
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,400
Feed Annabelle.

44
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,900
Oh my fucking god!

45
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,100
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.

46
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
Holly shit on and after it is.

47
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I want that report on my desk in one hour.

48
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,800
Okay everybody. We're all delayed for a hour.

49
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,700
Weren't you something sad?

50
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,100
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetative stress injury in check.

51
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,800
Just a fact that I repeat something and after
that causes me - stresses fucking sad.

52
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,900
Nice job dude.

53
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,500
Have you seen Barry?

54
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,400
Yeah, he'd go to the dantist. Again.

55
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes! Ah! Ah!

56
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
Do you think, are there any morning after pill here?

57
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,900
I think it works crushed up in her omelet. "Hey baby, bite a some bit. Every but you say."

58
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,500
Oh, god!

59
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,400
I lost my wallet somewhere.

60
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
All this together?

61
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
No... no...

62
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,100
Yes.

63
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,500
He is the man.

64
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,500
Which is it?

65
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,400
Oh, plus this.

66
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,300
$20.42

67
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
Watermelon.

68
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
Chicks dig it.

69
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,900
Thanks.

70
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,900
See you next time.

71
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Have a good time.

72
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Love these energy drinks, man.

73
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,100
My mom said kind of energy drink cleans.

74
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,500
One for breakfast, then two or three for a lunch...

75
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
I am the man.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,100
Yeah, right, Barry, I am the man.

77
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,000
By the fact, I'm so much the man I have a standing perscription

78
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,600
from medication to control my exaltity attacks.

79
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,100
God, I wish to add something else to release my stress!

80
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,700
Hello, Wesley!

81
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,300
You know, there are people. Beatiful people.

82
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,800
You just wish they could see you in a different set or get to different place.

83
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,300
Instead of where you're are, what you've become.

84
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Nicole is so hot!

85
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,400
What?

86
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,600
Boom thousand time laid!

87
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,500
But most of you wish you weren't such a pussy

88
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,200
for wishing for things that are never change.

89
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Good god of mine!

90
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
You're over here like in spring fucking breaking

91
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,500
and I still don't have that fucking billing report.

92
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Why would you to keep you around, Wesley?

93
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
I'll get done, Janice.

94
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,600
Oh, I've never heard that before.

95
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,900
I'll get it done

96
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I'll get in done, Janice.

97
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,100
I am sorry!

98
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Fuck that sorry, I don't need that sorry, I've hired you to get things done.

99
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
You know what the best thing is about the end of a day?

100
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,300
Tomorrow it starts all over again.

101
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,900
Hi.

110
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,000
I am sorry?

111
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,300
You apologize too much.

112
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
Sorry about that.

113
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,200
I knew your father.

114
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,500
My father left me while I was born, so...

115
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,900
Your father died yesterday on the roof top of the Metropolitan building.

116
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,700
Sorry.

117
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,000
Look, the liquor is around just over there, so ...

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Your father was one of the great assassins who ever lived.

119
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,100
The man who killed him is behind you.

120
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,000
DON'T MISS

121
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
LAST CHANCE!

122
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT THE EGG STORE

123
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000

Oh, Oh my god! Oh my god! What the fuck is that?

Please be quiet.

128
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,500
Please drive faster!

129
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,200
Quiet.

130

Please, understand that I care about my life!

131
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,700

132
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,600
but can you let me out and call the cops?

133
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Ah!

134
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,900
What are you doing?

135
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,600
Shit!

136
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
I think we lost him.

137
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,900
I think we lost him. Please let me

138
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh! Wow!

139
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,300
Shit!

140
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,900
Oh, shit.

He is right there!

142
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,700

144
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800

Shit!

162
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
Hello!

163
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,900

165
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Taller?

166
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,400
Sir... sir, I've been try to explain that lady here I'm an accounter...

168
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,000

169
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,100
If something will go wrong you can cut letter by email... she...

170
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,200
Shoot the wings off the flies.

171
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,100
I don't know what that means.

172
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Shoot the wings off the flies.

173
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,900
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else...

174
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,900
On thirdy. Either you should or I do.

175
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,600
One.

176
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,300
Okay.

177
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,300
Two.

178
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,800
I can't even see them!

179
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,500
Three.

180
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
It's impossible.

181
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
A lot of things were impossible for you today.

182
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,500
Your experience was not a panic attach.

183
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute.

184
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
Sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your blood stream.

185
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,900
This allows you to see and react faster than normal.

186
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,700
Only a few people in the world can do that.

187
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,700
Your father could do it.

188
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,500
And you can do it.

189
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,500
With a little work you will find how to control these attacks.

190
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Get away from me.

191
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,100
You stay back from me.

192
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
I have a gun, sir.

193
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,100
All right?

194
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
My name is Sloan.

195
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,000
This is Fox.

196
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,700
And all others you see around you are all very good at killing.

197
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,100
So if I were you, I'd keep your gun pointed at me,

198
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,200
you don't want it pointed at any of them.

199
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
That's better.

200
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,900
You're insane.

201
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,300
No. Insanity is wasting your life for a nothing

202
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
when you have a blood of a killer floating in veins.

203
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,300
Insanity is being shitted on, beated down.

204
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,800
Coasting through life in a miserable existence

205
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,100
when you have a caged lion locked inside you and the key to release it.

206
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,200
This gun you holding is an Imanishi-17, it belonged to your father.

207
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.

208
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,900
And you going to use it and to kill that man who shot him down and called blood.

209
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,200
The same man who tried to kill you tonight.

210
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Your father was one of us. A fraternity of assassins. The weapons of fate.

211
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,200
We've transferred all his savings over to you.

212
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,700
And let me I show you their awesome ...

213
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,600
It is your long avoided destiny.

214
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,700
To join us.

215
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,700
Back off. Back off.

216
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,500
You don't know anything about me.

217
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,300
Stay away from me. Stay away from me!

218
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,400
Would you stay away from me?

219
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,800
Would you stay away from me, please?

220
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
You let me through?

221
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,500
You know, when you have a dream...

222
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,200
And you're have awake.

223
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,200
But it still in a fridge in your brain.

224
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,900
Then you're open your eyes you so then glad it was a dream?

225
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,400
This was nothing like that.

226
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,400
One second, thank you.

227
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,600
Ok.

228
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,400
AVAILABLE BALANCE - $3,647,035.59

229
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,700
Shit!

230
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,000
Wesley!

231
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
What's up with you?

232
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,500
What do you mean?

233
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,600
Ah, you... you're here early.

234
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,000
Is that... Is that... you seem pepped up. You're all right?

235
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,200
Oh yeah.

236
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,200
Yeah.

237
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,000
I guess I feel... kind of different.

238
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,300
Whatever. I'm gonna get some boosteners do you want?

239
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,900
No.

240
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,400
Really?

241
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,500
Yeah.

242
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay.

243
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,200
Jesus age fucking popsicle!

244
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
I still don't have my billing reports.

245
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,200
But you have time to sit here and google you ass off...

246
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,100
Fine, but know a thing. You got your review coming up next week.

247
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,400
And I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes.

248
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Attitude: poor.

249
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
Performance: poor.

250
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Management skills: poor.

251
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,400
Works well with others? Ha, it's a fucking joke.

252
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,900
What is this bullshit?

253
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,700
Who is this prick?

254
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,300
Some looser gets a bullet on a roof top of Metropolitan...

255
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Shut the fuck up!!!

256
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,500
She has one single iota of tenuous power.

257
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,000
And you think you can push everyone around?

258
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,500
You don't need this.

259
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,900
I understand.

260
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,700
Junior high must mean kind of tough.

261
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,100
But it doesn't give you the right to threat your coworkers as a horse shit, Janice.

262
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,800
I know, we laugh at you, Janice.

263
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,300
We all know you keeping stashing jelly doughnuts on the top of your desk.

264
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,500
But I want you to know...

265
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,900
If you weren't such a bitch we'd feel sorry for you.

266
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:50,200
I do feel sorry for you. But as it's damaged what you behave...

267
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,100
I feel like I can speak for the entire office... I want to tell you...

268
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,600
Go fuck yourself.

269
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,900
Yeah. This was great, bro! Who's the man?

270
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,100
FUCK YO

271
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,500
I'm the man.

272
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,900
Hi!

273
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,600
Yeah!

274
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,200
It's... It's a bad idea.

275
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,100
Couldn't find your keys, ha?

276
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,400
It'll be handy, can you teach me that?

277
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,500
I'd might need that.

278
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,200
So Fox, right?

279
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,500
What's that?

280
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,300
Like Maverick, Topgun?

281
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,700
You could tell me, but you'd got to kill me?

282
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,700
I'm just kidding.

283
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,800
Check and control rotation on this STB, should be three hundred per minute.

284
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,400
This kind of ... got to be 4000.

285
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,900
Hey you! This is pretty awesome.

286
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
Ah?

287
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,700
Is it a front?

288
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Front for what?

289
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,600
I don't know. Assassinate suite?

290
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,800
You may think this is the front for something.

291
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,100
All I can tell you, this is a textile we own.

292
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,600
George, George! Go help Peter up there.

293
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,700
This is textile we own. And a damn good one.

294
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,700
Yeah, I get it. Keep that bullshit, right?

295
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,900
But we know these guys are killers, don't they?

296
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,400
If you own me some answers...

297
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,800
All right, clearly I don't understand, but...

298
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Do you make sweaters, or you kill people?

299
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,400
Kushai, moi maltchik, kushai... (eat my boy, eat, rus.)

300
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,200
Is it not a lot of questions on the coffee?

301
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,200
Are you sure you ready for the answers?

302
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,600
Yes, I'm sure.

303
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,500
Yeah, I can't come back.

304
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Go to my life.

305
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,400
He's all yours.

306
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,400
We're up.

307
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,300
How are you doing? I'm the Repairman.

308
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
What do you repair?

309
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,400
A lifetime of bad habits.

310
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
Okay.

311
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,900
Would you do me a favor?

312
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,200
Thus put your own if you mind to your back.

313
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,500
Ah, it's okay.

314
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
I don't know...

315
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Just put on your back.

316
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,100
Is this okay?

317
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Just relax.

318
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,000
It's a part of it?

319
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Here we go.

320
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,700
You don't put bag over my head?

321
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,300
No. There's no need for a bag.

322
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,900
It's not too tight, is it?

323
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,400
No, that's... nice.

324
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,100
Why did you come here, Wesley?

325
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,700
Well you brought me here, you remember?

326
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,900
What the fuck you do that for?

327
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,600
How many punches did the Repairman throb before ... ?

328
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,500
Oh I haven't spend a lifetime having my face smashed down before, all right?

329
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,200
Did you spend lot of time with knives?

330
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,400
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

331
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,400
It was a rhetorical question, Uno.

332
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,300
You interrupt me again, I use of ... nose out.

333
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,200
You ... only got to need, puto, Knives are easy to hide.

334
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,500
They own germs and they never run out of bullets.

335
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,500
They cruel and handy... when you gotta do some close contacts.

336
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,600
What the fuck?

337
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,100
Come in.

338
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,500
Come in!

339
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,000
Go try to cut me.

340
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
What?

341
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,100
Try to cut me.

342
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,900
Hey, just ... it me here.
Be careful with that, it's sharp!

343
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,200
Just stick, and... stick, and...
Why?

344
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,800
Seriously, then I can hurt you!

345
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
Okay.

346
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,400
Pussy.
I'm not a pussy.

347
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,400
You are pussy.

348
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm not a pussy.
You pussy.

349
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,300
I'm not a pussy, I gotta help you with that for a human condition.

350
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,100
Fuck that, you're pussy!
I'm not a pussy!

351
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,200
You pussy!
I'm not a pussy.

352
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,800
Come on, pussy!
I'm not a fucking pussy!

353
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,200
You, scank!

354
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,900
Hi. How are you doing?

355
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Fuck!

356
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,200
Just a moment.

357
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
Sorry.

358
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Hey, hey, come back, hey!

359
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,800
You must drink. Drink that.

360
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,900
Kholodnenkaya! (coldy, rus.)

361
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,500
RUSSIAN STANDARD

362
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,500
What is this?

363
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,600
This is the recovery room.

364
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,400
These bath stimulates blood cells and speed up the bruises.

365
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,200
Injures, briuses, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days.

366
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,800
Are you shitting me?

367
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,800
What is this, Vodka?

368
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,500
Yeah.

369
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,600
Are you russian?

370
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,400
Yeah.

371
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Get up.

372
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,800
This is the gunsmith.

373
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,700
He knows more about that piece than anybody else and going to teach you how to use it.

374
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,400
How are you doing?

375
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,100
Pretty good.

376
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,600
You know, Richard broke his leg.

377
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,900
Oh, really?

378
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah. In a three places.

379
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,900
How he did it?

380
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,100
Jumped off from building.

381
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,500
Seriously?

382
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,600
Yeah. Bad one.

383
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Oh my god.

384
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Oh my god, you guys did it so realistic.

385
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,900
He'd be in a recovery like for three days, and he said that they not even let him out.

386
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,600
Oh my god.

387
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,900
Oh my god!

388
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,800
Hey, we can't shoot in a dead woman!

389
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,500
She might be somebody's mom!

390
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,400
You need to know what is it like to put a bullet in a body.

391
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Why are you here?

392
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,000
You know, I... I thought I'm learning for a kind of super-assassin.

393
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,000
You know, If I wanted get beat up I would to stay to my cubicle, you know?

394
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Fuck.

395
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
All right, shoot the target.

396
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,400
From there.

397
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,900
You want me shoot through Wilbur?

398
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,100
No I want you to curve the bullet.

399
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
How am I supposed to do that?

400
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,100
It's not a question of "how".

401
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,100
It's a question of "what".

402
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,000
If no one told you that bullets flew straight.

403
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,800
And I'd gave you a gun and told you to hit the target, what would you do?

404
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Let your instincts guide you.

405
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,600
How the hell did you do that?

406
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,100
Can you do that? You do that. Hello?

407
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Hey, I can't get, this is rail training?

408
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,200
Then is.

409
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
Where it is go?

410
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,000
Come on!

411
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,500
Get go!

412
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,700
Are you out of your fucking mind?

413
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Ah, I feel... I feel...

414
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
I feel... I feel kind of good.

415
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,200
He got Victors.

416
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,300
Perfect sacked.

417
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,000
Impossible angle.

418
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,100
Cross is taking us out one by one.

419
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Wesley is the only one who can get to him.

420
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,700
Cross is closer with each hour.

421
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,400
Get back to work.

422
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
Do you see that?

423
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,600
Aha.

424
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,200
Look there is a shuttle.

425
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,500
I want you to try to catch it.

426
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You want me to stick my hand in there?

427
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,100
Yes. The way you catch it.

428
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,700
Wouldn't you put a gun on my head? I can pass this exam like with fly.

429
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,400
You need to learn to control that by yourself.

430
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,700
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

431
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
How is it going today, Wesley?

432
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,500
No... Fuck the litter, fuck the Repairman.

433
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,300
I can shoot the wings off the back of the fly!

434
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,400
I'm ready!

435
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,700
You will ready when Fox says you ready.

436
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,000
Who puts her in charge?

437
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,800
I did.

438
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,600
Wesley.

439
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
People think you use cheese to catch this beauties.

440
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,300
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.

441
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,100
Your farther was a big fan of this.

442
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,000
Watch!

443
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,800
Right...

444
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,800
Plastic explosive of peanut butter.

445
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,500
Sorry, Mickey.

446
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,100
Five... four... three... two... one...

447
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Hey.

448
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,800
Hey, Russian!

449
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,300
Good for that one.

450
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,000
Imagine if you had a thousand?

451
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,100
Are they fucked you didn't they?

452
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,600
What the hell did they do to you?

453
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,900
Threw you in front of a moving train for no reason?

454
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,200
Beat the shit out of you?

455
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,100
You know, you gotta say this place is bullshit.

456
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,500
This is bullshit, ha? Bullshit?

457
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,700
To Repairman in five minutes.

458
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,500
Heads ... out of a question.

459
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,800
Fuck.

460
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,700
You are wasting my fucking time. Why are you here?

461
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,400
I don't know, so hit me.

462
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,400
Why are you here?

463
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,400
I had shit live, so were wouldn't I?

464
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,200
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

465
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,500
What do you want me to say?

466
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,700
Why are you here?

467
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I don't know!

468
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,900
Why are you here?

469
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,200
I don't know why I'm here.

470
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,400
Why are you here?

471
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,000
What did you say?

472
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,500
I said I don't know who I am.

473
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,100
Do you really want to know who you are?

474
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,400
Yeah, It's my room.

475
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,500
No.

476
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,900
This was your father's room.

477
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,800
What happened?

478
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,300
Remember this fraternity went broke.

479
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,800
Cross...

480
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,000
Hi started by killing the one man who was better than him.

481
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,600
Your father.

482
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,300
Laid him ... on the roof top.

483
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,600
Betrayed him.

484
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:48,000
Everything in this room - books, weapons, clothes - belong to him.

485
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,100
Now they belong to you.

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,400
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

487
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,300
Maybe beyond we'll find to got who you are.

488
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,400
Now I know why I can never care about anything before this.

489
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,900
I was living a lie.

490
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,300
Finally I have a chance to step into my father's shoes.

491
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,600
Grow up here.

492
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,200
Live the life I was born to live.

493
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,500
I've been pissing it all the way like it was another fucking billing report.

494
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,300
I've to train harder.

495
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,400
I have to be as good as my father.

496
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,900
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the fraternity kills.

497
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,900
Everything you will need to kill your attorney.

498
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,900
To kill Cross,

499
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,900
the man, who betrayed fraternity and murdered my father

500
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,200
I must prepare.

501
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,000
I have to become his student.

502
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,600
Memorise every move he ever made.

503
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,300
Every attack he ever executed.

504
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,500
While he dropped a patient in a ... surrounded by secret service agency.

505
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,500
And took up that business man in the elevator.

506
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,500
His bullets untraceable of course.

507
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,300
Whatever what method, what the weapon and how he eliminates his target.

508
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,100
He was always one chess move ahead.

509
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,900
One move more prepared.

510
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,800
One step quicker.

511
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
One shot more precise.

512
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,100
In fact in all my research i've found he never missed a target.

513
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,600
Not until me.

514
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,800
Yeah!

515
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,300
First time when you alive, Wesley, you're in control.

516
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,900
Shoot the target.

517
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,800
You crazy.

518
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,200
Welcome to fraternity.

519
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,600
We call this the loom of fate.

520
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,900
After today, you will never set foot in here again.

521
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,100
Why not?

522
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,900
Because you're like an apostol.

523
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:07,200
Your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.

524
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:15,400
Every culture in history has a secret code, one you'll not find in traditional texts.

525
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,600
A thousand years ago

526
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,500
a clan of weathers discovered a mystical language written in the fabric.

527
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,600
They called themselves the fraternity.

528
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,700
To be honest with you, all I see here are threads.

529
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,800
Come here.

530
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,500
Look here.

531
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,400
Do you see that blind thread that missed the weave and lies on top of the others?

532
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,600
Like in a ... stank?

533
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
No, it's a code.

534
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,900
If the vertical thread is on top - it's a one.

535
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,400
If it's below - it's a zero.

536
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,400
Binary code?

537
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
What is it say?

538
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,200
It's a name.

539
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,800
A target.

540
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,500
Where that names come from?

541
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:11,800
A matter of necessity, Wesley. Necessity to maintain balance in a world.

542
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,800
They are orders and must be executed.

543
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:21,800
Aim ... to us, so that we might afford stability of the chaos.

544
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,900
This one is yours.

545
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,200
But I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.

546
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,600
You will. In a time.

547
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,200
This is your first assignment.

548
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:46,100
The loom provides, I interpret, you deliver.

549
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,100
You want me to kill Robert Dean Darden?

550
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,600
Not me. Fate.

551
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,900
The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair.

552
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,100
There are six windows.

553
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,400
You will shoot through the fifth.

554
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,300
Fifth window.

555
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
Now.

556
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,200
What did he do if he deserved to die?

557
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,200
You don't know.

558
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,900
I don't know he was bad, I don't know he was evil.

559
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,000
I don't know anything about him.

560
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,500
We get all orders from the... loom.

561
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,000
Fate?

562
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,900
How am I suppose to take that as a fate and what we're doing is right?

563
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,600
Killing someone we know nothing about.

564
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,900
I don't know if I can do that.

565
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,600
There were 20 years ago. There was this girl.

566
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,900
Her dad was a federal judge.

567
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,700
And such her probably had in her mind is ... follow his footsteps.

568
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,100
So she's home one Christmas.

569
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,300
And her dad is on a this big racketiring case.

570
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,800
The defenders want to get this after judge.

571
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,100
One they can buy off.

572
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,600
So they hire this guy...

573
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,500
Max Petridge.

574
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,100
Get him to pay her father a visit.

575
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,400
And a way he pays people a visit...

576
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,000
Is to brake in...

577
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,900
And tie ... once.

578
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,100
And force them to watch, while he burns his targets alive.

579
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,100
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it around...

580
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,800
And brands his initials at each one of them so they will never ever forget.

581
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,700
After I was recruited into the fraternity

582
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,400
I found out that Max Petridge's is name that come up.

583
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,600
Weeks before the federal judge was killed.

584
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:10,500
At matter fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger.

585
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:18,300
We don't know how far do ripples of our decisions go...

586
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Kill one, and maybe save the thousand.

587
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,600
That's the code of the fraternity.

588
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That's what we beleive in.

589
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,400
And that's why we do it.

590
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,700
Cross.

591
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,400
Not yet.

592
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,000
Your target will be an the black limo.

593
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,800
He always travels the same six blocks on Holsten.

594
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,600
You have three blocks to kill him.

595
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,800
I am sorry.

596
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,400
Wesley!

597
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,200
Hey, where have you been, I'm really missed you, man.

598
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,100
Look at the big man!

599
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,800
You fucking asshole!

600
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,100
What, you don't ... for weeks and stopped to use the bathroom?

601
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,400
You are nothing! No, you are less than nothing!

602
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,500
You're not even half the man who Barry is!

603
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,600
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!

604
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,300
Who the hell is she, Wesley?

605
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:45,000
Your new whore? Is that is a chick that you're paying for it?

606
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,900
Wesley?

607
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,800
He is the man.

608
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,900
You all right?

609
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,300
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

610
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,700
Go and sit down, I'm gonna find a car.

611
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,900
Big night! I've ... covering.

612
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,200
Shit!

613
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,400
You, fuck!

614
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,300
Freeze!

615
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,000
Bullet time...

616
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,000
What is he doing here?

617
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:09,800
Oh god! Pull him up.

618
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,200
A thousand.

619
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,600
This bullet...

620
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,800
is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.

621
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,800
It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky.

622
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,100
He works this out where is now a monastery of eastern Moravia.

623
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,100
This place Is where our fraternity was born.

624
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,400
He's taunting me.

625
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
He's sending me a mesage.

626
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,000
I'm gonna send one back.

627
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,500
He's trapping you.

628
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,300
He think you took place he knows very well.

629
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,200
Look, I know this... I...

630
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,600
Isn't this what you've trained me for?

631
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,000
You can't go alone.

632
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:02,100
I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.

633
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,300
Remember, one of the fraternity is dead because of me.

634
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,300
Okay.

635
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,500
Go.

636
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,500
Thank you.

637
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,900
I don't thing it's a good idea.

638
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,400
Your next assignment.

639
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,500
Pekwarsky?

640
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,400
Shit.

641
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,900
What are you doing here?

642
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,700
Lower your gun.

643
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,500
You recognize this?

644
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,900
I pulled this out of my shoulder.

645
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,700
The guy who put it there killed my father.

646
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,100
And I know you made it so tell me where it is.

647
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,700
I did modded this but I can't be responsible for a people who used them.

648
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,700
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.

649
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,400
Look at my finger.

650
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:41,600
I... can try to arrange a meet.

651
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,000
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?

652
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,600
What do you mean?

653
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,900
I don't know.

654
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:16,700
Being... somebody else... somebody... normal.

655
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,200
No.

656
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,900
Wesley...

657
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,900
Out of the way, out of the way!

658
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,300
Wesley...

659
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,300
Listen to me.

660
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,900
Shut the fuck off!

661
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,300
You better don't talk to me.

662
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,900
You don't get to talk to me.

663
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,200
Everything they told you - was a lie.

664
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,700
Shut the fuck up, piece of shit, you shitfucker!

665
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,100
You are my son.

666
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,400
What?

667
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,900
What did you say to me?

668
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,500
Is that true?

669
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:21,700
Yes.

670
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,400
Why did you make me do that?

671
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:28,500
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.

672
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,400
You knew, god damn it!

673
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,200
You're do ... ha?

674
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,900
Well, his name came up.

675
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,300
So did yours.

676
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,900
I promised to your father I'll bring you back here.

677
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,200
What the fuck?

678
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,100
He said it was the only way you'd believe.

679
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:11,500
Your father was never ... a common trick way.

680
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,700
It is me.

681
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,500
He was my father.

682
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,300
And I killed him.

683
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:43,100
Your father... protecting you was what giving up his life.

684
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:48,100
Protect me? He shoot ... to fucking kill me!

685
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,400
No, he wasn't trying to kill you.

686
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,200
He was trying to rescue you.

687
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,700
When Cross left the Fraternity Sloan hunted you down.

688
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,500
Ever since Fox had a ... on you he's been trying to separate you from them.

689
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,100
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley.

690
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,800
He wanted a different path for you.

691
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
With things that he could never have.

692
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:32,400
Home, peace.

693
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,500
No.

694
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,300
He wanted you to find your own way.

695
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,900
Your father got ... of this.

696
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,500
Decypher it yourself.

697
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:59,900
Sloan began manufacturing targets for his own for profit years ago.

698
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,400
Your father found out all about it.

699
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,600
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?

700
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,300
But Sloan turned everyone against him.

701
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,900
My father's name never in came up, did it?

702
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:16,100
No. Holding on a code made him a target.

703
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,900
Yes.

704
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,800
You want me to run?

705
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,400
No. I want you to live.

706
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,600
You can have a different life, Wesley.

707
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,700
Like your father wanted for you.

708
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,100
We trained him well.

709
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,400
My father wasn't right about one thing.

710
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,900
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.

711
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,300
It's taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain...

712
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:07,100
And most important lead that every job has a perfect weapon.

713
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:12,600
Well, I am the perfect weapon.

714
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:18,200
I am supposed to run? No, I'm doing that my entire life.

715
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,800
So I said no.

716
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:27,100
I said kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.

717
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,500
Kill him.

718
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,100
Pussy. Pussy.

719
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:45,500
Sloan!

720
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,200
Hey.

721
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:04,800
My father wasn't a traitor.

722
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,200
This is a kill order.

723
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,800
This got Sloan's name on it.

724
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,400
What did you say to me?

725
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,900
It's a name. It's a... It's a target.

726
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,500
I don't want this person dead.

727
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:29,700
Fate does.

728
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:34,400
Fate wanted you dead.

729
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,900
And he couldn't take it. So he started manufacturing his own targets.

730
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,700
For his own gains.

731
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,600
And that's my dad found that. And decided to stand against him.

732
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:52,500
And that's one you've send a man's son to kill his father.

733
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:58,200
You're not an assassin of fate.

734
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:03,200
You just a thug who can bend bullets.

735
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,900
Is that true?

736
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,400
Here is what the truth is.

737
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,000
Your name came up.

738
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,100
Your name came up.

739
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:02,900
Your name came up.

740
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,900
Your name.

741
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:10,100
Your name. Yours.

742
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,100
Everyone in this room.

743
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:22,600
If I had not done what I did,

744
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,000
You would all be dead.

745
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,700
I've saved your lives.

746
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,300
Now look where we are.

747
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,900
We are stronger than ever.

748
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,400
Changing a cost of history as we sealed.

749
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,300
Choosing a targets we select.

750
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:50,600
We can redistribute power were we see fate.

751
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,000
The wolf rule.

752
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,100
Not a sheep.

753
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:04,300
Now if any of you feel the need to follow the code of the fraternity to the latter.

754
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:11,900
I invite you to take your gun, put it in your mouth, and pull the trigger.

755
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,500
That is what Wesley demands.

756
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,100
Otherwise.

757
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,100
Shoot this motherfucker.

758
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:28,300
and let us take our fraternity lasts to the highs reserved only for the gods of men.

759
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,300
You choose.

760
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,100
Fuck the code.

761
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Sloan!

762
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:21,000
Sloan!

763
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:39,300
Six weeks ago I was ordinary and patheric.

764
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:43,400
Just like you.

765
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,200
Well who am I now?

766
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:52,200
Account manager?

767
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:55,400
Assassin?

768
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:00,400
Or just another tool, who was mindfucked and he killed his father.

769
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:04,000
I am all of these.

770
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,300
I am none of these.

771
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:12,000
Who am I now?

772
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,400
This is not me, fulfilling my destiny.

773
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:53,000
This is not me, following in my father's footsteps.

774
01:36:54,900 --> 01:37:01,000
This is definitely not me saving the world.

775
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:19,500
Still trying to figure out who you are?

776
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,100
This is not me.

777
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:28,000
This is just a motherfucking decoy.

778
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:37,000
Oh, fuck.

779
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,800
This is me, taking control.

780
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,500
From Sloan.

781
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,400
From the fraternity.

782
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,500
From Janice.

783
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:52,800
From billing reports. From ergonomic keyboards.

784
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:57,500
From cheating girlfriends and suck-a-shit best friends.

785
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:04,300
This is me taking that control of my life.

786
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,600
What the fuck have you done lately?
