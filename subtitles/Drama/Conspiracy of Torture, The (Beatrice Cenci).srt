1
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,844
You have 10 minutes left.

2
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,528
Jesus, My Father!

3
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,235
About the topic related to
"The 95 Theses" in Question 2...

4
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,676
Is the answer Martin Luther in B?

5
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,736
Yes. That was the answer.

6
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,780
It was quite hard.
But I made it somehow.

7
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,718
It was hard for you, I suppose.

8
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:29,529
I'm in awe of this school.

9
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,272
It's okay for you to look around.

10
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,782
Thank you for coming.

11
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,340
Thank you.

12
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,536
Maria...

13
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,508
Today was kind of a shocking day

14
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,655
Maria...

15
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,854
I'm a bad girl.

16
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,328
Maria...

17
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,568
Please be quiet...

18
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,734
Maria...

19
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,344
I'm...

20
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,907
I'm coming...

21
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,019
I came.

22
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:59,136
Sacred Honesty Girls' School
Entrance Ceremony, Heisei 26 (2014)

23
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,648
Maria... I somehow got
admitted to this school!

24
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,615
The top-ranking scorers
from all over Japan...

25
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,248
vie for admission to this
coveted girls' school...

26
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,918
making the entrance exam
very hard for everyone!

27
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,479
Ms. Yuzuki Muto!

28
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,585
Yes?

29
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,701
Wait...

30
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,591
Excuse me...

31
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,247
Excuse me!

32
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:34,297
I don't know what's going on but
you shouldn't do things like this!

33
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,665
I'm okay Ms. Yuzuki Muto.

34
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,499
This is our club's activity

35
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,973
Your club?

36
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,945
Welcome to the Torture Club!

37
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,026
What is that?

38
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,919
This is the place where we study and practice
torture as our extra-curricular activity

39
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:10,600
Our goal is to facilitate torture battles,
which take place between two club members.

40
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,566
And I'm Yuri Kobashi,
the president of the club.

41
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,309
This is Maika Shinzaki,
a first year student.

42
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,875
Waite minute!

43
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,776
Why am I involved
with the Torture Club?

44
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,677
That's right.

45
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,596
This is the answer sheet
from your entrance exam.

46
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,799
We secretly mixed a torture qualification
test into the entrance exam...

47
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,067
in order to assess the torture
skills of the applicants.

48
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,506
What?

49
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:58,478
According to these results, you are clearly
very talented at torturing people.

50
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,049
No way!

51
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,142
Admitted
Outstanding Torture Skills

52
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:08,692
I just intuited the answers and didn't think it
through at all because it was too hard for me.

53
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:13,219
The torture test is only effective
when you follow your intuition.

54
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,026
But...

55
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,335
I can't torture people!

56
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,572
It hurts!

57
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,277
Help me!

58
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,015
Help me!

59
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,419
You can't fight it.

60
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:45,590
The Torture Club is the club with the longest
tradition and it's fully recognized by the school.

61
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:54,162
If a student commits a crime, they will bear
the torture here and reflect on their conduct.

62
00:14:54,494 --> 00:15:00,137
The Torture Club has the responsibility
of keeping order at our school.

63
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:12,484
But I didn't do anything wrong!

64
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,354
Then why am I...

65
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,124
Wait!

66
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,606
You...

67
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,039
You really didn't do anything bad at all?

68
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,190
To what extent do you think violent conduct
can be excused in order to achieve a goal?

69
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,929
Umm...

70
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,325
On the entrance exam day...

71
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,657
...my underwear disappeared.

72
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,795
Did you steal it?

73
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,433
No...

74
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,902
I didn't.

75
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,481
Lying is a major crime.

76
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,656
On the entrance exam day...

77
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,825
Were you in the changing room?

78
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,767
No... I wasn't.

79
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,105
There wasn't anybody else there, Yuzuki.

80
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,376
Who stole my underwear?

81
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,045
It wasn't me!

82
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,548
People are more vulnerable to tickling
than they tend to think.

83
00:16:55,381 --> 00:17:00,956
You will suffer breathing
difficulties and pass out.

84
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,028
Sorry!

85
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,067
The one who stole your underwear was me!

86
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,854
The Pear of Agony

87
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,492
This is a torture device which is used against
a person who has done something corrupt.

88
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:38,362
If I put this into a vagina and unfurl it,
the vagina will be destroyed.

89
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,945
Why did you steal it?

90
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,455
I don't know.

91
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,708
I'm going to stretch the hole.
Are you sure?

92
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,584
Pee?

93
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,758
You can pee in that position.

94
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:47,068
I'm begging you.
Please let me use the toilet.

95
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,469
Pathetic.

96
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,042
All right. Let's go to the toilet together...

97
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,049
I can't do this!

98
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,829
What are you going to do?

99
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,101
- What have you done?
- I don't know!

100
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,179
Shit! Yuzuki, why don't you confess?

101
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:38,311
I don't know! I mean that
underwear was very...

102
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,085
Okay then!
Just release me already!

103
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:41,887
Yes...

104
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,155
What? You tightened it...

105
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,565
Yuzuki!

106
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,310
Yuzuki Muto.

107
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,019
You are very talented.
Joining the Torture Club is your destiny

108
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,456
No way...

109
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,691
I can't torture anyone!

110
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,171
Sorry!

111
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,877
Maria, I'm in big trouble!

112
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,801
To: Yuzuki
1 Attached File
I can spread this anytime.

113
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:05,807
Sorry! The one who stole
your underwear was me!

114
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,478
Ms. Yuzuki Muto, you left
something in your club room.

115
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,849
Please come to Club Room G right away

116
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,929
The school life I had dreamed
turned out to actually be...

117
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:43,905
Nothing but torture!

118
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,614
The Torture Club

119
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,717
- Hello.
- Hello.

120
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,547
Too late! Have you brought
your application?

121
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,499
The purpose of the Torture Club
is to train a torturer or spy

122
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,627
Someone who could get the job done if
they were dispatched to a war zone.

123
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,262
We are strengthening minds through torture.

124
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,069
I'm sorry President.

125
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,575
I'm not sure about becoming
a torturer or spy...

126
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:21,634
The enemies!

127
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,814
They use various kinds of torture in order
to obtain confidential information.

128
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,908
You need strong endurance
against all kinds of torture.

129
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,812
Endurance...

130
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,553
Bear it.

131
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,896
Yuzuki.

132
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,496
Yes...

133
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,973
Your skin is showing.

134
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,342
What...

135
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,966
Embarrassed?

136
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,404
I'm embarrassed...

137
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:05,151
Embarrassing the victim to the fullest is one
of the most important tasks of a torturer.

138
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,761
First, reveal the embarrassing
things about the victim.

139
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,089
Strip the victim of all dignity

140
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,467
I'm so embarrassed it hurts.

141
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,845
Aoi, I can't take it anymore...

142
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,585
Yuzuki.

143
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,657
This is your limit at the moment.

144
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,827
If something like this already makes you scream,
the problem is clearly the weakness of your mind.

145
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:56,165
The most important thing is that you
learn to protect your mind.

146
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,368
Protect my mind...

147
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,736
Well...

148
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:07,069
If they put pressure on your weak mind, you'll
even end up confessing things you didn't do.

149
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:12,579
You can't become a torturer or spy
who deals with national intelligence.

150
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,883
President...

151
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,557
I can't become something like a spy...

152
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,582
First!

153
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,460
Strengthening your mind.

154
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,422
That's the required quality for a torturer.

155
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,997
Now, torture Maika!

156
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:36,610
Is she okay?

157
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,150
Maika is still a first-year student but she's been with
us since she was in elementary school. No worries.

158
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,543
I'm going to pull.

159
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:09,539
Judas' Cradle.
One of the harshest tortures.

160
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,444
Aoi... That's...

161
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,444
That's right.

162
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:20,182
If I let go of this rope, the tip will
go directly between her legs.

163
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,286
That's... What if she gets stabbed...

164
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:27,387
I'll be okay because my
endurance is high enough.

165
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,432
Enough...

166
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,080
You can't do that, Aoi!

167
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,639
Maika, are you going to give up?

168
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,549
No, no, not yet...

169
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,359
It's inside! I said it's inside!

170
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,067
No, Aoi!
You can't do that!

171
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,501
Too weak.

172
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,406
Yuri, show her an ideal example.

173
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,941
You leave me no choice.

174
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:41,735
There are two kinds of people. Those who are good at
torturing and those who are good at <i>being</i> tortured.

175
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,098
And you are...

176
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,808
Isn't it obvious?

177
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,409
I'm like you. I torture.

178
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,576
Like me...

179
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,490
Follow me to death from now on.

180
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,500
Is it really okay?

181
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,726
1!

182
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,864
Sorry...

183
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,063
2!

184
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,729
Sorry

185
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,102
Don't say sorry!

186
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:20,807
Sorry...

187
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:22,910
Sorry

188
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,481
I said like this!

189
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,346
Hit her now!

190
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,319
Thank you very much.

191
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,357
Aoi, that's...

192
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,487
Yuzuki.

193
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,924
Throw away your embarrassment!

194
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,804
Maria.

195
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,176
The Torture Club is very strict.

196
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,647
How can I keep going?

197
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:47,695
Of course, because of my seniors...

198
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:56,166
Excuse me, is it true that you're
doing the same club activity as Aoi?

199
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,332
Well... Yes.

200
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,940
She's so cool, isn't she?

201
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,986
Yes, she is.

202
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,182
Yuzuki...

203
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,356
I'll definitely kill you.

204
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,639
Yuzuki! Endure it!

205
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,267
- It hurts!
- It doesn't!

206
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,777
It doesn't hurt! It hurts!

207
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,898
President... President...

208
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,638
No, I just...

209
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,612
I beg you! Don't tell her!

210
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,848
I won't do that kind of thing...

211
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,892
If I got busted, I...

212
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:26,220
Maika, you like the president...

213
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,728
Yuzuki! What are you doing?

214
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,595
Are you some kind of spy?

215
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:50,809
You should have a strong mind
to be able to keep on torturing.

216
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:55,689
Therefore, having romantic feelings is
prohibited, because it weakens our minds.

217
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,428
Torture is different from simple S&M, which
is practiced in the pursuit of pleasure.

218
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,395
If something goes wrong,
you can get seriously hurt.

219
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,599
I see.

220
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,265
So...

221
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,268
If it comes out that I have
a crush on the president...

222
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:16,103
I can't participate in the
club activities anymore.

223
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,615
But how can you keep containing that feeling?

224
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:32,154
I'm strengthening my mind through torture
in order to contain my feelings.

225
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,993
So, let's do it together, Yuzuki.

226
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,093
Yes.

227
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,865
Of course, your feelings for Aoi
are quite strong as well.

228
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,901
You knew?

229
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,447
As a member of the club
I have certain skills.

230
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,659
Giving up already?

231
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,624
No. Not yet.

232
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:21,835
Will I be able to do it too?

233
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,878
What's wrong?

234
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,988
Hold it. I know you can do it.

235
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,224
Aoi.

236
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,669
- I...
- Yuzuki.

237
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,600
Stop whining.

238
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,237
You can't stay childish and weak forever.

239
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,269
Aoi...

240
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,805
I...

241
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,915
Can I become strong?

242
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,286
You definitely will.

243
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,730
You can still take more.

244
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:17,989
Aoi!

245
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,069
It hurts! It hurts!

246
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,580
That's enough. We've finished.

247
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:47,529
My Father in the sky My prayer is...

248
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,937
I can see you have anxieties because of
the Torture Review. Your mind is weak.

249
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,478
Please forgive me.

250
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,672
Mother.

251
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:11,279
You need a strong body and mind
in order to torture someone.

252
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:19,996
To train those things, you need to hurt
the person you least wish to hurt.

253
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:25,599
Hurt the person I least wish to hurt...

254
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,837
First of all, you have to know
who that person is.

255
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:40,846
What should I do about my feelings for Aoi?

256
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,249
I don't think I can become strong.

257
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,864
From: Yuri
A training camp is scheduled at
Aoi's house during summer break.

258
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,598
A training camp?

259
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:17,212
Aoi's family is traditionally
a torture family

260
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,811
A torture family?

261
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,117
Yes.

262
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:26,395
I heard their family tradition started
during the Middle Ages in Europe.

263
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:31,097
The reason why her expertise is on the torturing side
is because she has to follow the family tradition.

264
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,970
I heard she is even prohibited
to be on the victim side.

265
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,606
I see.

266
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,934
It seems there are some
torture devices at her house.

267
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,504
Yuzuki, you don't know what kind
of things will happen to you.

268
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,175
Wait. Stop, Maika.

269
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,628
Well, Aoi. Please explain.

270
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:07,197
Today's goal is to teach the Funaki
family's traditional torturing skills...

271
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:12,206
to Yuzuki and Maika and strengthen
their minds significantly

272
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,587
What do you think is the most
undesired thing for a girl?

273
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,897
What is that?

274
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:44,796
Honey? Don't they like that?

275
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,908
The most undesired thing
for girls in general.

276
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,442
It's bugs.

277
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,180
Bugs...

278
00:37:56,541 --> 00:38:00,011
A special kind of insect
inhabits this garden.

279
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,185
They are following the smell of honey

280
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,727
Wait a minute, please.

281
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:14,265
This is the traditional Funaki family
torture called Bug Attack.

282
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,206
Bugs! Bugs!

283
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,337
Actually I have impressive
memories about Bug Attack.

284
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:29,617
I was once covered with honey and left
alone for a whole night after I broke a rule.

285
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:39,355
I once lost my mind because of the unpleasant
feeling of their bites all over my body

286
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,906
It's going inside!

287
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,840
I can't do this!

288
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,158
I'm going to give you the
punishment for running away

289
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,829
Hurry up. Follow me.

290
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,341
Do you know what that is?

291
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,777
An Iron Maiden.

292
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,608
The inside is covered
with needles in a circle.

293
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:39,280
Transgressors are tortured by putting them
inside and poking them with the needles.

294
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,420
Get in.

295
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,187
Aoi... I will die.

296
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,787
No! Aoi!

297
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,498
No!

298
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,868
No!

299
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,678
I didn't think you'd pass out.

300
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,316
Look.

301
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,380
It's made of rubber.

302
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:21,720
The Iron Maiden is an execution device
made to put the fear into whoever sees it.

303
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,359
Meaning that seeing it alone
is already a kind of torture.

304
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,903
When I was young, I would get
locked up in this after breaking rules.

305
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,747
I wanted to let you know too, Yuzuki.

306
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,743
If I were you,
I would've been traumatized.

307
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:53,161
When I was young,
I cried just coming near here.

308
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,995
Was it scary for you too?

309
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:04,707
Everyone has something unknown inside.

310
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,835
You are the same.

311
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:18,320
You just haven't gotten wise about
your hidden talent for torturing yet.

312
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,228
But...

313
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,228
Aoi...

314
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,799
I'm just weak. That's all.

315
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,934
Yuzuki...

316
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,098
When are you going to stop
saying things like that?

317
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,710
But...

318
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,707
Aoi!

319
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,742
I...

320
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:59,259
Sorry! There's a bug on your breast...

321
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:03,766
What? A bug? Where?
Hurry and get it off me!

322
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,569
Hurry!

323
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,241
Maybe it moved somewhere.

324
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,541
It's still there.

325
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,084
Yuzuki...

326
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,986
It's okay now.

327
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,710
You got bitten by the bugs.
Sorry about that.

328
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,754
Aoi has been trying hard because
the Torture Review is coming up soon.

329
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,026
Maybe she overdid it.

330
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,424
I'm just doing a precisely
calculated strength training.

331
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,598
That is Yuzuki's...

332
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:16,298
You want her to enlighten herself
about her talent for torturing people?

333
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,906
Yes. That's it.

334
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,294
Hey Yuzuki.

335
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,762
Yes?

336
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,875
Do you want to torture me?

337
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,103
What?

338
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:05,618
Do you want to torture and hurt me?

339
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,583
No way! Aoi!

340
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:13,657
I don't want to hurt you.

341
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,230
I see.

342
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,035
Yuzuki.

343
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,463
I'm going to be the one
being tortured this time.

344
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:28,305
Aoi?!

345
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:32,607
I can't do it!
You are not allowed to be tortured...

346
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,334
ls it really okay?

347
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,236
Hurry up.

348
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:35,706
Yes.

349
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,757
Calm down.

350
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,357
Tighten it more as I told you.

351
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,258
Yes.

352
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,329
- Are you okay?
- You don't have to ask.

353
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:06,806
Yes.

354
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,105
Next. Hurry up.

355
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,533
Yes.

356
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,705
Sorry

357
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,217
Harder!

358
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,181
Yes.

359
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,495
Yuzuki, stop holding back!

360
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,795
Yes.

361
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,145
Yuzuki.

362
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,846
You need determination!

363
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,449
Aoi...

364
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,388
Aoi!

365
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,548
Let's return to the separate lesson.

366
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,644
Yes.

367
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,502
Yes.

368
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,438
Aoi...

369
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,250
Is your injury okay?

370
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,311
Yuzuki?

371
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,950
I have brought medicine.

372
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:00,666
Sorry

373
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,374
I...

374
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:15,483
I'm reflecting on what you
said to me today

375
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,587
Everyone has something unknown inside.

376
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,183
That's right. You're...

377
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:32,892
You've been lying to yourself
because of the rules of your family

378
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,105
Aoi.

379
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:48,316
I can help you.

380
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,543
Wrong.

381
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:55,788
The reason why I allowed myself to be tortured today was
just that I wanted to enlighten you about your talent.

382
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,616
Aoi...

383
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,124
- I'm...
- Doesn't matter what I do.

384
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,299
The training camp is over.

385
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,729
Check it after using it.

386
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,768
Sorry

387
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,146
Keep going forward.
Don't lose to your mind.
- Aoi

388
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,445
Maria.

389
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,657
I'm...

390
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,428
Strong...

391
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,888
I'm going to be strong.

392
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,458
I'm going to be strong!

393
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:35,623
Dear God, please forgive my sinful mind.

394
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,456
One!

395
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,597
Two!

396
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,598
One!

397
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,364
Two!

398
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,208
One!

399
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,009
Two!

400
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,045
Yuzuki.

401
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,811
What are you doing...

402
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,944
Please be quiet.

403
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,514
You'll be busted.

404
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:50,491
You've hidden your own masochistic nature.

405
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:55,667
It's wrong to keep hiding your own nature.

406
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,228
You taught me that.

407
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,136
Why are you doing this?

408
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,777
I'm going to strip away your dignity

409
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:13,649
What will people think if a senior member of a club
is being harassed like this on a bus by her junior?

410
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,587
Yuzuki, please stop.

411
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,555
Are you embarrassed?

412
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,418
Stop it, Yuzuki.

413
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,029
Are you embarrassed?

414
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,265
Yes.

415
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:05,832
Good morning, everyone.

416
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:10,678
This summer has been very hot, as usual.

417
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:14,644
I'm happy that every student has
come back with renewed energy...

418
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,557
Aoi.

419
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,153
It's cruel.

420
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:36,170
This is where I saw you for the first time.

421
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:45,075
You were spanking yourself in here.

422
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,071
Stop.

423
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,016
Why were you doing something
like that at school?

424
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,517
I didn't do anything like that.

425
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,915
Aoi...

426
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,326
Lying is a major crime.

427
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,867
You can't punish yourself for your own crime.

428
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,210
I'm going to punish you.

429
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:44,671
You've been hiding your masochistic nature.

430
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,407
You've felt guilty about it!

431
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,345
You have been prohibited
to show your real self!

432
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,810
Nobody tried to understand you.

433
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,622
But...

434
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,928
I can understand you!

435
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:19,540
Aoi!

436
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:23,011
I'm sorry

437
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:29,451
I have...

438
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,447
hidden my masochistic self.

439
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:43,625
I have hidden my prohibited masochistic self.

440
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,197
Aoi... Aoi...

441
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,368
Forgive me.

442
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,705
I think it's okay

443
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,868
Stop...

444
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:10,315
It's not 'Stop', is it?

445
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:16,751
Say Stop it, please.

446
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,622
Stop it, please.

447
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,196
Aoi.

448
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,998
You're just one helpless masochistic woman.

449
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:57,754
You're this wet?

450
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:41,694
Aoi... I'm coming!

451
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,648
Do you know why this is happening?

452
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:44,178
Having a romantic relationship
is prohibited in the Torture Club.

453
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,428
You know that.

454
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:54,598
Transgressors should be punished.

455
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,517
Why did you have a romantic relationship?

456
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,758
Nothing good will come out,
even if you shut your mouth.

457
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,700
Aoi.

458
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,393
What should we do?

459
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,744
Please stop.

460
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:32,339
It must be hard to swallow that someone
you love becomes sexually incapable.

461
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:39,069
Please torture me.

462
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,216
Okay Let's do it then.

463
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,584
President.

464
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,953
- I can't do this anymore...
- Maika.

465
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,953
We must have faith.

466
01:05:58,822 --> 01:05:59,892
Yes...

467
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,698
Pull!

468
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:16,945
Aoi.

469
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,916
You love Yuzuki, right?

470
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:49,648
Look

471
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,317
Stop...

472
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:08,235
It's not 'Stop', is it?

473
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,366
Say "Stop it, please".

474
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,204
How could you possibly forget
that you were under surveillance?

475
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:16,800
Fucking ridiculous!

476
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,274
Stop it please.

477
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:23,948
Can I stop?

478
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,812
Aoi.

479
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,157
You're just one helpless masochistic woman.

480
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,278
Why did you break the rule?

481
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,722
Why don't you answer?

482
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,030
Maika, pull!

483
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:15,667
Yuri...

484
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,203
- I...
- Maika!

485
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,758
Why did you break it?

486
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,526
Why did you break it?!

487
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,308
Why...

488
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,605
Why...

489
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:04,685
Why did you hide your masochistic nature?

490
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:47,626
The romantic relationship between Yuzuki Muto
and Aoi Funaki was punished...

491
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:53,967
with extremely severe torture. As a result,
Aoi Funaki is in serious condition.

492
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:57,762
Am I right, President?

493
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,029
Yes.

494
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:07,375
I had a conversation with
Aoi Funaki yesterday

495
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:15,982
She said she would quit the club and asked
me to end this commotion with her exit.

496
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,483
What...

497
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:21,891
- It was my responsibility too.
- You!

498
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:24,555
Are you trying to destroy our Torture Club?!

499
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,137
Come forward. Yuzuki Muto!

500
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,197
Yes!

501
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,259
This...

502
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:59,227
Aoi Funaki asked me to deliver this to you.

503
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,710
You better not go there.

504
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,748
In the history of our club...

505
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:22,989
there have been quite a few members who quit due to
the punishment for having a romantic relationship.

506
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:28,886
You still don't get what she's trying to do.

507
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,247
This was in front of the door.

508
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:15,138
I'm outside.
- Yuzuki

509
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:36,396
Can I tell you something?

510
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:43,494
There must have been...

511
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:50,175
a deep emotional conflict in you
since I met you for the first time.

512
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:58,846
The reason why I stayed in the club...

513
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:04,316
wasn't because I didn't want you
to know that I stole your underwear.

514
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,029
I wanted to be with you.

515
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,398
Yuzuki.

516
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,971
I love you.

517
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,614
I love you as you are.

518
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,719
If you are not with me, I...

519
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,397
I...

520
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,368
don't love you.

521
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,165
Aoi...

522
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:55,806
Yuzuki.

523
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:00,572
Be strong.

524
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,614
Aoi...

525
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,645
Aoi...

526
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:58,283
Yuzuki...

527
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,926
Yuzuki...

528
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,835
Aoi...

529
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:17,038
Yuzuki...

530
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,180
Aoi...

531
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,888
I'm coming!

532
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:03,156
Half A Year Later

533
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:11,429
Torture Club
Torture Club Review

534
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,136
Oh my God.

535
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,399
Jesus Christ.

536
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:33,446
Still want more?

537
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:38,355
Look at that face.
Torture without any hesitation.

538
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,024
She's a torturer.

539
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:47,230
I can't do it anymore!

540
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:49,298
I give up.

541
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,202
What an impressive torture!

542
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:04,417
You have tortured exactly the right spots.

543
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:09,213
You can retire with peace of mind, President.

544
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,446
Yes.

545
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:16,095
Now, bring it here.

546
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,648
This is...

547
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:39,009
The Funaki family gave us this.

548
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:44,789
They wanted to put it here since
they are going to move.

549
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,227
Move?

550
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:17,051
Be Strong

551
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:21,957
You can say something
to her for the last time.

552
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,994
But...

553
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:33,305
I don't even have her phone
number at the moment.

554
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,504
I have it.

555
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,876
Yuzuki Muto.

556
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:44,113
I'm going to test for the last time
whether you've become a real torturer.

557
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,947
Get Aoi Funaki's number from me!

558
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,624
I'm strong.

559
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:04,433
Wait a second.
You're going to use that?

560
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,732
That's an execution device!
I might die!

561
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:26,958
Hello?

562
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,056
Aoi...

563
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:32,723
Yuzuki?

564
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:39,195
I didn't know you were going to move.

565
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,508
Yuzuki.

566
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:46,608
Don't worry about me.

567
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,371
I'm already thinking about where to start.

568
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:53,044
I'm going to start something totally
different from scratch in university

569
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,689
What's wrong?

570
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,155
Aoi.

571
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:09,262
I can't forgive you like this.

572
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,796
Yuzuki...

573
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,073
I...

574
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:22,915
want to torture you.

575
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,782
Why?

576
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:36,920
Because you lied when you
said you didn't love me.

577
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,330
Lying is a major crime.

578
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,605
I'm going to wait for you
at the Torture Club.

579
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:18,732
What are you going to do after
your graduation, President?

580
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,106
Well...

581
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,502
Get married and become a posh wife...

582
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:29,241
What?!

583
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,976
I'm kidding!

584
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,277
I'm going to take the test
to become a public servant,

585
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:37,655
And learn more about
torture through my career.

586
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:41,652
In other words, an elite career.

587
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:45,392
I've tried hard to achieve that goal.

588
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:59,775
I want you to stay here at the Torture Club.

589
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:08,112
I'm going to keep supporting
the club with Yuzuki.

590
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:11,420
Great job.

591
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:15,784
You're not a child anymore.

592
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:25,065
President.

593
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,636
- I...
- Maika.

594
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,680
Don't say anything more.

595
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:39,875
I know. It's not that hard
to know your feelings.

596
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:43,888
Maika.

597
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:50,828
There are struggles in my life too.

598
01:24:52,955 --> 01:25:00,703
But if you want to live as a torturer,
you can't say anything weak like that.

599
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,097
I know.

600
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:11,852
The world of torture is quite strict...

601
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:41,071
Aoi.

602
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:44,540
Yuzuki.

603
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,992
Thank you very much.

604
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,262
I should be thanking you.

605
01:26:57,145 --> 01:27:00,456
Make it tighter.

606
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:05,227
Yes.

607
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:29,187
You've become so good
I don't have to do anything.

608
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,488
You were lying...

609
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:46,437
Weren't you?

610
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,079
Aoi...

611
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:14,630
I admit it.

612
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,632
Please do me a favor.

613
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,177
What is it?

614
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:47,900
I want you to torture me too.

615
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:55,707
Why?

616
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:06,348
Because I'm lying as well.

617
01:29:12,614 --> 01:29:13,957
About what?

618
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:19,392
Actually...

619
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,164
I want to be with you.

620
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:31,475
Actually...

621
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,973
I want you to be with me...

622
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:41,287
In the world of torture.

623
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:47,688
I got it.

624
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,566
Yuzuki...

625
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,506
Take off your clothes.

626
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:03,665
Yes.

627
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:54,988
Aoi.

628
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:59,391
Tighter, please.

629
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:19,007
Yuzuki.

630
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,205
Tighter.

631
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:46,879
Tighter, please.

632
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:56,954
Yuzuki.

633
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:01,222
Do you confess?

634
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:13,732
Yes.

635
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,345
Yuzuki.

636
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,423
Aoi.

637
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,195
Aoi.

638
01:33:14,856 --> 01:33:16,665
Aoi.

639
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,133
Yuzuki.

640
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,113
Stay strong.

641
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:35,186
Yes.

642
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:40,924
Yuzuki is...

643
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:50,325
going to be the best in the world of torture.

644
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,807
Even if I...

645
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,879
change my career...

646
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:07,514
I want you to stay strong.

647
01:34:13,615 --> 01:34:14,616
Yes.

648
01:34:18,253 --> 01:34:20,961
I'm going to stay strong.
