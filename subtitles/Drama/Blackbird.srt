1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,497
Wait downstairs,
Sean.

2
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,600
What's going on?

3
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,835
Mr. Randall,
we have a warrant

4
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,337
to search
your house.

5
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,171
A warrant?

6
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,706
What for?

7
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:52,611
Two upstairs,
two down.

8
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,414
Tommy,
what the fuck?

9
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,583
Ok, you guys cover the
bedrooms upstairs.

10
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,553
We got weapons
down here.

11
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,187
Call it in.

12
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,589
Call what in?

13
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:10,295
Ok, you just
stay right there.

14
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,866
You're about to be
front page news, Sean.

15
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,468
How do you
feel about that?

16
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,505
I told you,
I didn't do anything.

17
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,875
You planned to
do something.

18
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,176
No, I didn't.

19
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,246
I wish you'd
stop saying that.

20
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,390
Winchester 94.

21
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,559
Lever action.

22
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:44,363
Sleek, accurate,
no-nonsense.

23
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,733
Is that your
favourite?

24
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,605
We found it loaded,
ready to go.

25
00:02:56,175 --> 00:03:00,712
Or the Remington 870?

26
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,543
Also loaded.

27
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,259
Were you going to
start with this one

28
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:08,520
and move to the Winchester,
or the other way around?

29
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,189
Those are my
dad's guns.

30
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,256
I don't know
anything about them.

31
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,659
I don't even
like guns.

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,545
Which gun is going to make me
<i>feel like a man today?</i>

33
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:38,317
<i>So many options,</i>
<i>I feel giddy inside</i>

34
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,651
<i>just thinking about it.</i>

35
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,521
Sean, put that
thing away.

36
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,613
They're close.

37
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:11,817
I'll take your
word for it.

38
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,954
How come you get the
pump action, Ricky?

39
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,589
I wish you'd stop
calling me that.

40
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,391
Well it is
your name.

41
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,994
Keep the
muzzle down.

42
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,652
Prop it up.

43
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:56,988
No!

44
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,532
Is that its heart?

45
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,443
Stop filming this.

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,787
You'll get
the next one.

47
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,123
The next what?

48
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,672
I'm just going
to run in --

49
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,142
you may as well
wait here.

50
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,914
Whatcha looking at,
you fucking weirdo?

51
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,788
They're cliches --
ignore them.

52
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,795
Dude, is that blood
on your hands?

53
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,065
Probably killed his
sister or ate his dog.

54
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,602
Goths are pacifists,
you guys don't know anything.

55
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,571
When did you become
the Goth expert?

56
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,005
I am a Goth.

57
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,741
Well goths don't listen
to Marilyn Manson.

58
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,744
I listen to
other stuff.

59
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,146
Check this out.

60
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,617
Oh, dude --

61
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,852
<i>Stop filming this.</i>

62
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,254
-- that is sick.

63
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,057
Oh, tell me that's
an animal!

64
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,558
It's a deer.

65
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,027
Fuck, Sean.

66
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,830
- That's gross!
- That is so fucking awesome.

67
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,929
Can you send
it to me?

68
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,713
Yeah, I'll just
post it.

69
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,578
What are you gonna do
take on the entire hockey team?

70
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,779
Yeah, sure...
why not?

71
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,549
Who threw it?

72
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,523
Deanna?

73
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,692
I didn't realize
you guys were friends?

74
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,762
We're on the
same bus.

75
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,896
Okay, then why don't you
tell him who did it then?

76
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,738
Yeah some friend.

77
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,210
Don't do it again.

78
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,211
Or what?

79
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,013
You gonna slit
your wrists?

80
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,715
How about I give you
your own website?

81
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,617
Dumb asshole jocks
dot com.

82
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,318
You serious?

83
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,586
Corey.

84
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:19,724
Here, give it to me.

85
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:22,032
<i>This would make great</i>
<i>YouTube material, man.</i>

86
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,063
<i>All we need is a name.</i>

87
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,196
<i>How about "Freak gets</i>
<i>happy slapped."</i>

88
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,800
<i>No, that's too obvious,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

89
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,270
Tell us about
this guy?

90
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,605
Cory?

91
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,607
Just a guy
at my school.

92
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,275
You must
hate him.

93
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,712
I know I would if
he did that to me.

94
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,649
I don't hate him.

95
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,018
But it's pretty clear
he hates me.

96
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,288
Maybe you should question him.
He's the dangerous one.

97
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,644
"Noon.

98
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:05,171
Felt like a good
time to start.

99
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,640
A clean, memorable,
turning point of a time.

100
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,241
The cafeteria,
with all its

101
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,378
pathetic symmetry
would be the place.

102
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,948
Two Colt 45s
would be the tools.

103
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,617
The captain of
the hockey team,

104
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,719
that vain,
preening peacock,

105
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,221
would be the
first target.

106
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,273
His bourgeois, groupie of a
girlfriend would be the next.

107
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:31,096
Followed soon after by the
rest of the hockey team.

108
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,764
It would be
methodical.

109
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,265
It would be
unemotional.

110
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,136
With his tools he
could fix them all."

111
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,408
It's interesting --

112
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,811
we found the same
story online.

113
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,151
Are you sure you don't
want that lawyer?

114
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,853
It's just
a story.

115
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,520
Ms. Dorey told me
to write down my --

116
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,054
Your feelings?

117
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,721
Who's Ms. Dorey?

118
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,697
I heard there was an
incident at the mall.

119
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,799
Do you want to
talk about it?

120
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,702
Not really.

121
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,704
Do you have anybody
you can talk to?

122
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,972
Like my dad?

123
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,342
You know,
you might not believe it,

124
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,912
but I dressed Goth
in high school.

125
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,314
I don't believe it.

126
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:27,051
I didn't live in Eastport. I
grew up in the city, like you.

127
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,254
Who did you
listen to?

128
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,723
Joy Division,
The Cult,

129
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,224
stuff like that.

130
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,159
Do you have
any tattoos?

131
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,226
Sure.

132
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,431
None that I
would show you.

133
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,934
This is the part when
I'm supposed to

134
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:47,739
open up and tell you
how much my life sucks?

135
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,942
Have you spoken
with your mother?

136
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,717
You know what I do
when I'm angry --

137
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,119
I write it down.

138
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,187
It helps.

139
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,428
Hey?

140
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,933
What are you
writing?

141
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,935
A story of
revenge.

142
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,472
Am I in it?

143
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,241
What, so you can
talk to me now that

144
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,777
we're all alone?

145
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,545
What was I
supposed to do?

146
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,282
Get up and walk
away with you?

147
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,284
They're my friends.

148
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,291
I burned you a CD.

149
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,028
Some stuff that I like.

150
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,564
It's mostly Industrial,
but there's this one band

151
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,802
on here called
Nemesiah that I love.

152
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,805
You probably already
know them.

153
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,478
There's this story how the
bass at their shows is like

154
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,446
so deep and constant

155
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:39,317
that people actually
shit their pants.

156
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,223
Anyway,
it's for you.

157
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,428
He's a fucking
heathen?

158
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,496
Cory?

159
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,299
He's not always
like that.

160
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,366
Yes he is.

161
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,969
What, you're
any different,

162
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,504
going around
cutting up animals?

163
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,539
What are you
talking about?

164
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,107
Your video!

165
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,576
It's gone viral.

166
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,347
You see what
you want to see.

167
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,550
Tell me what I'm
supposed to see.

168
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,274
What's going on?

169
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,543
I thought we were
getting along.

170
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,979
You won't even be
seen with me in public.

171
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,981
That's not true.

172
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:48,319
I mean sure, it'd be nice if you didn't
dress like every day was Halloween.

173
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,456
You could tone it down
is all I'm saying.

174
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,390
And be a bitch
like you,

175
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,358
Zamboni Man?

176
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,596
People don't like people
who stand out, Sean.

177
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,098
I belong in
the city.

178
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,666
Yeah, well, she's
not taking you back.

179
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,935
She made that clear.

180
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,114
She's not
even home.

181
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,583
They took Lily
to Florida.

182
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,689
Why don't you sit down
eat your dinner.

183
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,592
You killed it,
you eat it.

184
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,605
Can you see me?

185
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,573
Yeah, I can
see you.

186
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,542
Can you see me?

187
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,445
Yes, I can.

188
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,480
That's your room?

189
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,116
It's the room
I sleep in.

190
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,619
I wouldn't exactly
call it my room.

191
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,455
What is that?

192
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,357
This is Milton,
my lizard.

193
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,225
Oh my god!

194
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,027
Like the poet.

195
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:36,728
What?

196
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,196
Like the poet --
Milton.

197
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,263
Oh.

198
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,335
This is Snuggles.

199
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,437
Milton --
meet Snuggles.

200
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,339
Hello.

201
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,142
He comes with the
room by the way.

202
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,310
Well I just want
to come over there

203
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:56,180
with a spray can
and tag your walls.

204
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,649
I can see that.

205
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,252
So were you
born a goth?

206
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,521
You think
I'm a goth?

207
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,623
Aren't you?

208
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,658
Were you born
a princess?

209
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,495
Yes, I was.

210
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,164
No, this is
just who I am.

211
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,500
If people don't like
that's too bad.

212
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:19,070
You learn pretty quick
who your friends are.

213
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,671
And your enemies.

214
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,241
I just find it
interesting because

215
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,576
I'm like totally
the opposite.

216
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,812
I want everyone
to like me.

217
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,415
Everyone does
like you.

218
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,118
They like the
idea of me.

219
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,587
They don't
actually know me.

220
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,624
Sounds lonely.

221
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,330
I guess we're not
so different.

222
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,612
Sorry, I gotta
turn this down.

223
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,653
You didn't have
to do that.

224
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,354
It's not muzak.

225
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,091
I don't know
what that is.

226
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,559
A girl gave
it to me.

227
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,395
What was her name,
Elvira?

228
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,596
No, Deanna.

229
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,666
Not Deanna Roy?

230
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,768
Yeah, why?

231
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,471
Brian Roy's daughter?

232
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,439
The Puck Bunny?

233
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,442
I don't think they
use that term anymore.

234
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,545
She never misses a hockey
game is all I'm saying.

235
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,247
Well, sometimes
girls like guys

236
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,782
they can talk to.

237
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,785
Yeah, they call
them friends.

238
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:58,402
Hey, I was wondering what
you were doing at lunch?

239
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,205
I have a chemistry test
I have to study for.

240
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,307
I could help.

241
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,578
Did all that last
year in the city.

242
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,380
I study better
by myself.

243
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,283
Take a hint.

244
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,187
MacKenzie, you don't
have to be rude.

245
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,522
God, Deanna,
when did you become

246
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,590
such a freak magnet?

247
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,300
I should go.

248
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,368
Then go.

249
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,589
Wow, nice place.

250
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,992
Appearance
is everything.

251
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,561
I'm afraid to
touch anything.

252
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,601
Oh my god,
don't look at that.

253
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,969
Hard not to.

254
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,211
Shut up!

255
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:42,841
It's better than having
guns on your wall.

256
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,342
The thing that
bugs me about it

257
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,777
is the fakeness
of it,

258
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,648
like we're a happy
family or something.

259
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,355
So that's Big Bri, huh?

260
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,291
See that hand
on my shoulder?

261
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:03,294
Feels like it's
always there.

262
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,899
Tell him how
you feel.

263
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:27,551
Get your fucking hand
off me, you cocksucker.

264
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,655
Are you recording me?

265
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,689
Calm down,
I'll erase it.

266
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,558
Sean!

267
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,428
Wait -- let me
see it first.

268
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,634
Get your fucking hand off me,
<i>you cocksucker.</i>

269
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,304
Oh god, I look
so angry.

270
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,879
Who's this?

271
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,580
My sister, Lily.

272
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,049
I didn't know
you had a sister.

273
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,517
Half sister.

274
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,359
<i>Sing the monkey</i>
<i>song again.</i>

275
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,694
<i>I did.</i>

276
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,628
<i>Do it again.</i>

277
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,464
<i>The monkey</i>
<i>was going.</i>

278
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,599
<i>I'm going to</i>
<i>do it faster.</i>

279
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,836
<i>The monkey was going ...</i>

280
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,739
<i>Sean, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>she's not a toy you know.</i>

281
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,544
You're really
sweet with her.

282
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,012
Tell that
to her dad.

283
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,613
He won't even
let me see her.

284
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:33,617
Thinks I'm gonna
kill her or something.

285
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,973
I heard it different.

286
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,708
Yeah, well my sister
knows his brother,

287
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,645
so I think that makes
me a much better source.

288
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,447
Wouldn't you
agree, Sean?

289
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,015
Yeah, Sean?

290
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,585
Sean, come on.

291
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,620
Sean, don't be
a retard.

292
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,088
What's going on?

293
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,928
Who is it?

294
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,196
It's my mom.

295
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:32,629
Can someone please
tell me what's going on?

296
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,133
You're like Homer Simpson hitting
his thumb with the hammer.

297
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,183
Oh my god,
is he texting you?

298
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,018
No.

299
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,008
Stop him!

300
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,681
So how did you
get her number,

301
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,649
Freak Show?

302
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,619
Why don't you
ask her?

303
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,754
No, I'm asking you.

304
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,756
She give it to you?

305
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,626
Fuck

306
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,634
If you go near my girlfriend
again I'll kill you

307
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,637
with my bare
fucking hands.

308
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,608
And I have the
means to do it.

309
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,943
He threatened me at school...
I was just responding.

310
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,347
Because his girlfriend
didn't want you?

311
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,648
What did she say?

312
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,651
Did you
talk to her?

313
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:05,756
This alleged threat of his,
were there witnesses?

314
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:09,093
Yeah, a few of his
friends Jason, Tyler,

315
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,228
a few others.

316
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,665
You mean the rest
of the hockey team?

317
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,837
We know about
your website.

318
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:17,368
Your videos. Your blog.

319
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,955
What we
don't know is --

320
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,771
why you're
so angry.

321
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,876
What did the
world do to you?

322
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,314
Can I see
my dad now?

323
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,826
Can you believe this?

324
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,763
Well, you dress
the part.

325
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,898
You wanted to stand out,
Sean, so now you do.

326
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,066
How's it feel?

327
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,300
I'm in jail,
how do you think

328
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,869
it feels?

329
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,837
I've been charged
too, Sean.

330
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,840
Improper storage
of firearms.

331
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,239
I've lived alone
for ten years.

332
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,749
They're saying I loaded them.
They're saying it's like Columbine.

333
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,983
I know!

334
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:09,053
Do you know how much
media is out there?

335
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,256
Does mom know?

336
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,191
I'm sure she
does now!

337
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,859
But they can't
give out my name,

338
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,461
right, because
I'm a minor?

339
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:22,466
They can give out mine,
so trust me she knows.

340
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,169
She's probably on a beach
somewhere breathing a huge

341
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:29,239
sigh of relief because you're
my problem now and not hers.

342
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:38,282
I should've been there
to raise you myself.

343
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,751
But you weren't.

344
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,948
Does he have
to wear those?

345
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,220
The whole town's
in there, Sean.

346
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,430
Take a seat.

347
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,505
Hi. You must be Sean?

348
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,807
Hi, I'm Andy Lewis,
with Legal Aid.

349
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,375
I've just been
assigned your case.

350
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,377
I just got your file.

351
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,688
Wow, it's nutso
in here.

352
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,848
Can you just tell them I'm
not who they think I am?

353
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,416
Lets take one
thing at a time.

354
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:49,286
We'll get you bail,
then I'll have a chance

355
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,089
to go over the file and
then we can talk, okay?

356
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:55,927
All rise.

357
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,420
The sitting of the Eastport
Provincial Court is now in session.

358
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,197
The honourable
Judge Campbell presiding.

359
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,232
Thank you,
you may sit.

360
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,401
Case number 6215,
in the matter of

361
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:07,906
the Crown versus
Sean Richard Randall.

362
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,661
Your honour,
Mr. Randall is accused

363
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:11,929
of making threats and
planning a violent attack

364
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,878
targeting specific students
and teachers at Eastport High.

365
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,815
Mr. Randall is clearly out of
control and a threat to himself

366
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,883
and the community at large.

367
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:22,219
Due to the uncertain nature
of the threats and the

368
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,555
instability of the accused
we request bail be denied

369
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,557
at this time and he be
remanded for the safety of

370
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,027
himself and
the community.

371
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:31,755
Proceed.

372
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,817
Uh, your honour.

373
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:36,934
I'd just like to say that I
find this a little bit extreme.

374
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:42,005
My client here has done nothing
but utter a few threats --

375
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,069
I'll have decorum in my court,

376
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,143
or I'll have the Sheriff
clear the room.

377
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,845
The point I'm trying
to make your honour,

378
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,280
is that my client's a minor.

379
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:53,350
It's my understanding that if
there is a parent or guardian

380
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,987
present and responsible,
bail should be granted.

381
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,390
Not if the parent is the one
providing illegal firearms.

382
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,519
Mr. Randall,
do you understand the

383
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,464
seriousness of
the charges?

384
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,499
Yes.

385
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,201
This is a tight-knit
community.

386
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,539
When you threaten our children,
you threaten us all.

387
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,942
I'm going to deny bail,
Mr. Randall,

388
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,611
pending further
investigation.

389
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,135
You're going
to Waterville.

390
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:26,405
For your sake and the
sake of the community.

391
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,566
Step through.

392
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,670
Step forward
to the line.

393
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:22,105
Turn around
and face me.

394
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,508
Take off
your shoes.

395
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,345
Take off
your socks.

396
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,617
Empty your
pockets.

397
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,121
Take off
your shirt.

398
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,027
Take off
your pants.

399
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:55,405
Rub your hands
through your hair.

400
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,607
Hold out your arms.

401
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,209
Open your mouth.

402
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,577
Wide as you
can please.

403
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:04,047
Stick out
your tongue.

404
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,515
Turn around.

405
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,684
Bend over.

406
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:20,998
BARKHOUSE!

407
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,100
Ce1l 2B.

408
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,602
Alright,
settle down.

409
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,070
Settle down.

410
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,172
In your cells in
twenty minutes.

411
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,774
I'll be watching.

412
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,715
It is about time
I got a new bitch ...

413
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:39,783
Eye down.

414
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,155
Fresh meat, huh?

415
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,457
Watch out
for Trevor.

416
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,426
I get the
headlines.

417
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,129
What's the
password?

418
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,663
Move.

419
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:57,067
Welcome to the
human fish tank.

420
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,657
You don't mind.

421
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,680
Can't whistle.

422
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,651
Birds whistle
and birds are free.

423
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,188
I didn't know.

424
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,457
Oh -- He didn't know.

425
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,592
Didn't know.

426
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,761
Speaking of birds fucking
parrot over here.

427
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,502
The question is --

428
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:41,705
just what kind of
bird are you?

429
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,142
Don't answer.

430
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,745
We have a tradition
here on West 7, ah.

431
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,388
Amherst teen arrested
for ATM bank fraud.

432
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,623
Ray, you're up.

433
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,325
Don't fucking
say a word.

434
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,793
I picked Hartford
youth gets

435
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,228
six months for
assault with

436
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,564
a deadly weapon.

437
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:12,836
Yarmouth teen sentenced for
eleven counts of joyridinq.

438
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,774
Could I see
bank fraud?

439
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,676
Maybe.

440
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,178
But assault with
a deadly weapon?

441
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,646
With his Aids
dick maybe.

442
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,858
And joyriding?

443
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:26,709
I swear Lucas you get
dumber by the minute.

444
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,601
Look at his face.

445
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,889
Joyriders are
friendly.

446
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,693
That's why they're
called joy riders.

447
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,200
This bird don't
like people.

448
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,571
He's got that
my-shit-don't-smell

449
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,939
look to him.

450
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,260
What's it say?

451
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:53,944
Eastport teen denied bail for
planning school massacre.

452
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:56,171
Trevor got it, I can
see it in his face.

453
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,316
Whoa whoa whoa,
he hasn't even one chosen yet.

454
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,319
Get them all in
front of him.

455
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,892
Come on, newbie,
who the fuck are you?

456
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,602
I knew it man.

457
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,595
I knew he was one of
them stinky-ass,

458
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:22,869
PIN stealing
muthafuckas.

459
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,266
Good count.

460
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,333
Okay.

461
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,769
Count up!

462
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:11,621
Hello?

463
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,689
Deanna?

464
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,325
Just a minute.

465
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,596
Who is this?

466
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:22,799
Friend of Deanna's.

467
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,601
What's your name?

468
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,570
Hello?

469
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,615
Okay boys,
in your cells.

470
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,818
Now.

471
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,601
No one lies to me!

472
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,604
No one!

473
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:11,441
Amherst teen my
fucking ass!

474
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,476
Teen dressed Goth and had a
large tattoo on his back

475
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,179
classmates described as
Satanic in nature.

476
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,014
The arrest follows a search
of the boy's home where an

477
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,150
arsenal of weapons were
found along with what is

478
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:22,786
believed to be a revenge
plan targeting the entire

479
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,088
hockey team.

480
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,090
Looks like I win
after all.

481
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,725
Let me see that.

482
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,319
Keep it,
Marcel.

483
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,028
Let it be a reminder to you
that you're still the same

484
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,147
dumb ass muthafucka
you always were.

485
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:38,067
Lying piece of shit.

486
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,968
BARKHOUSE!

487
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,637
Rollout!
Rollout!

488
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,640
Clean it up,
Columbine.

489
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,575
I ain't going to no
Discipline Unit

490
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:46,576
'cause of you.

491
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,585
You want
me to lie?

492
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:56,986
I want you home.

493
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:57,987
Your dad
wants you home.

494
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,689
That's why he
hired me, Sean.

495
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,191
To represent your
best interests.

496
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:02,459
How is saying
I did something

497
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,060
I didn't in my
best interests?

498
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,596
Please, Sean.

499
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,731
Mr. Johns is
here to help.

500
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,483
Look, I realize
those kids

501
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:11,763
at school were
the real threat.

502
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,570
But you got to
understand the system.

503
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,571
The parents,
the teachers,

504
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,005
the Crown,
they all want

505
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,574
blood on
this one.

506
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,542
Who do they
have, Harris?

507
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:22,612
It's a woman,
I think that's her name.

508
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,247
Dale Harris.

509
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,916
I remember because
Dale rhymes with bail.

510
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,534
They don't get any
tougher than her.

511
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:30,787
She wants fourteen year
olds tried as adults.

512
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,156
Fourteen.

513
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,657
How old are you?

514
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,758
He's fifteen.

515
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,227
Sixteen.

516
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,729
Point is you rattled
an entire community.

517
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,731
Accept this
and move on.

518
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:42,832
A couple years,
you'll be eighteen,

519
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:47,604
in college, nobody
will remember this.

520
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,272
I will.

521
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,840
Don't you think you'd
also remember a long,

522
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,042
drawn out trial?

523
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,011
Your dad's right.

524
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,613
I know you're
not guilty, Sean,

525
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,281
but the evidence against
you is very compelling.

526
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,849
If this goes
to trial...

527
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,118
I don't know.

528
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,820
What I do
know is this.

529
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,154
you put on
a nice suit,

530
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,690
you tell a nice story,
you'll get a slap

531
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,725
on the wrist
be released

532
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,093
for time served.

533
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,262
Lesson learned.

534
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,932
Make life easier
for yourself, Sean.

535
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:21,671
Doesn't anybody care
about the truth?

536
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:24,541
I'm due in court
in an hour.

537
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,844
Think about it.

538
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:28,912
Call me.

539
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,953
I'll talk
with him.

540
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,161
Do you have any
idea who that is?

541
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:48,331
It's only the best goddamn youth
lawyer this side of Montreal.

542
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,668
And he's here in this
room to help you.

543
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,836
Only you seem to know
more than he does.

544
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,638
What was wrong
with the other guy?

545
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Andy the
Legal Aid guy?

546
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:58,748
He's a fucking idiot.

547
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:00,498
Barry Johns is
the real deal.

548
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:04,180
I mortgaged my fucking
house to bring him here!

549
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,748
Well I don't
like him.

550
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,884
You don't like
anyone, Sean.

551
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:11,220
Is it any wonder the
whole world's against you?

552
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,823
How do you live with
such an embarrassment

553
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:14,757
for a son?

554
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,193
Don't give me
that shit, Sean.

555
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,295
I'm here,
aren't I.

556
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,731
It's more than you can
say for your mother.

557
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,602
She's not coming?

558
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,970
I don't know.

559
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:28,037
We're playing
phone tag.

560
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,672
She's still
in Florida.

561
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,007
Says she's
coming though...

562
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,710
soon as she
gets back.

563
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,778
When will
that be?

564
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,381
I don't know.

565
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,951
But wouldn't it be
nice to get out of here

566
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,152
before she comes?

567
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,656
Get you cleaned up.

568
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:50,059
Put an end to all
this brutality.

569
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,385
Get your own
bitch, bitch.

570
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,266
Eat your peas,
Columbine.

571
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,768
You don't have
to call me that.

572
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,870
Why not,
Columbine?

573
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,905
Cause I'm nothing
like them.

574
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:39,709
That's not what
the newspaper says.

575
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,914
You know what you need,
Columbine?

576
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,883
You need to learn to
love yourself.

577
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,418
They teach that shit
here you know?

578
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,253
Yeah man,
they teach you how to

579
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,021
paint watercolours
and everything.

580
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,497
Express all that
pain you got,

581
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:54,724
so that when
you get out

582
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,393
you won't go blasting
up the school.

583
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,329
Why you in here?

584
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,234
Hey man,
this bitch is so new

585
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,436
he's still in
the wrapper.

586
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,711
You wanna know
what he did?

587
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,946
He killed
Santa Claus.

588
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,981
Some Christmas store
Santa up in Plate Cove

589
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,450
where he's from.

590
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:24,454
Some old retired guy,
everybody just fucking adored.

591
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:28,191
Turns out the guy's
a fucking pedophile.

592
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,159
One night,
takes Trevor out

593
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:33,763
to a dirt road,
starts to come on to him.

594
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,132
Tries to touch his
dick and everything.

595
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:38,735
Trevor goes ape shit.

596
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:41,104
Fucking kills the guy
with his bare hands.

597
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,407
When was that?

598
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,810
Five years ago.

599
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,125
Okay, wait,
he's here,

600
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,793
I gotta go.

601
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,762
Where they keeping you,
Australia?

602
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:06,708
You've been
waiting?

603
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,798
Yeah, I just got Gerry
breathing down my neck

604
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,500
every five seconds -
how much longer,

605
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:11,467
how much longer?

606
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,536
You know what
he's like.

607
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,771
He's in the car?

608
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:17,140
Lily's taking
a nap.

609
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,407
Lily's here?

610
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,545
Come here,
let me look at you.

611
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,215
Oh, Sean.

612
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:28,284
How did this happen?

613
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,822
Glad you're
here mom.

614
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:34,557
Yeah, well, I would
have been here sooner,

615
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:37,426
it's just Gerry's
family you know,

616
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,561
he hadn't seen
them in years,

617
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:42,198
and Lily was
so excited so...

618
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,867
Oh, I brought
some photos.

619
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:51,507
Most of these probably
wouldn't interest you, but...

620
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,579
Here's one of Lily.

621
00:46:56,581 --> 00:47:00,516
Isn't that cute?

622
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:01,918
She looks older.

623
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,985
Her face.

624
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,222
I want to see her.

625
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:08,925
I wanted that for you,
I really did.

626
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:13,129
But - jail's no place
for a little girl.

627
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,366
So that's
why he came?

628
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:19,168
To keep away
the bad seed?

629
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,567
- No one sees you like that.
- Everyone sees me like that.

630
00:47:22,568 --> 00:47:24,051
You're telling me he hasn't
been saying I told you so?

631
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:25,751
He hasn't.

632
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,513
Maybe he didn't
have to.

633
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,323
I told myself I wasn't
going to get upset so...

634
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:48,164
So, think that maybe when I
get out I can come and stay,

635
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,466
you know,
take Lily to the park...

636
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:53,135
I don't think that's
such a good idea, Sean.

637
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,338
I just think it's important
you spend some time

638
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,574
with your father,
at this point in your life.

639
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,913
It's hard
for everyone.

640
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,115
Yeah, I can
see that.

641
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,131
Yeah?

642
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:37,413
Columbine -- ball!

643
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,020
Come on, Columbine,
get the ball.

644
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:13,949
Oh wow.

645
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,285
I mean, they clowing
you for real man.

646
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,687
Where you going,
Columbine?

647
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:19,455
To my cell,
to read.

648
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,391
I ain't done
with you!

649
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,393
Come on back,
bitch!

650
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,122
Co-lum-bine.

651
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:41,957
Come on buddy you're letting
it get away from you.

652
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,631
Get the ball. Come on.

653
00:49:44,842 --> 00:49:45,909
Attaboy.

654
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,022
Here you go, Kev.

655
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,597
Go get it.

656
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,265
Go ahead Lassie.

657
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,740
Oh what a
fucking cunt.

658
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:26,689
Now what am I supposed
to do with this?

659
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,757
Huh?

660
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,196
Rain cheque,
boys.

661
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,665
Big brother's
watching.

662
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,534
He ownes you G.

663
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,742
You got lucky,
Columbine.

664
00:50:58,655 --> 00:50:59,789
Barry Johns.

665
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,724
Hi, it's
Sean Randall...

666
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:02,491
from Waterville.

667
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,659
Sean!

668
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:04,593
Good news.

669
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:05,728
Did your dad
tell you?

670
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,263
We got a
trial date.

671
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,364
Really, when?

672
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:10,533
Twenty first.

673
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,668
That's in
two weeks.

674
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,770
Well, it could've been a
hell of a lot longer, Sean.

675
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:17,440
They wanted to push it
until the new year.

676
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:18,370
It's just..

677
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:21,210
I just don't know if
I can last that long.

678
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,378
You know,
it's like you said:

679
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,346
kids like me aren't
safe here.

680
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,582
There's still the other
option we discussed.

681
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,689
So, if I can hold on
for two weeks,

682
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:34,824
you're saying
I can get out?

683
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:37,126
Well, first we view
the Crown's case.

684
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:39,462
We get to see the evidence
they've compiled against you.

685
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:40,696
It's called
disclosure.

686
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,665
If you still decide
you want to proceed,

687
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,291
you'll get moved to
the courthouse,

688
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:45,434
to a holding cell.

689
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,802
And then we
go to trial.

690
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,671
And I can't move now,
since I know that's what

691
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:49,872
I want to do?

692
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:51,674
That's not
how it works.

693
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:53,342
If you insist on
going to trial,

694
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:54,643
you're just going
to have to

695
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:57,513
find a way to
hang in there.

696
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,664
Let him eat.

697
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:20,236
Everyone deserves
a last supper.

698
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,846
We're short.

699
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,715
Missing a knife.

700
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,651
Seems like one
of you thought

701
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,585
you'd walk
out of here

702
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,388
with a little
souvenir.

703
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,789
You were wrong.

704
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,326
We have dedicated staff
who take their jobs

705
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,629
very seriously.

706
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:48,364
They know how serious
putting a weapon into

707
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,400
the hands of a violent
teenager can be.

708
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:55,404
Now, we can do this the
easy way or we can do it

709
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:56,605
the hard way.

710
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,312
This is no joke, boys.

711
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:08,784
We will search each and every
one of you if we have to --

712
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:18,594
Thanks for choosing
the easy way, Sean.

713
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,796
See you in two weeks.

714
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,380
A fresh face.

715
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,319
This way.

716
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:03,672
Might want to think twice
before jerking off in here.

717
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,641
What if I have to
go to the washroom?

718
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,776
Go up to the window.

719
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,846
That's how we know you're
about to piss yourself.

720
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,014
Like that guy?

721
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:13,582
Him?

722
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,552
No, he's just a
pain in the ass.

723
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,439
I can't sleep.

724
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,460
You know,
the lights --

725
00:55:58,461 --> 00:55:59,685
they're brighter
or something.

726
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,556
The sound, the buzzing,
do you hear it?

727
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:02,658
It's driving me crazy.

728
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,727
Just go back to bed.

729
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,128
Try to relax.

730
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,933
Don't make me call
the Goon Squad.

731
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:42,064
Sean Randall?

732
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,102
Where are
we going?

733
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,571
Has it been
two weeks?

734
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,711
This way, son.

735
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,017
Thanks, Don.

736
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:05,754
Fuck!

737
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:07,890
Are you okay?

738
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,693
Is that the
evidence?

739
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,896
It's ninety percent
of their case.

740
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:15,597
Look I know it's hard,
it gets a lot worse

741
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,566
when it goes
to trial.

742
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:18,467
What do you
mean when?

743
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:19,501
Isn't that why
you're here?

744
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,069
To take me to court?

745
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,806
That's what we thought
too until this morning.

746
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:26,675
The trial's been
postponed, Sean.

747
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:30,646
The computer forensic
experts need more time.

748
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,681
How much time?

749
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:35,851
Could be a
couple months.

750
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:36,819
Procedure is long.

751
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,221
Life is short.

752
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:43,759
I've been trying to tell
you that from the start.

753
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,561
I know pleading guilty is
against your principles,

754
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,963
and I respect you for that,
but principles will not

755
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:51,099
end this vicious cycle
of abuse you're in.

756
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:53,869
What do
you say we

757
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:56,538
put  an end
to all this?

758
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,975
Your honour,
at this time my client

759
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,544
would like to enter
a plea of guilty.

760
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:03,579
Mr. Randall,
do you understand

761
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,813
that you are
pleading guilty

762
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,682
to planning an attack
on twenty-seven people

763
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,584
in this town?

764
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:09,384
Yes.

765
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,555
Please speak into the
microphone, Mr. Randall.

766
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:14,122
Yes.

767
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,381
Do you understand that you're
making this guilty plea

768
00:58:16,382 --> 00:58:18,631
of your own free will,
and that no one in any way

769
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,729
is coercing you to make
this statement today.

770
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:23,165
Yes that's right.

771
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:26,134
Is there anything else
you wish to say?

772
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:29,938
No, sir. Just I'm
sorry, I guess.

773
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,607
Sorry I guess?

774
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,610
Mr. Randall,
sorry I guess doesn't

775
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:37,212
restore the damage you've
caused this community

776
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,515
or diminish the impact
on the lives of those

777
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,749
you've threatened.

778
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,584
Your honour, please,
my client may not be

779
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:44,987
particularly eloquent,
but he is deeply remorseful

780
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,789
and sorry for
what he's done.

781
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,658
Mr. Randall,
is that true?

782
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,660
Yes, sir,
that's true.

783
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,031
I'm granting an
order of release

784
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,200
with conditions.
Mr. Randall.

785
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,135
Due to the violent and
disturbing nature of your

786
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,170
intended crimes you are
prohibited from attending

787
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,773
any school within
district thirteen.

788
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:08,544
Not only can you not attend,
you cannot step foot

789
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,312
on school property.

790
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,147
You are also prohibited
from communicating,

791
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,182
directly or indirectly,
with any victim,

792
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,119
witness, or other person
identified in the

793
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:19,621
no contact order.

794
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:24,126
That's twenty-seven
people, Mr. Randall.

795
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:26,087
Twenty-seven people who
don't want to see your

796
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:27,659
face ever again.

797
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:03,031
So, I didn't know what
to do with your room.

798
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:07,636
I just closed the door...
left it.

799
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,315
I didn't know
how you'd feel.

800
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:23,986
It feels weird...
like someone else's room.

801
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,253
Maybe it is.

802
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,024
I mean,
maybe you changed.

803
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,727
I talked with Barry.

804
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,895
He said that you can have
your computer and all your

805
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:35,998
stuff back,
just a couple of

806
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,800
formalities to
go through.

807
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,736
What about
your guns?

808
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:42,371
I don't get
those back.

809
01:00:42,373 --> 01:00:44,773
Part of
the deal.

810
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,675
Part of
what deal?

811
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:48,944
The deal to
get you out.

812
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,687
Sean, um, I was
thinking, you know,

813
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,889
with the school ban
in effect and everything,

814
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,425
that maybe you want to come
work with me at the rink,

815
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,395
help out some,
earn yourself a

816
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,863
bit of cash.

817
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,931
How's that
supposed to work?

818
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,734
The whole hockey team
is on that list.

819
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:14,836
I checked with Barry.

820
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,689
He said that as long as you're
upstairs when they're on the ice

821
01:01:17,697 --> 01:01:19,041
it's no problem.

822
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:21,977
They have a schedule,
you have a schedule.

823
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:22,844
I don't know.

824
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,813
Can I think about it?

825
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,982
Yeah,
absolutely!

826
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:29,885
No hurry,
take your time.

827
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,190
I'll leave you
to settle in.

828
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,160
Can I get you a
sandwich or something?

829
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,728
I got some of that
thinly-shaved

830
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,230
turkey breast
you like.

831
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:46,234
Yeah, that sounds
great, thanks.

832
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:48,804
I'm glad you're
home, Sean.

833
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:50,272
Sandwich then.

834
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,071
Hey.

835
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:58,807
Pittsburgh's playing,
you want to watch?

836
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,075
I'm reading.

837
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,544
No pressure.

838
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:05,147
Thought I'd
mention it.

839
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,831
Two dollars each?

840
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,507
Thanks.

841
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,431
Look at you.

842
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,301
Dirt under your
fingernails.

843
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,271
That reminds me.

844
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,073
First pay cheque.

845
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,478
Aren't you going
to open it?

846
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,546
Right.

847
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,649
Probably know how much
is in there anyway.

848
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:57,619
Don't forget,
there's deductions.

849
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:01,156
I guess I should start
saving for plastic surgery.

850
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:02,353
What are you
talking about?

851
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:03,625
People think I'm
a psycho, dad.

852
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,260
No, they don't!

853
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:07,162
Everybody I talk to
knows it's bullshit.

854
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:09,230
You should've seen them
gawking at me at the mall.

855
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:12,000
You just like
thinking that way.

856
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:14,102
I saw Deanna.

857
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,004
Didn't go up to her,
just saw her.

858
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,006
I should
hope not.

859
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:18,606
I don't know.

860
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,075
I guess I wanted to.

861
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:22,544
Give her a chance
to explain herself.

862
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:25,347
When are you going to realize
she's not your friend, Sean.

863
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:26,414
Never was.

864
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:33,488
I heard Jimmy Cooke's
selling his wife's Dodge.

865
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,256
Probably let it go
for fifteen hundred.

866
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:39,661
Consider going in on it
with you if you want.

867
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:32,180
Oh, come on,
Talbot!

868
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:34,115
How do you
miss that?

869
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:35,483
When did my
stuff get here?

870
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:39,187
I don't know,
earlier sometime.

871
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:40,155
My car got
vandalized.

872
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,657
The net was
wide open!

873
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,192
What did you say?

874
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:45,527
My car got
vandalized.

875
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:46,561
What?

876
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,396
What happened?

877
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,640
What did you do?

878
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:53,668
Nothing -- except plan
a school massacre.

879
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:29,804
"Get your fucking hand off me,
<i>you cocksucker..."</i>

880
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,378
<i>"Are you recording me?"</i>

881
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,513
<i>"Sean!"</i>

882
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:49,290
Hi.

883
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,227
Hi.

884
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,664
You look different.

885
01:08:56,666 --> 01:09:00,668
That's kind of
the general idea.

886
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,570
How are you?

887
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,305
Alright.

888
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:07,408
Just working now,
just got my own car.

889
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,210
Yeah,
that's cool.

890
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,645
How about you?

891
01:09:11,646 --> 01:09:13,681
How long have you
been working here?

892
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,583
Just like
a month.

893
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:16,851
It was my
dad's idea.

894
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,853
He knows the owner,
so that's how he

895
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,655
keeps tabs on me.

896
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:26,968
Anyway, I just -

897
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,100
wanted to say
I was sorry.

898
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:32,734
I didn't mean
to scare you.

899
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:37,672
I feel sick to my stomach
about what happened.

900
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:40,608
I don't talk to
Cory anymore.

901
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,809
Not at all.

902
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,582
You know the cops came
to my house and told me

903
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:49,551
that you had a plan?

904
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:52,253
I didn't
have a plan.

905
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,622
It was just
a story.

906
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,926
A story of revenge?

907
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,652
Where do you
want to go?

908
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,720
Mexico.

909
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,934
I should have
said something.

910
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:43,004
My parents are
impossible to talk to.

911
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,743
But I should have
said something.

912
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,482
I don't blame you for
not trusting me.

913
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,959
When did you get
the nose ring?

914
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,697
It's a nose stud.

915
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:10,765
Nose stud.

916
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,369
I like it.

917
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:35,723
So I was going
to head to Johnny's,

918
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:36,824
half price burgers.

919
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:37,934
You want to come?

920
01:11:37,935 --> 01:11:38,993
Actually there was
something else I was

921
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:42,597
thinking about doing,
but thanks.

922
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:43,631
Okay.

923
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,766
Next week then.

924
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,090
Hi.

925
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,358
Hi.

926
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,027
Your dad gave
you his Lexus?

927
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:15,697
Told him I
needed tampons.

928
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:18,433
Works every time.

929
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:19,867
No, you can leave
your boots on.

930
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:23,938
Unless you don't want
them to get dirty.

931
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:26,441
Um, the bathroom --

932
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:29,644
up and around the corner,
if you want to use it.

933
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:30,712
Okay.

934
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,650
Do you want to hang out
here or in my room?

935
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:36,718
Sure.

936
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,686
Which one?

937
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,623
We can go to
your room.

938
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,625
Okay, it's just here.

939
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,470
Wow, the walls
are so bare.

940
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,606
Yeah, it's part of
my new look.

941
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,974
Or non-look.

942
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,583
Are those
live maggots?

943
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:09,650
Yes.

944
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,591
I like the way
you look.

945
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:19,060
I feel like I
can see you.

946
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,144
You can
actually read?

947
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:40,148
Yes, well, it's not
exactly Dostoevsky.

948
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,853
Did you get
that in jail?

949
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:46,921
Yeah.

950
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,925
I feel really bad.

951
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,160
Don't.

952
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:54,095
I kind of like it.

953
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,963
It adds character.

954
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,568
Is that
your dad?

955
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,770
Yeah, just wait here.

956
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:39,974
There's a Lexus
in the driveway.

957
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,576
Yeah, that's...
Deanna's here.

958
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:42,643
Oh no, no,
she's not!

959
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,644
She's leaving!

960
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,246
It's not
a big deal.

961
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:45,989
You'll be arrested.

962
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,715
I won't be...
I won't be arrested.

963
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,951
Is that true?

964
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:52,653
You could
be arrested?

965
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,655
She doesn't know?

966
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:56,791
Know what?

967
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,094
You going to
tell her?

968
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:04,699
There's a restraining
order and you're on it.

969
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:13,875
Hey!

970
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,711
Time to head up!

971
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,236
Hey, look
who it is.

972
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,779
Careful,
he's got a weapon.

973
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,617
So like I'm
confused man

974
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,853
did you want
to fuck her

975
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:01,656
or did you want
to kill her?

976
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,059
Fuck her then
kill her?

977
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,696
Kill her then
fuck her?

978
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,164
What did you
want to do?

979
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:12,409
Sean!
Sean!

980
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:13,342
What did you
want to do man?

981
01:16:13,343 --> 01:16:14,486
- What are you doing?
- I'm working!

982
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,845
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry.

983
01:16:15,846 --> 01:16:17,531
Sean -- you got to go.
We got to go.

984
01:16:17,532 --> 01:16:18,906
Get your fucking
hands off me!

985
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,078
Go!

986
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:49,203
Sean!

987
01:16:50,764 --> 01:16:51,731
What's going on?

988
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:52,763
I just wanted
to see you.

989
01:16:52,764 --> 01:16:54,075
You know, I was
thinking about you.

990
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:55,743
You can't
be here.

991
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:58,980
Someone sees you and
they'll call the police.

992
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,149
I got into a fight
with my dad.

993
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,718
I think
I hit him.

994
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,153
I'm pretty sure
I hit him.

995
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,355
Are you okay?

996
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:08,623
No.

997
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:15,096
We can't talk here.

998
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:18,332
Try me later on Skype,
but wait until after eleven,

999
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:23,738
just give my parents a
chance to fall asleep, okay?

1000
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,662
SEAN! SEAN!

1001
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:51,298
OPEN THE FUCKING
DOOR, SEAN!

1002
01:18:06,108 --> 01:18:07,147
Get out of my way.

1003
01:18:07,148 --> 01:18:08,052
What, you gonna
hit me again?

1004
01:18:08,053 --> 01:18:08,949
That was an
accident.

1005
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:10,051
What the fuck?

1006
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:12,720
You knew the rules.

1007
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:13,888
Why can't you
just lay low?

1008
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,223
I can't be you.

1009
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:17,825
So you want to go
back to jail?

1010
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:18,893
I AM IN JAIL!

1011
01:18:18,895 --> 01:18:21,696
DON'T YOU
FUCKING SEE IT?

1012
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,701
Fine, get the
fuck out.

1013
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,877
Fuck!

1014
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,201
How was I
supposed to know

1015
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:10,004
it was her dad
on the phone?

1016
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,165
Mr. Johns.

1017
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:36,597
Thanks for coming on
such short notice.

1018
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:38,999
So, here's
the deal.

1019
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,368
The parents are filing
harassment charges.

1020
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,603
They can
do that?

1021
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:44,438
They basically
entrapped him.

1022
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,240
It's still a breach
of probation, Ricky,

1023
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:49,310
and for that reason
they see Sean as a threat.

1024
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:52,179
You were
reckless, Sean.

1025
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,614
You knew the conditions
of your release -

1026
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:55,015
stay away from the
people on that list.

1027
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,951
How hard is that?

1028
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:58,052
Look, he likes
this girl,

1029
01:20:58,054 --> 01:20:59,436
and this girl
likes him.

1030
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:00,988
It's the parents
that are threatened.

1031
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,556
Sure, it's not like he bought
their daughter flowers

1032
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:03,891
and took her
to the prom.

1033
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:05,893
He had her in
his revenge plan.

1034
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:09,129
He didn't have
a revenge plan.

1035
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:11,532
Sure, well,
they think he did.

1036
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:15,936
So what do
we do now?

1037
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:17,250
Same as
before, Ricky.

1038
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,272
He goes in,
says he's sorry,

1039
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,507
it won't happen again,
lesson learned.

1040
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:22,176
At most he's going
to get house arrest,

1041
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:23,077
three months.

1042
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:26,413
I didn't harass her.

1043
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:32,152
Then take it to trial,
put her on the stand.

1044
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:34,521
I'm sure she'll really
swoon over you then.

1045
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:39,526
They want to
send you back.

1046
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,612
Okay.

1047
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:00,281
You look good.

1048
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,385
Hey, don't worry,
we're going to

1049
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:06,453
get you out
of this.

1050
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:12,359
Don't look at
them, Sean.

1051
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:13,427
All rise.

1052
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,497
The Eastport Provincial
court is now in session.

1053
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:19,633
The honorable Judge Campbell
presiding.

1054
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:21,702
Thank you,
you may sit.

1055
01:22:23,413 --> 01:22:24,538
Mr. Johns?

1056
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,974
Your honour,
at this point my client

1057
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:30,044
would like to enter a plea
of guilty to the one count.

1058
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:31,512
And does this satisfy the Crown,
Miss Harris?

1059
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:33,213
The Crown
is satisfied.

1060
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:35,482
Mr. Randall,
please step forward.

1061
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:39,153
State your full name
for the record.

1062
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,256
Sean Richard Randall.

1063
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,731
Sean Richard Randall,
do you understand that

1064
01:22:43,732 --> 01:22:45,292
you're pleading guilty to the
charge of harassment,

1065
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,661
and that this guilty
plea is being entered of

1066
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:49,596
your own free will?

1067
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:53,133
Yes, I understand
what you're saying.

1068
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:56,503
Listen -- this isn't
about what I say.

1069
01:22:56,505 --> 01:23:00,607
We want to hear how you
feel about your actions.

1070
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:03,077
You mean going
up to Deanna?

1071
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:05,379
Going up to her,
emailing her,

1072
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:10,217
following her home from school,
harassing her at work...

1073
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:11,585
Mr. Randall?

1074
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,220
We're waiting.

1075
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:18,258
Well, um...

1076
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,127
it started
when I saw her

1077
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:21,595
working at
the mall,

1078
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:22,663
and I just wanted
to apologize

1079
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,199
for everything.

1080
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:27,601
Look at me,
Mr. Randall.

1081
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:29,536
So you wanted to
make things right?

1082
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,572
By apologizing?

1083
01:23:31,574 --> 01:23:33,640
Yes, that's
right.

1084
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:36,510
You wanted to apologize
for planning to kill her

1085
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,645
and her friends?

1086
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:40,214
Tell me,
Mr. Randall,

1087
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:42,730
how does one go about
apologizing for such a thing?

1088
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,718
That's not why I
was apologizing.

1089
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,054
Then why were
you apologizing?

1090
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,657
Because I didn't want
her to think she

1091
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,693
had to be
afraid of me.

1092
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,328
I wasn't planning
to kill her.

1093
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,330
I wasn't planning
anything.

1094
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:58,924
Mr. Johns,
I think you should

1095
01:23:58,925 --> 01:24:00,408
take a moment with
your client.

1096
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,737
He seems to be confused as to
exactly why we're here.

1097
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,442
What are
you doing?

1098
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:09,576
Telling the truth.

1099
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:10,778
Do you want to
go back inside

1100
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,780
with those animals?

1101
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,752
He's embarrassing
himself, Ricky.

1102
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:20,821
Let him speak,
Barry.

1103
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,764
Your honour, I tried
to make it clear,

1104
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:33,600
but my client wishes
to speak on his own behalf.

1105
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:35,135
Fine.

1106
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,503
Sit down.

1107
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:37,792
Mr. Randall,
you realize you are

1108
01:24:37,793 --> 01:24:39,673
speaking against
your lawyer's advice?

1109
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,809
Yes.

1110
01:24:41,811 --> 01:24:44,344
Are you his
guardian?

1111
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:47,681
Yeah, that's right,
I'm his dad.

1112
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:52,186
Do you want him to proceed
against counsel's advice?

1113
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:54,588
Yes I do.

1114
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,591
He's a good kid,
he didn't mean to do--

1115
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:58,859
It's okay,
It's okay.

1116
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:00,427
You can sit.

1117
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,795
Mr. Randall,
do you understand

1118
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:05,632
exactly why you're
here today?

1119
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,501
Yes, I'm being charged
with harassment.

1120
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:09,536
Yes, you're charged
with harassing a person

1121
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:12,206
you we're ordered to
stay away from.

1122
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:14,108
What we are asking
here today is:

1123
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:18,512
do you plead guilty to
this charge -- yes or no?

1124
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:20,581
No, I do not.

1125
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,616
Not guilty.

1126
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:23,584
I was angry.

1127
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:25,419
I wrote things down.

1128
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:27,754
Stupid, but
not dangerous.

1129
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:32,659
So what suited you yesterday
doesn't suit you today?

1130
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:34,161
We have a name for
that here, Mr. Randall.

1131
01:25:34,163 --> 01:25:36,430
It's called perjury.

1132
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:38,499
Is that what
you're saying?

1133
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,667
That you
perjured yourself?

1134
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:43,303
I'm saying I lied.

1135
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,772
If that's perjury
then yes.

1136
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,643
You leave me no choice,
Mr. Randall.

1137
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:52,412
This court is all about the
consequences of your actions

1138
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:55,182
and the implications
to this community.

1139
01:25:55,184 --> 01:26:00,387
So I'm going to remove you from
this community for three months.

1140
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:05,792
The next time I see you --
make sure you have a lawyer.

1141
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,678
Got you boys
a present.

1142
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,779
Holy fuck!

1143
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:27,948
Whoa, Columbine!

1144
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:28,882
Did you miss us?

1145
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:30,651
Check out the hairdo.

1146
01:26:30,653 --> 01:26:31,518
Hey, Trevor?

1147
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,519
Where's Trevor.

1148
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,655
Trevor don't do
Christmas, man.

1149
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:35,734
What do you mean
he don't do Christmas?

1150
01:26:35,735 --> 01:26:37,291
Where is he?

1151
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:38,759
Yo Trevor, get your
ass out here man,

1152
01:26:38,761 --> 01:26:40,761
you gotta see this.

1153
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:47,968
Well I can't believe
he came back though.

1154
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:51,838
He know's he's gonna
get killed right?

1155
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:18,232
I wonder what's going on
in the world today.

1156
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:21,268
Looks like the dollar's
still gaining...

1157
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:24,938
Sidney Crosby's out
with concussion...

1158
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,840
Oh, here's something:

1159
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:30,377
"Eastport teen
jailed for perjury."

1160
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:32,779
Do you know about this?

1161
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:36,650
Purge-re?

1162
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:37,651
What the fuck
is that?

1163
01:27:37,653 --> 01:27:39,386
It means I lied
in court.

1164
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:40,699
It means Columbine
don't want to be

1165
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,322
Columbine no more.

1166
01:27:42,324 --> 01:27:43,690
Only he is Columbine
so they won't let him

1167
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:45,892
not be Columbine.

1168
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:47,861
Ain't that right,
Columbine?

1169
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:50,864
Why's it matter?

1170
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,266
You're in jail,
I'm in jail.

1171
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:53,533
We've all
done stuff.

1172
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:54,768
Not me,
I'm innocent.

1173
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:59,373
You can call me Columbine
all you want.

1174
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,841
I know who I am.

1175
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,646
You know
you're dead?

1176
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:29,569
Fuck this.

1177
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:30,604
What the fuck, man?

1178
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:31,805
Put it back.

1179
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,740
Game's shit, bro.

1180
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:36,843
It's a fuckin'
blowout.

1181
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:41,515
Oh, shit yo --
I know this.

1182
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:44,211
Yeah, I used to watch this
at my grandma's every year.

1183
01:28:44,212 --> 01:28:46,308
Man, does this look
like your grandma's?

1184
01:28:46,309 --> 01:28:47,875
Yeah man,
this is a classic

1185
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:50,557
It's about this fella,
he claims to be the real

1186
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:51,725
Santa Claus and shit.

1187
01:28:51,727 --> 01:28:53,727
Fuck, Marcel man,
no one wants to watch

1188
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:55,662
a fuckin' black and white
movie from the depression -

1189
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:56,963
Who's fucking go?

1190
01:28:56,965 --> 01:28:59,733
Shut up, Tyrell,
I'm trying to listen.

1191
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:01,501
<i>"She's a little confused."</i>

1192
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:03,978
<i>"Would you tell her that you're
not really Santa Claus?"</i>

1193
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:05,906
<i>"That there's actually</i>
<i>no such person?"</i>

1194
01:29:05,908 --> 01:29:07,941
"I'm sorry to disagree with you,
<i>Mrs. Walker,</i>

1195
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:09,576
<i>but not only</i>
<i>is there such a person,</i>

1196
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:10,944
<i>but here I am</i>
<i>to prove it."</i>

1197
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:13,380
Whose fucking go?

1198
01:29:13,382 --> 01:29:14,681
Go Ray!

1199
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,583
- Slow ass motherfucker.
- <i>"I want you to tell her the truth."</i>

1200
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:18,392
<i>- "What is your name?"
- "Kris Kringle."</i>

1201
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:19,819
<i>"I'll bet you're in</i>
<i>the first grade."</i>

1202
01:29:19,822 --> 01:29:21,088
<i>"Second."</i>

1203
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,823
<i>"I mean your</i>
<i>real name."</i>

1204
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:24,424
<i>"That is my</i>
<i>real name --"</i>

1205
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:26,626
<i>"Second grade,</i>
<i>good gracious."</i>

1206
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:27,761
<i>"It's a progressive school."</i>

1207
01:29:27,763 --> 01:29:29,930
<i>"Ohhh, progressive school"</i>

1208
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:31,865
Fuck -- can somebody
go already?

1209
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,400
Chill out.

1210
01:29:33,402 --> 01:29:37,604
<i>"Where did you get</i>
<i>such a lovely outfit?"</i>

1211
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:34,594
Get up!

1212
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:35,695
Open the door.

1213
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:38,098
Lucas, open up,
it's me!

1214
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:41,435
Get the fuck
out of my way!

1215
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:42,702
Whoa, shit yo!

1216
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:21,475
Hey you look out
for my name man.

1217
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:23,543
You know
what it is.

1218
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:32,786
"To Seen."

1219
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:34,754
What the fuck?

1220
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:36,523
Man, that's
Columbine.

1221
01:31:36,525 --> 01:31:38,124
Okay.

1222
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:40,126
Yo, Seen --
Merry Christmas.

1223
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:42,762
My name's Sean.

1224
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:44,231
Yeah alright.

1225
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:45,565
Now tell me why I got
a wallet in a prison.

1226
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,767
What money do I got?

1227
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:52,672
Muthafuck!

1228
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:53,773
I mean damn.

1229
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:55,842
Columbine got
an iPhone 4.

1230
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:56,874
Check this out --

1231
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,512
it's still in its
plastic and everything.

1232
01:31:58,514 --> 01:31:59,679
Holy Shit.

1233
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:03,583
What I would do
with an iPhone4.

1234
01:32:03,585 --> 01:32:06,086
I hear they got like a
camera... Internet...

1235
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,189
Alright man,
what you get?

1236
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,290
A jumpsuit,
but I didn't find it funny.

1237
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:18,565
Hey yo you guys,
check this out right here.

1238
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:21,067
What do you get if you cross
Santa Claus with a duck?

1239
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:22,269
Your momma?

1240
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,639
A Christmas Quacker.

1241
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:31,745
Yo, Trev,
you ain't gonna pull at

1242
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:32,846
your cracker?

1243
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:44,157
Hey yo,
put on your hat.

1244
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,825
Fuck that.

1245
01:32:45,827 --> 01:32:48,728
Come on Trev,
we all got ours on.

1246
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,699
Trade hats with me,
Columbine.

1247
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:53,833
I got your color.

1248
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:58,004
You think you're
all tough now?

1249
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:01,074
Cause you got
by my bitch?

1250
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:07,347
Should have killed him,
weak punk ass faggot.

1251
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:11,718
I guess killing's
not my thing.

1252
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,054
Not here, Trev.

1253
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:24,731
There, can we
fucking eat now?

1254
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,201
What are you
so afraid of?

1255
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:29,078
It's just a hat.

1256
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:31,605
You're gonna kill me
because of a hat?

1257
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:33,940
I want to kill you
because you're a faggot.

1258
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,642
Is that why you
killed the old man?

1259
01:33:35,644 --> 01:33:37,877
Because he was
a faggot?

1260
01:33:37,879 --> 01:33:40,680
Or was it because he
thought you were?

1261
01:33:52,315 --> 01:33:53,259
FUCK YOU!

1262
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:55,142
I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!
I SWEAR TO GOD!

1263
01:33:55,143 --> 01:33:57,063
I'LL FUCKING
KILL YOU!

1264
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:00,867
Let me go!
Let me go!

1265
01:34:00,869 --> 01:34:02,636
Fucking let me go!

1266
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,170
Get your fucking

1267
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,155
What the fuck, man!

1268
01:34:05,156 --> 01:34:07,641
Get your fucking
hands off me!

1269
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:19,019
OPEN THE DOOR!

1270
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:35,135
Stand down!

1271
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,737
Stand down!

1272
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,209
D.U. code 11.
D.U. code 11.

1273
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:45,945
Sit down!

1274
01:34:45,947 --> 01:34:48,748
Back away and
stand down!

1275
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,087
Back down.

1276
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:11,104
Code 11.

1277
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:12,706
D.U. Code 11.

1278
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:17,310
Code 21.

1279
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:18,712
D.U. Code 21.

1280
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:31,357
Hey, I just want to
go to sleep, huh.

1281
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:32,192
Hey!

1282
01:35:32,194 --> 01:35:33,460
HEY!

1283
01:35:33,462 --> 01:35:34,794
AHHH!

1284
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:36,930
AHHHHH!

1285
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:39,365
The fuck!

1286
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:40,433
Ah!

1287
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,363
Is he okay?

1288
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:02,582
Fuck!

1289
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:04,217
Stop it! It was just
a glass of water.

1290
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:04,919
Sit the fuck down.

1291
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,067
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

1292
01:37:06,068 --> 01:37:06,942
You didn't have
to do that.

1293
01:37:06,943 --> 01:37:08,161
I'll kill you, man.

1294
01:37:08,162 --> 01:37:09,989
I'll fucking
kill you!

1295
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:11,591
I just want to
fucking eat.

1296
01:37:11,593 --> 01:37:12,926
D.U. Code 21.

1297
01:37:12,928 --> 01:37:14,093
I just want to
fucking eat!

1298
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:14,894
HEY!

1299
01:37:14,896 --> 01:37:16,496
Oh my god!

1300
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,564
Fuck!

1301
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:43,923
Keep moving.

1302
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,505
Weirdly the food tastes
better in here,

1303
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:01,374
don't you think?

1304
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:19,459
Randall.

1305
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:24,097
Fly away little bird.

1306
01:38:24,099 --> 01:38:24,998
What about Trevor?

1307
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,233
We came in at
the same time.

1308
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:28,635
He ain't ready.

1309
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:33,273
If he's not ready,
I'm not ready.

1310
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:04,103
It was self defense.

1311
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:12,011
He had this way of
locking the doors.

1312
01:39:12,013 --> 01:39:14,013
Like a cop.

1313
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,322
I just wanted out.

1314
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:15,608
You can have it.

1315
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:17,276
I don't want it.

1316
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:05,558
How was my dad
in the car?

1317
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,629
I learned a lot about
Sidney Crosby.

1318
01:41:09,631 --> 01:41:11,531
He's a nice guy --

1319
01:41:11,533 --> 01:41:13,232
Sidney Crosby?

1320
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:15,501
Your dad.

1321
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:18,738
You're lucky
to have him.

1322
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,139
What about
your dad?

1323
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:22,442
He know
you're here?

1324
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:26,746
No.

1325
01:41:37,858 --> 01:41:40,793
I couldn't
breathe anymore.

1326
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:43,596
It was either move out
or slit my wrists.

1327
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:47,700
Well, I'm glad you
chose to move out.

1328
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:53,606
Do you have a
marker or a pen?

1329
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:56,576
Yeah, I have a
ball point?

1330
01:41:56,578 --> 01:41:58,111
Yeah thanks.

1331
01:42:07,888 --> 01:42:11,190
I hate seeing you
like this.

1332
01:42:11,192 --> 01:42:13,826
Your whole
face is just --

1333
01:42:13,828 --> 01:42:15,428
It's okay.

1334
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:17,897
It's only two
more months.

1335
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,022
You know --

1336
01:42:21,023 --> 01:42:23,603
he's not going to want
us to be together.

1337
01:42:23,605 --> 01:42:26,239
He's not going
to make it easy.

1338
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:30,443
Oh, that's okay.

1339
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:33,246
Easy's not really
my thing.
