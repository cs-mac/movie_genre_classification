1
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:33,105
Most 16, 17-year-old kids,
they make a bad choice,

2
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:35,083
something gets broken,

3
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,211
they screw up in class,

4
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:39,313
hurt somebody's feelings,

5
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:41,517
show up at the prom drunk,

6
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,152
they get sent to the principal's office,

7
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,287
have their car keys taken away

8
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:47,955
or get grounded.

9
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:58,107
Then there's kids, they make a bad choice,

10
00:01:58,107 --> 00:02:01,110
somebody ends up shot dead
in a parkin' lot.

11
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,372
Those kids get sent here.

12
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:32,270
- Get off me, homey!
- Hey, man!

13
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,605
I'll shut your mouth, punk!

14
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:36,510
- Weathers! Get off of 'im! Get off-a him!
- You don't know me! Shut your mouth!

15
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,448
- Get off me! Don't you ever diss my hood.
- I got him! Just get the door!

16
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:41,916
Goddamn 88.

17
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,044
Let's go, Weathers!

18
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,054
Go back to sleep, guys. Lay down.

19
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,864
What is wrong with you?

20
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,161
Shit!

21
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,165
G'night, Weathers.

22
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:10,412
Back to bed, gentlemen.

23
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,507
Mr. Porter?

24
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,584
Gettin' beat in the middle of the night,
how do you like it, Roger? You like that?

25
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,744
Whatchu hitting me for?

26
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,048
What'd you hit Kelvin Owens for?

27
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,315
He dissed my hood.

28
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,118
And now he's up there asleep
and you're stuck in here.

29
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,590
So what does that make you?

30
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,058
Hey, man. Can you do dat?

31
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:59,960
- Can I do what?
- Be smackin' me and shit.

32
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:02,992
I guess I can.

33
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,534
Shit, man!

34
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:15,373
Roger, you're 1 7 years old.
Where you gonna be in four years, huh?

35
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:16,913
I don't know.

36
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:20,016
Answer me.
Where you gonna be when you're 21?

37
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,178
Probably in jail.

38
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,445
What?

39
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:25,555
Look at me!

40
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:26,748
What'd you say?

41
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:27,950
In jail.

42
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,722
No. You're not gonna be in jail.
You're gonna be dead.

43
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,332
You're a good kid, Roger.

44
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,531
But you're gonna be
back out on the streets tomorrow.

45
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:44,073
Back in your hood with your homeys.

46
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:47,474
You wanna stay alive, you gotta make a life
for yourself outside of your set.

47
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:51,105
If you don't do that,
if you don't find an alternative,

48
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,842
you're gonna die.

49
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:58,714
If you want any kinda help,
if you want to talk, I'm here for you.

50
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:07,854
Think about it.

51
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,111
Man, the moon be playin' with me, dawg.

52
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:32,144
Locked up at camp, used to look up
and see it all white and clean.

53
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:36,716
And think how it's the same o'er here
in the hood, only it's all dirty and shit.

54
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,695
Look, man, you back in the hood now, man.
You best forget that moon.

55
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:42,630
Keep your eyes on this here street, man.
You're back, baby.

56
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,691
Yo, I remember this poem said once,

57
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,932
"The moon is a friend
for the Ionesome to talk to."

58
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,564
Damn, girl.

59
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,635
You got a poem for everything that come up.

60
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,337
Didn't I tell you she was smart?

61
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:57,744
Yeah, she so smart
why is she witchu, dawg?

62
00:05:57,744 --> 00:06:00,511
Ya know,
I ask myself that question all the time.

63
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:02,745
There they go. There they go.

64
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:06,819
Yo, lil' homeys. 9-5s just jacked

00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,554
Man, don't look to her
when there's work to be done, dawg.

68
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:17,066
Look, man, I ain't got no heat.

00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,541
Look, man, if you wanna just chill,

Yo, man, this ain't no damn math quiz.

81
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,060

82
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,602
Put that shit away, man. Hurry up.

00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:59,264
Where these niggas at anyway, man?

00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,203

Damn it!

92
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:45,750
Roger!

93
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,749
Baby! Roger!

94
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:15,780
Baby!

95
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,157
Oh, God!

96
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:25,755
I saw the whole damn thing, officer.
Destroying the community.

97
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,319
Get all them damn gangs.

98
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,523
Drac.

99
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,232
Who did this?

100
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,792
95s, man.

101
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:35,733
One they call Klick.

102
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,273
Yeah, all right.

103
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:41,141
I know how it hurts. You and Raja
like lil' brothers to me, all right?

104
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:43,304
We gotta do right by him.

105
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,405
Me, I'll deal with Klick.

106
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,006
You put in work on his brother.

107
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,917
His name's Anthony.
Works nights, Parkside Market.

108
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,785
Free, let me go wit 'im.
I want to smoke some 95s too, man.

109
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,723
C-Co, this here is Drac's work. Right?

110
00:08:58,395 --> 00:08:59,657
For Raja.

111
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,293
Oh, God!

112
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:06,831
Oh, God!

113
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:18,070
All right, put all reading and writing material
and games away.

114
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,308
Hey, come on, homes.

115
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,647
If I see it, it's confiscated.

116
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,721
- Sean.
- What's goin' on?

117
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,579
Back up a little bit.

118
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:31,518
Roger Weathers got killed
in a drive-by today.

119
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:34,987
I said don't rush me, bitch!

120
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,726
See what happens?

121
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,293
What?

122
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,805
- Wassup?
- Get back! Enough! Come on!

123
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,135
Wassup?

124
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,640
Junior. Hey!

125
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:47,602
To the box.

126
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,167
I know the way.

127
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,681
You get your hands
behind your back, mister.

128
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,444
We got your back, homey.

129
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:57,715
That's the third time in the box
this week for Junior.

130
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,483
Back in your bunks.

131
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:02,582
Anyone else wanna laugh and joke
with him in the box? Is that it?

132
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,492
I'll send somebody's ass back to the box.

133
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,022
Christ, Malcolm, what are we doin' here?

134
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:12,432
We're like goddamn sheepherders.

135
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:15,772
We fatten 'em up and put 'em right back
on the street where they get slaughtered.

136
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:17,568
Tell me about it.

137
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,137
We're not even makin' a dent.

138
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,021
Willie!

139
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,459
Willie!

140
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:02,582
Where's Anthony at?

141
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,051
In the back.

142
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,051
Go, baby! Go!

143
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,565
Don't do this, please.

144
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,365
I got two little boys at home.

145
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:20,630
For my dead homey!

146
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,864
No, don't do this.

147
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,168
Oh, my God, what are you do...

148
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:25,538
Oh, shit!

149
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,068
Damn!

150
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,327
Where you been?
I thought somethin' happened to you.

151
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,058
Naw, I'm a'ight.

152
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,425
Bro, y'all gonna
shoot the boys killed Roger?

153
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:54,800
Dewayne, why would you say...
Just shut up.

154
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,236
'Sup, man?

155
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:57,972
Come here.

156
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,470
- Wassup, Ma?
- Here.

157
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,338
What's this?

158
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:07,076
- It was an accident.
- "Accident."

159
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:13,887
Accident? Why you keep lettin' him
do this to you, Ma?

160
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:16,885
Why you keep lettin' him back in here?

161
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,087
Hey, hey, hey,
whyn't you stay outta this, boy.

162
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:21,596
- Stay outta this?
- That's right. She know why she got it.

163
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:24,532
- This my mother. This is my mother.
- Who you talking to?

164
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,329
Naw, Mama, I'm sick of it!

165
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,200
- You better calm him down.
- He come and go whenever he please,

166
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,105
take your money and disappear
till he need more? I'm tired of this lowlife!

167
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:34,040
- Stop!
- Get off, lowlife woman!

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,439
I'm tired of this...

169
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,480
Show me some respect, you little punk.

170
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,481
Don't hit my son! Are you crazy?

171
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,313
- You better show me my respect!
- Don't you put your hands on him!

172
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,613
Get off!

173
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,492
I told you, you hurt her again...

174
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,824
You ain't got the balls to shoot me, boy.

175
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,295
Just leave!

176
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:07,808
Oh, God, no. No, no. No, no, no, no. No.
No, baby. No. No.

177
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,379
He's dead.

178
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,827
Listen, Paul, we convince a kid to stop
gangbanging, all we do is create a void.

179
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,130
And unless we fill that void
with somethin' better, we're gonna lose 'em.

180
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,563
According to the teaching staff,
the kids here have trouble being punctual,

181
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:10,265
responding to authority, being a member
of a team, and accepting criticism.

182
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:13,070
What one activity can improve 'em
on all these areas?

183
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,634
- You wanna start a football team?
- Exactly.

184
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,907
Sean, look at them.

185
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:21,246
Our whole system's designed
to prevent them from making contact.

186
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,945
Our whole system right now is a joke.

187
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,487
Malcolm, you're not buying into this,
are you?

188
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,683
Seventy-five percent of our kids
end up back in jail.

189
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:29,918
How much worse could it be?

190
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,221
Well, who are they gonna play against?

191
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,886
I'll find 'em high school teams to play.

192
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,827
Wait a minute,
you wanna take 'em out of the camp?

193
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,593
You really think you can trust these kids?

194
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,327
Not now, no.
But if they were a football team...

195
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,733
Oh, come on, Sean. It's impossible.

196
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:45,104
Then let's try the impossible,
because the possible just ain't workin'.

197
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:50,340
Paul, we've got to give these kids a target
and we've gotta fill that void.

198
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,005
You played football, didn't you?

199
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:56,052
Defensive end. Second Team All League.

200
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,752
All right, we'll give it a try.

201
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,490
But your neck is way out on this.

202
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,579
Mom, they have wheelchairs, ya know.

203
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,485
- I'm okay.
- Thank you.

204
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,360
Now, see, I've been tellin' you for years
you should coach.

205
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:19,160
I know. I know, Mom, but I just think
with you sick, maybe it's not a good time.

206
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,702
I completely agree.

207
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:22,499
Why should you do something you love

208
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,938
when you could be sittin' around
watchin' me fade away?

209
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,175
So, what kinda offense you gonna run?

210
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:33,078
I don't even know
if enough kids'll wanna play.

211
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,641
Are you kiddin'?
Teenage boys'll kill to play football.

212
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,554
That's what everybody's afraid of.

213
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:43,458
Throw it in. Over here. Down low.

214
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:50,932
Hey, yo, fetch me that ball, man.

215
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,636
Yo, nigga, you deaf? I said gimme the ball.

216
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,369
What, you can't talk neither?

217
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,366
Yo, Junior.

218
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,274
Take that ball, dawg.

219
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:06,846
This cat think he king of Samoa 'cause
he killed some Mexican with a baseball bat.

220
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,315
Yo, Junior, come on, man.

221
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:10,477
Catch you on the fly, homey.

222
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:12,020
Ball in, man.

223
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:17,490
Whatchu looking at me foul like that for?

224
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:20,786
I know you.

225
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:23,125
You a goddamn 88.

226
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,496
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:30,664
You lucky we up in here.

228
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:32,435
'Cause on the outs

229
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,575
you'd be dead.

230
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:37,204
I'll kill you right here, right now.

231
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:41,041
All right, gentlemen, let's line it up.

232
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,814
Owens, that's you too.
Come on, hurry up. Everybody.

233
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,551
Hurry up. Move it.

234
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,516
You wanna play football with this team,

235
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:55,530
you're gonna live with the team,
eat with the team and work with the team.

236
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,190
Is practice gonna be hard?

237
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,065
It's a lot harder than five homeboys
beatin' up a security guard, Perez.

238
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,569
Then I'm in.

239
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,763
How 'bout you, Bates?

240
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:04,898
I don't know.

241
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:07,499
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared.

242
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,135
You're on the team.

243
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,407
Yo. I'll play quarterback.

244
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,812
You got any experience, Leon?

245
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,406
Man, I got so much experience

246
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:18,250
I could give some away
and still have more than I could use.

247
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:21,021
All right.

248
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,417
I'll play.

249
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,392
- I can't use you, Junior.
- Why not?

250
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:27,793
'Cause you got no discipline. You'll be tryin'
to start fights every time I turn my back.

251
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,126
You ain't even gonna give me a chance?

252
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,631
You've had plenty of chances.

253
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,997
Who else?

254
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,028
How 'bout you, Owens?

255
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:38,562
You played defensive back, didn't you?
For Washington?

256
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,206
You wanna check your calendar
and get back to me?

257
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:43,837
Or maybe you got
another liquor store to rob.

258
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:45,403
Yeah, I'll play.

259
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,176
How 'bout you, Evans?

260
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:50,310
I mean, I played Pop Warner when
I was younger but that's about it, though.

261
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,444
You're on the team.

262
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,820
I got experience.
I played for, like, three years.

263
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,688
- What position'd you play?
- Out to the side.

264
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:58,590
Was that out to the side on offense
or defense?

265
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,357
If the ball's thrown from...

266
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,524
Man, I don't know what I'm talkin'.

267
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:07,161
All right, Bug. How 'bout you be water boy?

268
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:08,760
- Cool.
- All right.

269
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,068
Yo, Mr. Porter. Can I play?

270
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,040
You're getting out in a week, Madlock.

271
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,235
I wanna stay in.

272
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:15,800
You wanna stay in jail?

273
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,608
Yeah, man.
South Central in summertime gets hot.

274
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,411
Gets crazy.
People start shootin' each other and stuff.

275
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,111
I'll talk to your case worker.

276
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,414
- All right?
- All right.

277
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,648
New booty? What's your name?

278
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:28,847
Willie Weathers.

279
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,359
Get vertical when you talk to me.

280
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,763
You any relation to Roger Weathers?

281
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:38,562
He was my cousin, man.

282
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,830
I want you to play on this team, Willie.

283
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,268
Naw, man, it's a'ight.

284
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,999
You're playin'.

285
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,301
Why?

286
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,606
'Cause I want you to live longer
than your cousin.

287
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,744
Hey. Who we gonna play against?

288
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,083
We'll let ya know.

289
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,517
All right.

290
00:19:58,187 --> 00:19:59,848
I'm gonna do my stuff, boy.

291
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:04,921
Well, it's not a jail.
It's a juvenile detention center.

292
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,894
But they're criminals?

293
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:09,094
Yeah. Technically.

294
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:11,459
Sorry, I can't.

295
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,866
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Coach.

296
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:16,427
Our players will be closely supervised,
no problems.

297
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,634
Sounds fine,
as long as there's no gang members.

298
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,936
See, that's the thing.
We don't have our own home field.

299
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,708
So you expect to bring 'em here.

300
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,148
Yeah, that's a great idea. We love your field.

301
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,980
I'll come tomorrow.

302
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:32,220
Sorry, guys, I don't think it's gonna work.

303
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:36,257
Most of our starters
have been in this program for three years.

304
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:37,883
You have four weeks to prepare your team.

305
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:40,394
Do you really wanna go up
against those kinda odds?

306
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:42,658
I'll bet ya $100 we win.

307
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,462
We're a Christian school,
we don't gamble. I...

308
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:46,900
Look, I have to be honest with ya.

309
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,335
I don't think it's in the best interest
of my kids to play you.

310
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:52,431
Well, what about our players?
Don't they deserve a chance to play?

311
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:55,443
Well, frankly, no. They lost that chance
when they broke the law.

312
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:57,536
Well, maybe we shouldn't let 'em eat, either.
How 'bout that?

313
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:58,739
Sean.

314
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:03,383
Mr. Torrance, let me ask you.
You a Christian, right?

315
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,046
Yeah.

316
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:08,249
Now, I'm not that familiar
with the exact words,

317
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,549
but didn't Jesus say somethin' like,

318
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,154
"Be merciful, just as your Father's merciful,

319
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:18,462
"don't pass judgment
and you won't be judged"?

320
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:21,035
It's the book of Luke.

321
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:24,070
"Give and it'll be given in good measure.

322
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:27,067
"For whatever measure
you deal out to others,

323
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,611
"it'll be dealt to you in return."

324
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,312
You're not too familiar with it, huh?

325
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,816
No, look, Bob and Mel said it's fine
with them if it's fine with you.

326
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:38,911
I didn't know you were religious.

327
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:43,425
I ain't religious, but we need
all the help we can get for this program.

328
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:47,596
Wouldn't hurt for you to pray some yourself.

329
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,598
Well, scheduling games
on Saturday afternoon,

330
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:54,158
it isn't easy,

331
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:57,231
but I think I just got you a full schedule.

332
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,467
- Thank you.
- Welcome to the Camino Real League.

333
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,736
Hey, thanks a lot.

334
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,444
Take a knee, half-circle.

335
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:03,672
Everybody take a knee.

336
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,043
Gentlemen, we ain't got all day.

337
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,547
Bring it in.

338
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:09,207
All right, everybody, listen up.

339
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,583
Whatever neighborhood you came from,

340
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,485
whatever gang you claim,

341
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,114
whatever hood you're from,

342
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:16,920
this is your hood now.

343
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,019
You're no longer a Blood, no longer a Crip,

344
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,389
no longer an esé.

345
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,023
You're Mustang.

346
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,760
This football program will be three-pronged.

347
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,668
Number one, the dorm.

348
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,433
You're gonna have to learn to get along
with people from other neighborhoods.

349
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,976
Different backgrounds.

350
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:36,841
Number two, school.

351
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,414
You're gonna have to apply yourself.
Become a better student.

352
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:43,949
And number three, the gridiron.

353
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,388
Hey, Coach. What's the gridiron?

354
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:48,855
You're standin' on the gridiron.

355
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:51,291
The gridiron is a football field.

356
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,590
On the gridiron, we play football.

357
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,097
On the gridiron, we do it my way.

358
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,864
Not your way, my way.

359
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,133
Your way got you here.

360
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,832
And you're here 'cause ya lost.

361
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,931
Right now, you're losers.

362
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,801
Mustangs are winners.

363
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:14,382
And if you accept this challenge,

364
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,752
when it's all over come December,

365
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,047
you're gonna be winners.

366
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:28,696
All right, let's go. Let's have
a good first day of practice. Jumpin' jacks.

367
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:31,198
Everybody ready? Get set!

368
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,063
Begin.

369
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,177
M-U-S-T-A...

370
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:41,437
- T!
- A!

371
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:42,397
A-N-G-S!

372
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:52,113
You've got to be shittin' me.
You don't know how to spell "Mustangs"?

373
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:54,554
This is gonna be a long-ass day.

374
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,360
Evans, what in the blue hell is that?

375
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:09,998
Get up, Evans!

376
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:12,666
I bet ya there's a piece-a chicken down there
you'd go for it, wouldn't ya?

377
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,934
Hell, yeah, Coach. I love chicken.

378
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:15,307
Then get your ass down there
on my whistle.

379
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:17,744
On my whistle, get that chicken.

380
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,114
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it.
Get your feet pumpin'.

381
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:23,344
Feet pumpin'. You got pride.

382
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,482
Bend your knees.

383
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,986
Damn.

384
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:35,926
Concentrate. Focus.

385
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:41,364
- Little lower, Bates.
- Bend your knees.

386
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,671
You up for the challenge, Bates?

387
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,273
Good job. Thatta boy.

388
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:51,238
All right, Bug, let's get a water break. Bug.

389
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,748
All right, good job. Bring it in.

390
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,085
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

391
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:59,713
Y'all don't behave, y'all gonna die of thirst.
Y'all got that?

392
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:02,349
All right?
Hey, hey, I gotta do it, I gotta do it.

393
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:04,586
Here y'all go, here y'all go. All right, now.

394
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,525
Y'all doin' good out there,
that's what I like to see.

395
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:07,325
M-U-S-T-A-N-G-S!

396
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,265
Mustangs! Mustangs! Mustangs!

397
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,571
Come on, bring it! Hustle.
Touch that line and get back!

398
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:27,941
Way to go, Leon! Think you got that!

399
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:32,244
You ain't cheatin' me,
you're cheatin' yourself. Behind the line.

400
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:35,483
- Let's go!
- All the way through.

401
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,288
Come on, Weathers! Hustle!
Get down here, Weathers! Good job!

402
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,955
Good job. Now, get back!
Good hustle, come on!

403
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:43,931
Come on, Weathers. Come on.
All the way through, Willie!

404
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:46,161
Come on, Kelvin. Get 'im!

405
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,874
Look at you go, Evans! I like that! I like it!

406
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,741
Touch the line!

407
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:06,254
Evans, this is wind sprints, not wind walks.

408
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:10,922
All the way through, Evans.
Come on, come on. Come on.

409
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:14,292
- I'm too tired.
- You're too tired, my ass. You're too lazy.

410
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:16,627
But that's gonna change. I promise you
that's gonna change, come on.

411
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:18,860
Come on, back in line.
Through the line, Evans.

412
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,370
Man, I quit, dawg.
I had enough of this shit, man.

413
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,065
Y'all niggas is trippin'.

414
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:27,166
Five hundred degrees
and y'all doin' wind sprints?

415
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,835
If you can't accept the challenge,

416
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:32,347
then you're not good enough to call
yourself a Mustang, Evans. You hear me?

417
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:35,578
You wanna come back out here,
we'll be out here workin' our asses off.

418
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:39,052
You wanna come back out, make sure you
bring a heart with you next time.

419
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:41,180
What's everybody lookin' at?
Who else wants to quit?

420
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,021
Come on, Bates. We're almost done, Bates.
Don't quit on me.

421
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,993
Hand on the line. On my whistle.

422
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:47,859
All the way through,
touch the line and get back.

423
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,797
Come on, Bates. This is where we
win the game, in the fourth quarter.

424
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:53,835
You will be mentally tough
when this is done.

425
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:57,339
All right, bring it in.

426
00:26:57,773 --> 00:27:00,105
Great practice, great practice.

427
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,536
Way to work, way to work.

428
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:07,039
Everybody in close. Get in close.
Take a knee.

429
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:13,049
You guys worked really hard this week.
You should be proud.

430
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:17,217
You haven't heard that a whole lot,
have you?

431
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:18,954
You've earned it.

432
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:23,595
Boys, it's a whole new world out there
when you earn things.

433
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:27,428
All right, bring it in.

434
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,630
Everybody in. Everybody in.

435
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:32,674
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

436
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:34,072
Mustangs!

437
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:38,842
Jog it off the field. Jog it off!
You want water? It's on the sidelines. Jog!

438
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:45,745
Three weeks from this Saturday, we open
our season against Barrington High School.

439
00:27:45,745 --> 00:27:46,913
They any good?

440
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:48,820
They've only lost five games in three years.

441
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,882
We about to make it six.

442
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,060
All right, all right, listen up.

443
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,860
Madlock, look up here. I want you to tell me
what the offense is tryin' to do.

444
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,797
Which is the offense?

445
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:00,327
The O's.

446
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,165
Man, I don't know what all this shit mean.

447
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:05,503
It means, "Have a nice day"
in Japanese, Madlock.

448
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:09,203
Naw, man, Japanese for "Nissan Sentra,"
right, Bates?

449
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:10,802
What does that mean, Bates?

450
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,576
Bates jacked a Nissan Sentra.
That's why he's here.

451
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:18,018
It's sad. If you gonna jack a car,
jack a Mercedes or a BMW.

452
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:22,717
If you jack a Sentra, you gotta drive
backwards so nobody can see your face.

453
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,692
All right, listen up.

454
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,424
You got a pass, Junior?

455
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,487
I had a phone call.

456
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,824
From who?

457
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:04,859
It's my boy's birthday, man.

458
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:07,698
He's two years old.

459
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:13,031
He's two years old and I missed it.

460
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,714
I wanna be a Mustang, Coach.

461
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:28,189
Why should I trust you?

462
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:29,885
'Cause I ain't gonna mess up.

463
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,756
That's what you told the judge
the last time you got out.

464
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:33,089
No more.

465
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,695
I'm tired of bein' a loser, man.

466
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,494
Makin' a mess of everything.

467
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:44,705
Coach, I wanna show people I can play.
I can do somethin' with my life.

468
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:50,475
I just wanna make my son proud.

469
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,981
Take it half speed till we get it right.

470
00:29:58,721 --> 00:29:59,847
Set.

471
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,284
Hut!

472
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:06,820
Junior. Junior. Junior. Junior!

473
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,487
Hey, get back. Madlock, get back.

474
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:09,861
Just 'cause we call it a run-through

475
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,456
doesn't mean you run through
your own men.

476
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,091
No contact till we get equipment.

477
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,602
- Look out for Junior.
- Wait till you get some pads.

478
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:17,070
Bug, give 'em water.

479
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,131
I'll be down with it, Coach!
Come on, guys, let's go!

480
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:24,043
Coach, how 'bout you have that water boy
go fill up the swimmin' pool?

481
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:26,240
Let us do a little backstroke
before we get heatstroke.

482
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,374
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll put a quart of water in that pool

483
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:29,474
for every pass you complete.

484
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:31,280
- How 'bout that?
- Okay, that's what's up.

485
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,015
Drink it up, drink it up, drink it up.

486
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:38,816
You want some water, 88?

487
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,132
My dead homeys drink water before you do.

488
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all doing good out there.
What I like to see!

489
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,368
Keep it up, I'll provide some extra water.

490
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:55,467
Now that's a funny kid. He always smilin'.

491
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:56,806
It's all about the water, man.

492
00:30:56,806 --> 00:31:01,043
I wonder if he was smilin'
when he stabbed that old lady for her purse.

493
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:02,251
Here ya go.

494
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:04,475
Junior, Willie, is that your positions?

495
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:06,612
Let's go. Leon, let's see what you got.

496
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:08,156
Green 18!

497
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:10,714
Green 18! Hut!

498
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,634
What was that about?

499
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,077
Man, just send me to the box!

500
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:33,842
No, you start trouble on a football field,
we finish it on a football field!

501
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,315
- I ain't doin' shit wit 'im!
- Why not?

502
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:36,612
Was his set smoked Raja!

503
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,676
- 88s killed my best friend!
- Shut up!

504
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:40,119
How long your sets been at war?

505
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,349
Ancient times, dude.

506
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,015
How'd it get started? You even know?

507
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:44,457
They started that shit, dawg!

508
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:46,858
- Man, that's a goddamn lie!
- Shut up!

509
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:48,954
Willie, lemme ask you something.

510
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:51,124
How'd you feel when Roger died?

511
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:52,633
Did you cry?

512
00:31:55,604 --> 00:31:56,969
How 'bout you, Kelvin?

513
00:31:56,969 --> 00:32:00,270
How did you feel
when your friend was killed? Did you cry?

514
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,843
Yes, sir, I did.

515
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:04,539
Yeah. So it's just gonna
go on like this forever?

516
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,913
Killin' each other 'cause ya live
five blocks in the wrong direction?

517
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,747
How 'bout we call a peace right here?

518
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,317
God damn it, why not?

519
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:20,988
I mean, we just, like, little gangsters.
It wouldn't even mean nothin'.

520
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:25,523
It'd mean somethin' here. Right here,
right now, it would mean somethin'.

521
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,502
Paul, a delay in funding?

522
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:34,041
Well, there's a lot of red tape
and paperwork we gotta...

523
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,872
How are we supposed
to play without equipment?

524
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,276
I just read Willie Weathers' file.
Have you seen it?

525
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:39,371
Yeah, what about it?

526
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:42,008
We had an agreement.
No killers on the football team, right?

527
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,644
Dexter, if there's more than five kids
on that team that aren't killers,

528
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:45,744
it's because they have lousy aim.

529
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,686
- They're not in here for that.
- 'Cause they didn't get caught.

530
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:48,848
But Weathers did.

531
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:52,758
And I'm workin' my ass off to make sure
he doesn't kill anybody again!

532
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:54,193
You sure that's it?

533
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:55,457
What?

534
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:57,465
Well, you were a college football star.
Maybe this team is...

535
00:32:57,465 --> 00:33:00,592
Dexter, your degree was in social work,
not psychology.

536
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:02,536
We need that equipment.

537
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:07,333
Guy's outta control.

538
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,378
Not now I'm not. But soon, very soon!

539
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:14,178
Come on, show us what you got!

540
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,578
Come on, buddy! Throw it!
No, no, no, no, no!

541
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,745
Evade!

542
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:19,879
Come on, man!

543
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:21,354
You gotta be kiddin' me! Hold on, hold on!

544
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:22,481
Cut it out.

545
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,959
For three days, we been runnin' this play.
You still don't know where you're goin'!

546
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:29,657
Get your asses on the line and do it again,
and do it right! Line it up!

547
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:31,323
Coach, you said we'd have a water break.

548
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,096
Not until you do it right. Line it up!

549
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,830
Line it up! Move!

550
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,106
Weathers, get up.

551
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,303
Not till we get some water.

552
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,175
Bug, give 'em some water.

553
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,719
- Here you go, boys!
- Finally did something as a team.

554
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,719
The water man's back in town.
Here you guys go.

555
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:35,156
These kids have never worked hard
for anything in their life.

556
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,927
And teamwork. Teamwork to them
is four homeboys robbin' a liquor store.

557
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:42,801
So I gotta push 'em. But I know
if I push 'em too hard I'll lose 'em.

558
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:47,331
You couldn't expect 'em to work as hard
as you did. Not right off the bat.

559
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,502
Now, see, you had a God-given talent.

560
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:52,672
The minute you put on a helmet,
you were a star.

561
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,909
I always had faith in you.

562
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,375
You're my mom. That's your job.

563
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,784
I'm your mom, that's my job.

564
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:02,924
Well, here we are.

565
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:04,356
Home sweet home.

566
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,127
Junior?

567
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:18,301
Who needs helmets?

568
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:24,445
Bug, give this to somebody who can use it.

569
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:26,504
Now, that's more like it.

570
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:34,385
Damn, J-dawg,
that's destruction of state property.

571
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,419
What the hell is this?

572
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,017
A nose guard.

573
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,490
It's for your balls, dawg.

574
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:50,895
Man, that's for pussies.

575
00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:01,641
Let's get it on!

576
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,981
Five tight, 32 dive. Run it.

577
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,812
Set.

578
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:07,885
Green 18!

579
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:09,014
Hut!

580
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,356
Madlock, what happened?

581
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:18,490
He broke my biscuits, man.

582
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:21,229
Broke your biscuits.
Are you wearin' your cup?

583
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:21,979
No.

584
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:27,070
Naw, he ain't wearin' his cup.
Because cups are for pussies!

585
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:33,948
Hey, yo, Coach.
I think I need to go back to the gym.

586
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:36,177
- You gotta go back to the gym?
- Yes, sir.

587
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,185
Put your cup on, maybe?

588
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:40,349
Yeah, me too.

589
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:43,220
Get goin', Willie.
Anybody else forget to put their cups on?

590
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,088
Yeah. Half the team.

591
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:47,958
Come on, Madlock, walk it off.

592
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,591
Walk it off, Madlock.

593
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,893
Yeah, limp it off, Madlock.

594
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:52,263
Hey, Coach.

595
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:56,031
I got mine on but it ain't nowhere
near big enough to hold me.

596
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,935
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I need the extra-large, Coach.

597
00:36:57,935 --> 00:37:01,203
Well, come here, tiny. Let me talk to you
for a second. Y'all get back to work.

598
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:03,643
All right, line it up, gentlemen.

599
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,107
What's up, Coach?

600
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:10,015
Last year, when you were dealing crack,

601
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:12,679
I heard that you made five times my salary.

602
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,278
And I ain't paid no taxes.

603
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:15,948
- No taxes?
- No taxes.

604
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:18,117
Means you're pretty good
at math, memorization.

605
00:37:18,117 --> 00:37:19,717
Yeah, I'm pretty friendly wit it.

606
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:21,092
Here's the problem.

607
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:24,064
I'm worried about Madlock
not being able to learn our playbook.

608
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,463
What's that got to do wit me?

609
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:28,526
If he can't learn it, he doesn't play,
which means he doesn't block for you,

610
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:32,630
which then means I'm gonna have
to put in Aguilar to protect you.

611
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:40,873
I see, Coach.

612
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:43,144
- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.

613
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:45,550
Get back to work. Come on.

614
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,882
Let's go!

615
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:49,389
Mr. Porter, can I talk to you?

616
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,221
I tried to tell ya.

617
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:53,460
Hey, Dexter.

618
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:56,658
You signed for $10,000 worth of equipment?

619
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:57,926
We got a helluva deal.

620
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,728
You're not authorized to do that.

621
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:01,360
Really? I thought I was.

622
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,165
You're gonna get suspended,
you know that, right?

623
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,570
Yeah, I know, but first you're gonna
have to write up a 784,

624
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,039
and then they're gonna schedule a hearing,

625
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,304
which I'm gonna have to postpone
due to a family illness,

626
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:12,608
then I'm gonna appeal that ruling, and
by that time, the season's gonna be over.

627
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:15,707
Look, Dexter, the equipment's used already,
we can't give it back.

628
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,617
Let's just give the kids what they worked
really, really hard for, huh?

629
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:27,823
I got a Mustang football T-shirt
for you, Dexter.

630
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:30,494
Get 'em goin', Coach.

631
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:38,404
Madlock, I'm gonna work witchu
'cause you got what it takes.

632
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:41,931
I'mma just, you know what I'm sayin',
get you together.

633
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:44,376
Hey, watch out, man! We workin' here!

634
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:47,904
Come on, Madlock, just stand in front of me,
don't let nobody hit me.

635
00:38:47,904 --> 00:38:51,111
You gonna come see me play?
See Daddy play football?

636
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:52,710
Hey, Weathers.

637
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:55,150
You got a visitor.

638
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:57,287
- Danyelle!
- Willie.

639
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:04,497
Damn, girl.

640
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,496
How'd you get here?

641
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,627
Bus.

642
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:11,900
Bus? It's musta taken you
like two days, huh?

643
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,270
Seemed like it.

644
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,366
Seemed... Seemed like it.

645
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:18,974
Well, I'm really glad you here.

646
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:22,448
Why don't you move your fat ass to another
table with your McDonald's and shit?

647
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:24,508
I know you not gonna disrespect me
in front of my family!

648
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:25,575
Jermaine, let it go!

649
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,147
Get off me!

650
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,156
Settle down!

651
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:30,282
You want your family to go home?

652
00:39:30,282 --> 00:39:31,985
Man, settle down!

653
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:35,694
What's up, mija?
You wanna swing low on this or what?

654
00:39:35,694 --> 00:39:37,732
Hey, yo, shut your ass up, Peavy!

655
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:39,198
Willie, Willie, Willie, don't do that!

656
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:41,229
- Nah, you ain't nothin' but a bluff, nigga!
- No! Come on!

657
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:44,329
Man, you a bluff.
See you when you get out the box.

658
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,204
Don't even worry about him.
I'll take care of him later on, all right?

659
00:39:47,204 --> 00:39:49,675
Come on, let's go sit down.

660
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,143
I wanna go.

661
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:53,203
You wanna go?

662
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,151
How you gonna take care of him, Willie?

663
00:39:58,151 --> 00:39:59,983
You gonna kill him?

664
00:40:01,323 --> 00:40:02,620
Danyelle.

665
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:04,817
Come on, girl.

666
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,684
Mom, you can't just get up and leave.

667
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:09,753
Just don't look at me like that, all right?
Whaddya want me to do about it?

668
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:14,029
I'm not the one who put you here, all right?
You put yourself here.

669
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:16,534
Damn it.

670
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:53,165
What's goin' on, buddy?

671
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:54,674
It's my mom.

672
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:59,342
Things are just so messed up.

673
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:02,940
Gets so I just hate her.

674
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:08,012
No, you don't.

675
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:12,487
Just want my mom to love me, you know?

676
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,396
I know.

677
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:24,566
I know.

678
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,610
You know what I was thinkin'?

679
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:38,318
'Bout we try you out at receiver?

680
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:43,552
You mean, like, I'd be catchin' the ball?

681
00:41:43,552 --> 00:41:45,855
Sometimes. Mostly blockin'.

682
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:47,588
That'd be cool.

683
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,959
Why don't you get your playbook.

684
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,521
I'll meet ya up here.
We'll go over some plays.

685
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:54,033
- All right. Right now?
- Right now.

686
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:16,847
You guys got any letters to go out before
the weekend, I gotta screen 'em tonight.

687
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,850
Dear Danyelle.

688
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:23,490
Look, I'm sorry you felt bad here.

689
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,932
I don't like it either but I'm tryin' to change.

690
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:29,893
My mama moved to Oakland.

691
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:33,805
She don't want my little brother
havin' nothin' to do with me.

692
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,947
Danyelle, you're the only one
who cares anything about me.

693
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:43,039
The only really good person I know.

694
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,683
Please write me back.

695
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:53,859
Let's go. It's that 28 toss, Leon.
Get 'em goin'. It's a big play for us.

696
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:56,021
Come on, Weathers, show me your wheels.

697
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:59,362
Let's see what you got, defense.
Kelvin, lemme see.

698
00:43:07,108 --> 00:43:09,702
Kelvin, good job, good job.
Way to get in there.

699
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:12,212
Come on, Weathers, you're better than that!

700
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:14,510
Don't worry 'bout it, man. Hey, you'll get it.

701
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,812
All right, let's go! Run that same play.
Let's go!

702
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:18,182
I'm so tired, man.

703
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:21,381
Rather fight five angry niggas
than mess with this football shit.

704
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:25,654
Quit bitchin', quit moanin'!
We've got five days till we play Barrington.

705
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:27,922
If you don't get this stuff down,
if you don't get it right,

706
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:29,327
they're gonna kick your asses.

707
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:30,864
Can't nobody kick our ass, Coach.

708
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:32,661
Yeah, no, clearly, Junior. Yeah.

709
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:35,362
After what I just saw from Weathers,
you guys are gonna run over everybody.

710
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,495
Run the play!

711
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:37,868
Ten hut!

712
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:43,137
They all pussies, Coach.

713
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:46,442
You better let me play
or else we ain't gonna win.

714
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:48,238
Shut up, Bug.

715
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:53,286
All right, we're runnin' this play to Junior.
L-five toss, Junior.

716
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:54,480
Run it, Leon.

717
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,753
Gray 10. Gray 10. Hut!

718
00:43:58,827 --> 00:44:03,025
Come on, Junior. Let's see
what you got, Junior. Go! Go, Junior! Go!

719
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,395
Hey, come on, man.

720
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,701
Hey, Coach! He down, man, come on!

721
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:13,999
Back up. Junior.

722
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:17,239
Junior, talk to me. You okay?

723
00:44:18,012 --> 00:44:19,809
Talk to me, Junior.

724
00:44:21,382 --> 00:44:24,579
I don't know what's wrong
if you don't talk to me.

725
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:29,284
We're gonna get you to a hospital,
get you all taken care of,

726
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:31,882
everything'll be okay, you hear me?

727
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:44,367
He gonna be a'ight.

728
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,332
See you tonight.

729
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:00,819
Listen up.

730
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,855
We just got back from the hospital.

731
00:45:03,855 --> 00:45:08,362
The good news is Junior's gonna
walk outta there, he's gonna be okay.

732
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:11,992
The bad news,

733
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,830
he has a concussion and a slipped disk.

734
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:19,206
Without Junior we gonna suck, man.

735
00:45:20,642 --> 00:45:23,634
Well, that's up to you, Leon. And you, Bates.

736
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,776
And you, Willie. Madlock, Perez, Kelvin.

737
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:34,284
It's up to all of you. Then we'll find out
what this team is made of.

738
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:39,016
You gotta imagine there's a goal post
right there to the right and to the left.

739
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:42,895
Good job!

740
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:45,456
Everybody in. Take your helmets off.

741
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:48,900
Circle it up. Circle up the wagons.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

742
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,404
Great practice, great practice.

743
00:45:51,404 --> 00:45:52,905
Take a knee.

744
00:45:55,243 --> 00:45:59,145
Next time you put those helmets on,
it'll be for real.

745
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:01,681
Learn your assignments, get ready.

746
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:08,351
- Madlock.
- That's my homey, man.

747
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:12,325
These are your homeys. You're not gonna
do 'em any good in the box! Sit down!

748
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:13,792
Chill, man.

749
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:22,359
Yo, whatch'all niggas lookin' at?

750
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,497
Y'all a buncha busters and shit!
Doin' everything they tell you.

751
00:46:25,497 --> 00:46:29,907
Run, jump, roll over. Like little pets.
Little pussy pets.

752
00:46:30,345 --> 00:46:33,473
Man, shut the hell up, Peavy!
Yeah, you the pussy.

753
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:35,778
Man, you ain't got half-a what it takes
to play football.

754
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:37,181
Keep walkin', Peavy.

755
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:39,049
What's up, Mustangs?

756
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,384
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, yo.
I got injuries.

757
00:46:48,029 --> 00:46:50,156
Hey, Junior, what's up, man?

758
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,666
That's enough, though.

759
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:00,398
When I was in the hospital,

760
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,770
I thought a lot about you guys, man.

761
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:06,746
The team.

762
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:10,781
How you guys are like my family.

763
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:13,946
And I wanted to show my family
what I could do.

764
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:20,149
I just wish I could play witchu guys
on Saturday, man.

765
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,059
But I'll be there.

766
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:25,897
I know you guys are gonna kick ass, right?

767
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,204
Bring it in, y'all, come on.

768
00:47:33,204 --> 00:47:35,242
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

769
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:37,369
I want it loud and clear.

770
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:39,845
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

771
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:41,211
Mustangs!

772
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:47,714
Come on, guys! Let's do this!

773
00:47:48,356 --> 00:47:51,325
That's what I'm talkin' about! Let's do it.

774
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:00,359
We got a ass-kickin' for Barrington
waitin' for 'em.

775
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,098
We're gonna see
what you're made of, Weathers. On the bus.

776
00:48:13,648 --> 00:48:15,343
Y'all ready, baby?

777
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:22,616
Evans.

778
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,423
Still wanna be a Mustang?

779
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:36,834
Of course I do. But I can't fulfill
the physical requirements, Coach.

780
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:40,169
Evans, you don't have to be an athlete
to be a Mustang.

781
00:48:40,169 --> 00:48:41,640
Look at me.

782
00:48:42,477 --> 00:48:45,969
You just gotta have heart.
I know you have heart.

783
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:51,441
We could use an equipment manager.
You interested?

784
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:53,612
Hell, yeah, I'm interested!

785
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:55,053
Come on.

786
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:56,590
Can I get
one of these Mustang shirts, though?

787
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,252
Oh, it's a lot of fabric, but yes.
Gimme some time to find your size.

788
00:49:00,252 --> 00:49:03,762
Hey, Mustangs.
Meet the new equipment manager, Evans.

789
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:10,864
I'm tellin' you, Barrington about to get their
ass whooped when we step on the field.

790
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,974
'Ey. Don't forget,
you work for me now, Jermaine.

791
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:16,839
Shit, man, long as I don't gotta run,
I'll call you "boss," homey.

792
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:18,139
You know what I'm sayin'?

793
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:20,840
Hey! Look at the girl in the Mustang.

794
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,314
Where?

795
00:49:22,683 --> 00:49:23,877
Damn!

796
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:28,482
Hey, I'd like to run a quarterback sneak
right into your end zone!

797
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:38,657
Hey, she wavin' at me! She wavin' at me!
She want me bad!

798
00:49:50,745 --> 00:49:54,010
Jesus Christ, man.
You got this all messed up.

799
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:57,578
How many times we do this in practice?

800
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:03,823
All right, bring it in. Let's go.

801
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:16,434
This is it. The day you been waitin' for.

802
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:21,798
I know you're nervous. So am I.

803
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:24,067
My first game too.

804
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:27,512
Now it's time to go out there
and put it on the scoreboard.

805
00:50:27,512 --> 00:50:30,710
Now it's time to see who has the heart.

806
00:50:31,786 --> 00:50:36,985
Now is the time to prove to yourselves
and prove to everyone out there

807
00:50:36,985 --> 00:50:39,492
that even though you're locked up,

808
00:50:41,362 --> 00:50:43,057
you are somebody.

809
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:46,331
And you are worthy of something!

810
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:52,332
And you're able to do something special
that no one else in the world can do,

811
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:54,897
which you can walk through those doors,
hold your heads up high

812
00:50:54,897 --> 00:50:57,376
and call yourselves Mustangs!

813
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:03,648
Are you ready to go out there
and take what's yours?

814
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:04,980
Yeah!

815
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,485
What you've worked hard for?

816
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:08,146
Yeah!

817
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:12,415
Are you ready to accept
the Mustang challenge?

818
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:17,993
Lead us!

819
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:19,694
Lead us!

820
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:56,162
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the undefeated Barrington Panthers.

821
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:23,797
Let's go, Mustangs.

822
00:52:30,204 --> 00:52:31,899
Let's go, let's go.

823
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,441
Now, gather in. Hands in.
Hands in. Hands in.

824
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:37,068
I wanna see everybody's eyes.
Everybody's eyes.

825
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:40,079
You get out there on that field
and you earn their respect.

826
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,876
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

827
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,473
Mustangs!

828
00:52:44,385 --> 00:52:46,478
Kickoff team. Kickoff team.

829
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:52,258
Let's go, Mustangs.

830
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:00,758
Let's go! Let's go!

831
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:10,439
Nail that son of a bitch. Let's go, Kelvin.

832
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:28,120
Kelvin! Great hit! Great hit!

833
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:41,840
Madlock! Madlock!
Set the tone! You set the tone!

834
00:53:45,212 --> 00:53:47,009
Set hut!

835
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:56,881
Fumble! Fumble!

836
00:54:12,873 --> 00:54:14,306
First down!

837
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:17,139
Fumble recovery, number 31, Kelvin Owens.

838
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:19,839
That's what I'm talkin' about, Madlock.
Great job, Kelvin.

839
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,281
We bad, we bad, we bad.

840
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:25,648
Offense, get out there.

841
00:54:25,648 --> 00:54:27,811
Ace, right cross! Let's go.

842
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:29,378
Leon, come here.

843
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,392
C'mon, listen. Pro right 25, toss.

844
00:54:34,392 --> 00:54:36,726
C'mon. C'mon, damn it! Let's go!

845
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:38,128
Oh, shit!

846
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:40,826
- Hustle up!
- Go!

847
00:54:41,335 --> 00:54:43,326
Pro right 25 and stuff.

848
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:55,709
Willie, run their asses over.
Run their asses over. It's all you.

849
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:58,617
Show 'em what you're made of.

850
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:13,426
Green 18!

851
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:15,093
Green 18!

852
00:55:16,337 --> 00:55:17,736
Hut!

853
00:55:31,018 --> 00:55:33,543
Yeah! Go Panthers!

854
00:55:33,854 --> 00:55:36,880
Good run. Good run. Right, let's get up.
Walk it off.

855
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,958
Tackled by number 55, John Stevens.

856
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,997
Welcome to my world, boy!

857
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:57,004
- Coach said to throw a 97 pass.
- Pass?

858
00:55:57,004 --> 00:55:59,442
Yeah, man, 97 pass.

859
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,137
Yeah, man, what the hell is wrong with you?

860
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:03,342
You ain't never thrown a pass
in a real game, have you?

861
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:05,942
Naw, I played games. I played Madden.

862
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:08,420
What? This ain't EA, homey.

863
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,219
- A video game?
- I controlled the quarterback. What?

864
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:12,452
That ain't football.

865
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,994
- Man, come on. 97 what?
- 97 pass.

866
00:56:14,994 --> 00:56:18,862
97 pass right now is what we about to do
and I'mma throw it.

867
00:56:18,862 --> 00:56:21,959
- 97 pass. On one. Ready?
- Break.

868
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:23,435
Green 18!

869
00:56:23,435 --> 00:56:25,131
Green 18!

870
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,901
Hut!

871
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:31,407
Throw the ball! Throw the ball!

872
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:41,453
Son of a bitch!

873
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,087
First down, Barrington Panthers.

874
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,890
Leon! That's okay! Get it behind you!

875
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:53,122
What happened, dawg?

876
00:56:55,603 --> 00:56:56,627
Let's go!

877
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:59,002
Coach, I suck, man. Just take me out.

878
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,700
Hey. No. Not gonna take you anywhere,
do ya understand?

879
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,370
I ain't takin' you out
and you ain't quitin' on me. Ya hear me?

880
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,538
You can do it. Now, come on.
Get your head in the game.

881
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:07,774
Come on. Come on.

882
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:11,181
Defense! Just get the ball back!
Get the ball back!

883
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:14,316
Set! White 20!

884
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:15,582
Hut!

885
00:57:16,423 --> 00:57:18,584
Trouble, he's open! He's open!

886
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:22,618
Whose man is that? Number three!
Number three! Kelvin!

887
00:57:37,978 --> 00:57:40,003
Touchdown, Panthers.

888
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,347
Hey! I wanna see some hittin' out there!

889
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,857
Set!

890
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:53,187
Black 20!

891
00:57:53,187 --> 00:57:54,659
Black 20!

892
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:56,161
Hut!

893
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:09,608
Perez, you can't catch?

894
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:11,372
What's up?
You can't hit me in my chest, dawg?

895
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:13,242
- You coulda dove for that.
- That was too low, man.

896
00:58:13,242 --> 00:58:16,374
- You coulda caught the ball.
- Just gonna push me like that?

897
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:20,614
Hey! Stop fightin' amongst yourselves.
Take it out on the enemy, for chrissake.

898
00:58:20,614 --> 00:58:21,889
Catch the ball.

899
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,891
Down, set! Hut!

900
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:36,031
He's open! He's open!

901
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:50,144
Come on, Mustangs!

902
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:51,514
Touchdown, Barrington.

903
00:58:51,514 --> 00:58:55,043
That was a 50-yard completion
by number 18, Michael Hays.

904
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:57,547
Damn, man.

905
00:58:57,547 --> 00:59:00,320
Bates, you supposed to cut
when you see that dude cut, man.

906
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,090
We gettin' worked, man.

907
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:13,739
And that's halftime

908
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:18,005
with the Barrington Panthers leading 21
and the Mustangs 0.

909
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,912
Told you guys they wanted
to kick your asses.

910
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,455
That's exactly what they're doin'.

911
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:31,821
I've seen only two or three hits out there!

912
00:59:32,493 --> 00:59:35,394
Linebackers, defensive backs,
they're runnin' right over you!

913
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:37,930
You're titty dancin' with 'em!

914
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:41,263
Defensive line! You're standin' up,
that's why they're takin' your legs out!

915
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:43,769
Madlock, come here!
You're standin' straight up!

916
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:47,329
If ya jam on him, you get your hands
on him, use upper body violence,

917
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:50,639
throw their ass to the dirt
and make the tackle!

918
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:55,742
And if you get your hands on the ball,
hang on to it.

919
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,180
Don't give it back!

920
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:04,118
Come on, baby! Let's go!

921
01:00:04,118 --> 01:00:06,455
Let's go, Leon,
let's get 'em back in the game.

922
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:08,586
Get 'em back in the game, Leon!

923
01:00:10,297 --> 01:00:11,423
Set!

924
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:13,432
Let's do it! Eyes on the prize!

925
01:00:14,468 --> 01:00:16,129
Black 20!

926
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,365
Black 20!

927
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,332
Hut!

928
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:26,036
Bates is open!

929
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:27,637
Throw the ball!

930
01:00:36,657 --> 01:00:38,682
God! I can't believe that.
Right through his hand.

931
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:40,989
You gotta catch the ball, Kenny!
Catch the ball.

932
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:43,120
Interception, Barrington.

933
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,495
Barrington's ball on the Mustangs'
32-yard line.

934
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:49,468
Unbelievable how we're playin'.
Absolutely ridiculous.

935
01:00:49,468 --> 01:00:51,401
Let's go. Lemme see.

936
01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:00,305
Tackle him! Tackle him! Tackle him!
Tackle him!

937
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,573
Damn it!

938
01:01:05,018 --> 01:01:07,714
Another touchdown, Barrington Panthers.

939
01:01:08,322 --> 01:01:10,654
Listen, we may not win this game,
but on the next kickoff,

940
01:01:10,654 --> 01:01:12,521
let's salvage some pride. All right?

941
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:15,221
Ya get out there,
you run their asses over and don't quit.

942
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,456
Go! Go! Go!

943
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,775
Come on!

944
01:01:38,886 --> 01:01:41,821
Afraid to get hit, boy? Don't like it, do ya?

945
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,020
Willie. Willie. What are you doin'?
You're waitin' for them to hit you.

946
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,725
Put your shoulder down
and run their asses over!

947
01:01:52,725 --> 01:01:55,290
Grow some balls! Get out there and hit 'em!

948
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,304
Willie, shoulder down!
Run their asses over!

949
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:05,004
Comin' for you, boy.

950
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:06,705
Black 20!

951
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:07,705
Hut!

952
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:20,656
You better stay down, boy.
You better stay down.

953
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:22,490
- Hey, get off me, bitch!
- Oh, you the bitch.

954
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,361
Willie, get off the field!
Choi, get in there for Weathers.

955
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:26,524
Dead ball.

956
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:29,501
Unsportsmanlike conduct on white.
Fifteen yards.

957
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:31,504
C'mere. What was that?

958
01:02:31,504 --> 01:02:32,664
This ain't no street fight out there.

959
01:02:32,664 --> 01:02:36,266
- You gotta have discipline and self-control.
- Tell me about it, Coach.

960
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:20,713
That's the final score.

961
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:25,315
Barrington Panthers 38,
Kilpatrick Mustangs 0.

962
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:30,425
Get off the field. Off the field.

963
01:03:30,425 --> 01:03:34,058
Madlock, what're you doin'?
A six-year-old girl could...

964
01:04:02,929 --> 01:04:06,524
All right, come on. Bring it in.
Off the bench, come on. C'mere.

965
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:09,296
Everybody. Off the benches.
Come take a knee.

966
01:04:10,904 --> 01:04:13,998
Let's gather 'round. Let's go. Take a knee.

967
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:18,673
C'mon.

968
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,213
First one is always the toughest.

969
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:34,688
We made a lotta mistakes out there today.
All of us.

970
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:41,523
Me too.

971
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:42,932
No shit.

972
01:04:47,374 --> 01:04:49,239
They were ready.

973
01:04:49,976 --> 01:04:52,570
They've been playin' together
for three years.

974
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,444
We've been together for three weeks.
Lemme tell you somethin' else,

975
01:04:55,444 --> 01:04:59,281
I still don't believe
that they're 38 points better than you.

976
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,883
I still don't believe
that they're the better team.

977
01:05:02,883 --> 01:05:05,948
I would not trade you for them.

978
01:05:07,094 --> 01:05:09,028
I want you to hold your heads up high.

979
01:05:09,028 --> 01:05:12,088
We got nine games left.
We're just gonna have to work harder.

980
01:05:12,088 --> 01:05:14,326
Shit, not me.

981
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:16,228
I don't need this shit.

982
01:05:26,913 --> 01:05:30,371
I didn't just let 'em down.
I brought 'em down.

983
01:05:31,618 --> 01:05:35,952
- I completely lost it.
- It's a long season, Seany.

984
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:40,426
I don't even know if I'll have enough
kids to field a team next week.

985
01:05:40,426 --> 01:05:42,333
Oh, they'll come back.

986
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:51,338
Do you remember how low
you used to get after a big loss?

987
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:54,109
You always took everything so personally.

988
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,846
Well, that's 'cause there was someone
on the other end of the dinner table

989
01:05:57,846 --> 01:05:59,750
tellin' me how much I sucked.

990
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,756
Mom, that was the worst part about it.

991
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:06,217
Yesterday, when I was chewin'
those kids out, I sounded just like him.

992
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:16,393
Oh, shit, it's the football team.

993
01:06:22,076 --> 01:06:23,065
Pussies!

994
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,174
All right, shut it down, gentlemen.
Shut it down!

995
01:06:30,385 --> 01:06:32,148
- Come on, you heard me.
- Mustangs suck!

996
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,917
Thank you.

997
01:06:34,155 --> 01:06:38,319
I don't know about everybody else,
but me, I ain't playin' no more.

998
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:42,612
Man, Coach Porter say we work hard,
we gonna be winners.

999
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,581
We worked hard, but we got destroyed.

1000
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:46,777
He didn't even tell me
when I was supposed to be on the field.

1001
01:06:46,777 --> 01:06:49,184
Then he starts screamin' at me.

1002
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:51,623
Man, what the hell y'all doin'?

1003
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:00,594
Sean. Can I see you a minute?

1004
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:03,400
- Can it wait till after practice?
- No.

1005
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:11,541
It's better not about stoppin' the program.

1006
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:13,004
Kids don't want to play anymore.

1007
01:07:13,004 --> 01:07:14,241
Let them tell me that.

1008
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:17,043
Sean, I was hoping that it'd work...

1009
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:26,690
We wanted to create self-esteem,
but that was just the opposite.

1010
01:07:27,106 --> 01:07:31,685
These kids... They can't handle that kind of
dissapointment.

1011
01:07:32,346 --> 01:07:33,737
I am really sorry.

1012
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:56,286
So Donald Lopez.
We need verification from Van Nuys court.

1013
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:59,551
The document number is 2...

1014
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:01,126
M-U-S-T

1015
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,038
- A...
- I'll call you back.

1016
01:08:09,038 --> 01:08:10,238
...N- G-S.

1017
01:08:13,087 --> 01:08:13,887
M-U-S-T-A-N-G-S!

1018
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,861
Mustangs! Mustangs! Mustangs!

1019
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:24,961
All right, clap it up.

1020
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:30,393
Hey, Coach.

1021
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:35,139
Sean, what's goin' on here?

1022
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:39,340
I don't know. Whose idea was this?

1023
01:08:39,772 --> 01:08:44,741
Like I told you, Coach,
we're tired of bein' losers.

1024
01:08:52,285 --> 01:08:52,956
You still with us?

1025
01:08:53,558 --> 01:08:54,513
I'm with the team.

1026
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,011
Yo, Mr. Higa. Catch.

1027
01:09:04,013 --> 01:09:06,077
Yo, Mr. Higa. Hit me.

1028
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,308
- Run a post pattern.
- Paul.

1029
01:09:11,308 --> 01:09:13,358
4 1-yard gain by number 31, Kelvin Owens.

1030
01:09:28,151 --> 01:09:29,482
All right, Kelvin!

1031
01:09:29,482 --> 01:09:33,852
Bulldogs 21, Mustangs 14.
1... 12 remaining in the fourth quarter.

1032
01:09:33,852 --> 01:09:37,290
It's 21-1 4. We can maybe win
our first game right here.

1033
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,861
Coach said 23 counter.

1034
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:40,829
It's all yours, Willie. It's all yours.

1035
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:43,227
23 counter. On one. On one.

1036
01:09:43,227 --> 01:09:45,096
- Ready?
- Break!

1037
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:49,868
Set!

1038
01:09:49,868 --> 01:09:51,702
Gray 10!

1039
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:53,469
Gray 10!

1040
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:54,874
Hut!

1041
01:10:08,157 --> 01:10:10,182
Go, Willie! Go, Willie!

1042
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,758
Ball!

1043
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,769
You don't like takin' a hit, now, do ya?

1044
01:10:27,043 --> 01:10:28,067
Scared to get hit.

1045
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:30,704
It's all right. Let's go.
Defense! Let's go, gentlemen!

1046
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:34,409
Offense, let's go.
Jog it off the field. You'll get it back.

1047
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:37,584
It's all right, Leon. It's all right. Small gain.

1048
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:43,049
Let's go. Short-term memory.
You gotta let it go.

1049
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:54,199
Keep it strong.

1050
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:56,765
White 10!

1051
01:10:56,765 --> 01:10:58,363
White 10!

1052
01:10:58,363 --> 01:11:00,466
Set! Hut!

1053
01:11:02,044 --> 01:11:03,511
That's the end of the game.

1054
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:07,276
And the final score,
Bulldogs 21, Mustangs 14.

1055
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:11,810
You're a tough kid, Willie,
but you give up on yourself way too easy.

1056
01:11:13,089 --> 01:11:17,082
You're a good football player, too.
I think you may even be great.

1057
01:11:19,796 --> 01:11:22,390
And I'm gonna push you until we find out.

1058
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:32,998
We gonna start with the circles to the front.

1059
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,873
'Ey, yo. 'Ey, yo. What the...

1060
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:42,039
- Man, what's he think he's doin'?
- That fool crazy.

1061
01:11:42,718 --> 01:11:44,549
I've come for Willie Weathers.

1062
01:11:44,987 --> 01:11:46,386
What you want with me?

1063
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,821
I'm here to find out just how good you are.

1064
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,024
- This a joke?
- Let's go.

1065
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:57,760
Leon, throw Willie the ball.

1066
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:00,992
You see this line, Willie?

1067
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:04,799
You knock me past this line,
you'll have my respect.

1068
01:12:06,509 --> 01:12:08,477
What if I don't wanna?

1069
01:12:08,477 --> 01:12:10,569
Then everybody will think
you're a chicken shit.

1070
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:14,207
"Chicken shit"? That's wrong.

1071
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:18,610
Let's see what you got, Weathers.

1072
01:12:20,056 --> 01:12:23,924
Come on, Weathers, I wanna make it clear.
Run through me. Run over me.

1073
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,225
That's not gonna work, Weathers.
Not like that.

1074
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:33,359
Get back there and do it again.

1075
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:35,131
It's all right, Weathers. Pick it up.

1076
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:38,774
Come on, let's go! Let's go, Weathers!

1077
01:12:42,011 --> 01:12:44,036
Keep your head up and run through me.

1078
01:12:47,116 --> 01:12:50,847
Get up and do it again!
Are you kiddin' me? Get back! Do it again!

1079
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:54,378
Now, dip your shoulder,
keep your head up and run through me!

1080
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,369
Do it again! We're gonna stay out here
all day if it kills us, Weathers!

1081
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:09,165
You are gonna put me on my ass!

1082
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:11,468
Now, keep your head up. Accelerate.

1083
01:13:11,468 --> 01:13:14,509
Put your shoulder down
and run through me!

1084
01:13:19,949 --> 01:13:24,283
What are you lookin' at? Don't look at them.
They ain't gonna help ya out here, Willie.

1085
01:13:24,283 --> 01:13:26,412
Ya got no homeboys, ya got no help!

1086
01:13:26,412 --> 01:13:29,549
Ya damn sure ain't got no gun!
And ya can't run away!

1087
01:13:29,549 --> 01:13:32,958
Ya got nobody but yourself,
but, goddamn it, that's all you need.

1088
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,896
Believe in yourself
and knock me on my ass!

1089
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:08,554
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1090
01:14:09,732 --> 01:14:11,461
You know you're a idiot, right?

1091
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:15,129
Well, I'm makin' progress.
'Cause I used to be an asshole.

1092
01:14:15,972 --> 01:14:17,599
Come on.

1093
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:26,310
All right, listen up.

1094
01:14:26,615 --> 01:14:30,278
We've got to run this punt
all the way back. You can do this.

1095
01:14:31,253 --> 01:14:34,347
Now get out there, do it together,
work as one and go make it happen!

1096
01:14:34,347 --> 01:14:35,788
Let's go!

1097
01:14:35,788 --> 01:14:38,486
Kick return! Let's win it!

1098
01:14:40,496 --> 01:14:44,159
Lions lead by one
with 15 seconds to go in the game.

1099
01:15:20,403 --> 01:15:22,371
Willie, let's go!

1100
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,640
Come on, Willie.

1101
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,574
Come on, Willie! Go!

1102
01:16:16,358 --> 01:16:19,816
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby!

1103
01:17:16,952 --> 01:17:18,681
Oh! Y'all messed my arm up!

1104
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,984
Hey! Hey! Come here.

1105
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:23,055
Oh, it's my shoulder, Coach.

1106
01:17:23,459 --> 01:17:24,824
Hold up!

1107
01:17:25,561 --> 01:17:27,290
C'mere, lemme see.

1108
01:17:39,608 --> 01:17:43,100
That's it! That's it! That's it!

1109
01:17:53,889 --> 01:17:55,914
'Bout time for practice, isn't it?

1110
01:17:55,914 --> 01:17:58,721
I gotta miss today. Goin' to the hospital.

1111
01:17:59,028 --> 01:18:00,586
How's she doin'?

1112
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,458
Not that good. They don't give her long.

1113
01:18:05,668 --> 01:18:09,001
Sean, if you wanna take some time off,
you know...

1114
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:11,730
She won't let me.

1115
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:18,673
Hey, shouldn't the team be out there?

1116
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:21,071
Yeah.

1117
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,952
He's on his way.

1118
01:18:41,537 --> 01:18:43,835
How come you guys aren't out there?

1119
01:18:48,911 --> 01:18:50,776
It's for your mom, Coach.

1120
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,812
We all signed the card.

1121
01:19:00,656 --> 01:19:02,954
Yeah, tell her she needs to get better
so she can come see us, Coach.

1122
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:04,822
That's right, man.

1123
01:19:05,527 --> 01:19:07,154
For real.

1124
01:19:09,765 --> 01:19:11,096
Thanks.

1125
01:19:12,668 --> 01:19:14,693
You guys get out there and practice.

1126
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:17,399
Hey, Coach.

1127
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:20,602
My next touchdown's
gonna be for your mom.

1128
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:27,780
All right, y'all, bring it in. Come on.
One, two, three.

1129
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,545
Porter!

1130
01:19:41,263 --> 01:19:43,026
I see

1131
01:19:45,467 --> 01:19:47,059
Kenny.

1132
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:52,438
- And where's Willie?
- Right here.

1133
01:19:53,475 --> 01:19:58,242
- They're some good boys.
- Yeah. They are.

1134
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:04,510
Ya know, what's crazy, Mom,
is next year I'll have a whole new group.

1135
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,415
That's a long way away.

1136
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:14,423
I'm so proud of you.

1137
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:20,031
- Your father would be proud of you too.
- Mom.

1138
01:20:20,636 --> 01:20:23,469
He tried, Sean.

1139
01:20:25,174 --> 01:20:26,505
He tried.

1140
01:20:27,109 --> 01:20:29,475
You're so darn stubborn.

1141
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,879
I know.

1142
01:20:32,879 --> 01:20:36,111
Guess if it wasn't for bein' stubborn,

1143
01:20:37,486 --> 01:20:40,353
there wouldn't be no football team.

1144
01:20:42,624 --> 01:20:45,684
You know my greatest accomplishment?

1145
01:20:46,829 --> 01:20:51,823
I raised a good man.

1146
01:20:57,539 --> 01:21:00,337
A couple hours later, she was gone.

1147
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:05,141
That game today was just like a dream.

1148
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:11,549
I stood on those sidelines thinkin' about her

1149
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:15,454
and all the games she watched me play.

1150
01:21:16,592 --> 01:21:21,586
All the times she bandaged my cuts,
got me ice packs.

1151
01:21:22,464 --> 01:21:24,295
She washed my stuff.

1152
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:32,370
She cheered me on.

1153
01:21:33,776 --> 01:21:35,744
She cheered me up.

1154
01:21:42,785 --> 01:21:47,950
I just felt so bad for all those kids
who never knew that type of mother.

1155
01:21:53,395 --> 01:21:55,295
What about your dad?

1156
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,996
I don't talk about him.

1157
01:22:03,839 --> 01:22:06,069
I'm glad to hear that things
are getting better, Mom.

1158
01:22:06,069 --> 01:22:09,872
Maybe when I get out
we can live together again.

1159
01:22:09,872 --> 01:22:13,711
Football is great. And I'm good at it now.

1160
01:22:16,552 --> 01:22:18,747
I love sackin' the quarterback.

1161
01:22:20,622 --> 01:22:23,887
Sometimes I can't even believe it's legal.

1162
01:22:27,996 --> 01:22:30,965
Throwin TD's don't pay as much
as slingin' rocks,

1163
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,965
but damn, it feel good.

1164
01:22:36,305 --> 01:22:40,571
Grandma, you'd be proud of me.
I'm stayin' outta trouble.

1165
01:22:42,945 --> 01:22:45,209
I don't have enemies here anymore.

1166
01:22:48,717 --> 01:22:50,685
We done won seven in a row now.

1167
01:22:50,685 --> 01:22:53,846
I can't remember the exact number
of touchdowns I scored.

1168
01:22:58,827 --> 01:23:00,624
I think about 60.

1169
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:06,160
Dear Danyelle,
I wish you would write back to me.

1170
01:23:07,169 --> 01:23:09,364
I'm different than I was.

1171
01:23:10,973 --> 01:23:14,568
I think you would like me again
if you saw me play football.

1172
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:35,727
How ya doin'?

1173
01:23:36,098 --> 01:23:38,999
Doin' great, sir. How can I help you?

1174
01:23:39,234 --> 01:23:42,328
- I've got a letter for a Danyelle Rollins.
- Well, who from?

1175
01:23:43,138 --> 01:23:44,730
Willie Weathers.

1176
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,604
- And who are you?
- His football coach.

1177
01:23:47,604 --> 01:23:50,668
- Isn't that kid in jail?
- Yeah, he is.

1178
01:23:50,668 --> 01:23:54,011
We've got a team now.
And Willie's a hell of a player.

1179
01:23:54,783 --> 01:23:57,047
He's also a hell of a young man.

1180
01:23:57,286 --> 01:24:00,744
I just don't understand how you could
read his letters and not write him back.

1181
01:24:01,723 --> 01:24:03,520
I never got any letters.

1182
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,458
Look, mister, my baby's going to college.
She's gettin' outta this place.

1183
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,155
Daddy, you kept his letters from me?

1184
01:24:08,155 --> 01:24:10,391
And if she's going to fulfill her potential,

1185
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:13,229
there's no room in her life
for some gang member.

1186
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:15,862
- Ya understand that?
- Absolutely.

1187
01:24:16,305 --> 01:24:18,330
That's not who Willie is anymore.

1188
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,473
With a little bit of support,
maybe he'll stay that way.

1189
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,238
I'm glad to hear it.

1190
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:26,372
But I'm not willing to bet
my daughter's future on it.

1191
01:24:26,372 --> 01:24:29,245
I understand. Thank you.

1192
01:24:39,795 --> 01:24:42,320
Thank you. Enjoy your visit.

1193
01:24:50,138 --> 01:24:54,131
- Who ya here for?
- Willie Weathers. I'm his brother.

1194
01:24:59,214 --> 01:25:02,581
- You're awful big for a six-year-old.
- Say what?

1195
01:25:02,581 --> 01:25:06,610
Says here Willie has one brother,
six years old.

1196
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:10,419
- That's wrong, 'cause I'm here, ain't I?
- Yeah. Yes, you are.

1197
01:25:10,892 --> 01:25:13,258
But you ain't gettin' in.

1198
01:25:14,463 --> 01:25:16,260
Come on, man, I'm all he's got.

1199
01:25:16,465 --> 01:25:19,832
Sorry. Now, you have a nice day.

1200
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,320
Bitch.

1201
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,522
I'll catch you on the rebound, homey!

1202
01:25:52,668 --> 01:25:55,899
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
a new addition to the Mustang team...

1203
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:58,768
Mustang Cheerleaders
from Camp Scott, California.

1204
01:25:58,768 --> 01:26:01,241
Camp Scott, that's that girls' prison.

1205
01:26:06,415 --> 01:26:09,213
That's my girl Cherise! She's so hot, man.

1206
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:10,979
Who? The one on the end there?

1207
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:12,782
Go Mustangs!

1208
01:26:12,782 --> 01:26:16,017
Nah. Come on, now, the one in the middle.

1209
01:26:16,324 --> 01:26:18,155
Hot like the summer.

1210
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,398
The one in the middle!

1211
01:26:23,899 --> 01:26:26,265
Hey, hey! All right, eyes front!

1212
01:26:32,207 --> 01:26:35,608
Hey, turn around! Turn around!

1213
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:40,271
And at the end of the two-minute warning,
the Mustangs lead 17-14.

1214
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:44,544
Drac! Yo, Drac!

1215
01:26:44,986 --> 01:26:46,749
Do your thing, boy! Drac!

1216
01:26:46,749 --> 01:26:48,813
- Show these niggas what you can do!
- What up, baby!

1217
01:26:48,813 --> 01:26:52,656
Willie! Get goin'. Let's go! Focus!

1218
01:26:54,596 --> 01:26:56,996
Green 18. Hut!

1219
01:27:07,442 --> 01:27:09,239
Yeah, baby!

1220
01:27:16,151 --> 01:27:19,484
Touchdown, number 13,
Willie Weathers for the Mustangs.

1221
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,748
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1222
01:27:20,748 --> 01:27:22,881
- 88, baby!
- I'm gonna represent, baby!

1223
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:24,255
Hut!

1224
01:27:24,993 --> 01:27:28,224
And that's the game,
Mustangs 21, Eagles 7.

1225
01:27:28,224 --> 01:27:32,027
Mustangs! We're goin' to the playoffs!

1226
01:27:36,938 --> 01:27:38,030
Good game.

1227
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,698
Good game, good game.
Y'all did y'all thing.

1228
01:27:39,698 --> 01:27:41,538
Good job, good job. Wassup?

1229
01:27:41,538 --> 01:27:44,636
- Congratulate on the 88.
- 8-8!

1230
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,345
88 for life, homey.

1231
01:27:53,588 --> 01:27:55,180
What up, 95?

1232
01:27:55,724 --> 01:27:57,055
- Get up off of me, bitch!
- What up?

1233
01:27:57,055 --> 01:27:58,251
You be payin' for that, nigga!

1234
01:27:58,251 --> 01:28:01,261
- You a bluff! You ain't got nothin', fool!
- Don't let me catch you in the street.

1235
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:03,889
I be like this! I know that! Take that, nigga!

1236
01:28:03,889 --> 01:28:05,762
Kelvin!

1237
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:10,437
Go to sleep. Go to sleep!

1238
01:28:13,675 --> 01:28:15,336
Free!

1239
01:28:50,879 --> 01:28:53,712
- Any news?
- No, he's still in surgery.

1240
01:28:55,483 --> 01:28:56,472
Sean,

1241
01:28:57,919 --> 01:29:00,752
they're makin' us forfeit the playoff game.

1242
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:03,351
Season's over.

1243
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:11,062
I told those kids

1244
01:29:11,933 --> 01:29:15,198
that no matter what happened,
they'd be winners.

1245
01:29:16,104 --> 01:29:18,436
Hey, man, you did your best.

1246
01:29:19,808 --> 01:29:22,174
We all did our best, I guess.

1247
01:29:27,983 --> 01:29:32,215
- What do we tell 'em now?
- That's what I don't know.

1248
01:29:45,267 --> 01:29:48,464
All right, gentlemen, line it up.

1249
01:29:49,337 --> 01:29:53,296
Come on, move! We've done this before.
Let's go!

1250
01:29:54,242 --> 01:29:57,302
A line here. A line here. A line here.

1251
01:29:57,302 --> 01:30:01,372
I heard about you. You buster!
Got your boy Free killed.

1252
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:03,847
- I'll kill you!
- Get off me!

1253
01:30:03,847 --> 01:30:05,580
I'll kill all you bitches!

1254
01:30:05,921 --> 01:30:08,219
- I'm 88! 88 for life!
- It's Willie. Come on, man!

1255
01:30:08,423 --> 01:30:12,052
Did you hear me! 88 for life, bitch!

1256
01:30:12,052 --> 01:30:16,393
- He goin' crazy!
- I'm a 88! 88! 88, man!

1257
01:30:16,393 --> 01:30:17,795
Get 'im off me!

1258
01:30:17,795 --> 01:30:20,096
Screw this bitch-ass football team!

1259
01:30:20,769 --> 01:30:23,932
- You're goin' to the box, Willie.
- I don't give a shit!

1260
01:30:23,932 --> 01:30:25,063
Get 'im outta here!

1261
01:30:25,063 --> 01:30:28,234
And I don't need this football team shit!

1262
01:30:44,926 --> 01:30:48,726
I just got back from the hospital.
Kelvin's gonna be okay.

1263
01:30:49,197 --> 01:30:51,688
Better for me if the nigga was dead.

1264
01:30:51,688 --> 01:30:54,997
Ya think so? I really don't think it matters

1265
01:30:56,371 --> 01:31:00,330
'cause you're screwed either way, Willie.
Your homeys know what you did yesterday.

1266
01:31:00,608 --> 01:31:03,736
So you go back to the hood,
they're gonna put a bullet in your head,

1267
01:31:03,736 --> 01:31:05,871
'cause they think you're not down
for the set anymore.

1268
01:31:05,871 --> 01:31:07,608
No matter what you say now.

1269
01:31:09,584 --> 01:31:12,553
You know what? I think they're right.

1270
01:31:12,854 --> 01:31:14,151
Man!

1271
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:19,121
You better be good to me, asshole,
'cause I'm all you got!

1272
01:31:20,462 --> 01:31:22,930
- Man, fuck you!
- Who else cares about you?

1273
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:24,522
I don't need nobody else!

1274
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:26,328
You don't give a shit about me
or anybody else!

1275
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:27,425
Man, that's right!

1276
01:31:27,425 --> 01:31:29,732
Then why'd you try
and save Kelvin yesterday?

1277
01:31:29,732 --> 01:31:31,965
Huh? Answer me that!

1278
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:36,108
Why'd you side with the enemy
over your own homeboy!

1279
01:31:36,108 --> 01:31:39,943
Man, 'cause-a you!
And this damn football team, man!

1280
01:31:39,943 --> 01:31:42,984
That's bullshit! You made a choice!

1281
01:31:42,984 --> 01:31:44,518
No, I didn't!

1282
01:31:44,518 --> 01:31:49,387
I ain't even know what was happenin' to me!
It was just so...

1283
01:31:49,387 --> 01:31:51,322
Everything so quick!

1284
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,396
I don't know what's happenin' to me, man.

1285
01:32:11,246 --> 01:32:12,611
I do.

1286
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:18,443
You're not the loser you were
when you first got here, Willie.

1287
01:32:20,422 --> 01:32:22,754
You're just not used to bein' a winner.

1288
01:32:25,827 --> 01:32:28,694
My father said I was a waste of his time

1289
01:32:28,997 --> 01:32:30,487
and his money.

1290
01:32:32,367 --> 01:32:34,198
Your father was a loser, Willie.

1291
01:32:36,337 --> 01:32:38,703
My old man was the same way.

1292
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,337
He spent so much time tellin' me
I was no good, tellin' me I was nothin',

1293
01:32:42,337 --> 01:32:43,707
I believed him.

1294
01:32:44,145 --> 01:32:46,670
That why you so pissed off all the time?

1295
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:54,448
Yeah, that's probably got
somethin' to do with it.

1296
01:32:59,127 --> 01:33:01,254
I know how you feel, Willie.

1297
01:33:01,663 --> 01:33:06,225
You get to the point where you expect
to screw up. You expect to fail.

1298
01:33:09,437 --> 01:33:11,871
If we wanna win, we gotta let 'em go.

1299
01:33:14,242 --> 01:33:15,834
Forgive 'em and move on.

1300
01:33:17,345 --> 01:33:19,711
- Forgive 'em?
- Forgive 'em.

1301
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:24,714
Otherwise we give 'em
too much power over us.

1302
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,949
And they don't deserve it.

1303
01:33:28,256 --> 01:33:31,316
Well, how long it take you
to forgive your dad?

1304
01:33:56,451 --> 01:33:58,180
Till just now.

1305
01:34:04,592 --> 01:34:06,082
Till just now.

1306
01:34:12,734 --> 01:34:14,929
Kelvin's gonna be okay?

1307
01:34:16,804 --> 01:34:18,237
Yeah.

1308
01:34:21,509 --> 01:34:24,569
Whole football team's done, though, huh?

1309
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:31,878
Maybe not.

1310
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:38,755
After our game, Willie Weathers
tried to save Kelvin Owens

1311
01:34:38,755 --> 01:34:41,420
'cause he didn't see him as an enemy,
he saw him as a teammate.

1312
01:34:42,163 --> 01:34:44,631
Everybody wants to talk about us
winning eight games in a row

1313
01:34:44,631 --> 01:34:45,723
and how great that is.

1314
01:34:45,723 --> 01:34:49,759
That's nothing compared to breaking
the power that gangs have over these kids.

1315
01:34:53,374 --> 01:34:57,674
If you cancel this game,
we're givin' that power back to them.

1316
01:34:59,214 --> 01:35:01,808
I admire what you're tryin' to do,
Coach, I really do.

1317
01:35:01,808 --> 01:35:06,377
But how can I ask our parents to expose
their kids to potential violence?

1318
01:35:06,921 --> 01:35:10,948
Yeah, you see, our problem is,
while you didn't cause the shooting

1319
01:35:11,192 --> 01:35:13,285
you couldn't prevent it either.

1320
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:17,227
What if we could?

1321
01:35:21,336 --> 01:35:24,430
What if we could guarantee
it won't happen again?

1322
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:37,941
Well, what you see behind us here
is a force of volunteers

1323
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:41,477
from the Department of Probation,
the LAPD and the Sheriff's Department.

1324
01:35:41,477 --> 01:35:44,150
The County Board of Supervisors
firmly believes

1325
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:48,685
we can't allow gangs to dictate
the terms by which our young people live.

1326
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,710
M-U-S-T-A-N-G!

1327
01:35:59,974 --> 01:36:02,067
Well, I know they had
their uniforms donated,

1328
01:36:02,067 --> 01:36:05,340
but where did they get those moves?

1329
01:36:06,547 --> 01:36:10,039
They're Mustangs, Coach.
They accepted the challenge.

1330
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:27,431
Relax, guys. What're you worried about?
That they beat ya 30-nothin' last time?

1331
01:36:27,431 --> 01:36:29,299
38 to nothin'.

1332
01:36:29,299 --> 01:36:32,965
They didn't beat you.
They beat a team that never played before.

1333
01:36:32,965 --> 01:36:35,134
But on this day it's gonna be different.

1334
01:36:35,134 --> 01:36:37,200
On this day,
you're gonna have Mustang pride.

1335
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,508
You're gonna go out there,
you're gonna put your helmets on,

1336
01:36:39,508 --> 01:36:42,481
buckle your chinstrap,
and hand out 38 ass-whoopin's!

1337
01:36:42,481 --> 01:36:45,314
You understand? Mustang pride!

1338
01:36:45,314 --> 01:36:47,047
Let's go, Mustangs!

1339
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:57,425
Hi, Dad!

1340
01:37:00,168 --> 01:37:01,999
Go Mustangs!

1341
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,634
- Kenny!
- Mom!

1342
01:37:08,634 --> 01:37:10,267
I made it!

1343
01:37:13,915 --> 01:37:15,940
Willie! Willie!

1344
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:24,777
Captains, let's go out for the coin toss.

1345
01:38:24,777 --> 01:38:29,551
That's a psych-job.
Sending out eight guys to a damn coin toss.

1346
01:38:31,426 --> 01:38:33,257
Psych 'em right back.

1347
01:39:13,935 --> 01:39:15,835
Let's go, Willie!

1348
01:39:46,667 --> 01:39:48,157
- Little flag.
- We've got a clipped ball

1349
01:39:48,157 --> 01:39:50,101
- on the receiving team.
- Flag on the play. No touchdown.

1350
01:39:50,101 --> 01:39:53,402
- You gotta be kidding me!
- Clipping on the receiving team!

1351
01:39:53,402 --> 01:39:54,498
That was a fair hit!

1352
01:39:54,498 --> 01:39:56,941
Clipping on number 88, Kenny Bates.

1353
01:39:59,981 --> 01:40:03,109
Bates! Bates! C'mere!

1354
01:40:03,109 --> 01:40:05,448
Don't worry about it, we'll get it back,
all right? You hear me?

1355
01:40:05,448 --> 01:40:07,784
Take it easy on the ref,
he knows he made a horrible call.

1356
01:40:07,784 --> 01:40:09,117
That's okay.

1357
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:13,582
- Offense, let's go!
- Kenny, it's okay!

1358
01:40:14,395 --> 01:40:15,760
Come on, Mustangs!

1359
01:40:19,267 --> 01:40:21,235
Goin' right.

1360
01:40:21,235 --> 01:40:22,530
Set!

1361
01:40:23,538 --> 01:40:24,800
Gray ten!

1362
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,499
- Goin' right.
- Gray ten!

1363
01:40:26,499 --> 01:40:27,871
Hut!

1364
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:39,417
You remember me?
I'm gonna be in your face all day, loser!

1365
01:40:41,822 --> 01:40:43,153
Hut!

1366
01:41:07,448 --> 01:41:09,006
Touchdown Barrington.

1367
01:41:15,556 --> 01:41:18,024
Great effort.
All right, come on, offense, let's go!

1368
01:41:18,024 --> 01:41:21,084
Run 18! Run 18!

1369
01:41:21,329 --> 01:41:22,455
Hut!

1370
01:41:26,434 --> 01:41:29,961
Come on, Leon! You got Willie open!
Throw it!

1371
01:41:33,908 --> 01:41:35,432
Throw it!

1372
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:44,077
Damn it!

1373
01:41:44,485 --> 01:41:48,945
Barrington recovers the ball
on the Mustangs' 40-yard line.

1374
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,387
Leon's intimidated.

1375
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:54,155
He's too worried about throwin'
another interception.

1376
01:41:54,495 --> 01:41:55,484
Yeah.

1377
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:57,793
First down, Barrington Panthers.

1378
01:41:58,299 --> 01:42:00,460
Come on, defense, let's go! Get out there!

1379
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,026
Leon! C'mere. Look at me.
You're a great quarterback.

1380
01:42:04,026 --> 01:42:07,097
Believe in your teammates
and believe in yourself. You understand?

1381
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:09,775
Let me see you smile. Come on.

1382
01:42:10,478 --> 01:42:11,968
Attaboy.

1383
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:19,352
Blue 15! Hut!

1384
01:42:24,091 --> 01:42:25,888
Perez!

1385
01:42:34,535 --> 01:42:37,026
Come on, man!

1386
01:42:41,208 --> 01:42:44,871
Touchdown, Barrington.
Number 3, David Smith.

1387
01:42:48,482 --> 01:42:50,347
I smoked that!

1388
01:42:55,956 --> 01:42:57,548
Halftime!

1389
01:42:57,548 --> 01:43:01,186
We got a whole half to play.
We got a whole half of football left.

1390
01:43:01,186 --> 01:43:02,820
Come on, guys.

1391
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,194
Hold your head up, come on!

1392
01:43:44,138 --> 01:43:47,335
Sean, you gotta get 'em ready
for the second half.

1393
01:43:48,743 --> 01:43:50,540
- They're ready.
- What?

1394
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:52,203
Just wait.

1395
01:43:53,114 --> 01:43:54,581
They're ready.

1396
01:44:00,821 --> 01:44:02,584
Man, those fools are whippin' our ass.

1397
01:44:02,584 --> 01:44:04,146
For real, man.

1398
01:44:04,146 --> 01:44:05,590
Shit.

1399
01:44:07,428 --> 01:44:09,259
They ain't that good, man.

1400
01:44:12,066 --> 01:44:13,624
We're better.

1401
01:44:14,935 --> 01:44:18,496
And it means much more to us. You know?

1402
01:44:21,876 --> 01:44:24,436
When this all started, man,

1403
01:44:25,479 --> 01:44:28,277
Coach, he said we'd be winners.

1404
01:44:32,386 --> 01:44:34,911
I thought he was full of shit, man.

1405
01:44:37,191 --> 01:44:39,489
I hated y'all.

1406
01:44:39,927 --> 01:44:41,792
Didn't want no part of it.

1407
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,765
But then

1408
01:44:48,602 --> 01:44:50,467
we made a team.

1409
01:44:52,206 --> 01:44:54,936
We showed people somethin'.

1410
01:44:57,845 --> 01:44:59,540
Coach is right.

1411
01:45:00,481 --> 01:45:02,381
We changed.

1412
01:45:04,718 --> 01:45:06,811
We're not losers no more.

1413
01:45:08,322 --> 01:45:13,385
All we gotta do is go out there
and show it one more time.

1414
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:19,599
You know what I'm sayin'?

1415
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:06,709
Let's get out there and kick some ass!

1416
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,417
- Break!
- Let's go!

1417
01:46:18,417 --> 01:46:22,428
In the third quarter the score
remains Barrington Panthers 14,

1418
01:46:22,428 --> 01:46:23,588
Kilpatrick Mustangs 0.

1419
01:46:23,588 --> 01:46:25,495
Let's go!

1420
01:46:35,643 --> 01:46:37,338
Boom!

1421
01:46:37,578 --> 01:46:39,671
That's what I'm talkin' about! Let's go!

1422
01:47:12,179 --> 01:47:13,544
Man.

1423
01:47:13,544 --> 01:47:16,515
Damn! Damn, that white boy be killin' us!

1424
01:47:16,515 --> 01:47:18,710
Woo! I'm back, nigger!

1425
01:47:19,253 --> 01:47:20,720
Stevens, come on, man.

1426
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,881
Don't go nowhere, dawg, I'll be right back.

1427
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:25,155
Huddle up.

1428
01:47:26,026 --> 01:47:29,393
Let's get back in the game, baby. On one.

1429
01:47:29,997 --> 01:47:33,558
- Let's make it a 625 swing.
- Coach called a flood.

1430
01:47:33,558 --> 01:47:36,498
You can call a audible
if you see an opening, right?

1431
01:47:37,671 --> 01:47:39,502
Look, I got an opening.

1432
01:47:41,742 --> 01:47:43,573
- Ready?
- Break!

1433
01:47:48,482 --> 01:47:51,007
That's not the right formation.
What the hell are they doin'?

1434
01:47:51,007 --> 01:47:53,110
Leon! Leon, what're you doin'?

1435
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:54,916
Get in the right formation!

1436
01:47:59,793 --> 01:48:00,793
Set!

1437
01:48:02,029 --> 01:48:03,656
Black 20!

1438
01:48:03,964 --> 01:48:05,431
Black 20!

1439
01:48:05,431 --> 01:48:06,830
Hut!

1440
01:48:20,748 --> 01:48:24,343
Go, Willie, go! Go, Weathers, go!

1441
01:48:44,271 --> 01:48:46,262
Yeah, baby!

1442
01:48:52,513 --> 01:48:56,779
That was number 13, Willie Weathers.
Touchdown for the Mustangs.

1443
01:48:57,918 --> 01:48:59,943
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1444
01:48:59,943 --> 01:49:03,285
Woo! You all right, nigga?

1445
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:12,025
Great job! Great job!

1446
01:49:21,975 --> 01:49:24,808
Fourth quarter, Barrington's ball
on the Mustang's two-yard line

1447
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,937
and we have one minute of play remaining.

1448
01:49:26,937 --> 01:49:28,948
You stop 'em now, we got a chance.

1449
01:49:28,948 --> 01:49:31,484
Unless they score again,
then it'll be all over, man.

1450
01:49:31,484 --> 01:49:32,883
Man, shut up, Bug!

1451
01:49:32,883 --> 01:49:34,978
Shut the hell up, Bug.

1452
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,194
Left! He's throwin' left!

1453
01:49:42,194 --> 01:49:44,924
Blue 16! Hut!

1454
01:49:58,378 --> 01:49:59,970
Ball! Ball!

1455
01:50:06,019 --> 01:50:09,011
All right! Go offense!

1456
01:50:13,861 --> 01:50:16,955
Fumble recovery, number 5, Miguel Perez.

1457
01:50:16,955 --> 01:50:19,863
The Mustangs have possession
with the score 14 to 10

1458
01:50:20,367 --> 01:50:21,925
and 50 seconds remaining.

1459
01:50:25,772 --> 01:50:28,036
Coach, I'm goin' deep.

1460
01:50:28,036 --> 01:50:31,339
- Ya think?
- Yes.

1461
01:50:31,339 --> 01:50:34,812
Leon. Bates.
Feel like catchin' a ball, Bates?

1462
01:50:35,682 --> 01:50:37,377
Coach, the deep pass always goes to Perez.

1463
01:50:37,377 --> 01:50:39,681
Everybody knows that,
including Barrington.

1464
01:50:39,681 --> 01:50:42,449
- Coach, I don't wanna...
- Hey, it's only a game, Kenny.

1465
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:46,050
You just get out there
and give it your best shot. Catch the ball.

1466
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:47,753
Let's go. Get out there. Come on.

1467
01:50:47,753 --> 01:50:49,523
Let's go, Hayes.

1468
01:50:54,501 --> 01:50:56,196
We got the ball back, let's go!

1469
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:58,462
- What's up, man?
- Help me out with somethin'.

1470
01:50:58,462 --> 01:51:01,372
All right, man, come on, let's ride.
Watch out, y'all.

1471
01:51:01,675 --> 01:51:04,235
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
you can do it.

1472
01:51:18,692 --> 01:51:20,319
Set!

1473
01:51:21,662 --> 01:51:23,755
Green 18!

1474
01:51:26,567 --> 01:51:29,536
Green 18! Hut!

1475
01:51:32,806 --> 01:51:34,467
You're mine, boy!

1476
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,731
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

1477
01:52:42,242 --> 01:52:44,938
That was a Mustang gain of 50 yards.

1478
01:52:44,938 --> 01:52:47,674
The first reception by number 88,
Kenny Bates.

1479
01:52:48,582 --> 01:52:50,413
Come in.

1480
01:52:52,452 --> 01:52:54,079
Bring it in! Come on.

1481
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:57,281
With the ball on the 20-yard line,
the score is 14-10.

1482
01:52:57,891 --> 01:53:01,918
Come here. All right.
We got time for one play.

1483
01:53:02,996 --> 01:53:05,487
26 toss to Willie. Can you get the 20 yards?

1484
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:08,159
- Come on, Willie.
- All right, it's cool.

1485
01:53:09,469 --> 01:53:12,905
- Definitely.
- Exactly. You believe. We believe in you.

1486
01:53:12,905 --> 01:53:15,100
Get in the end zone. Come on. Go. Go.

1487
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,938
Let's go!

1488
01:53:24,751 --> 01:53:26,651
Touchdown! Let's go!

1489
01:53:27,487 --> 01:53:32,390
A'ight, team, this is it.
We goin' with the l-right, 26 toss.

1490
01:53:35,329 --> 01:53:38,423
- Hey, who's 36? Who's 36? There's no...
- Who the hell is that?

1491
01:53:38,423 --> 01:53:40,125
That's Junior!

1492
01:53:43,603 --> 01:53:45,730
Look, it's your daddy!

1493
01:53:47,541 --> 01:53:49,031
- Yo, Junior.
- Shit.

1494
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:51,634
- Move out.
- Junior, what the hell?

1495
01:53:51,634 --> 01:53:55,148
Slipped disc, my ass. Get behind me.

1496
01:53:56,183 --> 01:53:57,707
Let's do this together.

1497
01:53:58,385 --> 01:54:00,717
A'ight, y'all, we gotta go. We gotta go!

1498
01:54:01,388 --> 01:54:06,291
This is it, right here.
L-right, 26 toss. On one. On one.

1499
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:08,123
- Ready?
- Break!

1500
01:55:02,883 --> 01:55:05,010
Green 18!

1501
01:55:22,269 --> 01:55:23,463
Go! Go!

1502
01:55:29,075 --> 01:55:32,203
Not this time! I'm gonna kill ya, boy!

1503
01:55:32,203 --> 01:55:35,112
No, you ain't! No, you ain't!

1504
01:55:35,112 --> 01:55:37,013
No, you ain't!

1505
01:56:10,016 --> 01:56:13,315
Touchdown, number 13, Willie Weathers.

1506
01:56:19,059 --> 01:56:20,492
You're the best!

1507
01:56:33,473 --> 01:56:35,941
Hey. C'mere!

1508
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:46,148
Mustangs, baby!

1509
01:56:58,164 --> 01:57:01,361
We played the championship game
the next week.

1510
01:57:01,361 --> 01:57:05,528
We lost 17-14.
But we played a helluva game.

1511
01:57:06,206 --> 01:57:08,071
And no one called us losers.

1512
01:57:09,075 --> 01:57:12,408
I told 'em, far as I was concerned,
they were champs.

1513
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,407
Since then all the kids have been released.

1514
01:57:16,216 --> 01:57:20,050
24 are goin' to school.
Three are working full-time jobs.

1515
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:22,879
And only five are back in jail.

1516
01:57:22,879 --> 01:57:26,687
That's a lot better than the average
failure rate of 75 percent.

1517
01:57:27,794 --> 01:57:31,730
After his release, Junior Palaita
got a job working for a furniture company

1518
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:33,823
and lives with his family.

1519
01:57:33,823 --> 01:57:36,232
Kelvin Owens recovered
from his bullet wound.

1520
01:57:36,232 --> 01:57:38,669
He's gonna play
for Washington High next season.

1521
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:42,475
Miguel Perez and Donald Madlock
went back to their old gangs

1522
01:57:42,475 --> 01:57:45,170
and are now in California
Youth Authority prisons.

1523
01:57:45,879 --> 01:57:49,838
Kenny Bates is goin' to school
in Redondo Beach and living with his mom.

1524
01:57:50,917 --> 01:57:54,080
Leon Hayes is trying to resist
the crack dealer's lifestyle.

1525
01:57:54,287 --> 01:57:56,778
He's gonna play football for Dorsey High
this year.

1526
01:57:57,490 --> 01:58:01,324
Bug Wendal was killed in a drive-by
shooting in Compton.

1527
01:58:02,462 --> 01:58:06,455
Willie Weathers got a full scholarship
to play football for a top boarding school.

1528
01:58:07,167 --> 01:58:09,635
A school that's a long way from 88th Street.

1529
01:58:11,838 --> 01:58:13,965
And how'd things change for me?

1530
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:18,377
Not a whole lot.

1531
01:58:19,379 --> 01:58:23,782
On the gridiron we do it my way.
Not your way, my way.

1532
01:58:23,782 --> 01:58:26,717
Right now you're all losers.

1533
01:58:26,717 --> 01:58:30,244
That's why you're in here. 'Cause ya lost.

1534
01:58:31,291 --> 01:58:35,955
But if you accept this challenge,
if you accept the Mustang challenge,

1535
01:58:35,955 --> 01:58:39,430
then come this December,
when it's all over with,

1536
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:41,524
I promise you

1537
01:58:42,769 --> 01:58:44,396
you'll be winners.

1538
01:58:44,738 --> 01:58:46,228
Ready?

1539
01:58:47,574 --> 01:58:48,534
M-U-S...

1540
01:58:51,678 --> 01:58:52,178
A!

1541
01:58:53,313 --> 01:58:54,273
A-N-G-S!

1542
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:58,812
Mustangs!

1543
01:59:01,321 --> 01:59:06,190
You don't know how to spell "Mustangs"?
You have got to be shitting me!

1544
01:59:11,931 --> 01:59:13,193
All right.

1545
01:59:13,193 --> 01:59:14,927
Here we go again.

1546
01:59:16,302 --> 01:59:17,982
M-U-S-T-A-N-G.

1547
01:59:27,814 --> 01:59:30,214
Tell me to shoot somebody, I'll shoot 'em.

1548
01:59:30,214 --> 01:59:33,912
They would have killed me
if I wouldn't-a killed them first.

1549
01:59:33,912 --> 01:59:37,354
I played football in high school
and college and most of my life.

1550
01:59:37,354 --> 01:59:40,757
You know, I had people work with me as
a kid and they made a difference in my life,

1551
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:43,295
and I was just hopin'
to pass that on to somebody else.

1552
01:59:44,164 --> 01:59:46,724
The Kilpatrick sports program
is three-pronged.

1553
01:59:47,901 --> 01:59:49,664
The dorm, where you're at now.

1554
01:59:49,664 --> 01:59:52,261
You've gotta learn to get along
with people from different neighborhoods,

1555
01:59:52,261 --> 01:59:54,898
different backgrounds. And school.

1556
01:59:54,898 --> 01:59:58,705
Apply yourself, learn,
become a better student.

1557
01:59:59,145 --> 02:00:03,377
On the field, you do it my way.
Not your way.

1558
02:00:03,377 --> 02:00:05,111
Your way got you here.

1559
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:09,884
You played a game, sellin' drugs,
robbin' people, rippin' people off,

1560
02:00:09,884 --> 02:00:12,618
and you lost. Right now you're a loser.

1561
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,250
Mustangs are winners.

1562
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:17,125
Why'd you take 'em off?

1563
02:00:17,125 --> 02:00:18,289
Good job, man.

1564
02:00:18,289 --> 02:00:20,491
- Where you goin'?
- I'm goin' to put my shorts on.

1565
02:00:20,491 --> 02:00:24,264
Why'd you even come out with 'em off?
Why'd you even walk off the field?

1566
02:00:24,264 --> 02:00:26,532
You quitting again?
You know your program.

1567
02:00:26,532 --> 02:00:29,370
Your program is you run, you get in shape,
and you get a uniform.

1568
02:00:30,143 --> 02:00:33,579
You just keep walkin'. Football team's here.
You wanna be part of it, we're here.

1569
02:00:33,579 --> 02:00:35,705
But you bring a heart with you next time.

1570
02:00:38,318 --> 02:00:39,410
I'm tired of bein' a loser.

1571
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:44,822
Out there on the field,
I can just show 'em that I'm somebody.

1572
02:00:45,191 --> 02:00:47,489
Show 'em that I can play.

1573
02:00:47,927 --> 02:00:52,557
This program has helped me get
a relationship back with my mom.

1574
02:00:53,099 --> 02:00:55,397
I want her to hold me

1575
02:00:58,805 --> 02:01:01,103
and tell me she loves me.

1576
02:01:03,643 --> 02:01:05,873
It's up to you to accept the challenge.

1577
02:01:05,873 --> 02:01:09,142
If anyone tells you it's gonna be easy,
they're lyin' to you.

1578
02:01:09,142 --> 02:01:12,184
I'm gonna push you.
I'm gonna challenge you.

1579
02:01:14,754 --> 02:01:17,416
Put your helmets on
and go shake their hands.

1580
02:01:24,397 --> 02:01:28,231
But I still don't believe
that they're 26 points better than you.

1581
02:01:29,135 --> 02:01:33,265
I still think you're the better team.
I still would not trade you for them.

1582
02:01:34,374 --> 02:01:37,810
These kids, the anxiety's
weighing them down, it's holdin' 'em back.

1583
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:39,674
It's almost a fear of the unknown.

1584
02:01:39,674 --> 02:01:41,941
It's gonna be a whole new
experience for 'em.

1585
02:01:43,349 --> 02:01:46,147
We wanted to thank you
for not giving up on us,

1586
02:01:46,147 --> 02:01:50,315
even though we didn't want
to put out the effort at times.

1587
02:01:50,315 --> 02:01:52,449
Thank you for teaching us
more than football.

1588
02:01:52,449 --> 02:01:54,459
You taught us about the game of life.

1589
02:01:54,459 --> 02:01:57,223
This ball, I wanna give it to our head coach,

1590
02:01:57,223 --> 02:01:58,730
Sean Porter.

1591
02:02:09,709 --> 02:02:11,768
When they came in here
a lot of people thought of them

1592
02:02:11,768 --> 02:02:13,574
as criminals and delinquents.

1593
02:02:15,481 --> 02:02:16,914
No way.

1594
02:02:24,824 --> 02:02:26,121
You did a great job.

1595
02:02:26,121 --> 02:02:28,558
You're a helluva group of young men.

1596
02:02:32,332 --> 02:02:34,129
You guys are champs.
