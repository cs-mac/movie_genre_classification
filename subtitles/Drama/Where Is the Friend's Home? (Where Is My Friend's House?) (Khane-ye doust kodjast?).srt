My Best Friend's Girl [2008] {English}

2
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:32,405
Oh, let's just get in there, baby.
Let's go. Hustle. Here we go.

3
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:36,612
I love angry sex. This is the best.

4
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:38,475
Oh, you wanna do it right here, huh?

5
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:42,710
Oh, yeah... Okay.

6
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:48,655
Give up, already.
Yeah, you know.

7
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,797
I like this girl. Really do.

8
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:03,664
Sometimes you just know.

9
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:13,515
I'm not finished.

10
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,818
I tried like a motherfucker
to follow you up...

11
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:27,998
...but this door, it does a little thing
with the lock when you're inside.

12
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:32,226
Anyway, here's what I'm thinking.
We start with a blowjob.

13
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,405
Yeah. I mean, obviously, you know?

14
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,903
And most girls
find it rewarding the way I do it...

15
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:41,738
...because I turn what is normally
a chore into, like, a training session.

16
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,678
It's like my own special Head Start
program. Even got Chloraseptic spray.

17
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,284
Do that really well,
we move on to the nasty stuff.

18
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,682
Bring my buddies over, maybe
take some "artsy" pictures, you know?

19
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,858
Do some artsy live streaming video.
Totally tasteful.

20
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,754
Don't worry, I'll get you paid. Easy.

21
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,020
That way you could
get that can opener fixed...

22
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:02,290
...lipo the back end,
maybe refurbish the balcony.

23
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:05,526
- Wait, I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,137
Real quick, yes to bad timing
or yes, you wanna go...?

25
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,773
- Fuck you!
- Exactly.

26
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,653
- Why won't you just die already?
- I accept your rebuke of my advances.

27
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,859
But for future reference, could you
at least give me a reason why?

28
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:28,888
How about 10?

29
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,286
I love angry sex. This is the best.

30
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,764
It's gonna be great. Just...

31
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,936
Hey, we're going Dutch
on gas money, you know.

32
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:46,378
Is that your phone?

33
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:49,441
- Don't you answer?
- I don't know.

34
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,343
Or are you more interested
in me right now?

35
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:54,018
- I'm...
- Answer your phone. That's my phone.

36
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,517
Shit. Hold on one second. I got it.

37
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:57,983
Hello.

38
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,320
Hey. Yeah, I got it. I'm a knee guy.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,390
- You need...
- Listen to me. Listen, Sarah...

40
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:05,494
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not even listen...

41
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,254
Oh, my God! Why aren't you...?

42
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,898
Dick!

43
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:12,160
- Listen. Sarah, are you pregnant?
- Oh, my God.

44
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:13,463
I'll just be a minute.

45
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,300
You know what, you expect me
to swallow that horseshit?

46
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm predictable.
Well, then fucking marry me!

47
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,943
- Didn't see that one coming, did you?
- What are you doing?

48
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:25,742
How am I supposed to know
it was your sister? How was I?

49
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:29,113
Okay, it was dark, I was drunk
and I thought it was you.

50
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,785
- Oh, she's pregnant too. Talk to her.
- What? No.

51
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:35,323
Okay, you tell your sister...

52
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,052
...that I'll make a donation
to Planned Parenthood in her honor.

53
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,034
Sarah, my ex.

54
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,000
Big cunt.

55
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,176
Rachel, I apologize.

56
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,816
Sometimes when you try
a new restaurant, it's a gamble.

57
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,179
And today we lost.

58
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,221
I'm thinking to avoid
any sexual obligation, that's you.

59
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,043
Oh, my God.

60
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:28,145
- Everything okay?
- I can't eat this. I can't.

61
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:32,112
Perhaps I can interest you in some of
our fabulous Famine Fiesta Fries?

62
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,377
She could use a little more famine
and a little less fried.

63
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:43,296
Tank.

64
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:47,857
Okay. Since you have yet to
ask me anything at all...

65
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,194
...I just thought I should tell you
a little bit about myself.

66
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:52,461
I'm a social worker.

67
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:54,639
- Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
- Yeah?

68
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,501
It's very... It's challenging work...

69
00:04:56,742 --> 00:05:01,042
...but it's so important.
- Whoa, whoa, there, big time.

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,545
I'm a customer satisfaction rep
at Airmeister Air Filtration Systems.

71
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:09,248
That is important work.
Because without air, we cannot live.

72
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,189
What can I get for you tonight?

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,796
Is the corned beef quesadilla,
is that any good?

74
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:18,759
Or what do you recommend?

75
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:22,593
Do you mean unspoiled? For example,
if you said, "Is this milk any good?"...

76
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:26,293
...your concern would not be with taste
but rather your personal safety.

77
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,408
Hi, my name is Pedro O'Malley.
I'll be your server for tonight.

78
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:36,979
Something to drink?

79
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:40,014
Two Baja Car Bombs on the snap.

80
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,017
Okay, no, I don't drink...

81
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,883
...but thank you.
- I wasn't ordering for you.

82
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,927
- I gotta warn you, the stereo's busted.
- That's okay.

83
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,097
I've got a little bit
of a headache, so...

84
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,528
See?!

85
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,703
It's been like this for a month!

86
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,703
I got it.

87
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:13,214
These are for your ears!

88
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:15,481
Thanks.

89
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:18,691
You look offended by the song!

90
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:22,053
But if you really listen,
it's not really vulgar.

91
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:27,198
It's about a guy, he's in love. And
I know he's saying, "Pop the pussy."

92
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,458
But it's a metaphor for, like:

93
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:32,102
"I wanna hug you!"

94
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:36,068
<i>Pop that pussy
Hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me</i>

95
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,702
It's not about fucking.

96
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:41,071
It's about taking a relationship...

97
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,339
...to another level!

98
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,010
- What?
- Yeah. And now we see it.

99
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:51,553
So we should listen to the whole thing
so you know the story.

100
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,158
Listen, listen.

101
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,689
No, it's easy, all right? She's not
even gonna make it past dinner.

102
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,559
By the time I'm done, she'll know
the difference between...

103
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,361
...what's in the hand
and what's in the bush.

104
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,731
Hi.

105
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:11,374
- Yeah, we said 7:00.
- I know.

106
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,545
I tutor this high-school girl.

107
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,639
She's part of my Head Start program.

108
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:20,011
And she's slow, learning-disabled.

109
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,915
It's sad.

110
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,254
Every time I come,
I feel like I'm wasting my time.

111
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:32,263
- You know, not in her eyes.
- Actually...

112
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,866
No one is doubting your memory,
which is both vivid and damning.

113
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:39,265
But if I could, I'd like to briefly
challenge points four and seven.

114
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:42,998
Oh, really? Because, you know what?
I didn't even get to mention...

115
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,035
Oh, my God.

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,575
Please stop. Please stop.
Please stop.

117
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,559
So I'll call you later?

118
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:04,593
- And I'll call the cops, you asshole.
- I had a nice time tonight.

119
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,204
<i>- Hello.
- Josh, I just went on...</i>

120
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,567
<i>- ... the worst date of my life.
- Rachel.</i>

121
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,870
<i>- Hey, look, I'm gl...
- I'm so, so sorry.</i>

122
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,877
Why are you sorry?
Baby, I was the one who...

123
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:26,643
<i>- Can we maybe, you know, grab a...?
- Yeah. Yeah, no, that sounds great.</i>

124
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,378
<i>- Yeah.
- I'd really like that.</i>

125
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:33,217
Listen, I'm out with a friend right now.
But can I call you?

126
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:35,688
<i>- What about dinner tomorrow night?
- I'd like that.</i>

127
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,726
Yeah, I'd like that too. All right.

128
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,832
I'm so glad you called. All right, bye.

129
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,829
Told you.
I just show them the difference...

130
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,437
...between what's in the hand
and what's in the bush.

131
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,108
You have mastered
the female psyche.

132
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:52,675
To get them to run,
I make them think that I'm shit.

133
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,245
To get them to come,
I make them think they're shit.

134
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,473
Either way, you're the asshole.

135
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,015
It's what I do.

136
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:37,285
<i>Sorry.</i>

137
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,135
All right.

138
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,231
Look at you, all white and thin.

139
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,638
I bet if I laid you on this bar,
she could snort you.

140
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,179
Listen, beauty queen.

141
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,712
I know people are concerned about
you because you're dangerously thin.

142
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,714
But I'm not one of those people.
Yet I am concerned.

143
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,477
That you've had too many drinks...

144
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:12,157
...and your fingers are in this bowl
like it's one of your sorority sisters.

145
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:14,519
These pretzeled devils,
far from complimentary.

146
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,558
I mean, baby,
get your head in the game.

147
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:19,527
Nothing tastes as good
as looking good.

148
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,632
- That is just...
- Excuse me.

149
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:25,304
Are you psycho? I mean,
how can you even begin to talk to...?

150
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,528
Easy, Urlacher.

151
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,765
Ever notice it's the linebackers
concerned with people not eating?

152
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,979
If the pussy police here would
stop ordering her fries tempura...

153
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,145
I just had a child.

154
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,713
Congratulations.
I'm sure he was probably delicious.

155
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,542
Looks like you
downed the whole thing.

156
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,345
You're an asshole.

157
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:47,382
- You really are an asshole.
- Then walk away.

158
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:02,769
- Let me just go get my purse, okay?
- Get cigarettes.

159
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:05,811
- Let's go.
- Okay.

160
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,846
Take me. Take me to your house.
Take me right now to your house.

161
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,053
- Hey, guy.
- Tank, hey. Tank, this is Renee.

162
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,084
- Yeah. Come here.
- Renee, Tank.

163
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:17,824
- Hey, okay. Two seconds.
- Talk to me for a second.

164
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,390
- Yeah, I'll talk to you all night.
- All right.

165
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:23,256
Didn't I just save your ass?
I just cleaned up your bed...

166
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:27,365
...and you're shitting in it again, okay?
Aren't you getting fucking married?

167
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,895
I am getting married...

168
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:32,472
...but not tonight.

169
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,837
- Renee. Renee, there she is.
- Josh.

170
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:39,307
There she is. She's all mine.

171
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:45,648
I have to work tomorrow.

172
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:50,521
Everybody's gotta work tomorrow.
It's Tuesday.

173
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:55,457
Good one.
I have a strict no-sleepover policy.

174
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,564
Yeah.

175
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:08,804
Come on, Tank, it's almost 5.

176
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:13,741
For some people that's not tonight,
it's tomorrow.

177
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:23,721
I hate those people.

178
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,304
Shit.

179
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:45,842
Dustin? Yeah, five minutes is fine.
Okay, bye.

180
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,480
- Dude. What the shit?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

181
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:52,379
I told you this was happening. As
of now, I'm training for the marathon.

182
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,613
Goal: Run, don't walk. Nothing wrong
with a little bit of discipline.

183
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,256
By the way, you should try it.

184
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:00,960
You need discipline
like I need to miss my period.

185
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,820
Seriously, you're already, like...

186
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:06,328
...a crazy, insane, OCD alpha-dog...

187
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,262
...cyborg crazy creature.

188
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,901
You mean, I have a job?

189
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:13,733
And now you're gonna wake me up
at 5:15 every single morning...

190
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:16,910
...so that eventually
you can run 26 miles in a circle.

191
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:20,910
Here's the great part. You get to
go back to sleep indefinitely. Yea!

192
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:28,383
For the record, I am involved in
a very taboo interoffice relationship.

193
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,755
- Morning.
- Good morning.

194
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,826
Dustin, the bad boy
from the wrong side of the tracks.

195
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:38,395
I'm from Lexington.

196
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:40,429
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

197
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,569
- See you.
- Yeah.

198
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,035
That's not the secret knock.

199
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,406
That's the one. What's going on, man?

200
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:58,277
I need to move this into your room.
Tonight is the night.

201
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,955
And if all goes according to plan,
consider this move permanent.

202
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:05,659
<i>- "Lawrence of a Labia"?
- Yeah, in a moment of weakness...</i>

203
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:10,260
...I bought the entire EFI. The
Erotic Film Institute's top 100. Enjoy.

204
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:12,831
Where did it go wrong?
You have a serious problem.

205
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,059
Better than taking
sexual frustrations out...

206
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,897
...on a parade of one-night skanks
I'll never see again.

207
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,106
- True.
- Good morning.

208
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:22,504
Hey, no, no, come here. This
is Dusty, my roommate-slash-cousin.

209
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:26,543
Not technically related. Our parents
were friends until his mom walked out.

210
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,079
Slash-fuckhead for bringing up
bad family shit at inappropriate times.

211
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,284
It's nice to meet you.

212
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,487
- Nice to meet you.
- Fucking family.

213
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:36,781
What's the plan? Bring this girl
back here, pop open chloroform...

214
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,854
...insert Tab A into Slot B, repeat?

215
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:41,688
No. Tonight is the night
I tell her how I feel.

216
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,388
Tank, this girl... This girl is my
soul mate and it's time she knew that.

217
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,898
Not if you want to fuck her.

218
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:51,071
You, what is the nicest thing
I've said to you since I met you?

219
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,672
You complimented me
on my technique.

220
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,274
Okay, look, I'm not you, okay?

221
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,604
I'm not gonna manipulate her,
I'm not gonna con her.

222
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,406
- I'm just gonna be myself.
- No.

223
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:03,947
Yourself is a repressed headcase that
beats more meat than Rocky Balboa.

224
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,711
By hiding porn, taking her to joints
you hate, training for a marathon...

225
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:11,254
...you're not showing the real you.
You're showing a highlight-reel you.

226
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,759
- Thus, in fact, you're conning her.
- You don't get it. You don't get it.

227
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:18,727
I love her. Alexis...

228
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:21,265
Alexis is my angel.

229
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,403
You get it, right?

230
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,939
We don't get it. We don't.

231
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:31,235
Anyway, we can skip this
"call me" scenario.

232
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,571
- I'm already late.
- Great.

233
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,406
I wanna know something.
This chick...

234
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:35,740
- What's her name?
- Alexis.

235
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:39,350
If this chick Alexis means so much to
you, how come I haven't met her yet?

236
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,453
Because she means
that much to me.

237
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:45,784
Mazel tov, man.
Love. Angels. Awesome.

238
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:49,758
What about that girl at camp who
used to let you play with her boobies?

239
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:53,525
- Jackie? We were 15.
- She looked like a baton with titties.

240
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:55,861
What about Gracie, love of your life...

241
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,595
...till you caught her blowing Holstein
freshman year?

242
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:01,435
- What's your point?
- My point is this: Lindsay, gym crush.

243
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,543
Melissa, your barista.
A lot of angels, Dust.

244
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,270
- Why you gotta be such an asshole?
- It's what I do, man.

245
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:10,483
Good luck. If you need them,
condoms are in the medicine cabinet.

246
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:14,678
If not, Jergens lotion,
underneath my bed.

247
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,593
Dusty, this is absurd.

248
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,862
What? You love steak,
we're eating steak.

249
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:34,735
- You're a vegan.
- Not tonight. Eat, eat, eat. Enjoy.

250
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:40,841
I feel a little guilty loving steak
so much and you're a vegan.

251
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,045
But whatever.

252
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:46,017
I love the way you eat.

253
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,282
I love that you eat.

254
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,581
I love that you pay.

255
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:59,491
Seriously, though, I just love
watching you do anything.

256
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:02,532
I love it... I love you, Alexis.
I love you.

257
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,742
Oh, shit.

258
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:15,741
We just said more than once
we're gonna keep it light.

259
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,912
- We work together, we're friends.
- That's what I'm supposed to say.

260
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:23,386
Right? I mean, I'm supposed to be
the relationship tough guy, you know?

261
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:24,716
I'm the dude.

262
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:26,517
The dude can't just come out with:

263
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,730
"I've loved you since the moment
I first saw you, pounding out...

264
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,989
...a lender's agreement,
eating Cocoa Puffs...

265
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,167
...while some pretty boy
drooled over you."

266
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:37,803
- Michi Yamana.
- Yeah, Michi Yamana. Dick.

267
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:41,268
So I love you, madly.

268
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,239
Sorry. l... l... I know I need to stop.

269
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,209
Now, stop. Just stop speaking,
Dustin. Just shut your mouth.

270
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:50,351
I'm sorry. Wow, kamikaze, huh?
See, this is what you do to me.

271
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,485
- What do I say here, but...?
- I'm sorry.

272
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,349
But do you know how hard it's been
trying to play it cool?

273
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:57,181
- It's been five weeks.
- I know.

274
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,892
We haven't even had sex.

275
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:06,026
Well, that's why we're here, Alexis.
I wanted to talk to you about...

276
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,499
I think I'm ready
to take the next step.

277
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,531
Sex isn't a step, Dustin.

278
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:17,474
Being exclusive would be a step
or moving in together is a step.

279
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,112
Then let's move in together.

280
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,009
I need you to take me home.

281
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:29,519
But it just felt so right.
It just felt so right.

282
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,053
No, it does, it feels right.

283
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:36,025
Just not right now.

284
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,357
"Just not right now."

285
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:45,872
<i>Oh, God.</i>

286
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,215
God, I'm a fag.

287
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,818
- Dude, you canceled Spice.
- It was like 21 bucks a month, dude.

288
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,425
Someone had a rough night.

289
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,927
I'm Mr. Right...

290
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:14,932
...just not Mr. Right Now.

291
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,071
What...? What does that even mean?
What does that even mean?

292
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,743
- I told her I loved her...
- Oh, no.

293
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,536
What?

294
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:29,050
I went in early. No, no, I know.
I went in a little early, but she...

295
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:34,820
- Thanks for your support. Sweet.
- Dustin.

296
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:38,853
Dusty, look.

297
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,596
This too shall pass, all right?

298
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:44,731
But that journey begins...

299
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,935
...with self-exploration.

300
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,364
And I'm holding the map, Dusty.

301
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,004
Hey.

302
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,402
Kid, I got your 'bate crate.

303
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,577
You know how much
you love your 'bate crate.

304
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,007
"I'm like comfort food for your penis."

305
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,109
- What do I do?
- Okay.

306
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,753
What do you do?
Okay, let's look at the options.

307
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:10,618
Stalk her. But you're never gonna
be with her. Love her from a distance.

308
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,885
Never have a family but you could
love her kids from a distance.

309
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,393
Murder-suicide,
but that's trending upward.

310
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,795
- Or I could just hire you.
- No.

311
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,900
- Why not?
- I don't fuck with family.

312
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:25,499
Well, technically
we're not blood-related. Right?

313
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,470
Go to bed, Dust.

314
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,634
You're serious. Okay.

315
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,677
I'll get serious.

316
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:35,073
If I do this...

317
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,488
If I do this, I'm gonna make it
the finest Tank-ing of my career.

318
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:42,815
My fucking masterpiece.

319
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,583
She'll lose her shit
like a shit collector with amnesia.

320
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:50,059
I'm talking about a Turkish twist,
epic mindfuck of a Tank-ing, okay?

321
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,895
Her brain'll be rocking back and forth
in the shower for like three weeks.

322
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:58,106
Okay? I'm talking about
demonic fucking Tank.

323
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,705
I'll be flying up into the sky.

324
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:04,345
She's gonna cry tears that form
"Call Dusty" on the ground.

325
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,208
Yes? Am I doing it?
Tell me I'm doing it.

326
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,886
Okay, that was weird.
And I'm not sure that...

327
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:14,556
Listen, rain check, maybe though.

328
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:18,520
Wow, can't believe I almost resorted
to emotional terrorism. I'm sorry.

329
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,194
You're sweet.
Next time with the next one, maybe.

330
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,193
- Thank you.
- I'm here.

331
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,868
A little crazy. Sweet, crazy mostly.

332
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:32,770
Don't say a word.

333
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:59,396
God! Son of...

334
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:03,469
Why? That stupid...

335
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,209
Hi. Tank Turner,
Customer Satisfaction.

336
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,743
How may I help you today?

337
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:14,041
<i>Excuse me, do you have any idea
how long I was just on hold?</i>

338
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:16,115
<i>It's been like an hour and a half.</i>

339
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:17,752
<i>Hello. In your manual...</i>

340
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,548
<i>... you've expressed a possibility
of some odor issues.</i>

341
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:25,453
<i>"Faint aroma," it says here on page 7.
Come on. "Faint aroma"? Bullshit.</i>

342
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:28,288
<i>It smells like burnt fucking hair, dude.</i>

343
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:32,898
<i>Because apparently
I paid 49.90-motherfucking-5...</i>

344
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:37,504
<i>... so that my sweet-ass condo smells
like some Korean cat barbecue.</i>

345
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,571
<i>- Touchdown.
- You lose. You lose.</i>

346
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,333
You suck.

347
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:46,180
Sir, I will gladly give you a refund, but
that's not gonna solve your problem.

348
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:49,145
New girl.

349
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,349
<i>New girl</i>

350
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,848
<i>Ooh, new girl</i>

351
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:00,123
Did the emotional terrorist win?

352
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,297
I just... You know, it's funny.
I never noticed your highlights...

353
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,466
...until somebody actually
said something.

354
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,167
They're actually really good.

355
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,128
- Just tell me how it works.
- Let me make this clear.

356
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:13,274
Before she can love you,
she has to hate me.

357
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,240
But before she can hate me,
she has to like me.

358
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,470
That may be
the hardest part of the equation.

359
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:19,943
So I set up the meet-cute.

360
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:22,378
In every movie,
the stars meet in some cutesy way.

361
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:25,554
Since every woman is looking
for that dreamy, witty, goofy guy...

362
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,225
...of their sitcom, rom-com fantasies,
I've gotta be that thing.

363
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,618
Here.

364
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:33,158
Lucky slap on the ass. Hit it.

365
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,192
Are you okay?

366
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:17,104
That was rough. I'm Alexis.

367
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,115
Wow, that looked really real.

368
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:31,684
- Is that real?
- It's real and it hurts.

369
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,651
Okay. So, like, what happens now?
You come back every day...

370
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,688
...for a couple weeks. Slowly,
eventually you build her trust.

371
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:40,596
- Daddy bee's got the honey.
- That's her number.

372
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,560
- Let's go eat.
- How...? How did...?

373
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,200
Now, remember, she's classy.
So maybe a fast-food joint.

374
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:49,200
Or wait, wait, drive-through.

375
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:52,306
Do I tell you what flavor of jam
to eat out of your boss's ass?

376
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:55,875
No. Dusty, it's what I do, okay?
You want offensive locales?

377
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:58,842
There's a place in Revere,
they let you boil your own dolphin.

378
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,243
Arlington, you can have
a dominatrix waitress...

379
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:04,214
...take a dump on your lap
while she peppers your Cobb salad.

380
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:07,685
I know a spot in P-town, you can get
a meat loaf shaped like a cock.

381
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:11,353
You gotta trust me.
She's not gonna know what hit her.

382
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:13,625
All right. Good luck.

383
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,404
- Do not wear that, please.
- What am I doing?

384
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,470
Just take this.
This is what you're doing.

385
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:28,302
Clean the pipes. It's mandatory to
flush them out after a relationship.

386
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:31,013
That's disgusting.
But seriously, what's wrong with me?

387
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:32,737
Dustin's a good guy.

388
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:35,473
- You're such a fucking girl sometimes.
- Pretty good guy.

389
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,117
A good guy? Who cares?

390
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,949
A good guy is, like,
somebody that your parents dig or...

391
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:44,683
- Listen to me. In the real world... Ami.
- I'm listening.

392
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,453
- In the real world...
- Yes.

393
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:51,188
What if he's a good man
with a good heart...

394
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,459
...and he's smart? And if
he's not too rough on the eyes?

395
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:58,936
If "ifs" and "buts" were cocks and nuts,
I'd be getting gangbanged right now.

396
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:02,611
Seriously. But it's that I wanna teach
you something that took me, like...

397
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:05,211
...years and years of promiscuity
to learn, okay?

398
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,211
- What is this outfit?
- It's aweso...

399
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,213
Hey, how many guys
have you slept with?

400
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:12,183
- Like, total? Three, right?
- Two.

401
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:16,322
- Two?
- I'm a serial monogamist.

402
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:20,553
Well, okay. That's, like, the first
big, huge problem right there.

403
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,766
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that you have to suck a few frogs...

404
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,730
...before you get to suck a prince?

405
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,870
I believe it's "kiss."

406
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:30,834
Pretend it's a year abroad, you know?

407
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:35,670
But instead of going to Europe, you're
gonna bang a whole shitload of dudes.

408
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:38,472
- It's awesome.
- I haven't been drunk in a long time.

409
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:40,877
Good. You need it. You need it.

410
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:44,349
Now tell me something.
What do you see in this box?

411
00:26:45,923 --> 00:26:49,620
- I see into the...
- No, in the box.

412
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:52,661
An inordinate amount
of masturbatory aides...

413
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:56,832
...which some,
I pray, are novelty-sized.

414
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:00,959
Oh, my God.

415
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:04,266
Okay, that will do nicely.

416
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:06,873
- You, show her a good time tonight.
- I love you.

417
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,634
- Show her a good time.
- I love you.

418
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,074
- Such a good time. Love you.
- Have a great night.

419
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:12,509
Don't be scared without me.

420
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,514
- I'll be back. I'll be back.
- Yeah. I'll be waiting...

421
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:18,779
- She's my roommate.
- I bet she gives great head.

422
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:21,423
Actually, I'm sure she does.

423
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:23,159
You're pretty drunk.

424
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:26,021
I'm pretty ready to rock.

425
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,396
Oh, boy.

426
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,227
Tank, is this a Mustang?

427
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:34,766
It's a GTO.

428
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,906
- A... Whatever that means.
- Yeah.

429
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:44,314
Well, listen, I just wanna warn you,
my stereo's busted.

430
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:46,948
Oh, that's cool. That's cool.

431
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:55,988
Hey, this is my...
I almost lost my virginity to this song.

432
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:08,729
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

433
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:16,374
- This is a first, Tank.
- Yeah, me too.

434
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,309
Should we sit front row and center?

435
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:23,348
Oh, wild.

436
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:26,722
Yeah, can we get
two Long Island Iced Teas?

437
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,084
And put the chop-chop on that, lady.

438
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,761
Could you make mine a double?
And two shots of tequila, please.

439
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:40,269
Okay, let's slow down, princess.

440
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,371
You're getting sloshed
like it's your prom night here.

441
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,742
- I never went to prom. I never went.
- No shock there. I believe that.

442
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,741
I had the date, I had the dress.

443
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,574
But prom was the night my dog
bit my sister in the neck...

444
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,477
...and we had to put him down.
- Shit.

445
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:57,346
And I will never... Oh, my goodness.

446
00:28:57,588 --> 00:29:00,079
- ever forget the horror
in little Fraggle's eyes...

447
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:03,293
...as his paw went limp in my hand.

448
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,256
It was horrible. Blood.
It was just, like:

449
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,466
I'm sure that's not the only thing
that's gone limp in your hand.

450
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:12,534
I will say it. In all sincerity,
that sucks hard.

451
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:14,602
It's sad to lose a pet.

452
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,567
Where do they learn how to do this?

453
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:19,867
- Well, I taught them a few things.
- I wanna know.

454
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:25,806
That's incredible.

455
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,942
What is that?

456
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,384
- What is that?
- I think we should just fuck tonight.

457
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,030
That looks pretty.

458
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,505
- I'm gonna go pee.
- Got it.

459
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,347
Hey, I can't talk.

460
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,106
- Where are you?
- I'm out, I'm seeing a band.

461
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,875
They suck, but I'm seeing them
so I really can't talk.

462
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,214
- Put your "Guitar Hero" down.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

463
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:09,586
I'm not playing "Guitar Hero."
It's Saturday night. I'm out.

464
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:12,227
Just put it down.
We have problems.

465
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:13,658
All right. What's the story?

466
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:18,335
I am drunk and he's either
the biggest asshole in America...

467
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,470
...or trying to convince me
he's the biggest asshole in America.

468
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:25,664
Either way, even a broken clock is
right twice a day, but this guy...

469
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,469
Come on. How better to
appreciate Dustin than to do this?

470
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:31,180
Than to bang this guy,
who's obviously far inferior...

471
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:34,384
...but probably hung like Seabiscuit.
Right?

472
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:38,384
Now go. Go and bang. Bang
like you have never "bung" before.

473
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:41,114
And do it for Dustin.

474
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,424
Jesus.

475
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:47,062
- Baby doll...
- Hi.

476
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:48,526
- Hi.
- I'm Alexis.

477
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:50,597
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

478
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:54,396
And when it comes to love,
there's only one thing you can trust.

479
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:57,574
It's not your friends,
it's not your head.

480
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:01,073
It's that little voice
inside your clamburger.

481
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:07,212
"Listen to me."

482
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:18,519
Watch this. It's a game.
It's called "Who's at the Door?"

483
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:20,593
And I look out the peephole.

484
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:22,726
It's the mailman.

485
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:30,397
Would it hurt you to play with her tits?
Help me out.

486
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:34,335
You can stay there. That's good.

487
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,944
Oh, you grab that.
I'll get the next one.

488
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,479
- There won't be a next time.
- Lucky me.

489
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,749
And our motto, basically,
is, "Without air, we..."

490
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:52,428
"Without air, we cannot live."

491
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:53,996
- Stop.
- Right.

492
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,699
I get it. You're a dick.

493
00:31:56,935 --> 00:31:59,233
I'm sufficiently offended.

494
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:01,161
Done.

495
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:26,693
Coming up?

496
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:41,210
Suit yourself.

497
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:46,248
Enjoy the long ride home.

498
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:54,919
I'm going home, okay?

499
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:57,127
Why am I going home?
Because I'm going home.

500
00:32:57,362 --> 00:33:01,458
I'm getting in the car. Eyes
in the game and the head in the ball.

501
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:03,394
Can't do it.

502
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:06,730
Just start the car.
Just start the car, baby.

503
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:09,338
Just gotta start the car,
get the fuck out of here.

504
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:12,976
Why? Because, look. Your head's
in the game, your balls are attached...

505
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:17,147
<i>...and you're gonna go home
and maybe she'll call you mañana.</i>

506
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:19,179
Why would she call me?
She'll call Dusty.

507
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:22,352
Because she's what? Dusty's
girlfriend. Follow the bouncing ball.

508
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:25,215
She is Dusty's girlfriend.

509
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,855
Listen to me.

510
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:35,197
What is wrong with you, asshole?

511
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:53,743
You asked me to trust you.

512
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:57,485
- And I trusted you.
- Done.

513
00:33:58,122 --> 00:33:59,111
Somehow.

514
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:01,018
Some way.

515
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:04,995
Thank you.

516
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:11,563
Dude, you did it. She just called.

517
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:14,432
Okay, quote,
"I just had the worst night of my life."

518
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:17,233
"I just had the worst night of my life."
You did it, man.

519
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:18,704
We're having lunch tomorrow.

520
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:20,935
Tank, we're having lunch.
Can you believe it?

521
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,273
Dude, when it comes to being
an asshole, you are a genius.

522
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,415
Genius.

523
00:34:29,587 --> 00:34:31,111
Anything for a friend.

524
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,989
So about the other night.

525
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,229
Okay, I was stupid. I was stupid.

526
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:42,160
It's just... I've never gone this far
with a girl, emotionally.

527
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:44,301
- And I just lost it.
- Slow down. Slow down.

528
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:46,527
I was stupid and harsh...

529
00:34:46,772 --> 00:34:48,171
...and I'm sorry.

530
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:51,672
Last night I went out
with a real asshole. Horrible.

531
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,435
It just made me realize
that guys like you are so rare.

532
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:59,146
But it also made me realize
how few guys I've dated.

533
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,374
How few guys
I've actually gone out with.

534
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,087
Like, none. I need to date
and you need to date...

535
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:07,155
...other people. I'm just saying that...

536
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:11,624
What I'm trying to say is that
I wanna start over as friends first.

537
00:35:11,897 --> 00:35:14,297
Like, be friends.

538
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,831
I like you as my friend.

539
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:25,471
Start over...

540
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:27,838
...as friends first.
- Friends.

541
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,014
Like Harry and Sally.

542
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:36,978
I think the point of that movie was that
men and women can't just be friends.

543
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,123
No, no, no,
they can be just friends...

544
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,089
...even date other people,
as long as they end up together...

545
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:46,058
...in the end. As long
as they end up together, right?

546
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,389
Yeah.

547
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:53,332
This is fun. You know, I'm gonna go
because my sister is getting married.

548
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,506
It's an on-again, off-again,
on-again thing.

549
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:59,336
She's freaking out, treating me like
her assistant so I'm running all over.

550
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:02,012
I'm really glad we had this talk,
you know?

551
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:07,116
Dude. You check out that sandwich
they got downstairs?

552
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,547
Bread is, like,
two slices of freaking pizza, man.

553
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:11,016
Only in America. Fuck me.

554
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:14,692
<i>Clean air probably shouldn't stink
like flaming ass nougat.</i>

555
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,861
I got a real fucking tough guy
over here.

556
00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:20,496
I got a guy on the verge of a five-state
killing spree. Do you wanna?

557
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:22,791
Ready? Three, two, one.

558
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:26,003
- Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
- Let me transfer you to my supervisor.

559
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:28,569
- Make me proud.
- Kill it.

560
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,233
Hi, this is Supervisor Eugene Lenay.

561
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:33,341
- How may I help you?
- How may I help you?

562
00:36:35,214 --> 00:36:36,681
- Please hold.
- Please hold.

563
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:41,678
Treat her like a bowling ball.

564
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,148
Strike.

565
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,015
Dust, hold on one second, all right?

566
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:48,351
Sir, I looked into the problem
and it'll actually fix itself.

567
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:50,117
- What's up, kid?
- You failed, Tank.

568
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:52,158
She wants to see other people.

569
00:36:52,431 --> 00:36:54,160
She said she wants
to see other people?

570
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,833
She did. That's why
you're gonna take her out again.

571
00:36:57,102 --> 00:36:59,570
Except this time,
you're gonna get seriously diabolical.

572
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:02,171
I'm talking public defecation.

573
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:05,899
Dust, you're freaking me out here,
okay? Tank-ing is a subtle art.

574
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,841
You can't go in there crazy
like a dragon with a hemorrhoid.

575
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:12,074
Besides, what makes you think
she'd ever wanna speak to me again?

576
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,183
Don't worry, I'm taking care of that.

577
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,684
No, you're not. You do... Dust.

578
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,523
<i>Don't do anything, okay? Listen.</i>

579
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,820
I have to teach a training seminar
10 minutes ago. Dusty?

580
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:27,329
All right.

581
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:31,462
- You're late, Tank.
- I know.

582
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:33,962
- You're Tank, right?
- Are you a cop?

583
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:36,970
No, Roger's friend Sonny
said you fix things.

584
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,302
Walk with me.

585
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:39,568
- You're late.
- Thank you.

586
00:37:39,812 --> 00:37:42,940
I'm going crazy without her.
Shit-in-the-bed-and-roll-around crazy.

587
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:44,171
- You're late.
- Shut up.

588
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,715
Okay, religious girl.
How do I bump into her?

589
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:48,011
- You're late.
- No shit.

590
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:50,016
She's a high-school English teacher.

591
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:53,383
Guy can't really hang around a
high school these days, unfortunately.

592
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,525
- She gets her hair done Tuesdays.
- Love it.

593
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:59,286
What'd you do? Foot in your mouth?
Foot-long in somebody's mouth? Facts.

594
00:37:59,564 --> 00:38:02,795
Let's say you're gonna have to be
a real asshole to make me look good.

595
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:04,468
It's what I do.

596
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:06,864
- You're late.
- Yes.

597
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:09,301
Everybody, you're late.
Don't let it happen again.

598
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:10,804
I'm Tank and I will be brief.

599
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:13,410
Here at Airmeister
we have two rules.

600
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:15,546
No refunds.

601
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:19,741
The beauty of an air purifier is that
nobody can prove that it doesn't work.

602
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:23,250
Amanda, you saucy tart.
I want somebody really pissed off.

603
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,752
I'm talking about DEFCON 2
level of anger.

604
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:27,219
Who do you got for me, baby?

605
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:31,452
<i>I have just the one for you. She's
furious and asked for you by name.</i>

606
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,197
Put her through.

607
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:39,704
Tank Turner, Customer Satisfaction.
How may I help you?

608
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:41,770
<i>Before we even discuss
what I received...</i>

609
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:43,703
<i>... which is a whole other mystery...</i>

610
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:45,808
...I demand an explanation
for yesterday.

611
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:49,014
Ma'am, I'm fully concerned.
What happened yesterday?

612
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:51,307
Are you gay?
Or are you just an asshole?

613
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:56,181
Oh, ma'am. Profanity is superfluous
because no verbal affront...

614
00:38:56,422 --> 00:38:59,481
...could be as devastating to me
as your dissatisfaction.

615
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:01,192
Dissatisfaction?

616
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:05,863
Yes, I mean if the unit's performance
or lack thereof has left you frustrated...

617
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:09,364
See, I never saw your unit. I gave
you a chance and you didn't deliver.

618
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:11,263
Ma'am, you're upset.

619
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:15,406
I'm upset. I'm upset that you will
never, ever know what it's like...

620
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:19,509
...to sit on a hot, sweaty
summer night...

621
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:23,477
...and let that unit blow
its glorious bounty all over your face.

622
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,577
You think after the shit
you put me through...

623
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:30,550
...that I called just so
you could talk dirty to me?

624
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,280
I gave you a one-time
free hall pass for sex.

625
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:35,015
<i>Good sex. Hot sex.</i>

626
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:38,058
l... l... I fucking roofied myself.

627
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:41,597
I'm a little confused. Amanda?

628
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,597
<i>You're confused?
That makes two of us...</i>

629
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:46,896
...because I don't know what kind
of asshole acts like an asshole...

630
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,133
...and then when it actually comes
time to be an asshole, walks away.

631
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:53,174
Like a total asshole.

632
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:56,007
Making me look like
an even bigger asshole...

633
00:39:56,249 --> 00:40:01,448
...for offering some big-ass asshole
asshole-sex in the first place.

634
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:03,655
What kind of asshole are you?

635
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:08,353
This is actually a personal call.

636
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:10,390
Dude, you are so hired.

637
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:12,728
Excuse me for a second.

638
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,497
Shit.

639
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:16,195
Asshole.

640
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:33,878
Sorry. Offer expired.

641
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:44,519
Did you really think roses and a poem
would give you a second chance?

642
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,163
You rhymed "apology"
with "apologetically."

643
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,732
- I'm...
- I just felt bad, okay?

644
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,903
You're right,
I do owe you an explanation.

645
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:54,606
I didn't sleep with you
because you're not attractive.

646
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,172
- There, I said it.
- Oh, thanks.

647
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,400
Thank you so much
because you saved me...

648
00:40:58,644 --> 00:41:01,135
...from what could've been
the worst decision of my life.

649
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,439
- And I've eaten sushi in Tijuana.
- One-nothing.

650
00:41:03,683 --> 00:41:06,277
You're below my standards.
Even for a one-night pity fuck.

651
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,616
- And I've taken down some real hogs.
- Yeah, hogs, cows, sheep.

652
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:13,224
I bet your sex life is
a regular heavy-petting zoo.

653
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:15,586
You know what?
You're what we call a two-bagger.

654
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:17,819
That means I have to wear
a bag on my head...

655
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:20,361
...just in case
the one on yours breaks.

656
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,492
You sure it's not just a size thing?

657
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:26,534
Because it's gotta be tough standing at
a urinal, pissing on your own testicles.

658
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:28,637
At least I can hide my shame
in my pants.

659
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,536
What really sucks is having an ass...

660
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:34,303
...the size of a miniature
Mediterranean donkey. That suck...

661
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:36,877
- Don't...
- You think that's too big?

662
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,381
You think that's too small?

663
00:41:57,637 --> 00:42:00,197
So you said do nothing,
but I did something, totally small.

664
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:03,567
I sent her a couple hundred bucks
worth of roses and a kick-ass poem.

665
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,606
A few stanzas, no big deal.
Did she call?

666
00:42:06,112 --> 00:42:07,273
No, she didn't.

667
00:42:07,514 --> 00:42:10,347
Dusty, these women, they have
a way of getting into our head.

668
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:12,484
I'm gonna give you
some fresh perspective.

669
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,710
Listen to me.
This girl, I'm getting a hunch.

670
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:17,150
She's built for destruction.
You can't trust her.

671
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:20,383
You know who you have to trust,
Dusty? Each other.

672
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:24,026
Yeah. It's time to let her go.
Maybe get some... You know.

673
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,992
Just let her go. Move on.

674
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:28,597
You want me to move on?

675
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:32,292
Give up. Want me to give up. That's
your big plan? I should just give up?

676
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:35,700
That doesn't quite work for me, okay?
That doesn't quite work for me.

677
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:37,604
I'm not some sort of misogynist...

678
00:42:37,844 --> 00:42:40,972
...that can just swap out women
like they were batteries, okay?

679
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:44,048
I love her, Tank. I care more
about this girl than I do myself.

680
00:42:44,284 --> 00:42:46,616
- You will never understand that.
- It's new to me.

681
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:49,014
She said she wants to be friends.

682
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:52,685
You know what? I'll give her a friend.

683
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:56,156
I'll be the best goddamn friend
she ever had.

684
00:43:27,227 --> 00:43:28,455
Today was a good day for us.

685
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:30,992
We made eye contact,
although I couldn't gauge...

686
00:43:32,465 --> 00:43:33,454
I gotta run.

687
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:46,244
<i>Turn.</i>

688
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:55,545
She's really tough to read.

689
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:57,086
Really tough to read.

690
00:43:57,324 --> 00:44:01,590
I felt like... I felt like
she was a bit distracted.

691
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:06,360
Totally. Hey, can we do this later?

692
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:44,165
It's hot.

693
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:50,501
Where you going?

694
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:16,094
She's seeing someone.

695
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:19,736
Dusty.

696
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:22,464
What are you doing?
You're scaring the shit out of me.

697
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:25,269
Sitting in the dark like a vampire,
you creepy weirdo.

698
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:27,480
She's seeing someone.

699
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:32,140
We don't go out at night.
I get her voice mail after 10.

700
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:34,377
She's seeing someone.

701
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:37,250
- And I'm gonna find out who.
- I'm gonna take back "weirdo."

702
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:39,983
You're giving off more of
a full-blown serial psycho...

703
00:45:40,228 --> 00:45:42,059
...crawlspace-full-of-skin-sombreros
vibe.

704
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,524
Stop. Intervention time.

705
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:46,266
It's time to forget about Alexis.
Look at me, all right?

706
00:45:46,534 --> 00:45:51,197
It's time to wipe the cobwebs
off your cock and stick something.

707
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,334
I don't think she'd be cool with that.

708
00:45:53,573 --> 00:45:57,009
Look at me, please. You definitely...
You don't need her permission.

709
00:45:57,244 --> 00:45:58,370
You need to get laid.

710
00:45:58,612 --> 00:46:01,274
And if you'll listen to me,
I bet I could make that happen.

711
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:04,746
This is one of the most important
things that any man can do.

712
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:06,419
A haircut?

713
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:08,788
Yes, Dusty, a haircut. Look at me.

714
00:46:09,023 --> 00:46:11,287
You look like Chewbacca and
Sasquatch had a baby...

715
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:13,892
...the baby took a shit,
and that shit was blinded...

716
00:46:14,128 --> 00:46:15,755
...moments before styling your hair.

717
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:18,795
- A bit harsh.
- Appointment for Dusty, please.

718
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:20,658
Grab a seat.

719
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:25,070
Great article. I've read that.
Sorry to interrupt.

720
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,864
My associate here is looking for
a stylist he can trust.

721
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:33,307
And this place was recommended to
us by a woman in our prayer group.

722
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:36,347
Well, is he looking
for something simple or?

723
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:39,178
Maybe a what-would-Jesus-'do.

724
00:46:43,024 --> 00:46:45,515
- I'm Hilary.
- Hilary, my name is Tank.

725
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,625
- This is Dustin.
- Hi.

726
00:46:49,664 --> 00:46:52,861
So I've got an $85 haircut
so you could have a meet-cute?

727
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:55,068
Oh, it's $ 110. Worth every penny.

728
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:57,133
In return,
I'm gonna get you a date with...

729
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,033
Let's just call her a confidence booster.
A slow, fat one down the middle.

730
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:02,798
I hope that's a baseball metaphor.

731
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:06,103
This pitch is in your wheelhouse.
Grand slam, upper deck. Game over.

732
00:47:06,347 --> 00:47:08,872
- Hey, beauty queen.
- Hey, I have a question. I'm sorry.

733
00:47:09,116 --> 00:47:11,141
I've got these little...
Is there any way...?

734
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,114
Yeah.

735
00:47:14,288 --> 00:47:15,755
- Shit.
- I'm so sorry.

736
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,322
No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

737
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,290
- Is there any other way we could...?
- Yeah, okay.

738
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:24,963
Guess what.
We're all set for tonight.

739
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,327
Okay, hold still.

740
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:31,862
What about, like, frosting my tips?

741
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:33,299
What are you, a Mini-Wheat?

742
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,408
Listen, this girl's not Alexis.
She's got a bed built for sex...

743
00:47:36,644 --> 00:47:38,703
...not stuffed animals.
- Wait, what?

744
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:41,813
How do you know that Alexis
has stuffed animals on her bed?

745
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:52,292
- Wait.
- Oh, my.

746
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:55,189
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God...

747
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:57,795
This stuff happens in salons.
Sometimes it's fixable.

748
00:47:58,065 --> 00:47:59,930
- Tell him it's fixable.
- I'm gonna throw up.

749
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:01,930
Makeup, little shading,
maybe some glue.

750
00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:03,568
How about an eyebrow toupee?

751
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:05,896
- Where's my eyebrow?
- I don't know what to say.

752
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,007
Oh, God, kill me. Kill me. Kill me!
Where's my eyebrow?

753
00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:10,232
That's a new look.

754
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:13,242
- You can fix it, right?
- Sure, just pop into my DeLorean.

755
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:15,108
- It's in the back.
- Don't be a bitch.

756
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:18,318
- You're the bitch, bitch.
- Hey, gossip girls. Focus on my friend.

757
00:48:18,553 --> 00:48:21,147
- He's follicly deformed.
- Fuck my fucking mother.

758
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:24,916
Let's come up with this... Dusty, unless
one's missing, nobody's gonna notice.

759
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:26,217
Yeah.

760
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,191
- Come here. Come here, sit down.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

761
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:32,889
You gotta be brave, man.

762
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,696
Oh, my God.

763
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,167
- Do it. It's good.
- Come on. It's gonna...

764
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,738
You know what?
I think it's gonna look great.

765
00:48:40,975 --> 00:48:44,274
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's gonna be really hot.

766
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:47,344
- It better be hot.
- Yeah.

767
00:48:50,484 --> 00:48:52,145
Fuck.

768
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:55,582
Bad, bad times.

769
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:59,086
Oh, my fucking shit.

770
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:02,452
I'm coming.

771
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:07,632
Oh, those are lovely.

772
00:49:08,437 --> 00:49:12,203
And I see
you've got a hairstyle change.

773
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,240
- True.
- Claire, he's here.

774
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:18,138
Come on in. She'll be right out.

775
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:24,245
I'm sorry, I was
under the impression that we...

776
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:29,013
Us? No.
Tank said you needed a lay-up.

777
00:49:29,256 --> 00:49:30,814
Are you calling me a lay-up?

778
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:33,390
No. God, no. No.

779
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,090
They told me you were taller.

780
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:42,903
Just for peace of mind,
the father of this child is?

781
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:46,697
In the middle of a brutal divorce
with the mother of this child.

782
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:48,169
Cool.

783
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:50,536
I mean, not cool.
That's not cool. But... But...

784
00:49:50,778 --> 00:49:51,904
Here you go.

785
00:49:52,146 --> 00:49:54,478
Lilies. Thoughtful.

786
00:49:58,185 --> 00:50:00,813
- Sorry.
- I don't wanna give them up.

787
00:50:01,055 --> 00:50:02,454
- Thanks.
- I told you.

788
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,590
My friend said
he was one of the good guys.

789
00:50:04,825 --> 00:50:07,818
I don't know if I would say
I'm one of the...

790
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:11,726
I've been known to be
a bit of a dog sometimes.

791
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:16,093
How cute,
he's trying to convince himself.

792
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:19,033
Oh, no, you're a sweetheart,
and that's okay.

793
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:22,936
I mean, Claire needs someone like you
after the mess she's been through.

794
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:25,475
Someone nice.

795
00:50:25,713 --> 00:50:29,012
Nice is nice.

796
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,649
- Should I take those?
- Oh, yes.

797
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:34,321
I'm sorry, sitter's running a bit late.

798
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:37,286
Can I get you something
to drink, cutie?

799
00:50:40,796 --> 00:50:42,821
- Yeah, actually, as a matter of fact.
- Okay.

800
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:44,532
You can.

801
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,765
I'll have what he's having.

802
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,370
- What the fuck?
- What just happened?

803
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:53,938
- He just said he wants...
- I just, I said...

804
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,336
He looked at Liam,
licked his lips and said:

805
00:50:56,577 --> 00:50:59,011
- "I'll have what he's having."
- Okay, but what I meant...

806
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:01,373
- What does that even mean?
- What does that mean?

807
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:04,243
- I'll ex... Let me explain.
- You want me to lactate for you?

808
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:05,544
- No.
- You want my big...

809
00:51:05,787 --> 00:51:09,484
...life-giving, mothering, nurturing
breasts in your filthy mouth?

810
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:11,893
What's wrong with you?
There's a child here.

811
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:13,754
- She's got a child.
- I see the child.

812
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:15,690
- A child.
- It is a child. I was just...

813
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:17,694
- You wanna breast-feed.
- What?

814
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:19,365
That's what this is.

815
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:23,697
You're some fetishistic monster
who preys on women.

816
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:26,999
- Okay, I was just kidding.
- You're disgusting.

817
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:31,371
I was gonna throw myself at you,
and you...

818
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,307
I was just joking...

819
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:34,912
- Can we just start over?
- Hi.

820
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:38,711
- I just wanna start...
- Sorry, Laney, we don't need a sitter.

821
00:51:38,954 --> 00:51:41,946
Groucho here made a mark
about suckling at my teat...

822
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,351
...and stealing my baby's milk...

823
00:51:44,593 --> 00:51:46,652
...and is consequently leaving.
- Okay.

824
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,056
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay, I'm really sorry.

825
00:51:49,297 --> 00:51:51,492
- I'm just... I'm sorry.
- No. No more. Just get out.

826
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:54,235
- I'm really sorry.
- Go, go.

827
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,870
Come here.

828
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,109
You got shot down...

829
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:07,315
...in a blaze of glory.

830
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,150
You cost me a job, man.

831
00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:14,412
I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.
How much?

832
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:17,386
- Forty... Fifty if it's past 11.
- Okay.

833
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:20,686
Here's 60 for your trouble.
I'm really sorry.

834
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,590
Sweet.

835
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:26,597
Hey, for another 60,
I'll jerk you off in the parking garage.

836
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:31,232
Jesus. Do I really
look that desperate?

837
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:39,008
There's no milk, but I'll let you suck tit
for 5 bucks a minute.

838
00:52:42,484 --> 00:52:44,042
Excuse me.

839
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:14,973
Alexis!

840
00:53:15,217 --> 00:53:17,185
Alexis!

841
00:53:18,186 --> 00:53:19,813
Alexis, I love you!

842
00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:24,223
I love you, Alexis.
I can't just be friends, okay?

843
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,021
Alexis, come to the door.

844
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:31,092
Come on.

845
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,189
- Oh, Dobler.
- Hey, hey.

846
00:53:33,468 --> 00:53:37,303
Hi there. I'm so sorry,
your BFF's upstairs with another guy.

847
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:40,071
Holy shit, what is
going on with your eyebrows?

848
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:44,109
- Seriously, I think there's something...
- I'm sorry. She's got a guy up there?

849
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:47,042
But they're just hanging out, right?
Is she seeing this guy?

850
00:53:47,282 --> 00:53:49,341
No, no, no.
No, no, just an occasional bang.

851
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,984
No, no. God, no. How many times
have they gone out?

852
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,280
- How many times have they...? Not...
- They don't go out ever.

853
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,321
No, he just comes over and
he bangs, and then he leaves.

854
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:00,886
- What?
- You know, she's doing this all for you.

855
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:04,565
Think about it. She's up there with
her knees by her ears, getting railed...

856
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:07,428
...so one day she can settle down
with a nice boy like you.

857
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,136
- I love her. I love her.
- Dustin.

858
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:12,203
- You'd better be ready. I'm serious.
- Alexis.

859
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:14,940
Alexis. Ale...

860
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,079
Dustin, what are you doing here?

861
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,316
- What is he doing here?
- Well, this is my...

862
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,281
It's Tank.

863
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,957
- This is the guy you're with?
- No, I'm not with anyone.

864
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,955
I'm not... We're not together.

865
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:35,891
I mean, no offense, Tank,
but we're not...

866
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:38,757
I told you. I told you that
I was gonna get out there...

867
00:54:39,035 --> 00:54:41,799
...and I was gonna see other people
and I was gonna date...

868
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,938
...and get some experience
under my belt...

869
00:54:44,173 --> 00:54:48,200
...and live my life a little bit. For once
in my life, do something like that...

870
00:54:48,444 --> 00:54:50,639
...and that's exactly what I'm doing.

871
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:55,748
- Should I go?
- Yes.

872
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:57,444
- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no.

873
00:54:57,686 --> 00:54:58,584
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Tank.

874
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,186
- You know what? I'll go.
- No, you don't go, you stay.

875
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,688
I should get going, I have a big day
tomorrow. My roommate's moving out.

876
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:05,894
I have shit to do too.

877
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:07,220
- Really?
- Bye.

878
00:55:07,463 --> 00:55:09,488
- I'll call you later.
- I'll call you later.

879
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,993
- No, after you.
- No, you go.

880
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,962
No, no, please, Tank. You go first.

881
00:55:13,235 --> 00:55:14,759
- All right.
- Fine.

882
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:20,839
- How can I trust you?
- I don't know.

883
00:55:21,077 --> 00:55:24,808
Hey, I wasn't kidding.
You're out by tomorrow morning.

884
00:55:27,216 --> 00:55:28,773
Dusty...

885
00:55:39,028 --> 00:55:40,723
I thought so.

886
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:49,130
So we remember
the words of Betty Friedan:

887
00:55:49,505 --> 00:55:53,601
"A woman has got to be able to say,
and not feel guilty:

888
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:56,669
'Who am I...

889
00:55:57,713 --> 00:56:00,204
...and what do I want out of life?"'

890
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:03,507
That's why my Women's Studies
program will be focused...

891
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:08,315
...on the liberation,
celebration and exploration...

892
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:13,425
...of you...

893
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:18,666
...and you...

894
00:56:21,704 --> 00:56:23,228
...and you.

895
00:56:25,141 --> 00:56:29,043
Enjoy your weekend,
and please try to do so responsibly.

896
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:34,780
The man is Oprah.

897
00:56:39,722 --> 00:56:42,691
Would you all excuse me
for just one second, please?

898
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:49,361
- Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
- Hey, Dad.

899
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:53,666
If there's anything else I can get for
you, I'm always available, professor.

900
00:56:53,903 --> 00:56:58,101
One of my teaching assistants, and
a very hard-working young woman.

901
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:07,876
Last night, I fucked her
within an inch of her life.

902
00:57:08,118 --> 00:57:10,848
True story. I'm jamming
her head through the headboard...

903
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:13,419
...I flip her over, she screams,
"Give me a choker."

904
00:57:13,656 --> 00:57:16,819
I play the choirboy, "What's that?"
Star wipe to five minutes later...

905
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,926
...she's bucking like an epileptic
at a strobe-light convention.

906
00:57:20,162 --> 00:57:21,129
I'm getting scared.

907
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:24,093
As I'm working out the 911 phone call
in my head, she goes:

908
00:57:28,337 --> 00:57:30,305
Like an air bag.

909
00:57:32,775 --> 00:57:34,003
Now, that's a Tuesday night.

910
00:57:34,878 --> 00:57:36,004
You got a good gig, Dad.

911
00:57:37,414 --> 00:57:38,381
How you doing, son?

912
00:57:40,617 --> 00:57:41,584
Dusty kicked me out.

913
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:45,185
In all fairness, I was accidentally
sleeping with his pseudo-girlfriend...

914
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:47,889
...but I feel like shit.

915
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:50,251
Son, let me tell you a story.

916
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,223
December, 1977,
your mother, God rest her soul...

917
00:57:53,462 --> 00:57:55,760
...throws one of her infamous
pot potlucks...

918
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:59,399
...and I find myself sozzled in
the boathouse with your Aunt Francie.

919
00:57:59,668 --> 00:58:02,034
Now today, some might consider her
to be zaftig...

920
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:05,173
...but back then,
she could really hang a sundress.

921
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:08,206
How I yearned for her.

922
00:58:08,445 --> 00:58:11,209
But I refrained because
it was your mother's sister.

923
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:14,417
- I get it. I fucked up.
- No. No.

924
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:17,848
The point is, is that two days later,
I banged the shit out of her...

925
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:21,750
...in the back of a Bonneville while
your mother filled my prescription.

926
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,019
Best Pontiac sex I've ever had.

927
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:28,961
Okay, so you approve?

928
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:35,400
Guilt is just one more thing
trying to asphyxiate us during sex.

929
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,040
You cheat, you feel bad, you watch TV,
you feel better, you cheat again.

930
00:58:48,652 --> 00:58:50,779
All right, you know what?
This girl's different.

931
00:58:51,021 --> 00:58:55,081
She's smart, she's cool,
she's tough, she's a 10.

932
00:58:56,458 --> 00:59:00,417
Ms. Barber, I must apologize
for my son's antiquated phraseology.

933
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:02,961
Out of desperation,
he continues to assess women...

934
00:59:03,232 --> 00:59:04,461
...a base-10 value number...

935
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:06,964
...predicated solely
on their physical countenance.

936
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:08,704
That's...

937
00:59:09,472 --> 00:59:11,906
- That's wrong, Sherman.
- No problem.

938
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:32,424
I moved from numbers a long time ago.
You rarely find a 10 outside of L.A.

939
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:35,722
That's ass-up polyurethane. Really
talking about a one through nine.

940
00:59:35,966 --> 00:59:39,231
It was too constricting.
I'm all about the letters now.

941
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,131
J.

942
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:44,696
She smells like a J.

943
00:59:44,975 --> 00:59:46,306
E over there in the booth.

944
00:59:46,776 --> 00:59:50,303
An E is a 22 on a scale of 26.

945
00:59:50,547 --> 00:59:51,809
It gets easier with practice.

946
00:59:53,984 --> 00:59:56,851
- S.
- Crop-top here, she would be an F.

947
00:59:57,087 --> 01:00:00,523
No, bad skin. She's a G,
maybe an H without the war paint.

948
01:00:00,757 --> 01:00:04,158
But that cougar over there,
Bo Derek with the blue wrap.

949
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:06,157
- She's a solid L.
- Okay, wait a second.

950
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:08,455
That woman is 62,
that wrap is a shawl...

951
01:00:08,698 --> 01:00:11,292
...that L is a Y, and
there's a reason they call them Y's.

952
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:13,195
- Come on.
- Check it.

953
01:00:13,837 --> 01:00:16,704
No, good call, Sherm, good call.

954
01:00:16,973 --> 01:00:18,873
I've gotta get that Lasik.

955
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:22,670
- So you gonna wing me or what?
- What's the game plan?

956
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,646
Being an educator,
I like to stick to the school grades...

957
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,380
...A, B, C and D.
You, on the other hand...

958
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,026
...should stay with the back 13,
thin out the herd.

959
01:00:31,262 --> 01:00:33,230
Thanks, Dad.
I'm off the market right now.

960
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,953
I told you about this girl.
You know, she...

961
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:37,859
The other night, we're making love...

962
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,500
...and we're just
laying there afterwards and...

963
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,171
- Sharing the silence?
- Yeah.

964
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,636
What the fuck is wrong with you?

965
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,672
"Making love"?
What are you, Nora Ephron?

966
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,377
<i>Is this some Redbook interview?</i>

967
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,046
You sound like Liberace's
stylist's boyfriend.

968
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:55,080
"Let's just enjoy the silences
and the caprice together."

969
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,081
- I have no son. I have no son.
- Dad, I dig this girl.

970
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,311
Good, keep talking.
And while you're talking...

971
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,922
...there are cougars on my right
who are clocking us.

972
01:01:03,158 --> 01:01:05,626
- Can you listen?
- Soon as you put on your safari hat...

973
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:09,354
...and grab your gun.
- Dad, can you just stay here with me?

974
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:10,866
Of course I can, son.

975
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,331
Since you fucked my chances with
the "Dad" play. Thanks for projecting.

976
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,437
Not to mention the gay-caress
maneuver for the hearing-impaired.

977
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:20,072
Can't you just be my Dad
for five fucking seconds?

978
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:24,405
Oh, I'm sorry, you want the real
father-son bullshit. Right this way.

979
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:27,809
That girl was dating Dusty,
which means she's out of your league.

980
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,514
She was slumming it, Sherman.

981
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:34,746
"Now, the truth may set you free,
but first it's gonna piss you off."

982
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,458
Gloria Steinem said that.

983
01:01:42,763 --> 01:01:44,958
My son, the booty call.

984
01:01:45,734 --> 01:01:46,996
Thanks for the advice, professor.

985
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,105
Shit.

986
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,856
That was insane.

987
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,801
It was insane, right?

988
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:30,466
It was...

989
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:36,675
Hey, can I have some of that?

990
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:45,081
Who's that guy?

991
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:48,118
That's Greg, he's an old friend.

992
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:51,562
Why?

993
01:02:53,334 --> 01:02:57,065
Just I'm seeing, you know,
his arm's a little low on your hip.

994
01:02:57,638 --> 01:03:02,268
One of his hands is almost near
your ass. You know, for a friend.

995
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:06,139
Did you guys ever hook up? Really?

996
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,405
You're not serious, are you?

997
01:03:10,116 --> 01:03:13,553
No. No, I'm not serious at all.

998
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:18,992
- I mean, you're in a picture with him.
- Oh, my God, you're serious.

999
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,921
Why don't we have a picture?

1000
01:03:24,464 --> 01:03:26,330
I don't know.

1001
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:29,367
- I can fix that. That's easy.
- No, no, no.

1002
01:03:29,603 --> 01:03:32,731
- No, no. I'm naked. I don't want... Tank.
- Yeah. I know, I want that...

1003
01:03:33,006 --> 01:03:34,598
- Come here. You're pushing me.
- Tank.

1004
01:03:34,874 --> 01:03:36,307
- I'm out of the bed.
- I'm serious.

1005
01:03:36,576 --> 01:03:38,602
- Okay.
- That hurt.

1006
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:41,211
- I'm tired.
- That really hurt.

1007
01:03:46,653 --> 01:03:49,383
Stupid idea. It's late.

1008
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,898
I gotta work tomorrow.

1009
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,164
Everybody's gotta work tomorrow.

1010
01:04:08,508 --> 01:04:11,375
You don't want me to stay tonight.

1011
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:15,972
- I just sort of feel like it's...
- Yeah.

1012
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:20,109
Totally understandable.

1013
01:04:21,054 --> 01:04:22,214
Yeah.

1014
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:03,917
Hi.

1015
01:06:04,388 --> 01:06:06,481
What happened to 8?

1016
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:09,887
- Eight's good.
- But you're an hour late.

1017
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:11,827
Can we make it 9?

1018
01:06:12,064 --> 01:06:14,258
I thought you wanted
to get drinks before dinner.

1019
01:06:14,499 --> 01:06:17,798
I did. And I did.

1020
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:20,162
Well, I'm not getting in a car
with you.

1021
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:23,465
Like I tell my students,
even one drink is one drink too many.

1022
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:27,643
No vehicle necessary, teach.
The place we're going is right here.

1023
01:06:27,912 --> 01:06:29,743
It's good. Let's go.

1024
01:06:43,394 --> 01:06:45,624
This is wrong.

1025
01:06:46,763 --> 01:06:48,197
Let's eat.

1026
01:06:48,432 --> 01:06:49,899
Right there.

1027
01:06:53,871 --> 01:06:57,101
I'm starving. I wanted to show you
this too. Look, it's my new T-shirt.

1028
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,240
"My cock plus your pussy equals..."?

1029
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:03,410
- "Good times"?
- That's it.

1030
01:07:03,648 --> 01:07:06,617
Welcome to Cheesus Crust,
where pizza is a religious experience.

1031
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,613
How can I ordain your order?

1032
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:11,719
How is the Pizza of Nazareth?

1033
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:13,890
People worship it.

1034
01:07:16,093 --> 01:07:18,686
- I'm deeply offended.
- Me too.

1035
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:20,157
These prices are outrageous.

1036
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:22,524
Which is why I carry
my Flavor Savior card.

1037
01:07:22,766 --> 01:07:26,863
Fifteen percent off,
all who eat here religiously.

1038
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:30,296
Do you think this is funny?

1039
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:35,101
Good night.

1040
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,276
- You people are sinners!
- You should have thought of that...

1041
01:07:39,516 --> 01:07:42,849
...19 years ago before you stopped
my mom from going into that clinic.

1042
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:44,781
Have a blessed day.

1043
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:49,686
Fastest ever.

1044
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:15,909
Even Jesus had to eat.

1045
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,746
- Don't.
- It was a bad date.

1046
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:23,617
Well, it was supposed to be
a nice night out.

1047
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:26,487
You know, my last boyfriend
never took me anywhere.

1048
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,196
Ever.

1049
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,161
He'd text me late at night
to come hang out at his place...

1050
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:34,631
...like he was ashamed
to be seen with me in public.

1051
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:38,635
- Please don't cry. Wait. Please?
- I'd make excuses for him, you know?

1052
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:40,842
He's not using me, I'm using him.

1053
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:45,137
- And I'm in total control...
- Total control and it's not that serious.

1054
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:47,008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1055
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:48,443
But when that phone rang...

1056
01:08:48,684 --> 01:08:51,084
...my heart leapt, and I was there.
- Totally.

1057
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,087
And now I finally get the chance to
go out on a real date and it's with you.

1058
01:08:55,325 --> 01:08:59,283
- I know, that sucks.
- No, you suck.

1059
01:08:59,528 --> 01:09:02,861
I do. I do suck.

1060
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,826
I suck.

1061
01:09:09,071 --> 01:09:11,904
You must be hungry. Let's go eat.

1062
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:20,076
My senior year, I take this girl
on a date... Horrible, date from hell.

1063
01:09:20,316 --> 01:09:23,285
About a week later, this frat boy
comes up and he says to me:

1064
01:09:23,519 --> 01:09:26,009
"Only you could make me look good."

1065
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:29,420
All right? I laughed...

1066
01:09:29,657 --> 01:09:33,617
...until one of his buddies
then came to me and was like:

1067
01:09:33,862 --> 01:09:35,989
"Can you help me with my ex?"

1068
01:09:36,231 --> 01:09:39,291
- Tank was born.
- Yeah. Yeah, really.

1069
01:09:43,338 --> 01:09:46,637
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

1070
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,307
But...

1071
01:09:49,777 --> 01:09:50,937
...do you enjoy it?

1072
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:53,409
I'm good at it.
I'm good at being an asshole.

1073
01:09:54,282 --> 01:09:55,909
It's what I do.

1074
01:09:56,517 --> 01:09:59,316
- You're like the anti-Cupid.
- More like the Antichrist.

1075
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:03,157
Sorry.

1076
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:06,587
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1077
01:10:07,527 --> 01:10:10,588
You know, in a cruel, twisted way...

1078
01:10:10,865 --> 01:10:13,390
...you give couples a second chance.

1079
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,101
You're a closet romantic.

1080
01:10:15,903 --> 01:10:18,701
- I don't know about that.
- You are.

1081
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:21,501
You know you have to
confront this girl, Alexis.

1082
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:23,744
I can't.

1083
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,268
I can't.

1084
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,209
If you don't do this,
she will never take you seriously.

1085
01:10:29,449 --> 01:10:32,350
You need to march up there
and tell her how you feel.

1086
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:34,678
Alexis.

1087
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:39,086
Alexis, it's Tank.

1088
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,892
Yeah.

1089
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,098
I'm just gonna say this.
I'm gonna say it.

1090
01:10:46,334 --> 01:10:49,700
If you value this, us, we...

1091
01:10:49,936 --> 01:10:53,736
...then you will let me take you
on a proper date.

1092
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:55,737
- In public.
- It's 2 a.m. in the morning.

1093
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,739
Can we do the proper date
another time?

1094
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:02,948
- Tomorrow.
- Yes.

1095
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:04,674
Proper date. In public.

1096
01:11:05,353 --> 01:11:06,342
- Get some...
- Good night.

1097
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:08,748
- Good night.
- Nice shirt.

1098
01:11:25,973 --> 01:11:27,372
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1099
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,136
This is for you.
Have to have a corsage.

1100
01:11:33,379 --> 01:11:35,574
Oh, my God.

1101
01:11:35,815 --> 01:11:39,115
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

1102
01:11:40,253 --> 01:11:42,312
I never went to prom.

1103
01:11:42,556 --> 01:11:44,183
I remember.

1104
01:11:46,993 --> 01:11:49,018
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1105
01:11:56,035 --> 01:11:58,697
She's got a shank. You might
wanna actually focus on her.

1106
01:11:58,871 --> 01:12:02,034
- They're with me, okay? Thanks.
- Alexis, this is Hilary, our chaperon.

1107
01:12:02,274 --> 01:12:04,766
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1108
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:06,546
<i>Thank you.</i>

1109
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,377
You two kids have fun.

1110
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,288
I'm having fun.

1111
01:12:16,522 --> 01:12:20,253
Let's set the stage here.
You're 17 years old.

1112
01:12:20,493 --> 01:12:23,291
As you make the mistake of
heading out onto the dance floor...

1113
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:25,588
...a fine, young chap
stops you on your way...

1114
01:12:25,865 --> 01:12:28,562
Strikingly handsome. Some
would say ruggedly good-looking.

1115
01:12:28,835 --> 01:12:31,736
He stops you and says, "Excuse me,
would you care to dance?"

1116
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,873
- Don't tell me you dance.
- Me?

1117
01:12:35,107 --> 01:12:36,131
Never.

1118
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:41,238
Oh, my God.

1119
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:45,014
- Oh, my God.
- That's it. That's all I've got, really.

1120
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:51,982
No way.

1121
01:12:57,296 --> 01:12:58,285
For you.

1122
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,057
- Let's go.
- No, I can't...

1123
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:05,063
You're making this embarrassing-
myself-to-be-cute thing really difficult.

1124
01:13:05,303 --> 01:13:06,703
Look at this, check it out.

1125
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:12,802
- Did you see that little move?
- I saw it. I wanna see more over here.

1126
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:40,695
I got caught up.

1127
01:14:05,262 --> 01:14:07,355
- Hi.
- Hey.

1128
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:33,119
Hey.

1129
01:14:37,462 --> 01:14:38,952
Fun, huh?

1130
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,527
Yeah.

1131
01:14:44,635 --> 01:14:47,069
You know you could have
any girl out there, right?

1132
01:14:48,171 --> 01:14:51,163
Hey, dude, look at me.

1133
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:52,602
Look at this.

1134
01:14:52,843 --> 01:14:54,708
It's not about
what you look like, man.

1135
01:14:54,945 --> 01:14:56,003
It's right here, okay?

1136
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:59,545
It's attitude, it's how you look at them.
Pretend you don't give a shit...

1137
01:14:59,784 --> 01:15:03,220
...they will be on you like acne.
Guaranteed or your money back.

1138
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:08,758
So, then, like, why have you been
such a kiss-ass to your girl all night?

1139
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:10,982
Pulling out chairs,
throwing out compliments.

1140
01:15:11,227 --> 01:15:15,494
I'm on a different plan. You're on a...
What you... What l...

1141
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:18,132
"Can I wipe your ass, baby?"

1142
01:15:18,535 --> 01:15:21,834
I was trying to help you, but fuck you.

1143
01:15:22,072 --> 01:15:23,300
Fuck you, you hypocrite.

1144
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:26,100
"Hey nerd, let me give you
some condescending advice."

1145
01:15:26,343 --> 01:15:27,401
Be cruel to women?

1146
01:15:27,644 --> 01:15:29,271
Fat, pathetic, sad dork.

1147
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:32,481
- Old man at a high-school prom.
- Husky bitch.

1148
01:15:35,518 --> 01:15:38,352
Don't get ahead of yourself here.
And I'm just curious...

1149
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:40,886
...but are you seeing anybody?
- No.

1150
01:15:41,124 --> 01:15:42,819
No?

1151
01:15:43,026 --> 01:15:45,085
- Are you?
- No.

1152
01:15:45,395 --> 01:15:47,794
What about that awkward night
with that guy?

1153
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,156
You still calling him?

1154
01:15:49,665 --> 01:15:51,827
He kind of disappeared.

1155
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:54,164
I haven't heard from him since he quit.

1156
01:15:54,403 --> 01:15:56,803
Maybe you could call him. You know?

1157
01:15:57,039 --> 01:15:59,530
See how he's holding up kind of thing.

1158
01:16:00,009 --> 01:16:02,239
- What?
- Or don't.

1159
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:05,039
It's... It's your choice.
I mean, I'm just saying...

1160
01:16:05,282 --> 01:16:08,307
- No, I know. It's sweet.
- Polite.

1161
01:16:09,485 --> 01:16:13,251
Even if it is a part of your whole show
that you've got going on tonight.

1162
01:16:13,589 --> 01:16:16,183
You're pulling out all the stops.

1163
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:19,557
Sweet Tank.
Sweet Tank is way into me.

1164
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:26,661
You know what, though?
You're right. I should call him.

1165
01:16:29,004 --> 01:16:30,904
I should call him.

1166
01:16:36,112 --> 01:16:37,635
I think I'll say good night.

1167
01:16:37,879 --> 01:16:39,870
- Yes, I will be going.
- Wait, what?

1168
01:16:40,115 --> 01:16:41,549
Good night.

1169
01:16:42,518 --> 01:16:44,418
I got what I wanted. A real first date.

1170
01:16:44,653 --> 01:16:47,281
Although this may be the worst
possible time to admit it...

1171
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:50,582
...l'm not good at the no-sex thing.
So I'll see you later.

1172
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:53,385
Hey, if you insist on celibacy...

1173
01:16:53,662 --> 01:16:56,495
...do you think we can have
our second official date on July 7?

1174
01:16:56,732 --> 01:16:58,427
Because my sister is getting married.

1175
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:01,533
And it would be great...

1176
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:04,033
...if you'd come with me.

1177
01:17:04,773 --> 01:17:07,174
Yes, I can do that.
But I'm gonna walk away...

1178
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,605
...because...
- You're missing out.

1179
01:17:10,746 --> 01:17:13,236
After a while, crocodile.

1180
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:22,451
You know, it was really cool
of you to call, Alexis.

1181
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:25,659
Lunch, wedding errands.
Just like old times, huh?

1182
01:17:25,927 --> 01:17:28,896
I haven't seen you since I took
my leave of absence from work.

1183
01:17:29,164 --> 01:17:30,597
Yeah, I heard you quit.

1184
01:17:30,865 --> 01:17:34,357
Oh, no, no, no, I just...
I took a sabbatical. A sabbatical.

1185
01:17:34,602 --> 01:17:36,502
I just wanted to do
some soul-searching.

1186
01:17:44,312 --> 01:17:47,179
- My sister picked it out.
- Well, you should thank her.

1187
01:17:47,415 --> 01:17:50,282
- The whole world should thank her.
- Well, you're welcome.

1188
01:17:50,518 --> 01:17:52,918
- Speaking of the devil.
- Oh, my gosh.

1189
01:17:53,154 --> 01:17:55,087
I love it. I love it so much.

1190
01:17:55,322 --> 01:17:57,314
This is my friend, Dustin.
This is my sister.

1191
01:17:57,559 --> 01:17:58,685
- Oh, hi.
- No. Get over here.

1192
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,689
- What?
- Congratulations.

1193
01:18:00,962 --> 01:18:03,157
Alexis will not shut up about you,
the wedding...

1194
01:18:03,398 --> 01:18:05,763
That was really smart.
That was so smart, yeah.

1195
01:18:05,999 --> 01:18:08,058
See, I brought mine too. Hi.

1196
01:18:08,302 --> 01:18:12,569
It's really the only opinion
that means anything these days.

1197
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:13,865
Oh, my gosh.

1198
01:18:14,675 --> 01:18:16,870
You have to see my dress.
Great, now.

1199
01:18:20,147 --> 01:18:22,013
- Yeah, I did it when...
- Alexis, I'm sorry.

1200
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,912
I'm the...
I'm the dress-shopping gay pal?

1201
01:18:25,153 --> 01:18:27,712
I just think that now's
not the time to set her straight.

1202
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:29,513
She's a little crazy, she's manic.

1203
01:18:29,756 --> 01:18:32,088
I get that we're in slow-down mode...

1204
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:34,453
...but I'm not gonna, like,
meet your parents...

1205
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:38,129
...under the pretext of the gay friend.
I mean, that's ridic...

1206
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:41,732
What? No, I don't mean "meet
your parents" meet your parents.

1207
01:18:41,969 --> 01:18:45,029
I just mean at the wedding,
I'm sure I'll casually bump into them...

1208
01:18:45,272 --> 01:18:47,468
- That's... What?
- I'm sorry, excuse me one second.

1209
01:18:47,709 --> 01:18:49,369
- Dustin, you need to...
- What? What?

1210
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:52,408
Yeah, what? What is it? What?
Is something wrong?

1211
01:18:52,646 --> 01:18:56,275
- Do you not want me to come?
- You've got it all...

1212
01:18:56,517 --> 01:19:00,009
- You... You don't want me to?
- Wrong.

1213
01:19:00,254 --> 01:19:02,688
Yeah, no. No.

1214
01:19:02,923 --> 01:19:05,255
- Totally. You know what? Sorry.
- Dustin, I have to...

1215
01:19:05,526 --> 01:19:08,120
- That was presumptuous.
- Promise me you won't be upset...

1216
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,659
...if I tell you something.
- Yeah, what?

1217
01:19:11,197 --> 01:19:13,098
I'm seeing somebody.

1218
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:17,667
And so I asked him
to come with me to the wedding.

1219
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,764
- You're... You're upset.
- No. What?

1220
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:24,973
Upset? No. Why would I be upset?

1221
01:19:25,312 --> 01:19:27,337
Come on. That's crazy.

1222
01:19:27,581 --> 01:19:30,982
Like I'm a guy that gets upset.
Come on. More like happy.

1223
01:19:31,218 --> 01:19:33,515
You know? I'm happy that...
That, you know.

1224
01:19:33,753 --> 01:19:36,916
- That you found someone special.
- It still feels a little short.

1225
01:19:37,156 --> 01:19:38,852
I still think that if you put the...

1226
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:40,854
- So, dish.
- I just wanna make sure my...

1227
01:19:41,127 --> 01:19:42,788
Who is he?

1228
01:19:43,062 --> 01:19:46,964
Yeah, I think that's too much shoe.

1229
01:19:48,434 --> 01:19:51,871
Man-ischewitz, Sherman,
look at you.

1230
01:19:52,105 --> 01:19:54,335
You remind me of me
on my wedding day.

1231
01:19:54,575 --> 01:19:57,805
I was one nasty son of a bitch.

1232
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:02,079
- Dad, why did Mom marry you?
- Who makes this tux? Versace?

1233
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:04,875
- Pop, come on. Fess up. Dad.
- Where'd you get this tux?

1234
01:20:05,117 --> 01:20:07,984
- The black on black.
- Come on, Dad, really.

1235
01:20:10,356 --> 01:20:12,153
Your mother was
an incredible woman...

1236
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:16,157
...but she had awful judgment.

1237
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:18,829
She was always trying to
find the better man inside me.

1238
01:20:19,098 --> 01:20:23,261
Unfortunately, she found him
inside of her psychotherapist, Janine.

1239
01:20:23,768 --> 01:20:24,735
Not good.

1240
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:28,805
See, I always knew that your mom was
the best it was ever gonna get for me.

1241
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:32,033
And I never asked the more
important question, which is:

1242
01:20:32,278 --> 01:20:34,371
Was I the best it was
ever gonna get for her?

1243
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:40,577
You're not so bad, Pop.

1244
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:47,158
I'm a fraud, Sherman. Yeah.

1245
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:49,656
And I'm a selfish asshole.

1246
01:20:56,235 --> 01:20:58,135
And so are you.

1247
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:01,334
So I want you to get out there...

1248
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:05,104
...and I want you to revel in it.

1249
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:28,161
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

1250
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:30,390
- You are hot as a pistol.
- You look handsome.

1251
01:21:30,634 --> 01:21:33,536
- No, you. I am very...
- I am so impressed with you.

1252
01:21:33,772 --> 01:21:35,967
...impressed. You look beautiful.

1253
01:21:36,574 --> 01:21:39,441
- Do you like the red lipstick?
- I wanna do you right here.

1254
01:21:39,678 --> 01:21:41,703
Okay, I gotta go... Josh.

1255
01:21:41,946 --> 01:21:45,438
My future brother-in-law. Josh,
I want you to meet my boyfriend, Tank.

1256
01:21:45,684 --> 01:21:47,412
Hey, Josh. I'll be your groom...

1257
01:21:47,651 --> 01:21:50,245
<i>...in today's performance of
Fuck Me, I'm Getting Married.</i>

1258
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:53,354
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
tame Bridezilla.

1259
01:21:53,624 --> 01:21:56,753
- You want me to come? Lex?
- No, I'll look out for him. All right?

1260
01:21:57,028 --> 01:21:59,496
- Just breathe for a second, all right?
- I am breathing.

1261
01:21:59,764 --> 01:22:00,924
Now adapt.

1262
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,497
- Are we adapting?
- Yeah.

1263
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:04,463
Are we ready to evolve?

1264
01:22:04,703 --> 01:22:07,364
You let fly one word
about our arrangement...

1265
01:22:07,604 --> 01:22:09,629
...I will crush your nuts into butter.

1266
01:22:09,873 --> 01:22:12,740
Like the kind at the health-food store,
but not so good for you.

1267
01:22:12,976 --> 01:22:15,171
But... But, but...

1268
01:22:15,646 --> 01:22:19,047
...you play ball, I will plant your flag
right next to mine. All right?

1269
01:22:19,283 --> 01:22:21,912
I will make you family.
And believe me, Tank...

1270
01:22:22,153 --> 01:22:24,451
...you wanna be family.

1271
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,455
- Money.
- Jesus Christ.

1272
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,954
Like, "money" money.

1273
01:22:30,193 --> 01:22:32,627
Old money, new money,
fuck-me money, fuck-you money.

1274
01:22:32,862 --> 01:22:34,194
Family money, money.

1275
01:22:34,431 --> 01:22:37,491
Okay, yeah.
Josh, you got me all wrong.

1276
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:40,898
No. I know exactly
who you are, all right?

1277
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:43,902
It's Alexis who's got you all wrong.

1278
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:46,702
Let's do what we do, brother.
Hey, Merrilee.

1279
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:49,709
- Brian.
- Now, I've told you, fella...

1280
01:22:49,947 --> 01:22:52,073
...from here on out,
it's strictly Mom and Dad.

1281
01:22:52,315 --> 01:22:55,148
I'd like to introduce you to
your next son-in-law, Tank Turner.

1282
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:57,011
This is Alexis' guy.

1283
01:22:57,253 --> 01:23:00,451
- I've heard so much about you.
- That is unfortunate.

1284
01:23:00,724 --> 01:23:02,419
Forget it all.

1285
01:23:02,693 --> 01:23:04,285
- Tank.
- Hi.

1286
01:23:07,664 --> 01:23:11,122
Tank Turner is an asshole.

1287
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:14,703
- You brought Satan to my wedding?
- Well, he's changed.

1288
01:23:14,937 --> 01:23:16,996
Or he's going to change.
Or he's changing.

1289
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,366
No.

1290
01:23:18,608 --> 01:23:21,099
I'm sorry, but that is not enough.

1291
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:24,040
Okay, maybe he's this fun vacation
on the dark side...

1292
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,772
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel,
I'm falling in love with him.

1293
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:28,615
What?

1294
01:23:29,753 --> 01:23:31,311
I love him.

1295
01:23:41,164 --> 01:23:43,530
- Hey, so...
- So many things that I want...

1296
01:23:43,766 --> 01:23:45,495
Oh, come here.

1297
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:55,274
- I gotta go. I'm going. I'm leaving.
- Go.

1298
01:24:15,965 --> 01:24:18,728
Are you the best
it's ever gonna get for her?

1299
01:24:29,912 --> 01:24:31,402
Are you?

1300
01:25:46,487 --> 01:25:49,888
If anyone here can show just cause
why these two should not be joined...

1301
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:55,185
...let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

1302
01:25:55,496 --> 01:25:57,226
White dress.

1303
01:25:57,999 --> 01:26:00,263
Chick's seen more dick than this guy.

1304
01:26:01,568 --> 01:26:03,229
Ridonculous.

1305
01:26:08,509 --> 01:26:13,003
I've been wanting to come over here
because I was reminded of a joke.

1306
01:26:13,714 --> 01:26:16,945
A priest and a Rabbi are at a wedding.
Who knew?

1307
01:26:17,518 --> 01:26:21,478
And they see a small boy
bending over to tie his shoe.

1308
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:23,882
So the priest says to the Rabbi:

1309
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:26,217
"God, I'd really love to screw that kid."

1310
01:26:26,493 --> 01:26:30,053
And then the Rabbi says,
"Out of what?"

1311
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:34,899
It's a visual thing,
because the kid is basically like this.

1312
01:26:35,135 --> 01:26:36,261
He's bending over.

1313
01:26:38,539 --> 01:26:40,234
Dirty Houdini. You gotta try this.

1314
01:26:40,474 --> 01:26:44,034
While you're giving it
to your lady from behind, okay?

1315
01:26:44,277 --> 01:26:46,040
Very important.
You gotta be behind her.

1316
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,544
Start making some sounds
like you're gonna bust...

1317
01:26:48,782 --> 01:26:49,908
...then you pull out.

1318
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:53,346
As you pull out, you let a little dribble
of saliva trickle down...

1319
01:26:53,619 --> 01:26:56,645
...onto the small of her back.
She thinks it's over, she flips over:

1320
01:26:56,923 --> 01:26:58,254
"Good, I can go to sleep."

1321
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:00,722
Fireman's hose. All over.

1322
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:07,231
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

1323
01:27:07,467 --> 01:27:10,493
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go ask your mom. Right there. Pound.

1324
01:27:16,976 --> 01:27:18,136
Ready, and wow.

1325
01:27:19,579 --> 01:27:21,513
It's like lifting a coffin.

1326
01:27:22,949 --> 01:27:25,544
Oh, Nana. You have a lead vagina.

1327
01:27:30,356 --> 01:27:32,187
Hello? Yeah, I can talk.

1328
01:27:37,663 --> 01:27:39,790
- You weren't gonna drink.
- Can't have a glass...

1329
01:27:40,033 --> 01:27:41,591
...to celebrate the holy sacrament?

1330
01:27:41,834 --> 01:27:43,927
- Is that Jägermeister I smell?
- I don't know.

1331
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,933
Wine, huh?

1332
01:27:47,873 --> 01:27:49,432
- No.
- Don't get into any trouble.

1333
01:27:49,675 --> 01:27:52,303
- I'm don't-ing. I'm don't-ing.
- Don't get into any trouble.

1334
01:28:01,153 --> 01:28:03,418
For their first dance
as a married couple...

1335
01:28:03,656 --> 01:28:08,150
...l'd like to present to you
Rachel and Josh.

1336
01:28:20,605 --> 01:28:21,663
Sorry.

1337
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:24,438
Can I have this dance?

1338
01:28:24,676 --> 01:28:25,904
Not a good time? Okay.

1339
01:28:26,144 --> 01:28:30,604
Sorry, everybody. This is their night.
I'll clean that up. It's the chicken.

1340
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:33,515
The bride and groom.

1341
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:42,692
I'm gonna grab these. Clean.
I washed them after I threw up.

1342
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:45,658
How are you? There's
a lot of talent here tonight, okay?

1343
01:28:45,897 --> 01:28:49,628
Lookit, lookit that one right over there.
Check out the lungs on that one.

1344
01:28:50,068 --> 01:28:52,559
That's Rachel's cousin. She's 15.

1345
01:28:52,804 --> 01:28:54,897
She's gonna be a scuba diver
when she grows up.

1346
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,131
Not that you don't have
some stuff going on.

1347
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,809
I'd part you like the Red Sea
and let you call me Moses.

1348
01:29:00,045 --> 01:29:02,512
I would open you up like
a public pool on Memorial Day.

1349
01:29:02,746 --> 01:29:04,611
Three words:

1350
01:29:04,883 --> 01:29:06,350
Let's eat.

1351
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:08,952
It's okay, I got the sleeve. I caught it.

1352
01:29:09,187 --> 01:29:11,655
Usually they come in twos
and threes, so that's...

1353
01:29:14,358 --> 01:29:16,826
Cocaine, you know,
just kind of gets me sneezy.

1354
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:20,088
And you, by the way, look lovely.
I just wanted to...

1355
01:29:20,332 --> 01:29:22,926
...say a hello to you.

1356
01:29:27,304 --> 01:29:28,794
All right.

1357
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:36,011
Weddings get me hot and hard,
know what I'm saying?

1358
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:37,874
What do you got going on?

1359
01:29:38,115 --> 01:29:40,583
I want that in my fucking mouth.

1360
01:29:44,022 --> 01:29:45,819
When's the last time
you shit your pants?

1361
01:29:46,056 --> 01:29:48,786
- Today. Today.
- You shit your pants today?

1362
01:29:49,026 --> 01:29:52,086
- I shit my pants yesterday.
- Today!

1363
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:55,126
- Me, today.
- Just a little. But not a whole shit.

1364
01:29:55,366 --> 01:29:59,166
Hey. Hey, Alexis sent me
to look for you, so let's go.

1365
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:02,061
Let me just take a snapshot
of you in my mind right now.

1366
01:30:02,306 --> 01:30:05,002
Gross. Fuck, I can
smell you from here, dude.

1367
01:30:05,242 --> 01:30:08,609
- How drunk are you right now?
- I had massive amounts of alcohol.

1368
01:30:08,846 --> 01:30:11,440
I'm embarrassed.
But I'm sobering up now...

1369
01:30:11,682 --> 01:30:13,616
...and I feel better.
Having a little chat.

1370
01:30:13,851 --> 01:30:17,251
With my friend.
Taking a breather. Breathing.

1371
01:30:19,222 --> 01:30:21,919
Fucking goddamn it.
What do you call that shit, A. J?

1372
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,684
Afghani-Kush Kryptonite.

1373
01:30:24,929 --> 01:30:28,262
Kryptonite. It killed Superman.
I'm just a man.

1374
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:31,729
You really are, like, a super
special kind of asshole, aren't you?

1375
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:33,869
I ride the special-kind-of-asshole bus.

1376
01:30:34,104 --> 01:30:36,197
- Do you really?
- All right. Okay.

1377
01:30:37,007 --> 01:30:39,065
- One more bite.
- What are you doing?

1378
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,800
Alexis is gonna freak out
when she sees this.

1379
01:30:42,045 --> 01:30:43,171
- No she won't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1380
01:30:43,413 --> 01:30:45,176
- She's understanding.
- Oh, my God, dude.

1381
01:30:45,448 --> 01:30:48,418
- She's never gonna forgive you.
- All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1382
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:51,919
- What a day.
- Yeah.

1383
01:30:53,389 --> 01:30:55,755
May I partake?

1384
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:59,351
My daughter got married today.

1385
01:30:59,596 --> 01:31:03,054
- Wonderful.
- Oh, God, I feel old.

1386
01:31:03,299 --> 01:31:08,737
I bet back in the day, you were
one hot slice of fuckberry pie.

1387
01:31:12,076 --> 01:31:15,738
You bet your sweet ass I was.

1388
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:20,474
Hey. I love your shoes.

1389
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,318
So are we gonna do this or what?

1390
01:31:25,622 --> 01:31:26,816
Come on, it's not gonna
suck itself, Mama.

1391
01:31:27,924 --> 01:31:29,949
Oh, my God.

1392
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:32,354
Who is this guy?

1393
01:31:34,163 --> 01:31:36,563
And he's ruining my entire wedding.

1394
01:31:36,799 --> 01:31:39,893
He ruined my dance,
my actual dance.

1395
01:31:40,136 --> 01:31:43,400
No, it's ruined.
And... Why did you bring him here?

1396
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:45,402
It's disgusting.

1397
01:31:47,309 --> 01:31:50,768
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1398
01:31:51,014 --> 01:31:53,881
- Are you kidding me?
- He really?

1399
01:31:56,653 --> 01:31:59,416
I got a bass-ackward way of
showing it, but I care about you.

1400
01:31:59,655 --> 01:32:02,385
Tank. Tank! How could you?!

1401
01:32:02,991 --> 01:32:05,653
My ex, Sarah. Cunt.

1402
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,423
Oh, no. You're not gonna
walk away from me.

1403
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:11,462
You're gonna talk to me.
This is insane.

1404
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,759
Who is that person, huh?
Who is that guy?

1405
01:32:14,002 --> 01:32:16,528
This is me. I'm an asshole.

1406
01:32:16,773 --> 01:32:19,434
You had your chance with a good guy
and you threw it away.

1407
01:32:19,675 --> 01:32:20,937
- Who?
- Dustin.

1408
01:32:21,176 --> 01:32:24,201
- You have no right to tell me...
- No, Dustin. Dustin's here.

1409
01:32:24,445 --> 01:32:26,413
Dustin. Dustin?

1410
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:27,774
- Dustin?
- Be careful.

1411
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,813
Tank!

1412
01:32:40,029 --> 01:32:41,586
It's time you all knew the truth.

1413
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:44,730
Would you stop? If I go down,
you're coming with me, okay?

1414
01:32:44,965 --> 01:32:49,095
Okay? So I'm sure every...

1415
01:32:50,004 --> 01:32:50,971
Don't touch.

1416
01:32:52,374 --> 01:32:55,309
I would like to share something
with you about Mr. Tank Turner.

1417
01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:58,308
Surely by now he's charmed his way
into your hearts... Stop.

1418
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:01,549
Charmed his way into your hearts
but I've got something to tell you.

1419
01:33:01,817 --> 01:33:03,613
Tank Turner is a fraud.

1420
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:05,649
Okay? Why don't you
take a walk with me?

1421
01:33:05,886 --> 01:33:08,753
- Hey! Come with me, okay?
- Dustin.

1422
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:11,514
Would you guys like to know
what this man...? Excuse me.

1423
01:33:11,759 --> 01:33:14,057
- What this man does as a hobby?
- Stop.

1424
01:33:14,295 --> 01:33:17,163
- You stop! You stop! Okay?
- Please.

1425
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:18,366
- Hold on.
- I'm sorry.

1426
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,161
Let's say, for example...

1427
01:33:22,404 --> 01:33:25,770
...I get dumped by my girl.

1428
01:33:26,006 --> 01:33:30,340
And I want to pay him
to go out with her...

1429
01:33:30,578 --> 01:33:32,842
- Oh, boy.
...terrorize her...

1430
01:33:33,114 --> 01:33:37,050
...and have her come screaming back
into my arms.

1431
01:33:37,318 --> 01:33:39,616
So your Mr. Perfect...

1432
01:33:39,854 --> 01:33:41,082
Your Mr. Perfect...

1433
01:33:41,322 --> 01:33:47,420
...is actually Mr. Asshole-
Dickhead-Shitface-Guy, okay?

1434
01:33:48,495 --> 01:33:52,556
Alexis, l... l...
I loved you so much.

1435
01:33:52,799 --> 01:33:57,430
I did. And I just,
I couldn't bear to lose you...

1436
01:33:57,671 --> 01:34:02,233
...and so I made a deal
with the devil.

1437
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:06,276
That's what I did. Which is pathetic.

1438
01:34:06,547 --> 01:34:07,981
- I'm a pathetic fool.
- Yeah, okay.

1439
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:11,547
- But... But what does that make him?
- Okay, stop. Stop it.

1440
01:34:11,785 --> 01:34:14,481
Just tell me this isn't true.

1441
01:34:17,123 --> 01:34:18,988
Ask him.

1442
01:34:20,093 --> 01:34:21,527
- Baby, sorry.
- You make me sick.

1443
01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:24,856
- Ask him.
- I hate you.

1444
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:28,028
- Ask him.
- I'm gonna kill you!

1445
01:34:28,269 --> 01:34:30,100
I'm gonna kill you!

1446
01:34:30,337 --> 01:34:32,701
- I work on referrals.
- Okay.

1447
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:36,567
You're honestly gonna tell me...

1448
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:41,612
...that you and I, that's nothing?

1449
01:34:42,148 --> 01:34:43,843
That's nothing?

1450
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:48,150
I'm just a job?

1451
01:34:49,156 --> 01:34:53,318
I need you to tell me.
Tank, tell me right now...

1452
01:34:53,559 --> 01:34:55,550
...that I'm just a job.

1453
01:34:55,794 --> 01:34:59,561
- Tell me to my face.
- You're just a job.

1454
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,569
Just a job.

1455
01:35:06,806 --> 01:35:09,570
I never wanna see you again.

1456
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,169
Yeah.

1457
01:35:12,413 --> 01:35:14,675
Alexis. Alexis.

1458
01:35:14,947 --> 01:35:16,847
I'm gonna kill you!

1459
01:35:46,745 --> 01:35:48,646
Motherfucker.

1460
01:36:09,635 --> 01:36:12,263
<i>You have one new message.</i>

1461
01:36:13,272 --> 01:36:15,207
<i>Dust, you were right.</i>

1462
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:17,499
<i>Alexis is an angel...</i>

1463
01:36:17,743 --> 01:36:20,575
<i>... and she deserves the best.</i>

1464
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:24,340
<i>And that's you.
So I'm sorry it took so long...</i>

1465
01:36:24,615 --> 01:36:27,176
<i>... but I finally did
what you hired me to do.</i>

1466
01:36:27,419 --> 01:36:30,149
<i>I got a bass-ackward way of
showing it, but I care about you.</i>

1467
01:36:30,389 --> 01:36:33,358
<i>Tank. Tank! How could you?!</i>

1468
01:36:33,592 --> 01:36:36,117
<i>My ex, Sarah. Cunt.</i>

1469
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:10,852
Did you love her?

1470
01:37:11,095 --> 01:37:13,586
Do you love her?
That's all I wanna know.

1471
01:37:15,099 --> 01:37:17,261
I don't even know what that means.

1472
01:37:17,502 --> 01:37:20,493
Yeah. Well, apparently, neither do I.

1473
01:37:20,871 --> 01:37:23,499
All I know is that me and her
ends up with her hurt.

1474
01:37:23,741 --> 01:37:25,106
It's inevitable.

1475
01:37:25,343 --> 01:37:27,867
Turners and women, right, Pop?

1476
01:37:28,144 --> 01:37:29,442
Yeah.

1477
01:37:31,616 --> 01:37:33,880
I banged a lot of women, Sherman.

1478
01:37:34,619 --> 01:37:36,519
I've been banging
since back in the day...

1479
01:37:36,754 --> 01:37:39,279
...when you were
laminating pictures of them.

1480
01:37:39,523 --> 01:37:41,616
So, yeah, that's me.

1481
01:37:42,259 --> 01:37:45,228
That's this guy, but that ain't you.
No.

1482
01:37:45,463 --> 01:37:48,863
Last night, you proved something
that I have long feared.

1483
01:37:49,099 --> 01:37:50,657
And that is...

1484
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,061
...you may just
take after your mother.

1485
01:37:54,939 --> 01:37:58,670
Yeah, I can't believe you actually
tried to give Alexis up for me.

1486
01:37:59,276 --> 01:38:00,402
I know, dude.

1487
01:38:00,678 --> 01:38:02,543
- That's pretty fucked up, right?
- Yeah.

1488
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,804
I mean, if that's not love...

1489
01:38:05,649 --> 01:38:07,584
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

1490
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:11,178
I'm sorry. I'm the guy who...

1491
01:38:12,789 --> 01:38:14,689
You were my best friend.

1492
01:38:15,358 --> 01:38:16,985
I still am.

1493
01:38:18,795 --> 01:38:20,855
You guys gonna make out now, huh?

1494
01:38:21,098 --> 01:38:23,965
Go ahead, stick your tongue
in his mouth. That'll clear the air.

1495
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:28,403
How about a?

1496
01:38:35,779 --> 01:38:39,909
Look, I know I kind of lost it for a while,
but now I'm seeing things clearly.

1497
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:42,084
You need to get her back.

1498
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,211
- But I don't deserve her.
- No, you... Tank.

1499
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:48,924
If you were willing to give her up,
you deserve her.

1500
01:38:49,292 --> 01:38:51,726
That's fucked up, but you're right.

1501
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:56,424
She's my angel
and it's time she knew.

1502
01:38:56,665 --> 01:38:58,531
Yes. So, what's stopping you?

1503
01:38:58,702 --> 01:39:00,567
I propositioned her mother
for a blowjob.

1504
01:39:02,005 --> 01:39:04,599
Man, that is great.

1505
01:39:04,841 --> 01:39:07,308
That is so great. Yes.

1506
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:11,009
Alexis! Alexis, wait.

1507
01:39:11,247 --> 01:39:12,680
Alexis.

1508
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,679
Just hear me out, all right? Listen.

1509
01:39:14,918 --> 01:39:17,647
Nope. Nope. Nope.

1510
01:39:17,886 --> 01:39:19,217
I did it for you.

1511
01:39:19,455 --> 01:39:22,015
I pushed you away because
I thought I didn't deserve you.

1512
01:39:22,257 --> 01:39:25,659
- You don't.
- So I made a mistake.

1513
01:39:25,895 --> 01:39:28,419
- Many.
- I know.

1514
01:39:28,664 --> 01:39:30,825
- I will never do better than you.
- I know.

1515
01:39:31,066 --> 01:39:33,000
- I need you in my life.
- I know.

1516
01:39:33,235 --> 01:39:36,069
- And I wanna apologize.
- I don't want it.

1517
01:39:36,306 --> 01:39:38,739
Good, because it's not for you.

1518
01:39:39,007 --> 01:39:41,703
I wanna apologize to myself.

1519
01:39:41,977 --> 01:39:45,413
I'm sorry, Tank,
that you blew it with Alexis.

1520
01:39:45,681 --> 01:39:47,979
- But you did.
- Because I thought you deserved...

1521
01:39:48,218 --> 01:39:49,582
...someone better than me.

1522
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:53,515
But when I'm with you,
it's like I'm better than me.

1523
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:57,720
You're the only person that could ever
make me do cardio. And I hate cardio.

1524
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,418
I wanna faint, I want a cigarette
and I have a massive cramp.

1525
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:03,927
But I would run a marathon for you.

1526
01:40:09,605 --> 01:40:11,663
- Okay.
- Fuck me.

1527
01:40:11,906 --> 01:40:13,875
You ruined my sister's wedding.

1528
01:40:14,143 --> 01:40:17,306
But I saved her life.
That guy was a fucking fuckface.

1529
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:21,571
- You curse incessantly.
- I will never swear again.

1530
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,282
Fuck. Last one.

1531
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:26,885
- My parents hate you.
- Well, they'll come around.

1532
01:40:27,122 --> 01:40:28,384
Except your mother.

1533
01:40:28,624 --> 01:40:29,613
And your dad.

1534
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:32,690
- Your job is a joke.
- A joke? I sell air.

1535
01:40:32,927 --> 01:40:34,292
I do the impossible every day.

1536
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,224
Have you ever even read a book?

1537
01:40:36,464 --> 01:40:38,125
<i>The Giving Tree.</i>

1538
01:40:38,566 --> 01:40:41,127
- And?
- Among others. Countless others.

1539
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:44,167
- Tank.
- I'll join a book club.

1540
01:40:44,906 --> 01:40:47,602
What's the matter?
You can't keep up?

1541
01:40:48,676 --> 01:40:51,840
You are not passionate
about anything.

1542
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:55,446
Except you. I'm passionate about you.
As evidence, consider the fact...

1543
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:57,810
...that I've been running
for two goddamn hours.

1544
01:40:58,052 --> 01:41:00,247
- I need to stop and rest.
- You sabotage dates.

1545
01:41:00,488 --> 01:41:02,752
You're a professional asshole.
That's what you do.

1546
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:06,187
No. It's what I did.

1547
01:41:06,961 --> 01:41:10,089
Tank, I just don't think
you're the one.

1548
01:41:13,201 --> 01:41:16,226
Not yet, but I'll get there.

1549
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:29,646
You okay?

1550
01:42:42,855 --> 01:42:45,757
Without air, we cannot live.

1551
01:42:47,294 --> 01:42:49,285
I think those words resonate
with people...

1552
01:42:49,529 --> 01:42:53,226
...because they're really true,
you know?

1553
01:42:58,605 --> 01:42:59,935
What?

1554
01:43:00,973 --> 01:43:02,998
I thought... I thought that was a joke.

1555
01:43:03,542 --> 01:43:07,706
- It wasn't. What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

1556
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:09,278
Air?

1557
01:43:09,515 --> 01:43:12,485
Because I don't really think
there's anything funny about air.

1558
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,619
It's kind of too important.

1559
01:43:25,097 --> 01:43:26,655
Asshole.

1560
01:43:30,002 --> 01:43:30,969
- Hi.
- Hi.

1561
01:43:31,203 --> 01:43:32,170
- I'm Alexis.
- Hi.

1562
01:43:32,438 --> 01:43:34,872
Do you wanna know what
this guy did? He humiliated me.

1563
01:43:35,107 --> 01:43:37,099
- He embarrassed me. He literally...
- Alexis.

1564
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:38,468
I'm having a conversation.

1565
01:43:38,744 --> 01:43:42,043
I'm having a conversation.
It's with her, it's not with you.

1566
01:43:43,047 --> 01:43:45,174
What this guy did to me
makes me sick every day.

1567
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:47,008
Physically ill.

1568
01:43:47,251 --> 01:43:49,652
But is that like lovesickness
or like hatesickness?

1569
01:43:49,888 --> 01:43:52,083
- No, it's like morning sickness.
- What?

1570
01:43:53,492 --> 01:43:56,757
Yeah, I'm pregnant, okay?
So I'm sorry.

1571
01:43:57,529 --> 01:43:59,656
It makes me a little emotional.

1572
01:43:59,897 --> 01:44:03,129
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, I'm fucking pregnant!

1573
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:05,097
I probably should go.

1574
01:44:05,336 --> 01:44:06,803
But how? It's...

1575
01:44:08,106 --> 01:44:09,937
How do you think?

1576
01:44:10,174 --> 01:44:11,505
That's right, everybody.

1577
01:44:11,743 --> 01:44:15,840
This asshole got me pregnant.

1578
01:44:16,482 --> 01:44:20,009
- I definitely think I should go.
- Okay, I didn't know. I didn't know.

1579
01:44:20,252 --> 01:44:21,549
If you think that's bad...

1580
01:44:21,786 --> 01:44:23,981
...you should hear what this guy
did to my sister.

1581
01:44:24,222 --> 01:44:28,659
- Alexis, I've apologized a million times.
- He got her pregnant too.

1582
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:32,022
So there's two of us
having a baby together...

1583
01:44:32,263 --> 01:44:35,596
...about three and a half weeks
apart.

1584
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:37,357
- Yeah.
- It was dark, I was drunk...

1585
01:44:37,602 --> 01:44:39,036
...and I thought it was you.

1586
01:44:39,271 --> 01:44:40,738
Right?

1587
01:44:44,776 --> 01:44:47,710
I'm gonna go now.
It was nice meeting you.

1588
01:44:47,944 --> 01:44:50,174
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

1589
01:44:51,716 --> 01:44:52,842
What's going on here?

1590
01:44:53,951 --> 01:44:56,146
Oh, I'm just saving another girl...

1591
01:44:56,387 --> 01:44:59,083
...from the worst sex
she'll ever have in her life.

1592
01:45:03,829 --> 01:45:06,194
Well, your mother never complained.

1593
01:45:08,165 --> 01:45:11,430
You wanna know why
I didn't return your e-mails?

1594
01:45:12,135 --> 01:45:13,625
Your pathetic calls?

1595
01:45:14,971 --> 01:45:18,305
You are unattractive. I said it.

1596
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:22,338
I'm not attractive.
Well, let's put it this way.

1597
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:25,743
I would kick your ass right now,
but my foot might get sucked in.

1598
01:45:27,751 --> 01:45:32,051
I'd kick your dick right now,
but my foot might get herpes.

1599
01:45:32,856 --> 01:45:35,552
Well, you know, you can
stop trying to be clever, Alexis.

1600
01:45:35,792 --> 01:45:39,319
The funniest thing that'll ever
come out of you is me.

1601
01:45:39,796 --> 01:45:41,856
All right, Tank.

1602
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,432
You got the best joke here.

1603
01:45:45,536 --> 01:45:47,197
And it's in your pants.

1604
01:45:58,115 --> 01:46:00,049
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

1605
01:46:00,283 --> 01:46:02,012
Oh, baby.
