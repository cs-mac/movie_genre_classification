1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>Once upon a time, before
there was any blue,</i>

2
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,300
<i>I take a long, long nap
in a brand new home.</i>

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,800
<i>This place, it's like I make up my mind
to stay in this lovely, warm pink goo.</i>

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,000
<i>With the thumpedy thump of the heart.</i>

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,500
<i>My only true pal.</i>

6
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,399
<i>I tell the noisy world out side to
fuck off with all your play acting.</i>

7
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,900
<i>Poor Runt, she going nowhere, for no one.</i>

8
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,000
<i>That was a time when silence
was some sort of friend.</i>

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,900
<i>But then my mum, heave and rip all inside.</i>

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,999
<i>And Runt, she wakes up, cause a
baby can't stay still forever.</i>

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,700
<i>A baby must be born.</i>

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,799
<i>So hold on mum, for the
little baby she's comin out.</i>

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,999
<i>Push the baby. Push the head.</i>

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,599
<i>Ooh, the fuckin pain.</i>

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,399
<i>Mum crying like a barber
herself, the silly cow.</i>

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,600
<i>Push now, push ya fuck mama, ya.</i>

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,599
<i>And I arrive into this world of mine,</i>

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,699
<i>with the light so bright,</i>

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>it wakes me awake with
my little baby scream.</i>

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,999
She's a little beaut.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
A diamond eh.

22
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,000
<i>And I remember seeing my old Dad,
so full of the happy he was.</i>

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,099
<i>The nursie hand me to my mum.</i>

24
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,199
<i>And she's so tired, yeah.</i>

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,999
<i>Opened up to spit me out
into this funny old world.</i>

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,900
<i>I smile at her cause that's what babies do.</i>

27
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,600
<i>And for the one and only
time, we three are a family.</i>

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,099
<i>Only a few moments old and I
start thinking things then.</i>

29
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,200
<i>Staring at that white sky right above me.</i>

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,499
<i>And, I want for something
altogether different.</i>

31
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,800
<i>And that's when I hear him.</i>

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,900
<i>And through the naudy and big ears
ward, I search after his cry.</i>

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,900
<i>A cry so lonely it scares
me and makes me cry too.</i>

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>And all the sites that we could see they go
invisible when we hear each others cries.</i>

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,399
<i>And that's when the magic it all begin.</i>

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,000
<i>It begin when the baby Pig and baby Runt,
stare through their baby eyes you see.</i>

37
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,500
<i>And the crying and screamin'd stop.</i>

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:18,600
<i>From that moment we become one, and
we need no one else... nobody.</i>

39
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,299
Night 'ol sweet ting

40
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,099
Cheerio 'ol pal.

41
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,099

Sure, what else?

43
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,199
Night beautiful

44
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Nigh, night.

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
What's the color of love Pig?

46
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,000
Sorry love, Love?

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Dunno.

48
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,300
But you know the way
tings, they got a color?

49
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,100
I wonder what the color o love is.

50
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,899
Jesus Runt.

51
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,999
You could read a tousand tick books and
never know the answer to dat quiz.

52
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,599
It'll be a good one to know tho, hey?

53
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
It'll be brilliant Runt.

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,100
<i>It's here somewhere.</i>

55
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,800
<i>There you are Runt.</i>

56
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,800
That's the Big Blue there.

57
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,800
All that water, huh?

58
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey it'll all yours Pal.

59
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,199
Mine Pig?

60
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,599
Birday present init?

61
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,300
17 in 17 days on the 17th.

62
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,399
I wanna to walk into the
sea and never come back.

63
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,200
I want the tide to take me out of
me, and give me someone different.

64
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,399
Maybe for a half hour or so.

65
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,100
That'd be good wouldn't it Pig?

66
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,099
Say again

67
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,400
Just for a try, you know?

68
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,800
Jesus Runt that'd be impossible,
'a half hour', fuck!

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,600
D'Ya know, they'd make a
huge space ship rocket.

70
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,499
And take it up to the cosmo shiny
stars all twinkle, twinkle.

71
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,100
And I'll sit in my saucer and I'll have
a good look down on the big, big blue.

72
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,999
And there'll be a button called LASER that would
blast all the shity bits that you'll see.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,399
And I'll fire dat fireball,

74
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,299
and I'll fire back down
to Cross Haven Beach,

75
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,199
knowin' dat all dat's left
is my room, your room,

76
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,100
an a palace that shine out of the
pool for the king and the queen.

77
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Cause that's all that matters Runt.

78
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,600
The rest is just weekday stuff fun.

79
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,400
<i>A palace.</i>

80
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
<i>It's a dream.</i>

81
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>You know where the palace is.</i>

82
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200

Are you deaf or what?

102
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,999
Oh, yeah good choice Sinead.

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Bloody rock if you're gone.

For the vodka, ya dope.

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,199
Oh, right cheers.

109
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
God bless.

110
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,100
5

111
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,999
4

112
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,299
3

113
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,899
2

114
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
1

115
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Well excuse me!

116
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,699
<i>It's simply not a healthy relationship.</i>

117
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,299
<i>I mean you have to separate
them, for their own good.</i>

118
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,399
<i>Expulsion would be the easy way out.</i>

119
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,099
<i>In fact to be honest wit you
I would like even go further</i>

120
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,500
to having the little feckers flogged.

121
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,699
This, is their reaction

122
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,600
<i>to us not letting them in
the end of year photograph.</i>

123
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,899
Their over reaction.

124
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
You don't say.

125
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,900
What should we do Saul?

126
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,299
I tink da floggin idea sounds good.

127
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,799
This, is their career guidance forms.

128
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,799
Which we received back from yesterday.

129
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,500
So as you can see here Darren wants
to be a King and Sinead a Queen.

130
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,000
<i>Most days, we wanna wish
the mum and dad far away.</i>

131
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,199
<i>I remember tinkin, all da good
tings we've already done.</i>

132
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,799
<i>And now only 5 years old,</i>

133
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,299
<i>and all the good tings to
come for the deadly jewel.</i>

134
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,199
<i>It was me, and him.</i>

135
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,299
<i>So no word we speak,</i>

136
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,999
<i>as the world around jabbers out stuff
that goes nowhere's to no one.</i>

137
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,399
<i>And we promise to never change.</i>

138
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,800
<i>To stay like this forever.</i>

139
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
It's a sad old town ay Runt?

140
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,600
But our town ay pal?

141
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,900
<i>Hey pal?</i>

Whad'ya think?

143
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,400
I make it myself.

144
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,300
<i>Okay?</i>

145
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,800
Beautiful.

146
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>Yeah?</i>

147
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Beautiful face your's.

148
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,900
Oh fuck off.

149
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Honest.

150
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,500
Like some model ya see of da telly.

151
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,699
'Cept so much better Runt.

152
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Better believe is boy.

153
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,500
Okay?

154
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,600
I have seen roses.

155
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,999
Da me, da me

156
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,800
Da masked.

157
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,800
Da masked red and white.

158
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,400
But not such roses see.

159
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,900
See, I inartite.

160
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,699
Cheeks, and in some perfumes, is there
more delight than in some perfumes.

161

Unable to swim, completely
addicted to sports.
