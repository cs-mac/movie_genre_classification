2
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,744
Here we go.

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,151
Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa-ho-ho!

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,231
<i>Rise and shine, beautiful.</i>

5
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,518
Here you go, buddy.

6
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,786
Oh, thank you.

7
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,254
I still use these.

8
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,198
<i>What took you so long?</i>

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,700
They forgot the Mu Shu pork,
and it's your favorite.

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,140
Kids, come on!
Food's ready, let's go, inside!

11
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,675
Susan, you hungry?

12
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,612
<i>- Bruce's book...
- Hmm.</i>

13
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,415
Hedging Your Bet Against
God <i>By Bruce Brooks.</i>

14
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:59,418
That's a great fucking title.
What's the book about?

15
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,186
Well, the way I see it,

16
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,622
was there's a Bible
for the afterlife.

17
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,357
I wrote the Bible
for the here and now.

18
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,295
I'm actually not kidding.

19
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,630
And people can say
all they want about insurance,

20
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,232
and guys like me,
but you know what?

21
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,467
At the end of the day,
having good insurance

22
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,502
is the most important thing
you can do while you're alive.

23
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,604
<i>Every time you up it,</i>

24
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,839
<i>you're just hedging your bet against God,
am I right?</i>

25
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,181
<i>What are you doing?</i>

26
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,683
Come on sit back down, Laney.
Everyone's enjoying the food.

27
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,452
The ribs are sour.

28
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,686
How would you know?
You didn't even eat them.

29
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,456
Laney, come on, sit down.

30
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,871
<i>Daddy...
Where'd you get that dog?</i>

31
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,207
We rescued him from the pound.

32
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,477
Janey, Bingo was supposed
to be a surprise for mommy.

33
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,445
Mommy, I think he needs you.

34
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,553
<i>We talked about this.</i>

35
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:11,490
No, you talked about this.
We didn't talk about anything.

36
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,958
Can you just give it a try?
Can you trust me?

37
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,361
Fuck you, Bruce.

38
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,537
Boom! Perfect!

39
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,614
<i>Mom, can we keep her?</i>

40
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:13,986
<i>I don't know,
E. It's just one more thing to worry about.</i>

41
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,043
E.

42
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,912
E, wake up.
You're having a nightmare.

43
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,016
What is it baby?

44
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,984
You have another bad dream?

45
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,386
Come here.

46
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,794
We were walking down the
street to go see Dad

47
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,530
and you were listening
to your headphones...

48
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,898
It's okay, take a deep breath.

49
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,000
Tell me.

50
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,903
I was trying to tell you,

51
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,639
but you wouldn't listen to me.

52
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,609
You couldn't hear me 'cause you
were listening to your headphones.

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,447
And there were all these cars.

54
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,483
And then I got trapped,
and I couldn't grab you.

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,956
And then the car just hit you.
You were dead.

56
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,659
That will never happen.

57
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,529
How do you know?

58
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,964
'Cause I don't have an iPod.

59
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,101
Oh, funny, Mom.

60
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:39,604
It will never happen because
I would never let it happen.

61
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,975
Okay? Go to sleep, Mommy's here.

62
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,912
I'll stay with you till
you fall asleep, okay?

63
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,588
<i>Rise and shine, beautiful.</i>

64
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,392
Thought I was gonna
have to wake you up.

65
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,594
No, I don't want to get up.
Come back to bed.

66
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,863
I wish.

67
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,469
Hey, Bingo.

68
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,571
Only school buses
allowed here, Lady.

69
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,508
Since when?
You must not be reading your emails.

70
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,177
Mom! It's okay, E.

71
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,646
Um, is Frank here?
Frank always lets me double park.

72
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,747
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,683
What's it say, Mom?

74
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,986
It says we have to park.

75
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,823
Come on, Come on.

76
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,161
Susan, what is this?

77
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:11,496
Oh, it's to check
the parent IDs.

78
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,166
They sent them in the mail.
Part of that whole new security thing?

79
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,734
I don't... Don't worry.
I'll vouch for you.

80
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,136
Okay, thank you.

81
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,573
ID?

82
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,675
I had a crazy morning.
I forgot it.

83
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,143
I will bring it tomorrow,
I promise.

84
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,145
Parent IDs are mandatory now.

85
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,648
We mailed them out last
week and sent an email.

86
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,450
I'll vouch for her. Thank you.

87
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,519
Mom? It's okay, E.

88
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,055
I've been walking him
to class for two years,

89
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,990
surely you can make
an exception for one day.

90
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,892
If I make an exception
for you, Mrs. Brooks.

91
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,994
Then I'm gonna have to
make one for everyone.

92
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,964
Is that how we want to teach our children?
I wouldn't think so.

93
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,799
At this point in the year,

94
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,001
Eli is familiar enough to
get to his own classroom.

95
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,603
He'll be fine. I'll take Janey?

96
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,839
Okay.

97
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,140
I'm okay, Mom. Are you sure?

98
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,909
Wait, Janey, give me a kiss!

99
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,214
Bye, baby.

100
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,149
Ooh.

101
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,550
I'll see you later!

102
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,830
Teach my kids,
you fucking bitch.

103
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,165
"Is that how you want
to raise your kids?"

104
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,234
Yeah, that's how I
want to raise my kids.

105
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,202
Thanks for the help,
you fucking condescending...

106
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,622
Yeah? Yeah.

107
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,792
I'm gonna take a shower.

108
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,860
Mmm-mmm.

109
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,229
Mmm-mmm.

110
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,730
It's early, stay with me.

111
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,032
No, I've got
to pick up the kids.

112
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,166
Nah!

113
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,804
Oh, God. I love you.

114
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:33,939
No, you don't.

115
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,340
What?

116
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,342
Why do you say that?

117
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,178
Because you're married.

118
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,748
And because no man can love a
girl whose ass he just fucked.

119
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,116
Jesus, Laney.

120
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,118
You're crazy, you know that?

121
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,924
I told you I'd leave Sue soon.
I love you.

122
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,065
That's what's so funny.
You could love me, fine.

123
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,734
I could love you. It doesn't matter.
It means nothing.

124
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,185
Fuck. Fuck!

125
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,445
You can't park here, ma'am.
We've been all through this, haven't we?

126
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,213
I was hoping you
wouldn't remember.

127
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,049
No, I remember.

128
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,316
Hey, Laney!

129
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,185
Oh.

130
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,054
Hey! Is everything okay?

131
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,056
Did Henry have a bad day?

132
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,824
No, I can't find Donny.
His cell phone has been off all day.

133
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,060
He hasn't been to the office.

134
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,828
I'm sure he's in
a meeting or something.

135
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,197
Lady, you gotta move it!
I'm moving!

136
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,866
Look, I'm sure,
I'm sure Donny is fine.

137
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,334
All right, thank you.
I'll call you later.

138
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,437
Okay, thanks. Okay.

139
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,305
Oh! Those are my kids!
Those are my kids!

140
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,707
Hurry, kids.
Kids, get in the car!

141
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,215
How was your day?
Good! How was yours?

142
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,984
It was good. How about you, E?

143
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,421
E, how was your day?

144
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,956
It was fine.

145
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,761
Mommy, your phone!

146
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,763
I know, Sweetie.

147
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,942
Did you miss me? Yes.

148
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,377
Did you cry?

149
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,279
How much do you love me?

150
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:32,050
Oh, good! Oh, good,
oh, good, oh, good.

151
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,485
Promise you'll never leave me.

152
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,220
Mommy, stop!

153
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,524
- I'm teasing, muffin!
- I'm just teasing.

154
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,265
Why aren't you eating?

155
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,000
Not hungry.

156
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,270
You need to eat more food.
Real food. Not lollipops.

157
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,540
Jesus, what are you,
the food police?

158
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,346
All that sugar
isn't good for you.

159
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:05,416
Empty calories, right guys?
Not...

160
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,186
Energy food. That's right!
Energy food.

161
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,257
And I know, if you eat too much sugar,
you can, um...

162
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,193
You can be very
tired and it can...

163
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,029
It can wear down your body.

164
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,998
That's right.

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,232
And you'll lose
some of your energy.

166
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,811
Mmm!

167
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,461
Did you that the pilgrims actually stole
America from the Native Americans?

168
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,165
They had the Native Americans teach
them how to grow corn and stuff.

169
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,934
And then they stole their land.

170
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,135
Is that, right?

171
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,970
Yeah, so we gave them casinos.

172
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,573
Mrs. Zeldis told you this?

173
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,508
No, John Frye did.

174
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,845
His mom told him.
She also said Thanksgiving is a lie.

175
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,182
John Frye's mother is a pig.

176
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,350
Lane.

177
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,191
All right.
You kids want to play basketball?

178
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,094
Really? Yeah!

179
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,562
As long as you promise to
take it easy on me. Let's go.

180
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,597
Okay! All right.

181
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,160
That's good. Yes!

182
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,531
Yeah!

183
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,066
That was high.

184
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,038
Eli, soap.

185
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,074
I already did.

186
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,342
Oh, you did?

187
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,986
Did you practice piano today?

188
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,461
E, you've got a piano recital coming up.
Did you practice?

189
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,363
Yeah. How much?

190
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,608
You done? All set?

191
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,511
Mmm-hmm. Great.

192
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,518
Whoa-oh!

193
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,291
Mom?

194
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,593
I can't breathe.

195
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,642
E, put on your T-shirt.

196
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,045
Ooh, dry your balls.

197
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,648
Mom!

198
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,016
You'll get a rash.

199
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,069
What's up?

200
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,039
I'm just thinking.

201
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,741
About?

202
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,676
Your balls.

203
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,277
What? Your balls!

204
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
Like do you worry
about drying them?

205
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,081
Do I worry?

206
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,219
Like when you were a little boy,
did your mother

207
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,487
teach you how to dry your balls,

208
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,688
or you just knew instinctively?

209
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,290
Like should I be teaching Eli?

210
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,459
Honey, you dry them like any
other part of your body.

211
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,396
Oh.

212
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,664
But if you don't dry it,
could you get a rash?

213
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,169
I guess you could,
but whatever you don't get

214
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,437
will just dry in your underwear.

215
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,105
What's going on, Laney?

216
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:24,342
Oh, your underwear!

217
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,078
Of course,
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

218
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,680
You know,
all this talk about balls...

219
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,323
You're so beautiful.

220
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,749
I feel like my dad
dried and powdered.

221
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,652
Christ, Laney,
can we change the subject?

222
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,566
We got to get rid of Bingo.

223
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,575
I'm serious. We can't keep him.

224
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:34,846
It's just a dog, Laney.
All kids get a dog.

225
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,514
Why does it have to
be such a big deal?

226
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,650
Why does everything
have to be such a big deal?

227
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,453
Because dogs get old and die!

228
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,255
I mean, what does
a dog live? Ten years?

229
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:48,693
Yes. Ten enjoyable years
our kids can have a dog.

230
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,295
Only you could manage to turn getting
a dog into a fucking negative.

231
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,632
I'm trying to spare
them a negative!

232
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:59,270
This dog is going to die,
and our kids will be heartbroken.

233
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,606
Yeah, but that's life, Lane.

234
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,374
That's how it works.

235
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,243
Dogs die. Bingo will die too.
The kids can handle it.

236
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,912
I can't handle it.

237
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,751
Well, then why bother
loving anything, hmm?

238
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,852
I mean, why bother loving me?

239
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:23,895
Yeah, yeah. I don't see why
anybody bothers loving anything.

240
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,530
Oh, come on, Lane.
You don't mean that.

241
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,931
I do mean that.

242
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,935
So what do you suggest?

243
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,774
Don't fall in love.

244
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,842
Don't...

245
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,948
Don't get married.
Don't have kids.

246
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,586
Don't act like everything's gonna be okay,
when nothing's gonna be okay.

247
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,791
Well, thankfully most of us
like to keep fooling ourselves.

248
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,262
You okay? Yeah, I'm okay.

249
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,898
Why wouldn't I be okay?

250
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,401
I don't know.
I just worry about you, that's all.

251
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,369
I got to go check on the kids.

252
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,448
<i>Hello?</i>

253
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,251
Hi, is this Diane? <i>Yes.</i>

254
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:57,321
I'm so sorry to call so late.
This is Laney Brooks, I'm Eli's mom.

255
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:05,263
Fine. Actually, I'm not,
that's funny, I'm not fine. I...

256
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,999
Eli came home from school
today with a bunch of stories

257
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,868
about how the Pilgrims
were thieves,

258
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,673
and Thanksgiving
is a lie, and I...

259
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,843
Well, that's fine, I...
Well, you...

260
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:23,347
Yes, you can teach your kids
anything you want, I just would.

261
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:28,819
I'm trying to teach my son, uh,
to have gratitude and Thanksgiving...

262
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:36,327
Okay, now, I didn't call to get into
a debate with you, Diane, I just...

263
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,629
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,066
That's fine. Yeah, no, no, no.

265
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,035
How about this,
why don't you go fuck yourself?

266
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,636
And you can tell
your little brat

267
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,004
to stay the fuck
away from my kid.

268
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,847
Help.

269
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,125
Bruce.

270
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,230
Laney?

271
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,132
Are you okay?

272
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,001
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

273
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,136
Oh, Jesus, Laney.

274
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,905
What did you do?
What did you do?

275
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,709
I don't think I can do this.

276
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,245
It's just a month, Laney.
You'll be home before you know it.

277
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,683
You must be Laney.

278
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,387
Okay. You can keep these.

279
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,990
And you can keep that.

280
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,229
And I need your bra too, honey.

281
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,033
Jesus.

282
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:50,401
I suggest you try
and get some sleep.

283
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,302
Drink as much water as you can.

284
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,837
We'll check on you
through the night

285
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,973
just to make sure
everything's okay.

286
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,107
Questions?

287
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,777
I need to call my husband.

288
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,211
We'll give him regular updates.

289
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,017
Everybody's anxious
their first time, honey.

290
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,254
You're gonna do great.
I'll check on you later.

291
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,171
<i>When did you
start hating me, Lane?</i>

292
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,239
I don't hate you, Bruce.

293
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,075
Then why did you
stop taking your meds?

294
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,478
<i>They were making me fat.</i>

295
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,180
<i>That's bullshit. It's true.</i>

296
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,248
So, what,
you'd rather be insane?

297
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,722
<i>You promised me
you'd take your medication.</i>

298
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,890
If not for me,
then for the kids.

299
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:47,958
They're gonna start to notice.

300
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,267
I need to call my husband.
There's been a mistake.

301
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,170
It's honestly just
not the place for me.

302
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,272
Your doctor will help you with
that when you see him, honey.

303
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,974
Okay,
well then I'd like to see the doctor now.

304
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,242
You know,
the first 48 hours are the worst.

305
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,744
Well, is this
a fucking hospital?

306
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,045
'Cause I'd like to
see the doctor now.

307
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,047
This is a fucking
hospital right?

308
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,049
Relax, relax. You need to get
some rest. This is the worst...

309
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,951
Don't fucking touch me!
You're gonna feel better soon.

310
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,094
<i>I just want you to be happy,
Laney, like you used to be.</i>

311
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,000
<i>Don't you want to be happy?</i>

312
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,907
Okay, your blood work shows

313
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,513
cocaine, amphetamines,
Ambien and marijuana,

314
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:45,849
but there's no trace of lithium.

315
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,118
Do you want to tell me why you
stopped taking the lithium?

316
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,863
Nurse Pauline says that
you're desperate to go home,

317
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,266
and that you feel
you don't belong here.

318
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,534
I don't.

319
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,338
Well then, why are you staying?

320
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,410
Call someone and go.
You're an adult.

321
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,347
Why not?

322
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,217
Because I have a family. So?

323
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,519
So, I can't just go home

324
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,423
and do this again.

325
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,464
So, uh, where would
you like to start?

326
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,568
Really?

327
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,503
Really.

328
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,141
What's more interesting for you,

329
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:47,344
the daddy issues or the drugs?

330
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,613
Well, uh, I'd like to start
with the daddy issues

331
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:53,016
because it's a very organic
segue into the drugs.

332
00:30:56,487 --> 00:31:01,091
Well, mine's boring.
My dad left when I was nine.

333
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,060
That's the whole story.

334
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,929
He kissed me goodnight,
and that's the last time I saw him.

335
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,266
So, drugs?

336
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,635
Yeah, we'll get to that.

337
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,571
Can you tell me why you
haven't spoken again?

338
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,974
Um, he didn't call me.

339
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,009
Why didn't you call him?

340
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:22,145
Because I didn't
know where he lived.

341
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,214
Ah.

342
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:33,123
He's upstate.
My brother told me.

343
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,225
So, your brother talks to him?
He does.

344
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:40,030
Or he did. I don't know.

345
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,367
We um, we don't talk about
Dad anymore because, um,

346
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,435
it always ends up in a fight.

347
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,910
When he left my mother,
she was devastated.

348
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:57,114
So, I... I held onto that.

349
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,450
And he

350
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,186
didn't, I guess.

351
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,088
Did she remarry? Mmm-hmm.

352
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,959
Yeah, a few years later.

353
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,961
Why didn't you call him then?

354
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,665
Why don't you ask him
why he didn't call me?

355
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,133
Why do you think
he didn't call you?

356
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,983
Can we talk about the drugs now?

357
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,162
<i>Hello? Hi!</i>

358
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,197
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

359
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,534
Good! It's going...
It's going well.

360
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,436
How are you? <i>Good.</i>

361
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:55,439
<i>The kids are wiped out.
Getting ready for bed.</i>

362
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,740
<i>It was a big day ice skating.</i>

363
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,742
You went ice skating,
without me?

364
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:00,077
<i>Laney, I...</i>

365
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,546
I just... It's just...

366
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:06,149
We always go together, I mean,
it's kind of our thing.

367
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,452
<i>Yeah, I know, Laney.
But you're not here.</i>

368
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,654
<i>Would you rather
I didn't take them?</i>

369
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,589
No.

370
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,424
No, I just...
I should've been there.

371
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,326
<i>I know, and you'll
take them next year.</i>

372
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,999
<i>Just focus on getting better,
the kids need you. I need you.</i>

373
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,303
<i>I'm sorry. I got to go.</i>

374
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:27,738
Can I say
good night to the kids?

375
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,741
<i>I don't want to
upset them before bed.</i>

376
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,442
<i>We'll see you at
the family visit.</i>

377
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,344
<i>I'm sorry, Laney, I...</i>

378
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,214
<i>I have to go. I love you.
We all love you.</i>

379
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,216
<i>We miss you here.</i>

380
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:39,750
I love you too.

381
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,338
You look good.

382
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Feeling better?

383
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,374
I am.

384
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,211
You seem like
you're making progress.

385
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,581
Yeah.

386
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,317
Why don't you say what you're
really thinking, Bruce?

387
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,353
What?
I don't understand why you're so angry.

388
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:19,756
I'm not...

389
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:25,195
What? I'm not angry!
I'm not angry. I'm scared.

390
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:29,566
What are you scared of?
Everything!

391
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,803
I know you think that if I
take my medication every day,

392
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:34,371
that everything
will go back to normal.

393
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:37,441
But it's bigger than that.

394
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,483
What is Eli doing with his eyes?

395
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:47,851
Have you noticed that?

396
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,152
No.

397
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,791
Is he doing that at school?

398
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,593
I don't know.
No one's called me about it.

399
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,329
You can't wait for someone to
call you about it!

400
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,132
You have to call them. Kids
could be making fun of him.

401
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,202
You've got to call the teacher on Monday.
First thing. You've got to...

402
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,603
Promise me you'll call
the teacher on Monday.

403
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,240
I promise, Laney.
I'll make sure he's okay.

404
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,342
Don't worry about it.

405
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,518
I need to tell you some things.

406
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,723
Some

407
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,759
really fucked up things I did
when I wasn't thinking clearly

408
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,362
and I want you to know them.

409
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,597
So we can start fresh.

410
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,332
I don't want
to do this now, Laney.

411
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:38,168
It's important for me,
that I, that I... I need to...

412
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,703
Come on kids. That's enough.
Let's go. Sit down.

413
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,742
How many cupcakes did you eat?
One.

414
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,410
One? Liar.

415
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,479
She ate two.

416
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,420
Okay. Bye, Mommy!

417
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:01,892
Bye, baby!
Oh, it's so good to see you!

418
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,860
It's so good to see you.

419
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,733
I brought you something.
You did?

420
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,704
I made this for you.

421
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,908
Dream catcher!

422
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,343
No more bad dreams.

423
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,947
Thank you. E, thank you. I love it.
I love it. It's beautiful.

424
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,575
<i>Neither of them
will ever know how hard</i>

425
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,877
I tried to not hurt them.

426
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,516
Am I gonna fuck this up?

427
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,751
I don't want to fuck this up.
I don't want to fuck this up.

428
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,954
Well, you're gonna
fuck up sometimes.

429
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:06,289
You're gonna say things
that you regret,

430
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,291
you're gonna do things
that you're not proud of,

431
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,294
and then you're gonna remember
that you're a human being.

432
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,430
We all have our moments.

433
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,799
But when you came here,
you made a conscious decision.

434
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,768
And that was to live.

435
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,778
<i>Nobody tells you
that it's terrifying,</i>

436
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,380
<i>you know,
to love something so much.</i>

437
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,283
Well, yeah.

438
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,485
You're going to have to find
a way to face your terror.

439
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,922
And, uh, you're going to have
to decide what it is you want.

440
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,258
Right.

441
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,327
What do you want?

442
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,670
<i>I've made really shitty
decisions my whole life.</i>

443
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,339
<i>And I just...</i>

444
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,309
<i>I need to remember
how to be a good wife,</i>

445
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:03,380
<i>and a good mother,
and a real person.</i>

446
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,515
I want to smile like
I did the first time

447
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,951
I saw Janey walk across a room.

448
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,957
I'd love to smile like
that again. You know?

449
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,301
It might not happen right away.

450
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,435
You might have
to wait for a bit.

451
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:32,676
Look, everything beautiful,
every moment of beauty,

452
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:35,345
it goes away. Fades.

453
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:38,715
But then there's another one,

454
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,417
and another one,
and another one.

455
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,021
And you just have to
be alive to see it.

456
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,596
Keep taking your meds.

457
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,365
Have faith in yourself.

458
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,900
Eli, you want to
help us ice the cake?

459
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,637
No, thanks.

460
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,906
It's not the way I pictured it.

461
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,409
It's not perfect.

462
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:42,812
What? It is perfect.
What are you talking about?

463
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,149
I don't know why you're crying.
This cake is beautiful.

464
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,417
Isn't it, E?

465
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,419
I like it.

466
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,786
See?

467
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,956
All right, basement's dry.
What's going on?

468
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,024
She doesn't like her cake.

469
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,626
What? Janey,
that's a great cake!

470
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,428
That's the best cake
I've ever seen.

471
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,463
Really? Really.

472
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,998
Hey, can I smell it?

473
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,032
Does it smell as
good as it looks?

474
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,034
Okay.

475
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,803
Mmm.

476
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,838
Daddy! Yeah, that smells good.

477
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,939
Your nose! What?

478
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,641
Your nose! What?

479
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,143
What's wrong with my nose?

480
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:14,778
You have something on your nose.
What?

481
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,880
I don't see anything. Your nose!

482
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:17,914
Right there. What?

483
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,050
I want to smell it! Okay!

484
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,787
Oh, my gosh!
You got a little something.

485
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,688
What? Just a little...

486
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,990
Smell it, Mommy!
I'm want to smell it. Can I smell it?

487
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,627
Oh, my gosh!

488
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,996
That's the best smelling cake
I've ever smelled.

489
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,932
Come on, E.
You want to smell it?

490
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,970
- What?
- Mommy!

491
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,972
- Oh, it's all right, muffin.
- It's just the electricity.

492
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,474
It'll come back
in a few minutes.

493
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,512
Janey, look at this.

494
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,049
This one is just for you.

495
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:00,083
Are you kidding me?
You can do better than that.

496
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,585
<i>What concerns me
are the rituals.</i>

497
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:06,155
The eye blinking,
the constant pencil sharpening.

498
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,957
Recently,
he started a pattern with tapping his feet.

499
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,728
These behaviors suggest anxiety.

500
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,097
The rituals are a way for
Eli to stay in control.

501
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,300
It's not unusual,

502
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:18,868
but the rituals
can become a problem

503
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,203
when they get in
the way of functioning.

504
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,105
When they become all consuming.

505
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,841
So, what do we do?

506
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:27,577
In my opinion, Eli
needs to see a specialist.

507
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,846
Perhaps start with cognitive
behavioral therapy.

508
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:31,147
Or, perhaps, he can even
benefit from medication.

509
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,918
Medication?

510
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,320
It's my fault.
He's got my genes.

511
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,322
Stop it.

512
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,836
Did you go to rehab because
you're a drug addict?

513
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:00,777
No. Why...
Why would you think that?

514
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,912
John Frye said
you're a drug addict?

515
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,714
Mommy, drugs are bad.

516
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,649
That's not why she was there, E.

517
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,985
John Frye is just
trying to get your goat.

518
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,056
Eli doesn't have a goat.

519
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:15,224
Then why were you there?

520
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:23,099
I was having some
problems in my mind.

521
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,372
And they were making me do
things I shouldn't have done.

522
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,177
Then why did you do them?

523
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,179
Well, it's complicated. But, um,

524
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,881
but I saw a doctor

525
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:42,218
who was really, really smart.

526
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,688
And he helped me sort
through my problems.

527
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,860
And now I'm better.

528
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:58,768
Did Mr. Odesky tell you
to send me to rehab too?

529
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,306
No. No, no, no.

530
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,930
Mom, look at this one.
It's so cool.

531
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,899
Really cool.

532
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,002
Eli! Hey, Henry!

533
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,772
Hey, look who it is. Hey.

534
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,242
Hi, Donny. Hi, Henry.

535
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:42,679
Hey, it's good to see you back.

536
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,048
Oh, it's good to be...
It's good to be back.

537
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,050
Which one are you getting?

538
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,885
I have to see what I can afford.

539
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,953
I'd get a superhero
if I were you, Eli.

540
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,389
Now,
I don't know about you guys,

541
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,358
but I have always wanted
to be the kind of superhero

542
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,694
that swoops into
the burning building

543
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:01,064
and then rescues the woman
and flies her off to safety.

544
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:03,232
Well,
you can't be Batman 'cause he doesn't fly.

545
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:05,068
Right.

546
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,470
And Spider-Man doesn't really fly.
He swings.

547
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,206
Well, what do you guys
think about Superman?

548
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,874
What do you think, Laney?
I think I could be a good Superman.

549
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,713
I think you're
already a superhero, Donny.

550
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,316
Laney! It's so good to see you.
I've missed you.

551
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,351
I...

552
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:26,255
I didn't know that
you were pregnant.

553
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,291
You're glowing!

554
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:30,026
Oh, bullshit. I look like shit.
I feel like shit.

555
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,361
But I'm almost halfway through,
thankfully.

556
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,264
Oh, my gosh! Congratulations!

557
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:38,134
Thanks. Hey, did you get my
message about my birthday party?

558
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:40,236
I did. I'm sorry, I did.

559
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,406
It's fine, I just want to make sure
you know, no pressure, really.

560
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,742
I totally understand
if you'd rather skip it.

561
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,810
We're gonna be there.
We're planning on it. Okay.

562
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,445
Can I get this one, Mom? Yes.

563
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:52,181
Oh, hey, good choice, my man.

564
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:55,752
Um, we've got to go.
So, we'll see you next weekend!

565
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,220
Yeah! We'll see you soon.
Bye, Henry.

566
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,083
Oh, my big girl.

567
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,460
I have a wish.

568
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,095
You do? What's your wish, baby?

569
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,264
I can't tell you.

570
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:42,465
Why can't you tell me?

571
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,467
Because it won't come true.

572
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,503
Who told you that?

573
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,505
I don't remember.

574
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,042
Well, whoever told you doesn't
know about the "mommy clause."

575
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:55,945
You can always
tell Mommy your wish.

576
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,849
I wish you'll love me forever.

577
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,419
You don't have to
worry about that, baby.

578
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,421
I will always love you.

579
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,356
Forever? Forever!

580
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,136
I don't know, I always heard

581
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,138
you're not supposed
to have too much time.

582
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,272
Listen, I cover
all that in the book.

583
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,341
But, to answer your question,

584
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,511
there really is no such thing as
having too much life insurance.

585
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,847
Especially,
if you're planning on having more kids.

586
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,182
No offense, David,
you look like you are in great shape.

587
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,251
Seriously.

588
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:38,154
But, I'm guessing Katrina
here is going to outlive you.

589
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,522
Yeah. That's the plan

590
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,123
I mean, I plucked her
out of high school.

591
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,892
Stop, I was almost
out of college.

592
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,327
Yeah, the book covers
a lot of unique scenarios.

593
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,195
I see it like this, Dave.

594
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,531
There's a Bible
for the afterlife,

595
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,565
I wrote the Bible
for the here and now.

596
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,969
Yeah. It sounds brilliant.

597
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:56,439
I mean, especially, that notion of,
uh, hedging your bet against God.

598
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:59,041
Sure it'll be a bestseller.

599
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,377
You know, I have always
dreamed of writing a book.

600
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,945
But, how did you do it, Bruce?

601
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:04,447
I mean, did you just sit down

602
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,482
and type everything you were
thinking into a computer?

603
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,951
Or did you pay
someone to help you?

604
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:11,420
It's sentence by sentence.
Anyone can do it.

605
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,356
Listen, you call me any time,

606
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:15,524
and I would be
happy to help you.

607
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:16,926
Thank you.

608
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,197
What do you want to
write a book about?

609
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,200
You know, like,
maybe a children's book?

610
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,903
I'm not sure yet.

611
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,571
I'm thinking
about writing a book.

612
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,006
Really? On what?

613
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,242
Prostitution.

614
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,510
Prostitution? Come on, honey.

615
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,012
You don't know anything
about prostitution.

616
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:38,114
It's the ultimate hypocrisy.

617
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:40,049
It's illegal to sell
your body, right?

618
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:42,451
But if you're rich enough,
it's perfectly acceptable.

619
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,353
They just call it being a wife.

620
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,429
Sorry.

621
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,632
Uh, I would like to make a toast,
uh, to my beautiful wife.

622
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,070
Thank you.

623
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,940
Thank you for putting up
with the restaurant hours,

624
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,474
and thank you for
putting up with me.

625
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,176
Suz, I just want you to know,

626
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:11,213
that, uh, every morning
when I drive away to work,

627
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:14,650
and I see you standing there waving,
with Henry by your side,

628
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,085
the only thing
I'm thinking about

629
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:18,254
is how fast I can
get back to you.

630
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,256
Happy birthday, honey.

631
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,603
Hey. Hey.

632
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,442
God, you look amazing.

633
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:40,977
Do I? Like a million bucks.

634
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,646
Thank you.

635
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,152
I wanted to... I was gonna call.

636
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,054
But I figured I had done enough,

637
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:53,389
that I had done enough damage.

638
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:56,025
No, you... It's not your fault.

639
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,160
You could have been any man.

640
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,763
Wow, really.
That came out wrong.

641
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,598
I just meant
it's not your fault,

642
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,100
you didn't drive me to rehab.

643
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,208
I am here for you.

644
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,145
If you need anything,
you just call me, okay?

645
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,114
Thanks. Thank you, Donny. Yeah.

646
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,521
Not at home.

647
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,556
You can call the restaurant.

648
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,425
If you need anything,
you talk to Jeanine, okay?

649
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:30,593
I mean, anything at all.

650
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,696
Thank you.

651
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,375
When are you gonna talk to me?

652
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,513
Why would you do that?

653
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,416
Babbling about prostitution?

654
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:55,384
I was this close to signing
David Blackman as a client.

655
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,787
I know. Do you?

656
00:50:57,789 --> 00:51:00,256
Do you have any idea how hard
I work to keep this all going?

657
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:01,791
'Cause you act like
it's some big joke.

658
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,626
Like what I do for a living
is somehow beneath you.

659
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,696
We used to be in this together.
Remember?

660
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,298
We used to be on the same team.

661
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,768
I'm sorry. I said I was sorry.
I am, I mean it.

662
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,672
I know how hard
you work. And I...

663
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:19,542
I don't know
what I was thinking.

664
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:24,313
Come here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

665
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,752
She was just, she was such a...
Prostitute?

666
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,155
Yes!

667
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,736
Why don't you come to the
conference with me this weekend?

668
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,274
What if we run into my dad?

669
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,243
We don't ever have
to leave the hotel.

670
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,414
I don't know,
you know how those things are.

671
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,583
It's just people being shitfaced

672
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:02,751
for three straight days,
and I don't...

673
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:06,889
Not for us.
Nothing stronger than water for me, either.

674
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:11,660
Come on, we can lay in bed.
You could get a massage.

675
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:16,699
What about the kids?
They'll stay with my sister.

676
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,667
They've been
through so much already.

677
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:23,339
They'll be fine, Lane.
Happy parents make happy kids.

678
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,741
Just think about it, all right?
It's been a long night.

679
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,424
I'll go with you.

680
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,695
Thank you.

681
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,876
I hate Upstate.

682
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:04,813
You don't hate Upstate,
you just hate your dad.

683
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,316
I think I hate them both.

684
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,751
Can I hate them both?

685
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,487
Yes, you can hate them both.

686
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,897
Rise and shine, beautiful.

687
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,600
No.

688
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,404
Pancakes and coffee.

689
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:31,440
And bacon? Of course!

690
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,309
I've got to call housekeeping.
I got to get my dress steamed.

691
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,610
Wait, wait.

692
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:35,878
Wait one second.

693
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,349
What have you done?

694
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,361
Who would have ever thought you'd
be able to afford this ring?

695
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,997
You did.

696
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,704
Tell me the newsstand story.

697
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,372
And I want a massage.

698
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,679
I forgot how high maintenance you are.
Mmm-hmm.

699
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,915
Okay, the newsstand story.

700
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,485
Once upon a time,

701
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,322
there was this
incredibly good looking kid.

702
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,291
Awkward kid.

703
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,526
Oh, right, I'm sorry,
that was a different story, my bad.

704
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:27,997
There was this incredibly
awkward kid in Teaneck,

705
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:31,500
who used to rack magazines at a store
around the corner from his house,

706
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,402
so he could make
some extra bucks.

707
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,871
He was usually bored out of his skull,
but one day,

708
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,640
this knockout walked in.

709
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,776
Long black hair,

710
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,645
and some really incredible...

711
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,580
You know what I'm saying?

712
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:47,616
There was just
something about this girl.

713
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,486
So this kid,
started dressing up for work.

714
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,521
Bullshit, he wore a T-shirt.

715
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:56,825
If you knew how carefully he
selected them for fit and color.

716
00:54:56,827 --> 00:55:01,430
Anyway, the point of the story is
that every day this kid would wait,

717
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,499
wondering when that girl
would come back in.

718
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,334
Mmm.

719
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,469
And then,
one day she came back in

720
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,605
and asked the old man behind the
counter for a pack of smokes.

721
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,540
And, when he turned
around she boosted

722
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,876
a candy bar and
stuck it down her pants.

723
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,413
But before she left,

724
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:20,916
she turned around
and gave the kid a huge smile.

725
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,551
Blew him away.

726
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:28,390
He thought,
this chick is hot and crazy.

727
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:30,459
So he rushed out after her,

728
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:32,961
desperate to get the nerves up to
talk to her for the first time,

729
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,931
and then she did the thing
that just owned him.

730
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:39,001
She gave the candy bar to the
homeless guy who lived in the alley.

731
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,470
And right then,
the kid was done.

732
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,772
Whatever it took,
he knew he was gonna marry that girl.

733
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:45,974
And did he?

734
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,754
I'm gonna go jump in the shower.
I don't want to be late.

735
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,357
Let's fuck first.

736
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,424
Mmm.

737
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,399
You sure you don't
want to come with me?

738
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:14,403
As much as I love insurance seminars,
I think I might pass.

739
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,138
Funny. All right,
I'm back at 5:00,

740
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,607
cocktails at 6:00,
and the awards at 7:00.

741
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:19,609
I'll be ready.

742
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,878
Have fun. Thanks.

743
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,460
Oh, I...

744
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:12,928
- I think I'm at...
- Daisy...

745
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,704
Elaine?

746
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:23,806
Hi.

747
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,676
What a... What a surprise.

748
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:28,811
Um...

749
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,880
Daisy, Daisy. This is Elaine.

750
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,116
She's, um...

751
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,987
I knew your dad a long time ago.

752
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,957
You can call me, Laney.

753
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:46,995
Come in, come in!

754
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,706
And this is Daisy's room.

755
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,551
Did you have a dollhouse
when you were little?

756
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:11,753
I did. What color?

757
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,556
Yellow with blue shutters.

758
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,200
That's me, that's Mommy,
and that's Daddy.

759
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:29,872
All right.

760
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,643
Let's snap.

761
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,712
Okay!

762
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,682
Bike helmets, huh?

763
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,085
Yeah, all these laws.

764
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:47,823
All that P.C. garbage.
Keeping our kids safe.

765
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:51,627
Helmets, car seats, this, that.

766
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,028
We didn't have any of this stuff

767
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,031
when you were a kid,
and you came through.

768
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,633
You survived just fine.

769
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,772
Um...

770
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,776
I thought...

771
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:11,680
I thought maybe we would,
uh, come down to the city,

772
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,249
Daisy and me, over the summer.

773
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:20,989
You know,
maybe meet her niece and nephew?

774
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:26,094
Janey and Eli are their names.
Janey and Eli, yeah, right.

775
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:30,232
Uh, I'd like to meet them too.
My grandkids.

776
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,070
And Bruce.

777
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,642
I just, you know, when you're...

778
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,945
When it's the right time.
When you're feeling better.

779
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,915
Who told you?

780
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,652
Your brother calls me from time to time.
He gives me updates.

781
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,193
Why didn't you call me?

782
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:01,063
You were in the hospital.
It didn't seem the right time.

783
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,733
I mean,
the 30 years before that.

784
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,045
She loves that bike.

785
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:19,281
Gave it to her for
her last birthday.

786
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:28,790
When I was her age,
all I cared about was baseball.

787
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,760
I'll never forget when
I hit my first homerun.

788
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,028
Pow!

789
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,063
Brought in three runs.

790
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:38,100
I was so excited I ran all
the way home from school.

791
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:41,703
And, "Ma! Ma! Ma!" I shouted, "Ma!"
I couldn't wait to tell her.

792
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:44,239
I burst right into her bedroom.
Didn't even knock.

793
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,309
And there she was.

794
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,411
Face down on the floor
in a pool of her own vomit.

795
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,786
I never knew that.

796
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:00,022
No. You were too young.

797
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,257
I don't think your...
your mother even knew.

798
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,696
I felt calling you was wrong.

799
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,403
It was too much for me.
The whole family thing.

800
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:19,141
I wasn't ready.
I just couldn't do it.

801
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:23,245
This time, Daisy helps me make her
lunch before she goes to school.

802
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,252
I never knew that would mean something.
Making lunch.

803
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,195
I have to go.
Can I use your bathroom?

804
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,463
Yeah, of course.

805
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:08,290
I really could have given you
a ride back to your hotel.

806
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,225
Give us more time to catch up.

807
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,827
Next time.

808
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:21,470
Bye, Daisy.
It was very nice to meet you.

809
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:23,438
Take good care of
your daddy, okay?

810
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,808
Hey. Can I?

811
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,810
Yeah.

812
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,884
I never stopped
thinking of you, Elaine.

813
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,063
Make it work this time.

814
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,100
Go.

815
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,936
<i>Hi, this is Bruce Brooks.
Please leave a message.</i>

816
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,004
Fuck.

817
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,444
Keep 'em coming.

818
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:11,079
Not a problem.

819
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:12,447
Enjoy the company.

820
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,121
Where are you from?

821
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,959
Minnesota.

822
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,261
Dylan, Prince
or The Replacements?

823
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,232
I went to the same high
school Dylan went to.

824
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,272
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

825
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:38,607
I like crazy.

826
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,343
Forget it.

827
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:45,447
Tell me.

828
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:49,217
Do people tell you, you look like Jesus?
Because you look like Jesus.

829
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,255
Bruce, I'm... I'm so sorry.

830
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,359
I fell asleep by the fireplace.

831
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,297
And, um, when I woke up,
it was over.

832
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:40,168
The ceremony.
And I would have gone over, but I was...

833
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,938
I was nervous because I didn't
want to disappoint you.

834
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,375
But how was it? Were you a hit?

835
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:48,710
I looked for you there, Laney.
You weren't there.

836
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,648
So, now you don't
believe me, is that it?

837
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,317
Yeah. I don't believe you.

838
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,320
Well, Jesus... No.

839
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,190
Do not try to make me
the bad guy here.

840
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:04,392
Saying your lie louder
doesn't make it true.

841
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:16,438
Okay, okay. Okay.

842
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,108
Listen to me, I...

843
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,644
I found a couple Xanax in the
bottom of my purse, and...

844
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:23,678
What the fuck is wrong with you?

845
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,015
Huh?

846
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:29,117
Why is it so easy for you to look
me in the eyes and lie to me? Why?

847
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,186
Huh?

848
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,590
Do you even love me, Laney?
Yes, of course I love you!

849
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,691
It's just not enough, huh?

850
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,433
I'm going to Atlanta,
I've got business there for a few days.

851
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:48,003
I need to clear my head

852
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,271
and figure out
where we go from here.

853
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,173
Well, when are you back?
What about Eli's recital?

854
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,211
I'll be there in time for that.

855
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:59,047
And they can stay with
my sister until then.

856
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:00,482
What, you don't
trust them with me?

857
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,752
No. I don't.

858
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,357
Look, I...

859
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,126
I think this was my fault.
I shouldn't have brought you up here.

860
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:14,596
It was too soon.
No, yeah, it was too soon.

861
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:18,800
I said it was too soon,
and now you're leaving me here.

862
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:22,070
You always seem to find
your way home eventually.

863
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:24,239
I just don't know if I want to
be there this time when you do.

864
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,859
Much has been written
about Beethoven's deafness,

865
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,395
but my favorite
story is this one.

866
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:23,231
After the first
performance of<i> The Ninth...</i>

867
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:26,434
Beethoven just stared
blankly at the orchestra.

868
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,838
A thoughtful musician realized that
he couldn't hear the clapping, so...

869
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,739
Daddy! Daddy!

870
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:35,410
He made Beethoven turn
around to face the audience.

871
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:38,279
Bruce, please.
Why don't you sit with your family?

872
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,814
This isn't Carnegie Hall.

873
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:45,153
It was Beethoven's eyes,
not his ears,

874
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:48,223
that conveyed
the symphony's triumph.

875
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:51,693
And now let's use
our eyes and ears,

876
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:55,163
while we welcome
Eli Brooks to the stage.

877
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:58,299
Eli will be performing the
final movement of<i> The Ninth,</i>

878
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,801
<i>The Ode to Joy.</i>

879
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,617
Come on, Buddy.

880
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,529
Why is Mommy crying?

881
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:37,599
Oh, they're happy tears, baby.

882
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:42,370
You were just spectacular.

883
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:44,672
You were just
so extraordinary, E.

884
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,676
I don't deserve
to be your mother.

885
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:50,812
All right. Who wants a snack?

886
01:10:50,814 --> 01:10:54,249
I do! I do!

887
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,917
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
See you in a minute.

888
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,428
- Mom?
- Mom!

889
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,632
Laney? God, I...

890
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:14,602
I can't find my contact. This is crazy.
Because it's clear. It's...

891
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,438
Hi, Pumpkin.

892
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,610
Oh.

893
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,687
Oh.

894
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,992
Hey. Hey.

895
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,727
I need something to calm down.
What happened?

896
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,163
Um, I don't want
to talk about it.

897
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:23,898
I just... I need something.

898
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,700
Laney, I can't
give you anything.

899
01:13:25,702 --> 01:13:27,402
What kind of person
would that make me?

900
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:28,736
Donny, this is not
the time to moralize.

901
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:29,804
You were just in rehab.

902
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:31,005
And now I'm not.

903
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,777
So, please...

904
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,479
It's all going to be okay.

905
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:39,580
Okay?

906
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,182
Not for me. No.

907
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:43,518
For you though,
you're having a baby!

908
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,752
We'll figure that out.

909
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,114
Suz, what's up?

910
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,950
Okay, I'm on my way.

911
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,152
Honey, everything's
gonna be okay.

912
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:20,054
Tell him Daddy's on the way.

913
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,589
How many people are you gonna
make everything okay for?

914
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,725
I got to go.

915
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:26,527
I know. I know.

916
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,222
Beer.

917
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,827
No Springsteen on the Jukebox?

918
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,100
Springsteen fan?

919
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:43,971
Best musician on the planet.

920
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:46,007
Put Jersey on the map.

921
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:49,577
Frank Sinatra would probably
argue with that, and Bon Jovi...

922
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:50,811
Bon Jovi?

923
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:52,613
All he ever wanted
was to be Bruce.

924
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,118
We all want to be
something better than we are.

925
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,688
So...

926
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,859
So, what?

927
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,047
Lick it. Lick what?

928
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,315
Lick it. Lick my ass.

929
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:32,153
I'm not licking
that fucking ass.

930
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,257
No more, fucker.

931
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:39,894
I'll tell you when it's no more.

932
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:43,831
Fuck!

933
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,032
That hurt?

934
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:49,203
I didn't even feel it.
I didn't feel it.

935
01:16:49,227 --> 01:17:05,227
