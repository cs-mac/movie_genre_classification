1
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,800
DOGTOOTH

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,800
The new words
of the day are:

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Sea ..

4
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,800
highway ...

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
roadtrip ...

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,400
and shotgun.

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,300
"Sea" is the leather chair
with wooden armrests

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,200
like the one in the living room.

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,600
Example:
Don't remain standing,

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,500
sit down in the "sea"
to have a chat.

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,000
"Highway"
is a very strong wind.

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,700
"Roadtrip" is
highly durable material ...

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,100
used to make floors.

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,400
Example:

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,400
The chandelier fell and smashed itself
on the floor,

16
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,300
but the floor was not damaged,

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,100
cause its made
100% of "roadtrip".

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,200
Shotgun.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,600
"Shotgun"
is a beautiful white bird.

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,700
I suggest playing
a game of endurance.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,300
We open the
hot water taps

22
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,800
and each puts his finger
under hot water.

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,100
The one who keeps it there
the longets, wins.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,900
What do you think?

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
I ... I like it.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,700
- And you?
- Me too.

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,400
Should we open all faucets
or just one?

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,100
We can open only one,
if you prefer.

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,300
And how will we time it?

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,400
With a stopwatch
or a clock?

31
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,100
No need for it. We'll all put
our finger under the water.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Whoever removes it last
is the winner

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,100
So we need
all three faucets ?

34
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Just one will do.

35
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,000
with all taps on
one could cheat.

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,600
We could use the big one in
the bathtub. The tap.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,900
And what should we call
this game?

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,600
I don't know ...

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you like the music?
I could change it if you want.

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
No, it's fine.

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't be shy.
If you don't like it just say so.

42
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
No, I like it.

43
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,100
What's your favorite song?

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
I have two.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Have you taken a shower today?

46
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,100
Yes.

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
You washed your hair?

48
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,400
No, I've washed them yesterday.

49
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,900
- Are you dizzy?
- No, I'm fine.

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Are you done?

51
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,900
Christina is here.

52
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,100
- Hi Christina!
- Hi.

53
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
You've lost weight.

54
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Yes, a bit.

55
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,700
Can I stay or am I
interrupting?

56
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,300
Stay. You don't bother me.
In the slightest

57
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,500
What's that on your headband?

58
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,400
Phosphorescent stones.

59
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Phosphorescent?

60
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,800
They light up in the dark.

61
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Without plugging them in?

62
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,800
Yes.

63
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
You're lying?

64
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
I swear!

65
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,900
Where did you get it?

66
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,900
I made it.

67
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,800
Congrats.

68
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,600
Thank you.

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,300
Do you have a headband?

70
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,600
I have. A brown one.
But I gave it to my little sister

71
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,500
in exchange for a pair of socks
and two rubber erasers.

72
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,100
The socks you wear?

73
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,300
No, not those.

74
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,800
These are pretty too.

75
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you.

76
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
will you stay for dinner?

77
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
No, I have go.

78
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,000
Too bad, we're having burger.

79
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,000
Burger is one of my favorite dishes.

80
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,500
What other food do you like?

81
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,600
Fish soup
and cheese pie.

82
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,300
Fish soup and cheese pie
are the best.

83
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,300
- I had soup yesterday.
- Great.

84
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,100
I added apple
in the juice.

85
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,900
It's delicious.

86
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,600
Unfortunately I'll have to go.

87
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,200
Could we shoot a video together?

88
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,300
Yes, we don't have  one
with Christina in it.

89
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
Is it okay if we shoot a video?

90
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,700
Not at all.

91
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,800
Daddy, could I sit
next to Christina?

92
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,800
Yes, sweetie.

93
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,300
Could you smile a bit more Christina?

94
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Consider a triangle whose angles
are 36, 77 and 67 degrees.

95
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,500
Side A is 12.8cm long

96
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,700
side C is 9.7 cm long.

97
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,700
Calculate the triangle's area,
the length of the B side

98
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,500
and the type of triangle.

99
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
Good luck!

100
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,200
We know that a fish is not fresh
if the eyes are not:

101
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,700
A: Muddy.

102
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,300
B: Big

103
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,800
C: Red.

104
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,500
Good luck.

105
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,400
If it's 11 pm, and we have't
managed to fall asleep,

106
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,300
what is the procedure to follow?

107
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,500
Good luck.

108
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,400
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

109
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,200
- Should I wait for you?
- Yes.

110
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,100
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

111
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,100
And from behind?

112
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
It's perfect.

113
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I think the skirt doesn't match
the blouse.

114
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,300
- How many do you have?
- 37.

115
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,900
- If you cheat, they'll find out.
- I have 37. And you?

116
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
52.

117
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,700
- You might have the most.
- No way.

118
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,100
- More salad?
- No.

119
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,300
We're out of iodine, and
the antihistamines, have expired

120
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
and I'm out of bandages too.

121
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
I'll make you a list.
When you can.

122
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,900
As you wish honey.

123
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,100
Dad, I need brown color
for your eyebrows.

124
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Didn't I brought you some
last week?

125
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,100
I've consumed it.
I absolutely need it..

126
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,900
I can't paint your eyebrows blue.
It would be untruthful.

127
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll bring some more.

128
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
- Lemon?
- No, thank you.

129
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,900
We're also out of meat.
You should buy some.

130
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Mom, can you
pass me the phone, please?

131
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,100
Thank you.

132
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,900
- Did you do the count?
- I have 76.

133
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,700
I have 52.

134
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,400
37.

135
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Girls, you must try harder.

136
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Your brother is the winner once more.

137
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,800
That means, he will choose
our entertainment for tonight.

138
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,100
But I have a surprise for you.

139
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,900
Something unprecedented.

140
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,200
The next reward won't be
just 1 or 2 stickers,

141
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
but 10!

142
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,000
So You must do your best.

143
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
You understand how important it is.

144
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes, absolutely.

145
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
The winner will tell us
how to spend the evening.

146
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,900
I choose the video.

147
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
We haven't watched a video
for quite some time.

148
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,200
Today is a good opportunity.

149
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Dad, can I use the hose as well?

150
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Run!

151
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Oh! Beware!

152
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,000
Look there is a dead plant there.

153
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Look there's more.

154
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,500
An airplane, Dad!

155
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,500
Can you bring me a wet cloth?

156
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Where is it, Mom?

157
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,800
In the closet, under the sink.

158
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,300
Be careful so you don't bring me
a clean, dust cloth.

159
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,600
Wait! It might fall down.

160
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,100
Careful!

161
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,500
How nice!
I want to see too.

162
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
I wash it better than you.

163
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,500
I also clean the floor mats
and tires.

164
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,800
I never forget the car deodorant.
Except once.

165
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,200
It had such a great smell.
I thought..

166
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,200
I had sprayed some already.

167
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,000
You, you never did,

168
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,100
and you didn't do the mats

169
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,300
when they had difficult stains
like mud or tar.

170
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,100
i wish you could see
how good I wash it.

171
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,300
You'd cry! If you could see.

172
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,400
He's by the fence again.

173
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,600
He started it
He threw stones at me.

174
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,300
Your brother
would never do such a thing.

175
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Not yet.
I'll tell you when.

176
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,400
Wait a bit.

177
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,500
Go ahead, spit.

178
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Oh, I wish it would fall!

179
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
If it falls,
it will be mine.

180
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,000
if it falls, the one who deserves it
will have it.

181
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,500
- Hello.
- How are you?

182
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
Good. My leg hurts a bit.

183
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
When will you be back at the house?

184
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,800
I'll have to check my shifts.
I think afternoon is best, next week.

185
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,900
Do you use the perfume
I gave you?

186
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,800
Yes.

187
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,900
Does it smell good?

188
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
It smells very good.

189
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,100
Good morning.
Mr. Petrou is asking for you.

190
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,400
- When did you last watered the plant?
- Two weeks ago.

191
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,400
- Do it every week.
- OK. Should I tell him to come over?

192
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,500
- No, I'm going to him.
- Good.

193
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,400
I have a belly ache
since yesterday evening.

194
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
Where exactly?

195
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,500
In the upper right.
It might be appendicitis.

196
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,700
Appendicitis is down, right.

197
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,500
- Does it hurt here?
- No.

198
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,100
There?

199
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
- There?
- No.

200
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,200
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

201
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,100
- No fruit and vegetables.
- I drank some milk.

202
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,200
It's okay.
Avoid doing much today.

203
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,700
- Will you'll give me some pills?
- No need for it.

204
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,500
If you follow my instructions,
you'll be better.

205
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Otherwise your condition will worsen.

206
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,900
Get up? Do you want to play something?

207
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
We have about 20 minutes free.

208
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
I have a new anesthetic.
Should we try it?

209
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,500
Yes.

210
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,400
The one who wakes up first,
wins.

211
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,900
Don't put more on mine.

212
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,900
One, two, three.

213
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,600
It's almost done. it just need
tiles and lights.

214
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,400
I can't chose between those two.

215
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,200
- Those.
- I prefer the other.

216
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,500
These are good too.

217
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
- How's your wife?
- No change.

218
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,600
Do you go out at all?

219
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,600
No.

220
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
You should, I told you.
Even in a wheelchair.

221
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,500
She is ashamed.
She doesn't wants visitors either.

222
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,300
You know haw many times I asked her
to invite you over? A 100 or more.

223
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I understand your situation.

224
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,400
What happened to her is tragic

225
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,000
It takes great courage to overcome it.

226
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,200
And she looks so alive in the photo.

227
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,100
She was volleyball champion, right?

228
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,400
Handball.

229
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,400
So, you prefer these, ha?

230
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,700
Yes, but those are good too.

231
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,100
Hello?

232
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,200
I was in a meeting.
In  a meeting, yes.

233
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,300
Did they go in the yard?
Did they compete?

234
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,300
What's wrong with her?
The belly or the stomach?

235
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Yes, it's a bit cold.

236
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I would like to take my dog.

237
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,800
Sorry, it's impossible.

238
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,000
He's still in the 2nd stage of training.

239
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,100
I'll show you.

240
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,500
1st, 2nd stage,

241
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,200
the one your dog is in,
3rd, 4th, 5th and final stage.

242
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
Let me explain.

243
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,400
A dog is like clay.

244
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,700
Our job here
is to shape it.

245
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,000
A dog can be dynamic,

246
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,800
aggressive, a fighter,
coward or affectionate.

247
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,500
It requires work, patience,
and attention from us.

248
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,500
Every dog, your dog is waiting
from us to teach him

249
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,100
how to behave.

250
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,100
You understand?

251
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,000
We, we are here to determine

252
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,300
what behavior
the dog should have.

253
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,900
Do you want a pet,
or a friend? a companion?

254
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,600
Or a keeper
that respects its master

255
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,900
and obeys our orders?

256
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,600
Do you understand?

257
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,100
I do.

258
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,400
Rex!

259
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,200
Rex!

260
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,100
1 min 15.

261
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
2 min.

262
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,100
2 mins 30.

263
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,300
2 mins 45.

264
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,700
3 min 15.

265
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
3 min 45.

266
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
4 min 30.

267
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,300
5 min 15.

268
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,000
5 min 30.

269
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,200
What do you mean, you can't?

270
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,500
Sorry.

271
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,700
It's not for me, but for you
that we do this.

272
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,300
Sorry.

273
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,300
Try again, with your tongue,
otherwise it's no use

274
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,100
Don't tell Dad.

275
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,800
- It disgusts you?
- No.

276
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,700
So?

277
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,100
I prefer what we did the other time.

278
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,000
Hello.

279
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
What are you doing?

280
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,200
I clean the carpet
to eliminate bacteria.

281
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,100
- Do you want my head clamp?
- Very much.

282
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,700
What will you give me in return?

283
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,400
You want this pencil?
It has an eraser at the end.

284
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,600
No.

285
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,800
This measuring tape?

286
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,800
You press here
and it contracts back .

287
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,700
No.

288
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,700
Come close and lick me here.
Then it's yours.

289
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,800
Does it disgusts you?

290
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,300
No.

291
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,900
- Shall we dance?
- I'm not in the mood.

292
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,900
And we don't have enough time.
We must see mom in a little while.

293
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,200
Mom will be late.
She talks to herself again.

294
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,500
Stop it.

295
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
You get scared when mom
talks alone in her room.

296
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
No.

297
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
- Yes, you are.
- Wrong.

298
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,200
- But you are.
- No.

299
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,900
You can't hear her
She might talk about you.

300
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,700
She doesn't talk about me!

301
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,000
If I gave you a gift,
will you'll lick me?

302
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,600
- What kind of gift?
- A headband.

303
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
I have one already.

304
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,900
This one is phosphorescent.

305
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,000
What does that mean?

306
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,300
It glitters in the dark.

307
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,300
Where did you get it ?

308
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,000
I can't tell you.

309
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,200
Do our parents know you have it?

310
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,200
No.

311
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,300
It can become yours, very easily.

312
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,300
Where do you want me to lick you?

313
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,200
At the shoulder.

314
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,500
You'll buy chocolates?

315
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,800
Only if there's it's on your way.

316
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,400
Any kind.

317
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,300
Yes those are good.

318
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,900
Me too.

319
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,900
This is not your.

320
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
Leave me alone.

321
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,900
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes.

322
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,000
You can ask Dad to get it for you
with the car.

323
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
That's what I would do.

324
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,700
There is no other way.

325
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,400
Daddy!

326
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,500
The eldest threw the plane
over the wall. Could you get it?

327
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,300
- Where is it?
- Right outside.

328
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,800
I'll try.

329
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,000
How did it happened?

330
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,000
What did you tell them?

331
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,700
Good.

332
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,100
I'll tell them, too.

333
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,000
It's a good opportunity.

334
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,500
Yes.

335
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,600
The temperature will rise
and the wind will fall.

336
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,400
5 or 6 degrees.

337
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,300
OK.

338
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,900
No, it's time to put an end to it.
Its exhausting for everyone

339
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,700
I agree.
You're absolutely right.

340
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,700
Yes.

341
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,500
Your brother is dead.

342
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,500
A creature like the one
in the garden tore hip apart.

343
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
On one hand...

344
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,500
he made a huge mistake,
venturing out ill prepared..

345
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,700
On the other hand, he was my son
and I feel sorry for him

346
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,800
The animal that threatens us
is  a "cat".

347
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,000
The most dangerous animal
there is

348
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,400
He eats meat.
Children's flesh in particular.

349
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,700
After lacerating it's victims
with its claws,

350
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,700
It devours them with sharp teeth.

351
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,100
The face and whole body
of the victim

352
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,400
If you stay inside,
you are protected

353
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,800
We have to be ready.

354
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,900
in case it invades the house
or the garden.

355
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,400
Our dear brother

356
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,000
we're sorry
you couldn't kill the cat,

357
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,500
as I did.

358
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,700
We will miss you ...

359
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
despite the mistakes
you did

360
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,100
It's a pity

361
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,400
that this would happen to you

362
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,500
and I wasn't able to use
my knowledge to save you.

363
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,300
My dear brother,
I would have never imagine

364
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,000
that things could go so wrong.

365
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,000
I hoped that you'd survive
on the supplies i secured for you.

366
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,900
But there are too many dangers.

367
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,900
I'm so sad ...

368
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,700
You press three times on the
chest. With force.

369
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,500
One

370
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,900
two

371
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,200
three.

372
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Then you block the nose,

373
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,300
open the mouth
and you blow.

374
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,000
I am pregnant.

375
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,800
A boy and a girl.
Twins.

376
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,800
How about two boys?

377
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,800
No, a girl and boy.

378
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,900
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

379
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,500
How about triplets?

380
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,300
It would be too much.

381
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,100
You're right. Twins.

382
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,600
The same thing on your backs.

383
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,000
The same thing facing front.

384
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,400
O.K.

385
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,500
Dive in.

386
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,900
Ready?

387
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,500
3, 2, 1, go!

388
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,900
Soon,

389
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,300
your mother will give birth to
two children and a dog.

390
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,800
I know some of you will resent

391
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,900
having to share a room

392
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,400
clothes, or even toys.

393
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,200
But

394
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,200
you must look on the bright:

395
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,600
You'll have two more people
to care for you.

396
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,400
The family will grow bigger

397
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,200
And I want us to applaud
your mother for this big gift.

398
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't want to share
my room.

399
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,400
If you're a good girl,
you will not have to.

400
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,900
I will be good.

401
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,900
I don't want to share either.

402
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,000
If your behavior
and your performance improves,

403
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,700
I may not have to give birth.

404
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,400
But if things don't change,
I will have no other choice.

405
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,900
But I won't hear a thing
about the dog.

406
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,100
He will be born as soon as possible

407
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,100
Great, darling,
bravo to you all.

408
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,800
Dry yourself and come get your reward.

409
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,200
Dry your hands,
or it won't stick anymore.

410
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,200
One more thing.

411
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,200
Your performance was worse
than last time

412
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,900
I shouldn't say more..

413
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,700
Oh! A plane.

414
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,200
It fell in the garden.

415
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,300
Not so hard, you're hurting me.

416
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,900
Like that?

417
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,300
Softer.

418
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,200
Like this?

419
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,300
Good.

420
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,500
You want me to lick you
so you'll give me gift?

421
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,500
I have nothing to give you.

422
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,800
It's okay.

423
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,300
here's a nice spot.

424
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,500
Good morning, Dad.

425
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,700
Good morning.
How many hours did you sleep

426
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,300
About 9.

427
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,900
Be careful of the pinky!

428
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,500
Daddy!

429
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,600
There are two fish
in the pool.

430
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,600
What kind?

431
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,300
I think they're sargos
but I'm not sure.

432
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,200
You should catch them.
Mom will be so glad if I'm right.

433
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,100
I'll be there in a minute.

434
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,500
There's three of them.

435
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,000
It was just two before.
the third probably just swam in.

436
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,900
The most creative time
for man is ...?

437
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,000
Between 30 and 40 years of age.

438
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,500
And for women?

439
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,200
Between 20 and 30.

440
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,800
A child is ready to leave
his house when ...?

441
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,900
When the right dogtooth falls off.

442
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Or the left one, doesn't really matter.

443
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,500
At that time,
the body is ready

444
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,500
to face all dangers.

445
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,400
To leave the house in safety

446
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,500
one should use the car.

447
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,300
When can one
learn to drive?

448
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,100
When the right dogtooth grows back.

449
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,500
Or the left, it doesn't really matter.

450
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,800
Mom,
what is a "cunt"?

451
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,100
Where did you learn that word?

452
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,300
On a case on top of the VCR.

453
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,500
A cunt is a large lamp.

454
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,500
Example:

455
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,200
The cunt switched of,
and the room got all dark.

456
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,000
Do you want to hear
your grandfather singing?

457
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,000
Yes

458
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,700
Dad loves us.

459
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,300
Mom loves us.

460
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,500
Do we love them?

461
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,300
Yes, we love them.

462
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I love my brothers and sisters

463
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,400
because they love me too.

464
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,500
Spring fills my house.

465
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,300
Spring floods...

466
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,800
my little heart.

467
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,900
My parents are proud of me,

468
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,600
because I do my best.

469
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,300
But I'm always trying
to do better.

470
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,500
My house, you're beautiful
and I love you.

471
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,200
And never ...

472
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,300
I will never leave you.

473
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,200
I dreamed of you the other day.

474
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,000
I was in a forest
with your father.

475
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,400
In the evening
we grilled potatoes.

476
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,800
Suddenly, we heard
noise in a bush.

477
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,800
It was you ... you were a zombie.

478
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,000
Your father and I,
we threw stones at you.

479
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,000
- But we couldn't hit you.
- What was I?

480
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,000
A zombie.

481
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,200
- You know what a zombie is?
- Yes.

482
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,700
- Do you see dreams?
- Sure.

483
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,200
Tell me a recent one.

484
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,800
I saw Mom falling
in the pool.

485
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,500
And then what?

486
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,600
Nothing. Just that.

487
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,500
I've brought
another gift. Hair gel.

488
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,800
You put it in your hair to model it.

489
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,300
I don't like it.

490
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,000
What do you mean?

491
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,800
I do not like this gift.
Besides, I don't believe you.

492
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,400
You said that the headband
sparkled. It was a Lie.

493
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,000
It's true! It sparkles.

494
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,100
You did something wrong.

495
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,600
I don't believe you.

496
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,100
Look here.

497
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,800
Look at me.

498
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,200
Look.

499
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,300
If you want me to lick you,
you have to offer me something better.

500
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,100
I have nothing else.

501
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,600
I want these.

502
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,100
I can't give them to you.

503
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,100
- I want them.
- Impossible.

504
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,100
Then you must leave.

505
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,200
I can't give them to you.

506
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,100
Get out.
I will never lick youagain!

507
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,500
And I'll tell my parents

508
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,900
you gave me a headband.
And that you asked me to lick you

509
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,000
down low, at your keyboard.
And all that happened.

510
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,700
You know what dad do if he finds out
that I lick your keyboard?

511
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,500
You should give them back to me
next week.

512
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,400
Mommy, what's a zombie?

513
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,100
Where did you hear this word?

514
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,200
Don't remember. Dad probably said it.

515
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,000
A zombie
is a small yellow flower.

516
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,200
What are you doing there?

517
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,600
I couldn't sleep.
I'm nervous.

518
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,700
I'm afraid.

519
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,800
If you won't go out in the garden alone
nothing will happen to you.

520
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,200
I won't let anything happen to you.

521
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,700
Dad, I want to learn how to fight.

522
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,400
What did you say? I can't hear you.

523
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,800
When do I learn to fight?

524
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,300
You can shut down your robot?

525
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I'll fight, so you won't have to.

526
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,900
You need to use your head
for something else

527
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,900
than a punching bag.
Like I do.

528
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,900
Your head does not look
like a punching bag.

529
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,600
No.

530
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,400
That's good. Thanks.

531
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,700
It looks like
a baseball glove.

532
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,200
You're a wise guy, ha?

533
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,700
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone.

534
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,000
There are all kinds of sharks.

535
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,500
Hammerhead,

536
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,700
the blue shark, mako,
white shark.

537
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,500
it's unlikely that those fools
got the right one ...

538
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,500
This kind of shark
does not live here.

539
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,200
Highly unlikely.

540
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,500
I don't mean that
this is not the shark we look for.

541
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,600
I think it is, Martin.

542
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,000
He's a man-eater.

543
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,200
Man-eater!

544
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,500
His jaws do not correspond
to the bites on the victim.

545
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,900
I want to be sure.
So do you.

546
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,800
We all want to be sure,
No?

547
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,000
Anyone else seen them?

548
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,300
No. Nobody.

549
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,900
Bring me the masking tape.

550
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,400
I want you to call me Bruce.

551
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,400
What is Bruce?

552
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,300
A name.

553
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,500
When you call me Bruce,
I'll respond

554
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,100
I also want a name like this.

555
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,900
Choose a new one.
Whatever you want.

556
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,800
I want to be called Backbone.

557
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,600
You can't be called that.

558
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,500
A backbone is a backbone.

559
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,700
Bruce!

560
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,100
Bruce!

561
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,600
Bruce!

562
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,000
Bruce!

563
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,100
Your house is  very nice.
Just as we pictured it.

564
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,800
Thank you.

565
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,900
Where is the perfume
I gave you?

566
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,400
In the bathroom.

567
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,000
It is a very good perfume

568
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,100
My wife insisted that we should buy
that perfume as a present for you

569
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,300
At first, we were thinking
of getting you a vase.

570
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,800
but we thought it would not
find it's place in your house.

571
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,500
You live here alone?

572
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,700
Yes. My parents live on the 4th.

573
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,600
I wish your children get all the
wrong stimuli and grow to be bad.

574
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,800
I wish it with all my heart.

575
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,200
Let this be the punishment
for your wrongdoings to my family.

576
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,100
She hit me with a hammer!

577
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,000
He's lying, it wasn't me!

578
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,400
I just saw a cat with a hammer
jumping out the window.

579
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:54,900
She did it.

580
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,100
The pain makes you delirious.

581
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,000
He needs a plaster
and painkillers.

582
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,300
It must be broken, Dad.

583
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,000
Did you do like we said?

584
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,900
You have taken precautions?

585
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,100
He didn't have time, dad.

586
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,900
From what i saw
it was a really fast cat.

587
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,800
Very, very fast.

588
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,700
You spend less time
with children.

589
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,400
Don't cry.
The children will see you.

590
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,600
Have you've combed your hair today?

591
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,800
Yes.

592
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,900
I had a hard day.

593
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:07,800
We'll have to replace Christina.

594
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,100
We can't trust anyone.

595
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,700
Nobody should come here anymore.

596
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,500
I think about handing the task
to our elder daughter.

597
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,600
Unless we let him
decide for himself.

598
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,100
That's maybe better.

599
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,800
If you do it again,
I'll gut you, you bitch.

600
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,100
I swear on my daughter's life

601
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,900
that you and your gang

602
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,200
will soon flee the neighborhood.

603
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,400
Mom!

604
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,500
I found
two little zombies.

605
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,200
Should I bring them?

606
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,900
Mom!

607
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,100
Mom!

608
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,200
Today is our wedding anniversary.

609
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,600
To celebrate,
we'll eat cake

610
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,300
and decorate the house
with lights and balloons.

611
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,400
Sit up.

612
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,300
I think my dogtooth is shaky.

613
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,700
I don't think so.
It doesn't even move.

614
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,200
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Great.

615
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,200
Dad, I'm tired.
Can I stop now?

616
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,000
Yes, my darling, if you can't keep on.

617
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,000
Enough!

618
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,400
Dad, you'll give me
the spear gun?

619
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,700
I've already said,
it is dangerous.

620
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,000
I can lick you ear
if you want.

621
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,200
Bruce!

622
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,000
Bruce!

623
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,300
I'll go get the dog tomorrow.

624
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,200
The 5th stage of training
must be completed by now.

625
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,500
If you don't drink your orange juice
while it's fresh, it's no use.
