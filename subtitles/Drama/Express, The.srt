1
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,979
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

2
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:22,419
Private Miller...

3
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:25,459
...you've been smoking ltem 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

4
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,499
We're going to ask you
several questions.

5
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,659
How do you feel?

6
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,939
Well, sir...

7
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:32,779
...I feel like a...

8
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,899
Like a slice of butter...

9
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:42,179
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

10
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:45,659
Yeah.

11
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:49,059
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

12
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,979
...what emotions do you feel?

13
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,299
Okay, Private Miller?

14
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:04,779
Is this normal?

15
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:06,539
Okay, Private...

16
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,339
Okay, Private Miller?

17
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,059
Private Miller.

18
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,859
Answer the question.

19
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:22,899
This went out, sir.

20
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,619
Can you torch me?

21
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,299
We'll send someone in.

22
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,499
Holy bejesus!

23
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,699
Private Miller, answer the question.

24
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,339
What was the question again, sir?

25
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:44,779
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

26
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,619
You know what problem I have...

27
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,979
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

28
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:53,379
Here it is. One: lots of dudes.

29
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,939
Where are the boobies?

30
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,379
Two: Why are we
underground right now, sir?

31
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,619
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

32
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,939
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know ltem 9 exists?

33
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,579
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

34
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,019
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, ltem 9!"

35
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,819
Private, we need you to be serious.

36
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,539
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

37
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,139
That's inappropriate.

38
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,059
Fuck you!

39
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,739
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

40
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,379
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

41
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,779
This never happened.

42
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,499
Dude, what happened to your eye?

43
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,659
Hello.

44
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,899
Can you guys understand me?

45
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,819
- Hey. Hey, where we going?
- This is General Brat.

46
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,619
We've reached
a final conclusion on ltem 9.

47
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,779
Illegal!

48
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,939
<i>Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.</i>

49
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,659
<i>Welcome to KRAD.</i>

50
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,619
<i>You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.</i>

51
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,379
<i>Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.</i>

52
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,339
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

53
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,699
<i>- Here's my piece.
- All right.</i>

54
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,499
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

55
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,619
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

56
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,539
Everyone likes smoking weed.

57
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,019
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

58
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:22,259
<i>It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.</i>

59
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,619
<i>It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.</i>

60
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,539
<i>It makes shitty movies better,
you know?</i>

61
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,339
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

62
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,499
Yeah.

63
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:44,099
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

64
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,499
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

65
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,739
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

66
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,579
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

67
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,099
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
- Sorry.

68
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,739
<i>I'm just saying love has no age.</i>

69
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,979
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

70
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,019
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

71
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,539
I'm dating a high-school girl.

72
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,259
<i>You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?</i>

73
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,659
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

74
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,819
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

75
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,939
<i>- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.</i>

76
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,939
Yo, you been served.

77
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,419
You've been served.
You've been served.

78
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,539
You've been served.

79
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,259
Walter Wadska the third.

80
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,699
You here to fix the fax machine?

81
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:38,939
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

82
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,379
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

83
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,059
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

84
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,099
- Hey, "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

85
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,259
- Take that shit to the next level, eh?
- Okay, I will.

86
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,739
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

87
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,299
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

88
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,459
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

89
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:24,059
And now because of that,
you've been served.

90
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,259
You're a jerk.

91
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,379
All this current system is doing...

92
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,659
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

93
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:33,379
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

94
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,859
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

95
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,939
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

96
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,899
<i>Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.</i>

97
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,739
I can't come.

98
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,019
What?

99
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,139
Why the fuck not, Dale?

100
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:02,539
I just... Look, I can't come.

101
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,339
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

102
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,539
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When were you gonna tell me?

103
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,179
My mom has been shopping all day.

104
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,179
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

105
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,179
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

106
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,259
- Now I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

107
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,059
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

108
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,579
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

109
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,139
Don't come. I don't care.

110
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:26,459
Then why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

111
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,819
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

112
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,419
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

113
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,979
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

114
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,219
You're great, and you're funny...

115
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,219
...and you're sexy.

116
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,699
I just want them to see that.

117
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,419
- You want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey, people?

118
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,099
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

119
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,179
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

120
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,219
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

121
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,219
- I'm with her, actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

122
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,499
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

123
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,939
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,579
I'm just wondering why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

125
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,659
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,299
- Angie, hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

127
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,459
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

128
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,259
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

129
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,979
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

130
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,939
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

131
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,579
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

132
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,179
I wish.

133
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,779
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

134
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,379
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

135
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,859
Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:28,379
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

137
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,899
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

138
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,459
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,619
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Sporty Spice?

140
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,979
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

141
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,539
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

142
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,739
I've heard so much about you.
You're real cool.

143
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:41,059
- I mean, you're great. Yeah.
- Yeah, awesome.

144
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,859
Anyways, yeah, dude, next year.
Next year college, man. College.

145
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,219
Gonna be kick-ass.
I will watch her back for you.

146
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,139
I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

147
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,139
- Oh, good.
- Because I got that... Yeah.

148
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,859
You got her ass? Perfect.

149
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,779
- I'll watch her ass for...
- He's trying to be nice.

150
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,939
- I'll catch you at Home Ec.
- Okay.

151
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,139
You guys got Home Ec
together too. That's cool.

152
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,499
- We got a few classes together.
- Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:08,339
Time to suck today's dick. That's what
I'm talking about. See you guys later.

154
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,299
- All right, Clark.
- Clark's a great guy.

155
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,459
He's totally gonna take care
of Angela, man.

156
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,659
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

157
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:17,979
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

158
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,179
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

159
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,499
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I want...

160
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,859
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

161
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,659
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

162
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,459
...or I call the liaison officer.

163
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,619
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

164
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,779
What a jerk.

165
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,579
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

166
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,659
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

167
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,699
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

168
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,619
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

169
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,619
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

170
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,019
Yeah, I wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

171
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:50,859
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

172
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,779
That means so much to me
and my parents.

173
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,819
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

174
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,859
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?</i>

175
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,899
<i>- Come on down.
- Sweet. Be there.</i>

176
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,699
<i>- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.</i>

177
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:07,339
<i>I thought the hurricane season
was over.</i>

178
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,099
I thought hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,979
<i>I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand.</i>

180
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,419
<i>Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.</i>

181
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,099
Hello? Hey, man.

182
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,939
What the fuck, man?

183
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,619
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

184
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:25,819
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when l...

185
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,019
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

186
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,739
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

187
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,859
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

188
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,379
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know your protocol yet.

189
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,699
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

190
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,699
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

191
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,779
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

192
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,059
Yo, check this out.

193
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,939
Satellite radio.

194
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,939
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

195
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,339
That's home entertainment.

196
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,579
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

197
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,779
<i>Oh, yeah. Me and my bubbe.</i>

198
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,779
Hey, let me ask you something.

199
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:03,219
Yeah?

200
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:07,419
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

201
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,579
Like, euthanasia?

202
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:13,579
Like, on her?

203
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,499
If I needed to.

204
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,219
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

205
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,939
I don't know if we should
start going down that road.

206
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,939
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

207
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,579
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

208
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,979
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

209
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,539
Business for the businessman.

210
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,699
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

211
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,219
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

212
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:39,659
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

213
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:41,619
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:44,739
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

215
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,379
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

216
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:50,939
...and they had a baby.

217
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,819
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

218
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,499
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

219
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,979
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

220
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,219
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

221
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,619
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

222
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,059
- Smell it.
- Okay.

223
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,419
Smell it. Enjoy.

224
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:13,659
It's like God's vagina.

225
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,499
What, you wanna bathe in it?

226
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:18,459
- I wanna live in here.
- You wanna be it?

227
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,619
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

228
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:23,779
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

229
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,179
Beautiful. What's it called?

230
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,379
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

231
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,459
It's this thing, like, El Niño.

232
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:32,499
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

233
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,419
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

234
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,819
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

235
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:40,539
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

236
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:42,219
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

237
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,019
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

238
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,099
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,539
Let me get my scale.

240
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,939
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

241
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,779
I thought hurricane season
was over.

242
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,859
Oh, crow.

243
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,779
Where are you, you little fucker?

244
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,259
What the fuck is this thing?

245
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,779
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,219
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

247
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,379
- Yeah, man.
- No.

248
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,539
This is the future.

249
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:20,339
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

250
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,619
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

251
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,259
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

252
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,579
My second favorite civil engineer...

253
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:32,459
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

254
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,259
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

255
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,579
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

256
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:43,619
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

257
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,899
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

258
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,979
Future. The future.

259
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,579
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

260
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,539
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

261
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,459
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

262
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:00,339
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

263
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,219
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

264
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,419
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

265
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,259
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

266
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,179
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

267
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,379
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

268
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,339
I need your help, man.

269
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,699
- I'm in.
- Come on!

270
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:18,539
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

271
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,499
Why not? What do I do?

272
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,779
Okay, here's what you do.

273
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,579
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

274
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,099
- Equip me, sir.
- Okay.

275
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,939
You are going to light these two ends
while I light this end.

276
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,779
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

277
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,699
- Ready.
- Blast off.

278
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,659
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

279
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,659
It's better to cough.

280
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,259
It's like...

281
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,979
Makes you 10 times more higher...

282
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,299
...than the cross weed
and the Pineapple Express.

283
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,099
<i>You're like,
totally fucking Gong Show'ed, man.</i>

284
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,859
Oh, fuck.

285
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,459
Hang on one second, man.

286
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,579
Oh, you fucker.

287
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,499
Who is it?

288
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,419
<i>It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.</i>

289
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,739
Shit.

290
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,419
What's a Gebert?

291
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,099
Come on up.

292
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,459
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

293
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:51,819
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

294
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:54,979
Hey.

295
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,059
So listen, man.

296
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,539
I gotta ask you. So...

297
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,499
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, two months, right?

298
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,859
- Two months.
- I gotta ask, man.

299
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,499
What's up with the suit?

300
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:10,339
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

301
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:14,699
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

302
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,979
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No, I'm not...

303
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,059
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

304
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,659
- I like...
- In process.

305
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,699
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

306
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,779
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

307
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:29,019
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

308
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,819
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

309
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,139
...so I can serve them the papers.

310
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,299
Disguise.

311
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:37,539
Kind of, I guess.

312
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,659
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

313
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,819
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

314
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,379
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

315
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,939
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

316
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,659
Nice.

317
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,179
What? You sucked on her titties?

318
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,259
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

319
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,819
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

320
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,019
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

321
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,819
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

322
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,739
She's cool as hell, actually.

323
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,579
- You'd get along with her.
- Really?

324
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:09,339
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

325
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:13,099
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

326
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,579
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

327
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:18,499
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

328
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:23,459
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

329
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,739
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

330
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:28,179
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

331
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,939
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

332
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,379
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

333
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:35,579
You get to smoke weed all day.

334
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,059
I wish I had that.

335
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:40,419
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

336
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:43,539
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

337
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:46,059
You didn't think of that.

338
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,179
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

339
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:49,539
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

340
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,259
Thank you.

341
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:54,419
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

342
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:57,299
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,899
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

344
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,379
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

345
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,619
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

346
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,059
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

347
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,459
All right, homes. Good.

348
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,659
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

349
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,739
You got the dough? There you go.

350
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,939
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

351
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,379
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

352
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,779
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

353
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:19,939
- Chris.
- Chris.

354
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,819
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

355
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:24,339
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

356
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,619
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well, I...

357
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,619
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

358
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,539
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

359
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:32,899
- Thank...
- God.

360
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,979
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,899
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

362
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,379
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

363
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:39,979
Fuck.

364
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,619
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

365
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:46,219
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

366
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:48,979
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,259
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

368
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,419
...and process and service?

369
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:56,979
I don't know. It's always
something different, I guess.

370
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,379
This guy...

371
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,139
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

372
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,459
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

373
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:07,259
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

374
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,259
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

375
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:10,419
That'd be weird.

376
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:13,019
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

377
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:16,579
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

378
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,979
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

379
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:21,659
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

380
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,819
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

381
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,979
That sounds appealing,
but you know what? I'll tell... Here...

382
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:48,616
I'm gonna run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

383
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:51,456
<i>- We'll watch 227 and shit.
- Definitely.</i>

384
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:53,416
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

385
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:54,696
- Peace, brother.
- Okay.

386
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,296
One love.

387
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:56,856
<i>When you got behind
on the mortgage...</i>

388
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,456
<i>When you got behind
on the mortgage...</i>

389
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,336
<i>... someone finally
made you a loan?</i>

390
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:01,536
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

391
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:04,216
<i>Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you got?</i>

392
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:08,776
<i>- It was 12 or 13 percent.
- That's disgusting.</i>

393
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,816
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

394
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:21,536
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

395
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:25,056
<i>I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.</i>

396
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:28,216
<i>Like, so excited. And so am I,
but we're all really excited.</i>

397
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:29,376
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

398
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,776
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

399
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:35,456
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

400
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:40,136
<i>Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over.</i>

401
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:43,056
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

402
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:45,096
Fucking cops. Shit.

403
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,616
Jesus.

404
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:00,536
What an adorable little cop.

405
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:02,536
Weird.

406
00:21:07,256 --> 00:21:08,696
Jesus. Fuck.

407
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:10,816
What the fuck was that?

408
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,176
Oh, shit.

409
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,856
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

410
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,016
Oh, no!

411
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:31,536
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

412
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,616
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

413
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,256
Pineapple Express.

414
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:08,176
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

415
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,776
I saw brains and blood!

416
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:11,336
Come on! Come on!

417
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,536
Where do I go?

418
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:29,256
Hello?

419
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,096
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

420
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:33,616
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

421
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:36,456
<i>- It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man.
- Dale?</i>

422
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:39,136
<i>Yes, Dale. That's what I said.
It's Dale. Let me in.</i>

423
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:41,296
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

424
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:47,216
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

425
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:49,136
<i>Buzz it in three seconds exactly.</i>

426
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:51,656
One, two...

427
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:53,776
- Did it work?
- On three!

428
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:56,656
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

429
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:58,536
<i>Just on three.</i>

430
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:10,576
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey, I got neighbors.

431
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:12,136
He fucking killed him.

432
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:15,176
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

433
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:18,296
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

434
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,416
No, it was just a guy.

435
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,176
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

436
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:26,816
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

437
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,856
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

438
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:31,496
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

439
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:33,696
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

440
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:35,496
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

441
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:38,496
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

442
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,016
What?

443
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:43,336
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

444
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:44,856
You threw up on my printer.

445
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:46,336
- I did.
- Did you break it?

446
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:48,296
- I hope not.
- Listen, man.

447
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:49,896
I think the guy was Ted.

448
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:51,816
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

449
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,856
...so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

450
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,736
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

451
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,496
What? They saw you?

452
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:58,976
And you fucking came here?

453
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,016
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

454
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:05,256
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

455
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,016
I saw them kill him.

456
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,816
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

457
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:13,016
I tossed my roach.

458
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:15,536
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

459
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:18,696
So they must have heard...
They know someone was out there.

460
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:20,896
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

461
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:23,616
They don't know it was you. Right?

462
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:27,016
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

463
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:28,696
- Yes.
- I hope not.

464
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:29,856
Relax.

465
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:34,616
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

466
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,496
Is it really that rare?

467
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,896
It's, like, the rarest.

468
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:43,416
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

469
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:47,376
It's like killing a unicorn...

470
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:49,216
...with, like, a bomb.

471
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,456
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

472
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,656
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

473
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:59,296
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

474
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,376
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

475
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:05,536
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.

476
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:07,416
And Red got this from Ted?

477
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:08,856
Ted's the man.

478
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:12,416
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

479
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:14,856
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

480
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,896
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

481
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:20,336
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

482
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:22,616
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

483
00:25:22,776 --> 00:25:24,776
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

484
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:26,336
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

485
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:29,176
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

486
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:32,416
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

487
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:34,576
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

488
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:54,976
Red said he'd be here.

489
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,496
Them some drugs.

490
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:08,096
Smells like vomit in this house.

491
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,056
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

492
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:12,296
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

493
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:14,056
Smell it on my sweater.

494
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:15,616
For real?

495
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,016
Yeah, for real.

496
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,856
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

497
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:21,056
Not my style.

498
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:23,496
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

499
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:25,976
<i>You have reached
the voice mailbox of...</i>

500
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:27,696
<i>- Ted.
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.</i>

501
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,536
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

502
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,576
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew we were coming.

503
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:35,816
They not here, Ted.

504
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:37,616
Hi, Ted.

505
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,376
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

506
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:42,216
I think he's crazy about murdering.

507
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,169
Well, that's not good.
Where are we gonna go?

508
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:00,049
Let's just go... Go to a motel or a hotel
and just hide out.

509
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:03,649
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

510
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,649
Shit. I wish we could
just go nowhere.

511
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,849
Okay.

512
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:16,489
Even if he found that roach,
how could he know where you are?

513
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,649
Heat-seeking missiles.

514
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,369
Bloodhounds.

515
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,889
Foxes.

516
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,609
Barracudas.

517
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:29,849
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's weird.

518
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:30,969
Thank you.

519
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:33,089
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

520
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:35,129
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

521
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:39,329
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

522
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:42,689
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

523
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:44,609
Only Red knows, man.

524
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,169
Who is Red?

525
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,849
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

526
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,969
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

527
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,169
One time, he got this girl...

528
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:57,569
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

529
00:27:57,729 --> 00:28:02,129
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

530
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:07,249
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

531
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:09,449
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

532
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,129
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

533
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:14,889
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

534
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,489
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

535
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:22,369
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

536
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,889
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

537
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,409
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

538
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,569
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

539
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:37,529
You know? Just ignore what I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

540
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,289
See what the dealio is.

541
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,569
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Red, you okay?</i>

542
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:47,689
<i>Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.
I just stubbed my toe.</i>

543
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:50,729
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

544
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:53,809
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

545
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:56,369
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

546
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,049
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

547
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:00,449
I'd never talk to anyone...

548
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:04,689
...about the stuff that I do with you
involving drugs.

549
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,249
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

550
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,169
I gotta lay some shit on you.

551
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:10,849
There is a fly in the ointment.

552
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:13,489
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

553
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:15,849
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

554
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,409
<i>- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- Perfect.</i>

555
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:21,449
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

556
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,969
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

557
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,489
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

558
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:27,609
- Who?
- I don't know.

559
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,369
He's whispering to another man.

560
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:32,249
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

561
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:35,769
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

562
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,209
<i>- Hey.
- So you're coming by tomorrow?</i>

563
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:39,409
How'd you know that?

564
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,289
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

565
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,049
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

566
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,809
<i>...because my bubbe... Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.</i>

567
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:51,409
<i>Is that the bubbe
that's on 41 st and River Street?</i>

568
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:53,889
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

569
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,569
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

570
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:59,689
<i>- Noon it is, bromosexual.
- Nice.</i>

571
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,449
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

572
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,169
<i>Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up.</i>

573
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:08,449
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

574
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:07,975
I should call Angie soon.

575
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:11,055
Make up some bullshit.

576
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:12,255
I'm cold.

577
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:15,375
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

578
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:16,535
I run hot.

579
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:17,935
- Really?
- Yeah.

580
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:21,255
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

581
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:24,535
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

582
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:26,815
I'm gonna call Angie.

583
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:34,735
Space.

584
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,175
Dale, wait. Wait.

585
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:41,815
The phones. The phones.

586
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:44,135
- You said they were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

587
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:45,815
I was thinking, maybe they can...

588
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:48,575
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

589
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:50,575
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

590
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:52,535
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right, man.

591
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,295
Maybe they can even trace them...

592
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,775
...like, when we're not even
on them, you know?

593
00:31:56,935 --> 00:32:00,295
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

594
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:02,335
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

595
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:03,935
We'll never catch an animal.

596
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:06,455
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

597
00:32:06,615 --> 00:32:08,135
No, no, no.

598
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,575
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

599
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:12,095
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

600
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:13,575
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

601
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:16,575
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

602
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,815
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

603
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:23,455
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

604
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:25,735
- What tree?
- That one.

605
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:28,335
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

606
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:31,255
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

607
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:33,255
Did you at least see
where it landed?

608
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:34,975
I don't know. Call it.

609
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:38,695
Call it? With what?
My phone has been smashed.

610
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:42,335
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

611
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:45,815
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

612
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:48,495
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

613
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:50,695
- Do you see it?
- See what?

614
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:53,055
The phone, you idiot.

615
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:55,855
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

616
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,215
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

617
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,055
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

618
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,095
- What?
- What was that?

619
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:04,295
- What?
- What is that?

620
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:07,255
- What?
- I hear something.

621
00:33:07,415 --> 00:33:08,375
What?

622
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:10,335
I don't know. Do you hear that?

623
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,775
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

624
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:14,615
Oh, fuck!

625
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:18,015
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

626
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:21,455
Help me!

627
00:33:22,415 --> 00:33:23,855
Tell him to get away from me!

628
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:26,135
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

629
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,055
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

630
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:31,695
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

631
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:33,535
- Fall back!
- Save me!

632
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,135
Oh, shit.

633
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,055
Car.

634
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,975
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

635
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:02,335
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

636
00:34:02,495 --> 00:34:04,695
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

637
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:08,375
- Go! I saw something!
- No! What did you see? Shut up!

638
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:11,895
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

639
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:14,215
I heard something,
then I saw something.

640
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,015
You didn't hear anything, man.

641
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:17,975
Well, I saw something.

642
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:24,855
<i>And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...</i>

643
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:26,335
<i>- ... broke your nose?
- Right.</i>

644
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:30,215
<i>The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?</i>

645
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:46,535
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

646
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:49,375
How did I get on you?

647
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:51,735
I wonder.

648
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,375
Watch finally broke.

649
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:59,055
Crazy. What time is it?

650
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:03,975
That can't be right.

651
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:07,175
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

652
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:09,335
It's 3:00 right now?

653
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:10,975
Holy shit, man!

654
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:14,495
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

655
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,095
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

656
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:19,095
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

657
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:23,415
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

658
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:26,615
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

659
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:29,175
<i>My bubbe...
Man, my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.</i>

660
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,375
Shit.

661
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,295
We gotta call Red.

662
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:34,935
Okay. How?

663
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,055
We'll go to a pay phone.

664
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:40,375
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

665
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:42,455
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

666
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:43,855
Yeah, I know where he lives.

667
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:46,055
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

668
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:47,615
"Insinuating." Good word.

669
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:49,015
Do you know what that means?

670
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,055
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like, "to seem like."

671
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,775
Let's roll. I'm done with the woods.
Let's go.

672
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,855
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

673
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:02,775
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

674
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,495
Wait.

675
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,695
What do you mean, it's dead?

676
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:10,255
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

677
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:12,015
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

678
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:14,575
How can I explain this
to you differently?

679
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:17,615
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

680
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,175
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

681
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,935
How did this happen?

682
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,775
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and...

683
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,775
Oh, man. To talk radio?

684
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:31,255
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring, man.

685
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:34,055
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

686
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:36,255
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

687
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:37,655
We're gonna go.

688
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:40,415
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

689
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,415
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

690
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,695
Red will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

691
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,055
How does that sound? Good?

692
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:48,975
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

693
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:51,615
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

694
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,735
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

695
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,135
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

696
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:06,615
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:08,575
Thanks for taking care of it.

698
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,855
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

699
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:55,295
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

700
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,935
Here's good.

701
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,255
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

702
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:12,895
You're welcome.

703
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:20,095
- You're sure we can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

704
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:21,815
Who is it?

705
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:25,495
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

706
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:28,695
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

707
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:29,855
Who's this?

708
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,935
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

709
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:33,055
Dale who?

710
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:35,135
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

711
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:36,495
Dale Denton. He's with me.

712
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,895
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

713
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:41,695
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
- You better.

714
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,055
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

715
00:38:44,215 --> 00:38:46,815
- Y'all wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

716
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,935
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

717
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:50,975
Look at that, huh?

718
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:54,215
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

719
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:58,815
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

720
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:00,375
What's up with the clothes?

721
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:03,295
We were camping.

722
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:04,815
- Camping?
- Yeah.

723
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,935
Is your lip okay, man?

724
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,055
- You been crying?
- Oh, my lip.

725
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,095
It's a cold sore.

726
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:15,575
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

727
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,815
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

728
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:21,415
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

729
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,975
Yeah. Yes, it does.

730
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:26,855
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

731
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:29,655
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

732
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:31,255
Herpes is for life, bro.

733
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:34,735
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

734
00:39:34,895 --> 00:39:37,415
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

735
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,255
It's from that time. I told you, man.

736
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:42,655
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

737
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:45,335
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

738
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:48,655
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

739
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:52,135
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

740
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:54,855
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

741
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:59,095
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

742
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:00,895
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

743
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,295
Can I have a piece of that?

744
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:04,615
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

745
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:06,215
No, you can't. This is private.

746
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,095
Do you know what today is?

747
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:11,055
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

748
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:14,255
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

749
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:16,295
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

750
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,735
So now who's the funny guy?

751
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,015
Sorry.

752
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:20,215
Today is his birthday...

753
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:23,615
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

754
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:26,895
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

755
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:29,295
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

756
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,095
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

757
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,255
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

758
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:34,575
What are we talk...? Guys...

759
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,215
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

760
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,375
Ask what? Just come straight.
What's up?

761
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,455
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

762
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:42,495
We need to know...

763
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:44,335
We need to know
about your source.

764
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:45,775
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

765
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:49,455
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

766
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,015
I'm not. That's not what I am.

767
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:54,175
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

768
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:59,135
Don't... Look, we don't want
to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

769
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:01,975
You don't want any trouble.
We don't wanna give you trouble.

770
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:04,415
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

771
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:07,335
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

772
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,335
- You can.
- I totally can.

773
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:11,175
And for you
to come into my house...

774
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,455
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

775
00:41:14,615 --> 00:41:17,215
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

776
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,535
Look at this. See this?

777
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,375
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

778
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:22,975
What's the significance of that?

779
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:25,815
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

780
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:29,495
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

781
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,055
That's all we need to know.

782
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,495
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

783
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:38,575
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

784
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:41,535
Cleared. Over.

785
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:43,615
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

786
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:45,335
We had a wacky night
in the woods...

787
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,055
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

788
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,215
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

789
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,775
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

790
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:53,215
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

791
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:53,455
Yes.

792
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,015
Yes.

793
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,655
There you go.

794
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,775
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

795
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,935
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

796
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:03,575
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

797
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:04,895
You're more chill than me?

798
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,495
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

799
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:09,495
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

800
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:12,735
I don't know what's up with you,
but I don't know if I like you.

801
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,935
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

802
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:17,335
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

803
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,095
<i>I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?</i>

804
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:21,375
- Give her a call.
- I will.

805
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:23,775
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

806
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:25,415
Oh, I won't.

807
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:02,895
Bullshit.

808
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,335
No, no, no.

809
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:06,895
- Liar.
- What are you doing, man?

810
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:09,415
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

811
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:10,535
No, he's not.

812
00:43:10,695 --> 00:43:12,535
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

813
00:43:12,695 --> 00:43:14,535
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

814
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:17,055
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

815
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:18,415
I do not trust you, sir.

816
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:20,255
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

817
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:22,335
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

818
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,015
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

819
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,295
Fuck you!

820
00:43:25,455 --> 00:43:27,095
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

821
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:28,455
Oh, Jesus.

822
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,415
Herpes!

823
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,615
I don't wanna have to do this.

824
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:35,895
Red, you're crazy, man.

825
00:43:36,055 --> 00:43:37,935
You brought the devil
into my house.

826
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:39,775
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

827
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:41,895
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

828
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,895
Dale, he's hurting me!

829
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,535
Toilet.

830
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:49,135
Flush.

831
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,415
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

832
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,815
True!

833
00:44:06,655 --> 00:44:10,255
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

834
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:12,695
Stay out of here!

835
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:17,695
Red, don't do it!

836
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:21,335
- Red!
- You assholes.

837
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:22,975
You ruined my portable phone.

838
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:25,255
- Teamwork.
- Yes.

839
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,535
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

840
00:44:32,575 --> 00:44:33,615
Fuck.

841
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:35,135
Phone.

842
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,455
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

843
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:42,055
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

844
00:44:42,215 --> 00:44:43,655
Tell us everything, now!

845
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,095
Said they were gonna kill me.

846
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:47,175
What did you tell Ted?

847
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:49,215
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

848
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,775
Smash them.

849
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:51,895
Fuck!

850
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,415
Time out. Time out.

851
00:44:53,575 --> 00:44:54,735
Time out. Time out.

852
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,575
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

853
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,495
- Stop!
- Cheater!

854
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,335
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

855
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:02,815
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

856
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:05,015
Fuck.

857
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:07,855
God...

858
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:09,255
Fuck!

859
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,335
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

860
00:45:13,575 --> 00:45:15,095
Fuck!

861
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,775
No! No, no, no!

862
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:21,695
Where you going, huh?

863
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:23,855
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

864
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:26,655
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

865
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:28,175
He's punching my bum!

866
00:45:28,335 --> 00:45:30,975
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

867
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:34,655
Use words! No! No! No!

868
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,055
You okay, man?

869
00:45:39,215 --> 00:45:41,615
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

870
00:45:42,935 --> 00:45:44,535
Happy birthday.

871
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:46,015
- All right?
- Thank you.

872
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,415
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

873
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:50,535
This ends now!

874
00:45:54,415 --> 00:45:55,815
Oh, shit.

875
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:57,695
Was that too much?

876
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:01,375
Can't get the edge.

877
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,735
Wait. Got it. Got it.

878
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:04,975
Hey, Dale.

879
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:08,335
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

880
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:09,655
I don't think I am either.

881
00:46:09,855 --> 00:46:12,495
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

882
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:14,975
Or, just not say anything.

883
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:19,175
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

884
00:46:19,975 --> 00:46:21,495
Wake up.

885
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:23,095
Hey, what's up, dudes?

886
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:26,215
What's up? Tell us everything now.

887
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,375
Talk, Red.

888
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,815
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

889
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:34,975
Trapped.

890
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:36,375
Not happening, Red.

891
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:38,935
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

892
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:43,415
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

893
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:46,415
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

894
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:48,815
Two real big son of a bitches.

895
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:50,655
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

896
00:46:50,815 --> 00:46:53,335
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

897
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:55,295
So you guys are basically fucked.

898
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:57,935
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

899
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:00,775
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

900
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:04,095
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

901
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:07,095
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

902
00:47:07,255 --> 00:47:08,735
- Oh, shit.
- What else?

903
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:11,015
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

904
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:12,575
They're in a drug war right now.

905
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:14,975
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

906
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,695
- It's true.
- What Asians?

907
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:20,495
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

908
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:21,655
Vietcong?

909
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:24,375
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

910
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:29,895
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

911
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,055
- Ding-dong.
- Hey, Red!

912
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,495
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're here.

913
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:33,975
They're here to kill me.

914
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:37,855
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

915
00:47:38,015 --> 00:47:40,295
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a new friend.

916
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:42,575
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

917
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,095
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

918
00:47:45,255 --> 00:47:46,575
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

919
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:48,415
No sweat.

920
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:54,535
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

921
00:47:54,695 --> 00:47:57,735
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

922
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,815
Hey. In here.

923
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,895
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

924
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,615
- We should hide.
- Why?

925
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:07,615
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

926
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:09,495
...then they'll go to my apartment.

927
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:13,175
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

928
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,775
No. I think we should stay.

929
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,215
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

930
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:20,295
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

931
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:24,575
<i>- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.</i>

932
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,175
Red, it's your last chance, man.

933
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:28,095
You gonna give us something
we can use?

934
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:31,495
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, what more do you want?

935
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:33,655
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

936
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:35,415
He's obviously working with Saul.

937
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:37,455
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

938
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,215
They kicked the hell out of me...

939
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,495
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

940
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:44,015
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

941
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:47,735
- You hear that, Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

942
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:50,295
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

943
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:52,415
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

944
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:54,655
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

945
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:57,095
Obviously. We're friends.

946
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:58,495
<i>Ted, you hear him?</i>

947
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:02,415
Dale Denton: not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

948
00:49:02,575 --> 00:49:05,975
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

949
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:08,535
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

950
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,295
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

951
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,375
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

952
00:49:13,975 --> 00:49:15,655
What the hell are you doing?

953
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:17,495
Ted told me to kill him.

954
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:20,335
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

955
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:22,335
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

956
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:23,575
- You catch it?
- See what?

957
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:26,655
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

958
00:49:26,815 --> 00:49:29,735
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

959
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:31,935
You was ruthless.

960
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,335
You was ruthless, man.

961
00:49:34,495 --> 00:49:37,455
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

962
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:39,735
I'm gonna die now probably.

963
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:43,175
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

964
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,815
This how you do me?

965
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,015
So, what did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

966
00:49:50,175 --> 00:49:51,735
I don't know.

967
00:49:52,735 --> 00:49:54,975
There's this guy, Saul...

968
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,335
...something, selling weed who works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

969
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,815
That's all he got out of him.

970
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:03,295
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that we shot?

971
00:50:03,455 --> 00:50:05,215
Well, did he say anything else?

972
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:08,535
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

973
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:10,735
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

974
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:12,895
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

975
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:16,375
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

976
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:20,095
Maybe after we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

977
00:50:20,255 --> 00:50:22,335
What's his name? Denton?
- to finish the job.

978
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:23,775
<i>Maybe.</i>

979
00:50:23,935 --> 00:50:26,935
<i>Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.</i>

980
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:30,455
<i>I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.</i>

981
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:33,895
<i>Who he's screwing,
who's his mother, everything.</i>

982
00:50:34,135 --> 00:50:35,615
I have to take a shit.

983
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,455
Wait. Where are we going?

984
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:43,775
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

985
00:50:43,935 --> 00:50:46,295
<i>What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.</i>

986
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,895
I mean, she has
a different last name.

987
00:50:49,055 --> 00:50:50,335
Belogus.

988
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,695
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

989
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:10,975
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

990
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:14,695
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

991
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:17,655
And you can call it rude.
You can call it whatever you want.

992
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:21,055
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

993
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,215
Dad, he'll be here.

994
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,335
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

995
00:51:25,495 --> 00:51:28,375
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

996
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:33,655
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

997
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:35,375
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

998
00:51:35,535 --> 00:51:37,495
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

999
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,415
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later, man. Look.

1000
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:43,055
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

1001
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:44,895
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

1002
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:47,095
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

1003
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:48,895
I'll keep guard.

1004
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,935
Hey.

1005
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:53,775
Shit.

1006
00:51:53,935 --> 00:51:55,415
Oh, no.

1007
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:56,575
Hey, Dale.

1008
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:59,575
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

1009
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:00,695
Dinner.

1010
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:05,575
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1011
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:06,975
Sit. Please.

1012
00:52:07,135 --> 00:52:09,375
Of course. Hi.

1013
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:11,055
- Hi.
- Shannon.

1014
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,775
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

1015
00:52:12,935 --> 00:52:15,575
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so we can eat.

1016
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:18,055
- Hi, Dale.
- Hey. Okay.

1017
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:19,655
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1018
00:52:19,815 --> 00:52:21,615
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1019
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:22,855
So I'm here.

1020
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,055
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1021
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:29,895
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude, you smell like shit.

1022
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:32,615
- Dale, what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

1023
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,815
- In the woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1024
00:52:35,975 --> 00:52:37,815
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

1025
00:52:37,975 --> 00:52:40,215
I bird-watch. I don't.

1026
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:43,135
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1027
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:46,815
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1028
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,815
I saw someone
murder someone else...

1029
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:51,415
...and I think
they've been following me.

1030
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:53,735
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1031
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:55,535
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1032
00:52:55,695 --> 00:52:58,535
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

1033
00:52:58,695 --> 00:52:59,935
...and it's on my fridge.

1034
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:02,615
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1035
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:04,415
We should call the police
right away.

1036
00:53:04,575 --> 00:53:06,615
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1037
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:09,175
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1038
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,895
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna...

1039
00:53:12,095 --> 00:53:14,055
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

1040
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:17,615
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1041
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:20,295
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1042
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:22,855
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1043
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,775
You are high as a fucking kite.

1044
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,335
I'm not high. Let's go.

1045
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,535
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1046
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:30,815
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1047
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:33,135
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1048
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,215
Your gun? His gun?

1049
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,735
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1050
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:41,735
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1051
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:11,363
<i>- This is so exciting.
- Okay, okay.</i>

1052
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:13,603
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1053
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:15,083
Who is after you, after Angie?

1054
00:54:15,243 --> 00:54:18,523
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1055
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:21,043
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1056
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,563
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

1057
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:26,963
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1058
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,363
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

1059
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:30,203
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1060
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:33,483
- Angie, what did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

1061
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:35,683
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

1062
00:54:35,883 --> 00:54:36,963
- I got it.
- Get it.

1063
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,643
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale, who is this?

1064
00:54:41,803 --> 00:54:44,683
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

1065
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,403
What was that?

1066
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,563
That was a gunshot.

1067
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:58,243
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1068
00:54:58,403 --> 00:55:00,243
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

1069
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:02,723
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

1070
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,523
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1071
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:07,403
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1072
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:09,243
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

1073
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,174
Anybody out there?

1074
00:55:40,054 --> 00:55:42,414
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1075
00:55:42,574 --> 00:55:44,134
Say, now.

1076
00:55:46,534 --> 00:55:48,814
Hey, the food's still warm.

1077
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:52,894
Love it.

1078
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,848
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1079
00:56:07,008 --> 00:56:09,368
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

1080
00:56:09,528 --> 00:56:10,808
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

1081
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,608
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1082
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:15,808
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1083
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:17,968
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1084
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:21,448
- Stay away from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

1085
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:23,848
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1086
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:26,048
Use a fake name.

1087
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:28,448
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1088
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:31,448
I don't know who these people are,
what they're capable of...

1089
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:34,208
...but I will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

1090
00:56:34,368 --> 00:56:35,608
Fuck off, loser.

1091
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:40,968
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that with love.

1092
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,680
So get this:

1093
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,360
We triangulated the cells.

1094
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,960
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1095
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,080
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1096
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,840
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1097
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,280
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1098
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,560
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

1099
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,480
I mean, what the fuck
does that mean?

1100
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,040
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1101
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,400
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1102
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,400
Hello?

1103
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
<i>Cheung, it's Ted.</i>

1104
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,080
Record this conversation.

1105
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,280
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1106
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,280
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

1107
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,200
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1108
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,200
<i>... hit men over here last night,
and I and my colleague...</i>

1109
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,400
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1110
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,800
<i>We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.</i>

1111
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,440
And now this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1112
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,080
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1113
00:59:05,132 --> 00:59:07,492
<i>You listen to me, you motherfucker!</i>

1114
00:59:07,652 --> 00:59:10,012
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1115
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,612
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1116
00:59:12,772 --> 00:59:14,372
...and be ready for everything!

1117
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,332
You are fucking dead!

1118
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:18,492
You are so dumb.

1119
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:22,012
Do you have any idea
how weak you just made us look?

1120
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:26,372
Goddamn it!

1121
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:27,972
Totally sweet.

1122
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:30,572
Ted Jones is slipping.

1123
00:59:30,732 --> 00:59:34,212
We shall strike now with full force.

1124
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:37,932
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1125
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:43,852
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1126
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:46,532
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1127
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:49,092
- Really? Thanks, man.
- No problem.

1128
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,572
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1129
00:59:51,732 --> 00:59:55,372
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1130
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:59,292
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1131
00:59:59,452 --> 01:00:02,332
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1132
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:04,932
Yeah.

1133
01:00:07,492 --> 01:00:10,012
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1134
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:11,772
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1135
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:13,892
Get bus tickets.

1136
01:00:14,052 --> 01:00:17,332
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

1137
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,692
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

1138
01:00:19,852 --> 01:00:21,692
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1139
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,972
But we should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1140
01:00:24,132 --> 01:00:25,252
What?

1141
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:28,452
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1142
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:31,812
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1143
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:33,612
What about your sack?

1144
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:36,492
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1145
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:40,492
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1146
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,052
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

1147
01:00:42,212 --> 01:00:44,172
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1148
01:00:44,332 --> 01:00:45,932
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1149
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:49,972
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

1150
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:50,852
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1151
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:52,812
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1152
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:54,532
These guys are amazing.

1153
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:56,332
What the fuck do you want?

1154
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:58,532
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1155
01:01:05,092 --> 01:01:06,492
What's this stuff called again?

1156
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:08,612
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1157
01:01:08,772 --> 01:01:11,812
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1158
01:01:12,012 --> 01:01:14,732
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at weed too.

1159
01:01:14,892 --> 01:01:17,732
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1160
01:01:17,892 --> 01:01:20,252
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

1161
01:01:20,412 --> 01:01:24,292
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1162
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:25,812
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1163
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:44,972
- How much money you guys got?
- Come on.

1164
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:47,412
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1165
01:01:47,572 --> 01:01:49,772
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1166
01:01:49,932 --> 01:01:53,452
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1167
01:01:53,612 --> 01:01:57,612
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1168
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:00,492
- Go. Come on.
- Go, go. Vamoose!

1169
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:03,532
You fucking did it, man.

1170
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,252
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1171
01:02:06,412 --> 01:02:08,772
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1172
01:02:08,932 --> 01:02:10,372
Get some burritos or something.

1173
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:12,412
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1174
01:02:12,572 --> 01:02:14,892
See you, man. Nice.

1175
01:02:20,852 --> 01:02:24,132
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1176
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,812
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1177
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,652
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1178
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:29,452
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

1179
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,052
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

1180
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:36,332
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1181
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:41,052
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1182
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:44,092
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1183
01:02:44,252 --> 01:02:47,212
And guess what? I just saw three
students walking from back here...

1184
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:50,572
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1185
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:58,332
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

1186
01:02:58,492 --> 01:03:00,132
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1187
01:03:00,332 --> 01:03:02,972
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

1188
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:06,692
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1189
01:03:06,892 --> 01:03:09,612
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1190
01:03:13,132 --> 01:03:15,492
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

1191
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:21,012
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1192
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:25,532
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1193
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:27,652
425, 425, what's your location?

1194
01:03:29,132 --> 01:03:30,332
You going down.

1195
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:32,492
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

1196
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:34,852
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

1197
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:37,132
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1198
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:39,692
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1199
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:42,212
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1200
01:03:42,372 --> 01:03:43,772
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

1201
01:03:43,932 --> 01:03:45,892
One of them was actually
a police cruiser.

1202
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,812
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

1203
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:51,732
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

1204
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:53,732
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

1205
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:55,572
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

1206
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,172
- Exactly.
- And you saw it?

1207
01:03:57,332 --> 01:03:59,252
- Yes, do you believe me?
- Give me a minute.

1208
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:02,132
- It was a woman or a man?
- It was a policewoman. A woman.

1209
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:07,012
- I think I know who that bitch was.
- Yes. I will identify that bitch.

1210
01:04:08,852 --> 01:04:11,212
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma'am. Thank you.

1211
01:04:11,372 --> 01:04:13,332
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

1212
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:15,652
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

1213
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,892
I don't work for the law.
The law works for me.

1214
01:04:18,092 --> 01:04:20,092
I been smelling something
in this department.

1215
01:04:20,252 --> 01:04:21,572
Keep your eyes on the road.

1216
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,852
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
- Stop!

1217
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:26,332
Son of a bitch!

1218
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:30,212
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

1219
01:04:35,932 --> 01:04:39,532
No, no, no.

1220
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:42,572
- No. What are you doing?
- I'm saving you, amigo!

1221
01:04:43,892 --> 01:04:45,892
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1222
01:04:46,052 --> 01:04:48,492
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

1223
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:50,412
Stop this car!

1224
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:56,252
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1225
01:04:56,412 --> 01:04:57,772
Oh, shit!

1226
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:03,132
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

1227
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:04,812
- That's the lady cop.
- Who's that?

1228
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:07,892
I don't know. They're shooting!

1229
01:05:13,612 --> 01:05:15,492
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1230
01:05:15,652 --> 01:05:16,892
Fuck.

1231
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,132
Dude!

1232
01:05:25,772 --> 01:05:27,292
I can't see! The Slushee!

1233
01:05:27,452 --> 01:05:29,532
- Turn on the wipers!
- It's not working!

1234
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,292
Well, kick out the window!

1235
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:34,092
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

1236
01:05:36,012 --> 01:05:37,812
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1237
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:42,332
Get your foot out of there.

1238
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:45,052
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1239
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:46,212
Her car's better.

1240
01:05:46,412 --> 01:05:48,692
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

1241
01:05:48,852 --> 01:05:51,652
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1242
01:05:54,012 --> 01:05:56,012
Oh, no, no, no!

1243
01:05:57,972 --> 01:05:59,212
Oh, shit!

1244
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,012
Get it out!

1245
01:06:03,372 --> 01:06:04,892
I can't see!

1246
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:14,252
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

1247
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:18,572
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1248
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:20,412
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1249
01:06:23,052 --> 01:06:24,852
You did it, man.

1250
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:27,532
All right! Look out!

1251
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,692
Oh, shit!

1252
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,172
Turn around! Turn around!

1253
01:06:40,092 --> 01:06:41,852
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1254
01:06:42,012 --> 01:06:44,252
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

1255
01:06:44,412 --> 01:06:46,572
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1256
01:06:49,932 --> 01:06:53,132
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1257
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:55,452
Sorry!

1258
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:58,212
What the fuck was that?

1259
01:06:58,412 --> 01:07:00,532
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1260
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:02,532
- Why?
- I don't know.

1261
01:07:18,812 --> 01:07:20,252
Oh, my.

1262
01:07:24,572 --> 01:07:26,892
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1263
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:29,612
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

1264
01:07:29,772 --> 01:07:32,452
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1265
01:07:32,612 --> 01:07:35,372
Come back! Saul!

1266
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:36,812
- Sorry, man.
- Thank you.

1267
01:07:36,972 --> 01:07:40,772
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1268
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,180
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1269
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,020
...l'm moving on.

1270
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,660
Okay.

1271
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,300
All right.

1272
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,420
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1273
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:50,780
As sure as shit you will.

1274
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,660
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1275
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,180
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1276
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,860
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1277
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,420
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1278
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,620
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1279
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,780
So smile.

1280
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,420
Shut up.

1281
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:13,940
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1282
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,980
All right. Are you using protection?

1283
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,140
<i>- Days Inn.
- Yes.</i>

1284
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,100
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1285
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,780
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, is Angie there?</i>

1286
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,700
<i>- Dale.
- Angie?</i>

1287
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,420
<i>- My God, are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.</i>

1288
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,860
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.</i>

1289
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,580
<i>Okay, good. I came up with a plan.</i>

1290
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,820
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1291
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,740
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

1292
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:40,580
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1293
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,540
<i>I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...</i>

1294
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,460
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1295
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,060
<i>I can't be addicted to marijuana.</i>

1296
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,260
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1297
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,180
<i>B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.</i>

1298
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,580
And now I'm dealing with it.

1299
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,140
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1300
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,700
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1301
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,300
<i>- We have to work through it.
- No.</i>

1302
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:03,900
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1303
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,420
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

1304
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,820
<i>You know what? It's over.</i>

1305
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,420
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1306
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,780
Congratulations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1307
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,220
What the fuck does that mean?

1308
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,900
<i>It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.</i>

1309
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,060
<i>You'll get into
Godspeed You! Black Emperor...</i>

1310
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,340
<i>... and the fucking Shins.</i>

1311
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,980
<i>And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...</i>

1312
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,740
<i>... and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.</i>

1313
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,220
<i>You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.</i>

1314
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,380
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

1315
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,220
<i>You never did like me anyway,
did you?</i>

1316
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,860
<i>You didn't wanna meet my parents.</i>

1317
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,500
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1318
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,860
I always care about you.

1319
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,780
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1320
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:43,260
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1321
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,380
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1322
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,500
Call me when I can go home.

1323
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:54,700
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1324
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,940
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1325
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,700
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

1326
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:04,820
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1327
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,460
I love you.

1328
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,700
You wise-ass.

1329
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,180
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1330
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,620
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1331
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,860
First things first.

1332
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,020
- Don't do that, okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

1333
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,220
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1334
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,780
That clearly just happened...

1335
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,220
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1336
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,260
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1337
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,500
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1338
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,420
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

1339
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,940
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1340
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,340
- we are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1341
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,100
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

1342
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,980
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1343
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,540
What do you gotta say to that?

1344
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,140
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

1345
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,380
But you didn't save me.

1346
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,380
She was gonna help,
you made things worse.

1347
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,340
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1348
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,420
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

1349
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,180
Only reason I started selling pot...

1350
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,820
<i>...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.</i>

1351
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,060
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

1352
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,500
I'm gonna become something.

1353
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,100
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1354
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,500
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1355
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,100
Little kids can take shits.

1356
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,820
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1357
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,020
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1358
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,620
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1359
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,860
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1360
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,380
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

1361
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,900
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1362
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,860
Boring people to death on the radio.

1363
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,460
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1364
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,420
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

1365
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:37,420
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1366
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,140
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

1367
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,700
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1368
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,580
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1369
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,980
You were cold and I clothed you.

1370
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:49,620
How about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1371
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,340
You didn't say anything back.

1372
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,940
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1373
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,540
You are my drug dealer.

1374
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,340
There's one reason
we know each other.

1375
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,460
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1376
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,740
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you were...

1377
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,900
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1378
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,660
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1379
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,340
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

1380
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,820
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

1381
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,940
What? That's not even
an expression.

1382
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,700
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1383
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,660
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1384
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,460
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

1385
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,100
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1386
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,260
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1387
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,740
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1388
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,060
I didn't mean that.

1389
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,620
<i>I love you. Do you love me?</i>

1390
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,380
That looks great.

1391
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,100
Hello?

1392
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,420
Dale?

1393
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,860
<i>It is Dale.</i>

1394
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:49,700
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the world...

1395
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,180
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1396
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:54,980
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1397
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,580
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

1398
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,340
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

1399
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,580
<i>So please
just take me back, please.</i>

1400
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,780
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

1401
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,900
<i>- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.</i>

1402
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,380
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

1403
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,740
I don't know. I just...

1404
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,220
I wanna marry you.

1405
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,820
I made a mistake.

1406
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,220
<i>- What do you mean?
- I've...</i>

1407
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,900
<i>- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.</i>

1408
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,540
<i>- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?</i>

1409
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,220
I don't know.

1410
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,420
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1411
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,460
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1412
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,020
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1413
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:41,180
<i>- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. You're immature.</i>

1414
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:44,420
<i>I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.</i>

1415
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:45,820
Just because you're older.

1416
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,420
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1417
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,660
<i>- Really?
- How many girls have you slept with?</i>

1418
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,820
<i>- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?</i>

1419
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,140
What is a half? Your hand?

1420
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,140
<i>No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.</i>

1421
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,860
<i>I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."</i>

1422
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,300
<i>If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.</i>

1423
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,740
<i>Screw you.</i>

1424
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:04,980
Get me out of this room.

1425
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,100
<i>I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?</i>

1426
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,820
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1427
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,100
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1428
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,740
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1429
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,660
Do you use the pool over here?

1430
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,460
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1431
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,700
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

1432
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,740
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

1433
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,500
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

1434
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,580
And now you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1435
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,300
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1436
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,540
May I call you Faye?

1437
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,700
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1438
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,340
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1439
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,980
What do you want from me?

1440
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,460
<i>Bubbe. Hey, guys.</i>

1441
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:51,020
- Well, look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

1442
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:55,940
Damn.

1443
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,140
Oh, shit.

1444
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,820
Sorry, Betty.

1445
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,300
They kidnapped my grandson.

1446
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,300
Yeah, these two guys came in...

1447
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:11,340
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1448
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
I never saw them in my life before.

1449
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,700
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1450
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:21,140
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1451
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:24,940
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

1452
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,380
...but he was short as shit.

1453
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,380
But the worst part was...

1454
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:32,740
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

1455
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,820
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

1456
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,180
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1457
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,140
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1458
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,780
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.

1459
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:48,300
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1460
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,140
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1461
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,020
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1462
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,300
Where am I, man? What?

1463
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,780
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1464
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,220
Shit. Did I do that?

1465
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,700
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1466
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,100
Fuck you, man!

1467
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,860
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

1468
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,300
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1469
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,380
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1470
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:16,820
- lf anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like Hamburglar.

1471
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,940
And the Elephant Man.

1472
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,220
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1473
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,060
Professional. Professional.

1474
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,260
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever, man.

1475
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,460
- Where were you?
- I was there.

1476
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,420
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

1477
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,180
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1478
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,460
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1479
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,940
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

1480
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,180
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1481
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,420
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1482
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:43,420
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1483
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,140
I might act tough...

1484
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,300
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1485
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,460
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1486
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,100
This ain't over.

1487
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,340
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

1488
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,460
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1489
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:00,780
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1490
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,100
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

1491
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,220
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1492
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,380
Watch your head.

1493
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,940
Hey, watch him.

1494
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,900
Oh, my God.

1495
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,300
El Dorado.

1496
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,740
The legends are true.

1497
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,460
Look at all this weed, man.

1498
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,260
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1499
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,700
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

1500
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,580
OG Kush?

1501
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,020
OG Kush.

1502
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,420
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1503
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,180
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

1504
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,180
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

1505
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,660
Hello?

1506
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,180
Red?

1507
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,900
- Red?
- What the fuck?

1508
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,740
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1509
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:13,900
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1510
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,420
Good.

1511
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:18,220
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

1512
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,180
You don't look great.

1513
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,780
They shot me, Denton.

1514
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,220
They got me right here.

1515
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,660
- Yeah?
- Right here.

1516
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,540
And then they got me again
right here.

1517
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,780
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1518
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,420
They'll save your life, okay?

1519
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,420
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

1520
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:36,100
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1521
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,420
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1522
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,620
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1523
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:43,580
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1524
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,300
He's just, like, an asshole.

1525
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,300
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1526
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,260
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1527
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,740
And I'm gonna get him back.

1528
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,780
You know, like, he saved my life.

1529
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,980
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1530
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,860
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

1531
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:01,020
I was mean to him, man.

1532
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,820
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

1533
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:07,500
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1534
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:11,420
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1535
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,420
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1536
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,380
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1537
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:21,500
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1538
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,940
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

1539
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,860
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

1540
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,660
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1541
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:33,420
Or a worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1542
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,900
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

1543
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,540
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1544
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,220
You'll come back as a dragon.

1545
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,980
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1546
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,860
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1547
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,220
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

1548
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,340
It belongs to me.

1549
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,900
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

1550
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:53,740
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1551
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,060
You'll have a second wind.

1552
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,540
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1553
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,260
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1554
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,460
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1555
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,820
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1556
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,580
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1557
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,940
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

1558
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,820
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1559
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,700
Come here.

1560
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:21,300
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1561
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,660
Thug life.

1562
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,580
Oh, shit.

1563
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,380
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1564
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,500
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1565
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,780
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1566
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,420
Don't.

1567
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,580
Don't.

1568
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,340
Just something quick like that.

1569
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,940
- Don't.
- Yeah.

1570
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,140
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

1571
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,620
Oh, God.

1572
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,180
That's a big hideout.

1573
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:22,980
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1574
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,980
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1575
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,940
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1576
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,420
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1577
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,620
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1578
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:36,540
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1579
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,780
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

1580
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,220
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1581
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,540
This could be your moment.

1582
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,140
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine, go.

1583
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,300
Fuck you.

1584
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,540
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1585
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,740
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

1586
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:56,180
Carol, she's cool now.

1587
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:00,100
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1588
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:02,460
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

1589
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,940
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1590
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,300
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1591
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,620
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

1592
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,220
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1593
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,940
Put them down. On the ground.

1594
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,380
All right, everybody just chill.

1595
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,340
Oh, my God!

1596
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,100
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

1597
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,700
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

1598
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:24,060
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1599
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,940
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1600
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,740
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1601
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,300
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1602
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:33,340
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1603
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,540
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1604
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,420
End of story.

1605
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,540
I'm telling Ted.

1606
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,380
- lf you do...
- He's got a piece.

1607
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,060
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1608
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,820
He's got another one, in the side.

1609
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,540
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1610
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,860
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1611
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,100
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1612
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,460
No. Come on.

1613
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,780
- Oh, great.
- Saul.

1614
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,980
- Dale.
- Yes.

1615
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,180
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

1616
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,140
- No, man.
- Yes.

1617
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,940
I'm here to save you.

1618
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,660
No. You just got caught too.

1619
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,100
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1620
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,220
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1621
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,100
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

1622
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:19,300
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1623
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,540
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1624
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,020
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1625
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:28,140
So that's what I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1626
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,740
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1627
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,540
You're a mean jerk.

1628
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,580
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

1629
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,860
I didn't want
you to be my best friend.

1630
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,620
I didn't wanna think
that that's what my life was.

1631
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,140
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

1632
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,740
You're the best guy I know.

1633
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,660
BFFF.

1634
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,180
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

1635
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,460
- All right. Give me a hug.
- Yeah. Okay.

1636
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,940
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

1637
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,380
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1638
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,580
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
- No, you're not, but it's okay.

1639
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,540
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

1640
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,340
- I know. They are.
- Fuck, man.

1641
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,660
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

1642
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:13,300
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
- Shut the fuck up.

1643
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,500
Do you know
what "shut the fuck up" mean?

1644
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,100
I do.

1645
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,980
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

1646
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,940
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

1647
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,420
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

1648
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,260
- Is it working?
- I can't feel it.

1649
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,420
I can't feel you.

1650
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:32,420
- Wait, I feel it.
- I feel it. Yes, okay.

1651
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:33,940
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1652
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,100
- I'm gonna save you, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1653
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,940
- Let me save you.
- Save me, Dale.

1654
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,900
It's not working.
We gotta change angles.

1655
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,220
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

1656
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,820
Okay, that's good. That's good.

1657
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,820
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

1658
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:48,020
- All right. All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

1659
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,100
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

1660
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,580
I'm gonna save you, man.
I'm gonna save you.

1661
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,940
- You're my best friend, man.
- Yeah, see?

1662
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,060
- It's not working.
- Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.

1663
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,140
Finish it off with my mouth, pal.
Let's go.

1664
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,300
Come on. Let's go.

1665
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,260
Harder.

1666
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,820
- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

1667
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,580
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1668
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,500
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1669
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:23,060
It's gross.

1670
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,380
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

1671
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:29,180
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

1672
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,460
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1673
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,740
Now they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

1674
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,380
He shot Pete?

1675
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,460
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1676
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,060
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1677
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:44,380
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1678
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,740
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1679
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,820
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

1680
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,980
Stop. Wait here.

1681
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,780
No retreat, no surrender.

1682
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,020
Yes, yes, yes.

1683
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,900
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1684
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:11,340
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1685
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,620
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

1686
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,580
Just don't. Don't...

1687
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:23,900
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1688
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:28,020
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1689
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,620
Stop.

1690
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,300
See, I don't think
you understood me.

1691
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,220
I can hear everything you're saying.

1692
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,980
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1693
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,540
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

1694
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,860
Y'all fuck on your own time, man.

1695
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,540
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

1696
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,020
What the fuck is that?

1697
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,220
Dale!

1698
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:59,460
I've been waiting for this.
You burned my face!

1699
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,900
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1700
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,580
You shot me.

1701
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,060
I'm sorry, man.

1702
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:16,780
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1703
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,500
I got glass in my ass.

1704
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,140
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

1705
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,340
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1706
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,540
Asians!

1707
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,300
War is upon you!

1708
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,180
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1709
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,140
Get down, motherfucker!

1710
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,700
Come on!

1711
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,460
Fuck!

1712
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,780
Go! Go!

1713
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:03,060
Get down, baby!

1714
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:04,860
Dale, no!

1715
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,580
No, wake up, man.

1716
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,540
No, you're not dying, man.

1717
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,180
Not without me.

1718
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,620
- Dale.
- What?

1719
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,540
You're alive.

1720
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,100
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

1721
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,620
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

1722
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,380
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

1723
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,060
Fuck!

1724
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,660
- Help!
- My ear.

1725
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,820
- Yeah.
- Help!

1726
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,980
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

1727
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,980
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

1728
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,140
You shot him?

1729
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,420
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

1730
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:40,180
We've had enough out of you.

1731
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,500
I'm not your friend.

1732
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:42,980
Maybe I can just...

1733
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:45,060
No. No, infected.

1734
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:47,540
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1735
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,220
It's clear.

1736
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,340
Dude. Look.

1737
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,020
Nice.

1738
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,340
Bullets.

1739
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,860
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1740
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:54,220
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

1741
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,340
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1742
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,420
I feel like I can smell it.

1743
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,940
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1744
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,100
You can't even tell.

1745
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,340
That's a good point.

1746
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,860
Wait.

1747
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,100
Did you shoot that guy?

1748
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,820
No. I'm out of bullets.

1749
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,420
Me too.

1750
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,780
Maybe it was ricochet.

1751
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,860
Gravity.

1752
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:56,660
Oh, nice.

1753
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,700
You go down.

1754
01:32:58,860 --> 01:32:59,980
I'll cover.

1755
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:03,180
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1756
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,260
Sexy motherfucker.

1757
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,460
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1758
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,780
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1759
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,060
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1760
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,420
Oh, nice.

1761
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,420
Here we go. Okay.

1762
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,380
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1763
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,180
Nice.

1764
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,540
Nice. Okay.

1765
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:51,900
Pull me up.

1766
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,780
I'm ready. Go.

1767
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,700
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

1768
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:58,180
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

1769
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,260
- Pull harder.
- Dale, come on.

1770
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:03,060
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1771
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,900
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

1772
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,700
Dale!

1773
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,340
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1774
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:16,180
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1775
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,980
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1776
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,300
Okay.

1777
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:06,940
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1778
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,220
Now!

1779
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:23,620
Fuck you!

1780
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:31,340
Fuck the police!

1781
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:53,300
Motherfucking kill you!

1782
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:58,020
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

1783
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,500
Oh, shit!

1784
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:01,820
Come here!

1785
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,740
I hate you!

1786
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,060
No! Ted, stop it!

1787
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:22,500
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1788
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,540
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1789
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,220
Jesus!

1790
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,780
Fuck.

1791
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,180
Gonna die.

1792
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,980
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

1793
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,860
But you weren't gonna stop.

1794
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,620
Shoot him!

1795
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:10,020
Just take it easy, buddy.

1796
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,980
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1797
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:18,700
I'm hungry.

1798
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,700
I'm going home.

1799
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,060
All right.

1800
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,180
Help.

1801
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,500
I knew you were going soft.

1802
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:36,660
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

1803
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,780
Fucked up, man.

1804
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:44,340
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
- Oh, man.

1805
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,860
What's up, sir?

1806
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:50,100
- Look, I didn't wanna hit you, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

1807
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:54,580
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

1808
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,260
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

1809
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,460
...and watch yourself get killed now.

1810
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:01,020
All right.

1811
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,140
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

1812
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,740
All right. This is how it ends.

1813
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:26,180
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

1814
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,780
How you like me now, huh?

1815
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,180
Gross.

1816
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:31,340
Red?

1817
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:32,860
Saul.

1818
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:35,820
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

1819
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:37,580
- Yeah.
- I remembered, man.

1820
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:39,820
Bro's before ho's.

1821
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,340
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1822
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:47,740
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1823
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:51,380
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

1824
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:55,180
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

1825
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:58,220
...I wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

1826
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:01,700
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

1827
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:04,340
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1828
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,220
No more lies, Red.

1829
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,780
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

1830
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,740
Red!

1831
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:33,500
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1832
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,420
Red, I'm coming, baby.

1833
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,940
Your stupidity amazes me.

1834
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:41,940
Hey, Ted!

1835
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,980
You killed my brother...

1836
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:47,100
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

1837
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:50,180
Suck my balls! Two times!

1838
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,740
Bitch!

1839
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:00,380
Bring it on.

1840
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:12,500
Shit. Dale.

1841
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:16,100
Dale!

1842
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,860
Holy shit!

1843
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:53,860
Sorry, Ted.

1844
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,740
You've been served.

1845
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:09,260
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1846
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:11,820
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1847
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,500
Saul! Saul!

1848
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,660
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

1849
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:27,580
Come to me!

1850
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,340
You're not dying today, friend.

1851
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,260
Not on my watch.

1852
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:03,220
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1853
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,740
Saul.

1854
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,340
Wake up.

1855
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,860
Oh, sweet Saul.

1856
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,820
Saul.

1857
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,260
Yes. Yeah.

1858
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,860
Saul, you made it.

1859
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,420
- What?
- Yeah.

1860
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,460
Where am I?

1861
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,580
You made it, man.

1862
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:29,140
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

1863
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,220
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

1864
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:33,660
What happened?

1865
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:35,020
What happened?

1866
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:43,580
Holy shit.

1867
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,980
What's that?

1868
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,420
Hi.

1869
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,380
- Red?
- Red?

1870
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,740
- Red.
- Hey.

1871
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:04,100
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1872
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:05,300
He came back to save us.

1873
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,500
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

1874
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:08,060
All right, man.

1875
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,260
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

1876
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:13,180
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

1877
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,820
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1878
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:26,780
<i>Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.
I am Dale Denton.</i>

1879
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:30,620
<i>The topic of the day: new beginnings.
Getting over losses.</i>

1880
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:33,100
<i>Friends. Life.</i>

1881
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:35,740
We have our first caller.

1882
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:38,420
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1883
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,180
Hi. Am I on the air?

1884
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,220
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1885
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:44,420
A D in the face.

1886
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:45,900
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

1887
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,900
You're my hero.

1888
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,500
You're my hero.

1889
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:52,620
You are good, man. Seriously.

1890
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:54,620
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1891
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:56,660
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

1892
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:59,540
- It's not bad, huh?
- lf I close my eyes, it sounds like...

1893
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,660
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1894
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:05,580
- lf you were on it, I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

1895
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:08,020
<i>It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...</i>

1896
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:09,940
<i>...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.</i>

1897
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:12,780
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1898
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:15,420
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

1899
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:17,620
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

1900
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:19,460
...I like you now.

1901
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,940
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1902
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,060
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

1903
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:28,340
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

1904
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:31,180
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

1905
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:33,460
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

1906
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:34,940
We should get a three-way one.

1907
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,580
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

1908
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:41,580
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

1909
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:45,500
I know we've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

1910
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:48,260
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

1911
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:50,860
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

1912
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,780
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

1913
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:56,700
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

1914
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:59,460
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

1915
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,140
Is that us getting a time-share?

1916
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,580
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

1917
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:06,020
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

1918
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:08,660
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

1919
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,780
I didn't wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

1920
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:13,860
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

1921
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,420
You fuckhead.

1922
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:18,060
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

1923
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,700
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was...

1924
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:23,700
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

1925
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:27,700
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

1926
01:46:59,733 --> 01:47:01,573
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

1927
01:47:01,733 --> 01:47:03,853
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

1928
01:47:04,013 --> 01:47:07,573
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood left?

1929
01:47:07,733 --> 01:47:10,493
- You've been shot, like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

1930
01:47:10,653 --> 01:47:12,333
- You're losing stuff.
- Here.

1931
01:47:12,533 --> 01:47:14,293
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

1932
01:47:14,453 --> 01:47:17,773
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

1933
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:22,293
It's a miracle.
I think we should all take a moment...

1934
01:47:22,453 --> 01:47:24,893
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

1935
01:47:25,053 --> 01:47:26,973
And that we became friends
in the process...

1936
01:47:27,133 --> 01:47:29,293
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

1937
01:47:29,453 --> 01:47:33,493
Should we touch each other's hands
while we do it? Okay.

1938
01:47:35,453 --> 01:47:36,853
I love you guys.

1939
01:47:37,013 --> 01:47:39,253
I love you dudes so much.

1940
01:47:42,053 --> 01:47:44,653
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

1941
01:47:45,493 --> 01:47:46,853
- Red?
- Red?

1942
01:47:47,013 --> 01:47:48,933
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

1943
01:47:49,093 --> 01:47:50,413
What's up, pal?

1944
01:47:51,253 --> 01:47:52,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

1945
01:47:52,853 --> 01:47:56,413
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

1946
01:47:56,573 --> 01:47:58,733
That's okay. We won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

1947
01:47:58,933 --> 01:48:02,213
<i>- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's bubbe.</i>

1948
01:48:02,413 --> 01:48:04,413
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1949
01:48:04,573 --> 01:48:06,453
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

1950
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:08,613
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

1951
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:10,613
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

1952
01:48:10,773 --> 01:48:12,973
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

1953
01:48:13,133 --> 01:48:15,093
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

1954
01:48:15,253 --> 01:48:18,173
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

1955
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:20,133
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

1956
01:48:20,293 --> 01:48:21,813
Blood from my ear just...

1957
01:48:21,973 --> 01:48:24,653
You guys smell like shit.

1958
01:48:25,813 --> 01:48:28,373
You are in serious danger.
