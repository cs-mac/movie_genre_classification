00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:28,012
<i>"I am with those who abuse sex</i>

3
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:31,512
<i>because individual doesn't count,</i>

4
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:36,482
<i>with those who get drunk
against the abyss of the brain,</i>

5
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:40,102
<i>against the garden parties
of pretense,</i>

6
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:44,102
<i>against the silence beating
at the temples,</i>

7
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:47,405
<i>with those who,
poor and old,</i>

8
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:51,805
<i>compete against death,
the atom bomb of days.</i>

9
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:55,530
<i>With those numbed in institutions,</i>

10
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,730
<i>shocked with electric currents</i>

11
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:00,419
<i>through the cataracts of nerves.</i>

12
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:04,767
<i>With those colored africans dispossessed.</i>

13
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:07,133
<i>With those how kill </i>

14
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:12,182
<i>because every death
confirms anew the lie of life.</i>

15
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:18,189
<i>And please forget...about justice...
...it doesn't exist...</i>

16
00:01:18,264 --> 00:01:20,089
<i>...about Brotherhood...</i>

17
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,188
<i>...it's a fraud...</i>

18
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:26,288
<i>...about love...it has no right."</i>

19
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,606
What have you got there?

20
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:34,472
Ingrid.
Ingrid?

21
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,458
Grandma won't wake up.

22
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,733
Thank you.

23
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:21,464
- Where are your shoes?
- We don't have.

24
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,971
What shall we call you?

25
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,836
Just call me "Pa."

26
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,287
BLACK BUTTERFLIES

27
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:42,947
CAPE TOWN, 1960.

28
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,353
Help.
Help.

29
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,514
Help me!

30
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,544
Help.

31
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,367
You can't swim against the current.

32
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:35,492
You need to swim out of it.

33
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:13,464
Who do I thank?

34
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,978
Jack Cope.
How do you do?

35
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:17,377
The writer?

36
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:23,081
- I've only written one novel.
- I read "The fair house" five times.

37
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,287
- You liked it that much?
- No.

38
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,967
I was at a guest farm in the Karoo,

39
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:30,910
and it was the only South African
novel I could lay my hands on.

40
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,238
So you didn't like it.

41
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,983
What's so funny?

42
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,854
Just that I should be saved
by a writer...

43
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,979
...of all people.

44
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:52,423
Don't worry, I liked it.

45
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:55,314
- Being saved by a writer?
- No, you fool.

46
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:57,704
- Your novel.
- Ingrid!

47
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:00,624
Ingrid, I've been looking
all over for you.

48
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:02,053
Pa's here.

49
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,458
- Where?
- He brought Pieter with him...

50
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,674
- ...back from Johannesburg.
- He did what?

51
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,170
- Where's Simone?
- She's with Pieter at the flat.

52
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,041
Oh, No!

53
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,125
I'm sorry about this.

54
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:19,787
- Ingrid, come on!
- Write me a poem, Jack.

55
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,973
I'll write one for you.

56
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:26,202
Ingrid Jonker, the poet!

57
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:31,402
Why are you doing this, Pa?

58
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:33,277
He asked me for a lift.

59
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,525
How could I refuse him?

60
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,129
I can't keep going through this.
It's driving me crazy!

61
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,898
- He's a good man, Ingrid.
- Pa, we have nothing in common.

62
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,812
You married him.

63
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:02,338
-...one...
- What are you doing here?

64
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,712
- Just visiting my daughter.
- You're not staying here. That's for sure.

65
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:08,960
- Then where am I going to stay?
- Anywhere but here.

66
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,040
Please Ingrid,
I can't live without you.

67
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,789
And I can't live with you.

68
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:14,888
Anna Jonker, Hello.

69
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:19,619
- God, why do you make me so cruel?
- Ingrid, it's for you.

70
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,571
Hi.

71
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:29,446
How did you get this number?

72
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,816
Yeah, I'd love to come.

73
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,427
Where do you live?

74
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,646
Hhm, see you there, then.

75
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,266
Ingrid, please.
Just give me a second chance.

76
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,027
Jack.

77
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,110
You made it.

78
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:26,610
Great.
Um...

79
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:30,813
This is my housemate and friend,
Uys Krige.

80
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:35,185
- Uys, Ingrid Jonker.
- Ah, The poet caught in the current.

81
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:37,974
Why are you so short?

82
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,099
What kind of a question is that?

83
00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:45,515
Nkosi Skosana's outside
on the beach.

84
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:48,828
He, um, needs a ride to the location.

85
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,133
Shit.

86
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,797
Excuse me.

87
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,026
I was...

88
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,138
quite absorbed by your little book poems.

89
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,557
And you're also a bit short.

90
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:02,666
I'm not short.

91
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:04,586
You are short of technical finesse.

92
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,453
But otherwise, not bad.
Coming from me,

93
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,369
that is a big compliment.

94
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,778
Nkosi?

95
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:27,481
- <i>Kunja ne</i>, Jack.
- I heard about your book. I'm really sorry.

96
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,354
Never mind they banned it.

97
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,727
Cops raided the printer's last night
and confiscated the bloody original.

98
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,931
four Years' worth gone
just like that.

99
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:39,096
I can't keep this up, Jack.
I'm leaving.

100
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:42,636
- And where will you go?
- London, New York. Who cares?

101
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:47,965
- No! Please leave me alone!
- Come Back here. Come Back here.

102
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:53,961
Any chance of rescuing me again?

103
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,874
- Who is this?
- My husband.

104
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:03,370
I've left him,
but he hasn't fully grasped it yet.

105
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:13,370
I'll be back in minute.

106
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,979
- Do you trust her?
- Hmm?

107
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:28,435
You know her father heads
up the censorship board.

108
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,087
He's the one who banned my book.

109
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:35,701
Apparently, she and her father
don't see eye to eye.

110
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:50,543
What's your favorite poem, Nkosi?

111
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,280
"The Lord shook his fist,

112
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,556
and the dice fell
horribly wrong on us."

113
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,453
What's it called?

114
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,409
It's called <i>Apartheid.</i>

115
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,741
Oh, damn.

116
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,106
What's this kaffir doing
in the back of your car?

117
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:18,272
I was driving him home.

118
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,309
Do you have permission
to be in white area?

119
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,017
He's our garden boy.

120
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,222
We're taking him home because
there were no more buses.

121
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,636
This time of night?
Where's your pass?

122
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,175
I was working late,
and my wife doesn't drive.

123
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:49,335
- Did you get him back safely?
- Just.

124
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,287
Through here.

125
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:17,320
Um, I'm not sure if you know it,
But I'm going through...

126
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,352
...a rather messy divorce
at the moment.

127
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:23,474
- Do you have children?
- Two boys.

128
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,595
- I'll leave you to it.
- No, No, Stay here.

129
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:28,927
Come sit here.

130
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,631
Pass me my bag, Please?

131
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,743
It's your poem.

132
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,228
This is beautiful.

133
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:19,681
You must run towards the light, Jack,
not away from it.

134
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:24,219
I...

135
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,508
can't believe you wrote a poem for me.

136
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,980
Well, you saved my life.

137
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,463
If there's a reason for learning
afrikaans, marjorie,

138
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,357
It's this book,

139
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,440
Eugene Maritz's latest novel.

140
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:08,324
Isn't Maritz a newspaper man?

141
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:11,352
Oh. He's the chief editor
of the Herald in Bloemfontein.

142
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,898
I wonder where he finds the time
to write a novel.

143
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:17,689
Perhaps he didn't waste time having
picnic on the beach with his friends.

144
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:20,273
That's because there are no
beaches in Bloemfontein.

145
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,606
But there are mountains,
and he is climbing them.

146
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:23,720
Mark my words,

147
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,605
Eugene Maritz will be one
of the saviors of africa's literature.

148
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:30,151
- Hell of a statement, Uys.
- Read the book,

149
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,905
and you might be in a position
to doubt me.

150
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:33,967
I think I will.

151
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:04,896
I'm completely in love with you.

152
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:15,188
I've had bad luck with men.

153
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,188
Why did you marry Pieter?

154
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,937
- Truth?
- Hmm.

155
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:25,604
To get out of my father's house.

156
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,979
Well, I want you to move in with me,

157
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,021
you and Simone, into the Bungalow.

158
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:40,228
You think it's bad idea?

159
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,478
Love's not an idea.

160
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:46,603
Am I too old for you?

161
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:53,313
I see you as young, Jack.

162
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:01,145
<i>"I repeat you, without beginning or end,</i>

163
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,688
<i>repeat your body.</i>

164
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:09,188
<i>The day has a thin shadow,
the night yellow crosses.</i>

165
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,478
<i>The landscape has no distinction</i>

166
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,870
<i>and the people a row of candles</i>

167
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,571
<i>While I repeat you</i>

168
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:23,353

the hollows of your hands."</i>

169
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:40,582
Hello.

170
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,766
Hello, Ingrid.

171
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:48,020
I recognize you from the newspapers.
Uys Kriger.

172
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:49,947
And you must be Jack Cope,
the writer.

173
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:51,575
How do you do?

174
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:52,976
Oh, come in.
Come in.

175
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:54,812
Your father's on the phone.

176
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:56,970
My goodness,
but Simone has gotten big.

177
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,561
Even on sundays,
they bother him now.

178
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,610
He barely has time to write
his novels anymore.

179
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,268
Pa writes books, Lulu,
not novels.

180
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,852
I heard that.

181
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:13,643
Sorry to keep you all.

182
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,357
Uys Kriger, I'm an admirer
of your plays.

183
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:21,435
- You're quite prolific.
- Pleased to meet you, Dr. Jonker.

184
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,143
- Jack Cope.
- how do you do?

185
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,311
For some reason, I thought
you'd be younger.

186
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:27,768
Pa!

187
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,614
-Where's Anna?
- She has a migraine,

188
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:32,681
- But she sends her love.
- All right.

189
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,935
Come this way.

190
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:36,977
Please.

191
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:47,975
Maria, you're spoiling us.

192
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,392
When I heard you was coming,
I put in extra roast potatoes,

193
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,057
just the way you like them.

194
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:56,097
Ah, and this little peach,

195
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,898
she's looking more and more
like her grandmother.

196
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,267
That's all, Maria.
Thank you.

197
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,064
Mr. Cope, I just read your
story, the one called "Power."

198
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:12,725
- Hhm
- It's good, don't you think, Pa?

199
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,340
I thought it was quite manipulative,

200
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:20,441
a black man coming to the
rescue of a white boy.

201
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,975
Well, he comes to the rescue
of the bird, not just the boy.

202
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,445
The beauty in the story
is the allegory of the bird.

203
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:28,546
It represents freedom.

204
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:33,600
- What kind of freedom?
- Political freedom.

205
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:35,175
Fortunately for us,

206
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:38,676
blacks can't grasp
allegorical writing.

207
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,683
Shall we pray?

208
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:45,842
Lord, we thank you for what
we are about to receive.

209
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:48,552
In Jesus' name, amen.

210
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:51,017
- Amen.
- Smells good.

211
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,433
It's Rooibok.
Abraham shot it himself.

212
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:58,849
Dr. Jonker, you don't honestly believe
that black people are stupid, do you?

213
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,974
Intellectually inferior.

214
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:05,641
So by implication, you regard
the afrikaners as a superior race.

215
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,286
We were chosen by god
to lead this country.

216
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,487
Blood river proved that.

217
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:15,099
The nazis paid dearly for their
presumption of being a superior race.

218
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,738
If you think you can compare
the afrikaner to the nazis,

219
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:21,016
you're way off the mark,
Mr Cope.

220
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:23,516
Can we not just eat
with our differences?

221
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:34,140
Oh, Pieter called yesterday.

222
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:38,557
He wanted me to get a ticket for you
and Simone back to Johannesburg.

223
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,470
This is not the time, Pa.

224
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,899
I think you should go,
give it another try.

225
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,514
So, uh, Uys.

226
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,639
You working on something
interesting right now?

227
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:04,932
I'm doing an afrikaans translation
of <i>king lear.</i>

228
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,639
He had a terrible time with his
daughters too, that man.

229
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,848
Excuse me.

230
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,306
She is in her old room, boss.

231
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:52,806
I didn't mean to upset you.

232
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:55,931
You take pleasure in upsetting me.

233
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:58,889
It's mutual, wouldn't you say?

234
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:05,596
I dedicated my book to you, and you
didn't even tell me what you thought of it.

235
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:09,056
I'm not even sure you read it.

236
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,763
It's me in those words, Pa.

237
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:15,204
Don't you want to know who I am?

238
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:17,364
I know who you are.

239
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,596
You are your mother.

240
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,096
Is that why you hate me?

241
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,179
Ingrid.

242
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:37,138
We need to find peace between us.

243
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,554
You all right?

244
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:07,345
These yours?

245
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:12,545
When my oma died,
our father put us here.

246
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:14,475
This is where he put us...

247
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,554
In the servant's quarters.

248
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,511
Why here?

249
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,428
Because we didn't have shoes.

250
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:47,178
Ingrid.
You're beautiful.

251
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,678
Don't let anyone
ever tell you otherwise.

252
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,300
Anybody?

253
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,384
I'll have a glass.

254
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,050
- Can I read while you write?
- Hm, be my guest.

255
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,258
Dinner has arrived.

256
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,258
Oh, that is beautiful.

257
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,466
Ingrid, the flesh is in the tail.

258
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,050
You have not lived if you haven't
sucked the juice from a crayfish head.

259
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:07,050
Jan, you're a true afrikaner.
You'll try some head, won't you?

260
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:07,841
Good head.

261
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,175
Will you pass me the wine, please?
There's a desert in my soul.

262
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,925
Maurice says there's a new nightclub
called Darryl's.

263
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,507
Why don't we all go tonight?

264
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,800
- That's for delinquents, Ingrid
- Oh, I thought that's what we were.

265
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:26,757
A letter arrived yesterday from
Nkosi in Paris.

266
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:29,424
How did he manage to get out?

267
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:33,007
Mike hid him in the boot of his car,
took him to the Botswana border.

268
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:34,799
He swam the river,

269
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,400
dodged a few crocodiles,
and flew from Gaborone.

270
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:40,715
He enjoy Paris?
The women there love black men.

271
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,077
Is there garlic in this mayonnaise, Uys?

272
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:49,747
Uys puts garlic in everything, darling.

273
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,631
Kiss me.

274
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:12,256
Why did you do that?

275
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:17,881
- We're not married, Jack.
- We're living together.

276
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,631
So because I share your bed, I'm not allowed
to have feeling for other man? Is that it?

277
00:27:22,964 --> 00:27:25,089
Sexual feelings?

278
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,922
I can't help my feelings.

279
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:32,214
What, are you telling me you want
to sleep with Jan? Is that what you saying?

280
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:42,839
All I want is a home, Jack.

281
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:49,963
That's all I've ever wanted,

282
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,588
just a place to feel safe.

283
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:57,006
I can't remember when last I had that.

284
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:02,756
Jesus christ.

285
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:06,838
You're nothing.
You're less than nothing.

286
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:10,380
- I'm leaving in the morning
- I don't want you to go.

287
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,963
- Then marry me!
- Marry you?

288
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:16,213
There's a thousand reasons
why I can't marry you.

289
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:19,547
- Name me one!
- My divorce isn't finalized.

290
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:24,463
That's a technicality.
Give me another reason, a real reason!

291
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:29,588
It's a reasonable question,
considering you're fucking me!

292
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,504
Don't turn your back on me!

293
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:37,254
- Do you mind? Irma's trying sleep.
- Fuck Irma!

294
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:42,171
You've woken up Simone,
you idiots.

295
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:47,129
Perhaps she's just trying to explain
the theater of the absurd to us, Jack.

296
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:51,171
Go back to bed, Uys.

297
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:13,671
- You need to calm down.
- Don't tell me what to do!

298
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,921
You're not my father!

299
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,128
Thank god.

300
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,961
We'll all be off in the morning.

301
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,545
- I don't want you to leave.
- You do!

302
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,586
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,
Run away.

303
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:37,213
Remember the poem, Jack?

304
00:29:37,314 --> 00:29:40,336
Remember the running man on the beach?

305
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:43,836
Yeah, Run away,
You pathetic little man!

00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:59,793
<i>Love fades away from its place.</i>

320
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:03,043
<i>Carpenter seals a coffin that's bought.</i>

321
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,793
<i>I ready myself for the naught.</i>

322
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:10,459
<i>Small grain of sand is my
word, my breath.</i>

323
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:14,625
<i>Small grain of naught is my death."</i>

324
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,375
Hello, Pa.

325
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:13,000
- Where's your sister?
- Ingrid?

326
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:24,249
You read this.

327
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,666
Most of it is exaggerated, Pa.

328
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:30,724
- You know what reporters are like.
- Why do you openly disagree...

329
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,802
- ...with my political views?
- Because I do.

330
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:38,457
But you don't say that to a reporter
from the <i>Sunday times.</i>

331
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,915
Are you mad?

332
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,288
Ingrid.

333
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:45,507
Come sit and listen to me nicely.

334
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,332
Anna, go to your room please.

335
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,915
Have you no respect for me?

336
00:32:56,581 --> 00:32:59,249
I respect you very much, Pa.

337
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:02,915
Then why do you do
these things?

338
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:14,665
These people are only interested
in you because of me.

339
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:16,373
Do you realize that?

340
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,704
Why do you always try
and make me feel worthless?

341
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:23,929
Ingrid.

342
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,642
Grow up.

343
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,406
You can't do this to me.

344
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,519
It'll only be for a few months.

345
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,122
A few months is a lifetime.

346
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,122
I'll come with you to Natal.

347
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:57,247
I'll bring Simone.
I'd love to meet Helen.

348
00:33:57,331 --> 00:33:59,586
- The boys wouldn't understand.
- You think children don't know...

349
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:03,372
...what's going on? They're children;
They know everything.

350
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,872
Ingrid.
Take it easy.

351
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:13,204
Waitress.
More wine.

352
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,788
The bus is full.
You must take the next one.

353
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,454
Please, I'm going to be late.

354
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:46,371
- Get off.
- But there are so many seats open.

355
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:49,329
- Let him have a seat.
- Whites only.

356
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,913
- Idiot!
- Get off my bus, you stupid communist bitch.

357
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:54,663
Get your hands off her.

358
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,621
Bastard!

359
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:24,203
It's me you want to leave,
isn't it?

360
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,328
These last months have been
extraordinary, wonderful.

361
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,953
And I haven't been able to work.

362
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:36,287
You drain me, Ingrid.

363
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:44,078
Your timing is all messed up.

364
00:35:45,161 --> 00:35:46,286
How do you mean?

365
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,577
You will come back, won't you?

366
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:06,411
I love you.

367
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,243
Jack.

368
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:26,055
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

369
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:27,528
I resigned.

370
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:32,328
- What?
- So I could see you off.

371
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:35,662
Please don't go.
Please don't go.

372
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:37,953
I have to.

373
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,410
You can't do this to us.

374
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:48,285
I'll call.

375
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:10,783
Hey, go.

376
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:36,365
Hi, darling.

377
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:39,990
Come here.

378
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,533
Come.

379
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:43,740
Come.

380
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:53,365
Hi, my darling.

381
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,284
Christ, Ingrid, you look like death.

382
00:38:58,385 --> 00:39:00,885
I think I'm coming down with some flu.

383
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:35,609
Ingrid!

384
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,192
Don't be a stranger.
Come on up.

385
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:48,760
Jack's been trying to get hold of you.

386
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:51,399
Our phone's still disconnected.

387
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,154
Still no job?

388
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:56,856
I'm doing some proofreading
for human & Rousseau.

389
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:59,697
It's freelance,
But it pays the rent.

390
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,447
Sorry I'm late.
I picked up a puncture outside Colesburg.

391
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:07,864
- You have company.
- Eugene Maritz, Ingrid Jonker.

392
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:13,531
It's an honor.
I know your work intimately.

393
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:14,906
"Intimately"?

394
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:18,114
I mean, I know your work well.

395
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,780
Is that your manuscript?
Is that your latest novel?

396
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,696
Yes.
Sorry.

397
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,238
I'll leave the two of you to
resurrect afrikaans literature.

398
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,344
I'd love to speak with you
more sometime.

399
00:40:32,444 --> 00:40:36,067
Well, when the iceman is done with you,
I'll be down on the beach.

400
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:41,613
Don't even think about it.

401
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,904
Ingrid!
Jack's on the phone!

402
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:54,654
- Jack.
- Uys tells me you've been scarce.

403
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:57,278
When are you coming back?

404
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:59,154
Another month, at least.

405
00:41:02,363 --> 00:41:06,237
- Is Helen still with you?
- Uh, so are the boys.

406
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:09,570
She's the one you married;
I'm just the one you sleep with. Is that it?

407
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,737
- I love you, Ingrid.
- If you loved me, you'd be with me, you prick.

408
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:24,029
- Thought you wanted to talk to me?
- Uh, yes.

409
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:26,570
Give me a lift home.
We can talk in the car.

410
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:34,154
When's the last time you had
sex with a woman?

411
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:37,695
- I'm married.
- Marriage and sex don't go together.

412
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:41,111
Or is your wife your mistress?

413
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:48,733
Whose are these?

414
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,650
I don't know.

415
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,692
Uys, I've been away for three months.

416
00:43:56,796 --> 00:43:59,608
I come home and find a strange pair
of shoes in my cupboard.

417
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:02,358
Surely you should know
who they belong to.

418
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:07,650
Perhaps they belong
to Eugene Maritz.

419
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:15,812
Jack!

420
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,895
When did you come back?

421
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:32,687
Is there anything else
I should know about?

422
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:35,979
I love you, Jack.

423
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:42,561
You are a liar, Ingrid.

424
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:47,146
- There's something you should know.
- What?

425
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:49,916
You going tell me you fucked Uys as well?

426
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,143
- You've cut my heart, Jack.
- You don't have a heart.

427
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:24,684
<i>"All that breaks
falls or dies away,</i>

428
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,926
<i>like the ejaculation of seed,</i>

429
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:30,627

430
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:35,933

431
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:38,655

<i>has no other fulfillment than the tomb."</i>

433
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:05,515
- How's work, Pa?
- Busy.

434
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,500
I see the government has banned the
mixed-race audiences to...

435
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,473
...all sports meetings,
concerts, theaters...

436
00:46:14,573 --> 00:46:17,173
We haven't banned anything.

437
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:21,409
They just have to obtain
a permit beforehand.

438
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:24,441
Uys Kriger has applied for
a mixed-race permit for his production...

439
00:46:24,442 --> 00:46:26,978
<i>...of king lear,
and it was turned down.</i>

440
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:30,161
- By you, Pa.
- Yah

441
00:46:30,262 --> 00:46:35,584
because his translation
gave the play a political slant.

442
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,725
What isn't political in this country?

443
00:46:38,825 --> 00:46:42,472
I would hope having dinner
isn't political.

444
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:52,107
Oh.

445
00:46:57,769 --> 00:46:59,558
You didn't pay the bill.

446
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:02,466
looks like you had more important
things to spend your money on.

447
00:47:13,136 --> 00:47:17,053
Come on, honey. Mommy's going
to pick you up for a proper meal.

448
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:27,292
- Give her to me.
- No. No.

449
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,427
- Give her to me.
- No.

450
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:35,177
Oh, god.

451
00:47:39,094 --> 00:47:41,843
Ingrid, you cut yourself.

452
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,939
Enough, okay?

453
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:44,419
You have to get out of here,
okay?

454
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:47,594
Tonight.
You have to go.

455
00:47:48,094 --> 00:47:52,384
I can't take it anymore, Ingrid.
I'm sorry, but i can't.

456
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:55,926
You think I don't understand?

457
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:59,634
I can barely live with myself.

458
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:19,350
<i>"My days seek out after
the carriage of your body. </i>

459

lineaments of your name.</i>

460
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:25,444
always before me in the
paths of my eyes.

461
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:29,138
My only fear is an awareness that
will change your blood into water,

462
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,591
that will change your name
into a number,

463
00:48:32,716 --> 00:48:36,506
...and deny your eyes a like...like...

465
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,173
Anna.

466
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,422
Hi, Simone.

467
00:49:13,297 --> 00:49:16,630
Nkosi says he's written to you twice
but you haven't replied.

468
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,088
He thinks the security police
are intercepting you mail.

469
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:26,004
He sent me this letter, and he wants
me to deliver it to his brother.

470
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,213
Do you know where he lives?

471
00:49:28,963 --> 00:49:31,003
Nyanga.

472
00:49:34,546 --> 00:49:36,796
Would you take me there?

473
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,544
Excuse me.
We're looking for someone.

474
00:50:13,352 --> 00:50:15,702
You're sure this is the place?

475
00:50:15,803 --> 00:50:17,303
Thank you.

476
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:26,043
Hello, we're looking for
Siyabonga.

477
00:50:26,843 --> 00:50:29,375
We're friends of Nkosi.

478
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:34,543
Police were here two days ago
and take him away.

479
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:38,209
I'm sorry to hear that.

480
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,874
What's going on?

481
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:53,916
It's a passport protest.

482
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:18,320
We have a child sick
I'm taking her to hospital!

483
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,960
Get back.

484
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,497
Get back.
Get back.

485
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:31,665
Get back.

486
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:34,953
The child is not dead.

487
00:52:41,536 --> 00:52:44,453
The child is not dead.

488
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,118
The child is not dead.

489
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:05,034
- The iceman.
- I want to speak to Jack.

490
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,117
Please don't deny me.

491
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:15,280
Yes?

492
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:18,155
Jack, I can't get that child
out of my head.

493
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:21,950
Every time I look at Simone,
I see him.

494
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:26,084
I'm going crazy, Jack. I know it.
I'm going crazy. Please come over.

495
00:53:26,184 --> 00:53:29,783
- Ingrid, I'm busy right now. sorry.
- But I need to talk to you.

496
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,450
Jack.

497
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,740
Jack.

498
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:54,324
- Number, please.
- Bloemfontein 24107, please.

499
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:58,910
Maritz residence.

500
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:01,629
Hello, is Eugene there?

501
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:05,083
<i>Eugene?
For you.</i>

502
00:54:05,115 --> 00:54:07,198
Hello?

503
00:54:07,614 --> 00:54:10,989
If you leave now, you'd be
in Cape Town for breakfast.

504
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:15,822
I don't think it would be wise
to run that article.

505
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:19,155
<i>The censorship board might ban it.</i>

506
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:25,780
I bet your wife doesn't fuck you
half as good as I do.

507
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:37,321
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

508
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:39,405
Thank you.

509
00:55:04,986 --> 00:55:07,424
There are no black children here.

510
00:55:07,486 --> 00:55:09,403
What's that you say?

511
00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:13,652
I've only just noticed that there's
no black children here.

512
00:55:13,736 --> 00:55:17,881
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They keep them locked up in location

513
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:20,486
They don't have a pass, you see.

514
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:29,360
Location.

515
00:55:56,068 --> 00:56:00,317
- I can't open my door.
- That's because I changed the lock.

516
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:06,192
You can't keep living here
for free.

517
00:56:12,483 --> 00:56:15,233
Let's go.

518
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:48,480
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:52,647
We need a place,
just for the night.

520
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:54,206
Please.

521
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:20,271
Where are we going, mum?

522
00:57:30,854 --> 00:57:34,566
We put an extra bed
in the guest room for Simone.

523
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:37,020
I'd rather stay
in my old room, Pa.

524
00:57:38,145 --> 00:57:40,145
We'll be fine there.

525
00:57:41,102 --> 00:57:44,020
Yeah, Ingrid, you must do
what you have to do.

526
00:57:53,061 --> 00:57:55,685
<i>"Screams the smell of freedom
and heather,</i>

527
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,852
<i>the march of the generations

528
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:06,068

529
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:08,451
<i>Without a pass."</i>

00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:22,393
<i>Police station at Philippi.

00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:26,309
<i>Nor at Nyanga
nor at Orlando.</i>

532
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:49,599
Yeah.

533
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:52,224
Can I come in?

534
00:58:53,016 --> 00:58:55,682
- I'm in middle of something.
- Please,

535
00:58:55,683 --> 00:58:57,849
will you read my new poem, Pa?

536
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:05,683
It would really mean a lot to me
if I could hear you read it.

537
00:59:07,473 --> 00:59:09,308
All right.

538
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:24,681
"The child is not dead.

539
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:33,139
The child raises his fists
against his mother,

540
00:59:33,222 --> 00:59:36,014
who screams 'AFRICA.'

541
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:40,514
Go on.

542
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:48,350
Screams the smell of freedom
and heather in the locations

543
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,638
of the heart under siege.

544
00:59:51,763 --> 00:59:57,137
The child raises his fists
against his father,

545

in the march of the generations
who scream 'AFRICA,'

546
01:00:01,595 --> 01:00:08,304
screams the smell of justice in blood
on the streets of his armed pride.

547
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:15,261
The child is not...

548
01:00:15,386 --> 01:00:16,272
...dead

549
01:00:16,273 --> 01:00:22,293
neither at Langa nor Nyanga
nor at Sharpeville

550
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:31,386
nor at the police station in Philippi,
where he lies with a bullet in his head."

551
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:37,718
Please, Pa, go on.
You're nearly there.

552
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,052
You're nearly there.

553
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,135
I can't finish this.

554
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:53,677
What do you think of it
so far?

555
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:13,883
Don't worry, Pa.

556
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:19,091
I've got it all inside here.

557
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:24,996
<i>The worms stir against my mother...</i>

558
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:27,185
<i>wind of the roses,
wind of the mud...</i>

559
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:30,018
<i>echo gives no answer...

560
01:01:30,118 --> 01:01:33,796
<i>follow my absent image...

561
01:01:33,896 --> 01:01:37,136
<i>the lonesomest fingers in the world...
the cornerstones of my heart</i>

562
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,988

563
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:42,083
<i>she doesn't know I'm scared...

564
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:49,798
Jack Cope.

565
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,839
It's me.

566
01:01:50,924 --> 01:01:52,839
- Who is this?
- Shh!

567
01:01:53,036 --> 01:01:56,098
Not so loud, not so loud.
Jack, listen to me.

568
01:01:56,161 --> 01:01:57,548
I'm being held prisoner.

569
01:01:57,648 --> 01:01:58,995
You have to come and get me.
I'm at my father's.

570
01:01:59,096 --> 01:02:00,196
Meet me at the Cape, please.

571
01:02:00,256 --> 01:02:01,922
- Ingrid....
- He's poisoning me, Jack.

572
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:04,005
He's poisoning me and Simone.

573
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:08,255
This is the last time I'll ask you
for anything, I swear.

574
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:10,673
Do this one thing for me, please.

575
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:25,380
Drive.

576
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:37,963
I don't have any money.

577
01:02:39,629 --> 01:02:40,879
Sorry.

578
01:02:47,254 --> 01:02:49,545
I'll pay you back.

579
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,670
Bye.

580
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,375
Thank you.

581
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:11,457
Ingrid was admitted to Valkenberg
mental asylum last night.

582
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:17,082
That's where her mother died.

583
01:04:49,455 --> 01:04:51,755
I'll call when I'm done.

584
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,539
I...I can't leave you alone
with her.

585
01:04:57,372 --> 01:04:59,872
They're like the police.

586
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:04,039
They count all the knives
and forks after we eat.

587
01:05:18,538 --> 01:05:22,495
They took my poems.
All of them.

588
01:05:28,745 --> 01:05:30,953
Don't worry;

589
01:05:31,037 --> 01:05:34,078
I've got them all up here.

590
01:05:40,328 --> 01:05:43,036
Like <i>smoke and ochre.</i>

591
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:51,861
I've been thinking about
our baby, Jack.

592
01:05:52,111 --> 01:05:55,076
Wondering if it was a girl or a boy.

593
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:03,785
I can't stop thinking about it.

594
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:07,617
What are you talking about?

595
01:06:07,742 --> 01:06:11,035
Our blood child lying in the gutter...

596
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,035
Trembling.

597
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:30,825
I wanted to tell you, but
I couldn't find the words.

598
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,450
And then you went away.

599
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,908
And I got rid of it.

600
01:06:48,073 --> 01:06:50,323
I killed it.

601
01:06:57,907 --> 01:07:00,323
Why didn't you tell me?

602
01:07:00,657 --> 01:07:04,323
Because you would have
married me for the wrong reason.

603
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,864
When I'm better,
I'm going to leave here...

604
01:07:20,614 --> 01:07:22,489
and go to Europe.

605
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:30,780
Been dreaming about it.

606
01:07:30,822 --> 01:07:35,822
You, me, and Simone in Paris.

607
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,488
I love you, Jack.

608
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:04,191
I'm taking these.

609
01:09:04,192 --> 01:09:06,691
You have to sign for them.
Sir?

610
01:09:06,816 --> 01:09:11,441
"I thought I should come upon
my heart, where I kept the two...

611
01:09:11,504 --> 01:09:13,941
...brown butterflies of your eyes."

612
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,858
Quite brilliant.

613
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:19,099
"Sewer, oh, sewer.
I lie trembling, singing....

614
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,775
how else but trembling?...

615
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,025
...with my blood child
under your water."

616
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,315
I think you should open with...

617
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,630
- <i>"On all the faces of all people."</i>
- No, it should start with

618
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:34,781
<i>"The child that was shot dead
by soldiers in Nyanga."</i>

619
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:36,768
I disagree.
That poem is too politically pointed.

620
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,773
So?

621
01:09:38,998 --> 01:09:41,244
Why start with that?
start with something gentler, like

622
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,982
<i>On all the faces of all people...</i>

623
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:47,187
Look.
Look.

624
01:11:02,769 --> 01:11:05,602
Uys and I have a surprise for you.

625
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,060
Come on.

626
01:11:17,726 --> 01:11:20,519
You may want to change
a few things.

627
01:11:20,559 --> 01:11:22,749
We could never agree
on the order of the poems.

628
01:11:22,849 --> 01:11:24,007
I've also edited some.

629
01:11:24,108 --> 01:11:26,854
I hope you don't think
I've butchered it too much.

630
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,162
Come. 
It's bedtime.

631
01:12:05,263 --> 01:12:07,304
I'm going to pick you up 
and bring you to bed.

632
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:14,370
Jack.

633
01:12:14,432 --> 01:12:16,712
They're going to publish
<i>smoke and ochre!</i>

634
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:19,891
They've offered me an advance
of 2,000 Rand. Look.

635
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,556
Brilliant.

636
01:12:26,806 --> 01:12:29,015
Fabulous man!

637
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:33,222
Keep the wine flowing, please.

638
01:12:33,347 --> 01:12:35,389
This is going to cost
an ram and a leg.

639
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:36,431
Who cares?

640
01:12:36,556 --> 01:12:39,347
If you win the APB prize,
you must go to Europe.

641
01:12:39,472 --> 01:12:42,183
- You know you're up against Eugene.
- With what?

642
01:12:42,283 --> 01:12:43,825
Because he doesn't have 
a new novel coming out.

643
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,490
It's being printed as we speak.
I got a look at the manuscript.

644
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,934
What's it about?

645
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:49,604
It's called Lust.

646
01:12:49,605 --> 01:12:51,141
 Well, that's direct.

647
01:12:51,888 --> 01:12:54,374
- Well, I hope you win, Ingrid.
- Me too.

648
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,584
You must go to Paris
and Amsterdam.

649
01:12:56,684 --> 01:12:59,165
Spain.
you write like Lorca.

650
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,971
You'll fit Barcelona like a glove.

651
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:07,303
I, uh...op.
I want to make a toast.

652
01:13:07,571 --> 01:13:09,904
I was going to wait for
<i>smoke and ochre</i> to come out,

653
01:13:10,004 --> 01:13:14,096
but I can't wait any longer.

654
01:13:14,388 --> 01:13:19,345
I decided to dedicate the book
to Uys and Jack,

655
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,553
without whom none of this would
have ever happened.

656
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:24,469
So,

657
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:30,053
to my two oldest...
and dearest friends.

658
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:37,732
Uys and Jack.

659
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:40,713
- Uys and Jack.
- Uys and Jack.

660
01:13:52,168 --> 01:13:53,696
Uys! 

661
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:56,197
- reviews are out.
- What's the verdict?

662
01:13:56,343 --> 01:13:58,135
Glorious.

663
01:13:58,176 --> 01:14:02,635
"Sensational New York of verse
infused with powerful emotion.

664
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,175
- Rew, eruptive..."
- To pass as the prose of a new generation."

665
01:14:07,385 --> 01:14:09,655
"A leading light of <i>die Sestigers</i>,
which include..."

666
01:14:09,755 --> 01:14:12,884
- Even you're in here.
- I should bloody well hope so.

667
01:14:21,009 --> 01:14:24,425
- your father will see you now.
- Thank you.

668
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:26,091
Thank you.

669
01:14:26,134 --> 01:14:29,726
You didn't have to come here.
You could have called.

670
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,049
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

671
01:14:32,799 --> 01:14:34,354
What is it?

672
01:14:34,355 --> 01:14:37,073
I won the APB prize.

673
01:14:38,049 --> 01:14:39,757
I heard.

674
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:43,794
They're flying me up to Johannesburg 
to receive the award,

675
01:14:43,894 --> 01:14:46,189
and I was wondering maybe
if you would...

676
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:48,549
if you would accompany me.

677
01:14:52,299 --> 01:14:55,382
It'd be a great honor for me, Pa.

678
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:57,923
Ingrid.

679
01:15:01,715 --> 01:15:04,673
I wanted to ban the book,

680
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,649
but my colleagues convinced me
otherwise not because they believed

681
01:15:08,749 --> 01:15:10,423
it had any artistic value,

682
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:15,297
but because of the scandal it would have
caused, considering I'm your father.

683
01:15:16,464 --> 01:15:20,838
"My blood child lies
in the gutter. "

684
01:15:21,838 --> 01:15:24,506
That's disgusting.

685
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:30,629
"I am with those who abuse sex"?

686
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,664
You can say that again.

687
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:37,338
According to my sources,
you are having sexual relations with

688
01:15:37,438 --> 01:15:40,004
everyone and anyone:

689
01:15:40,212 --> 01:15:45,479
Jan Rabie, Uys Kriger, Andre Brink,
Jack Cope, Eugene Maritz.

690
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:48,181
- Stop it, Pa.
- The list goes on and on.

691
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:52,129
I'm the laughingstock of parliament
because of you.

692
01:15:52,254 --> 01:15:54,504
You're a slut.

693
01:15:57,587 --> 01:16:00,503
I never want to see you again.

694
01:16:52,076 --> 01:16:53,897
Ingrid's on the phone.

695
01:16:53,997 --> 01:16:56,875
She says her wrists are sore and damp.

696
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,815
- You'll come with me to Europe, won't you?
- Well, you know them.

697
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:39,289
They refused to give me a passport.

698
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:47,331
You have to get me out of here.

699
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:09,412
Hello, Jack.

700
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,622
Eugene.

701
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,144
<i>"My darling Jack,</i>

702
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:22,607
<i>you said Amsterdam 
would be filled with flowers,</i>

703
01:18:22,787 --> 01:18:27,513
<i>but everything here is gray:
my feelings,</i>

704
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:31,953
<i>the people, even Eugene.</i>

705
01:18:32,078 --> 01:18:36,036
<i>Europe is nothing but a false promise.</i>

706
01:18:36,036 --> 01:18:38,953
<i>Half of me is missing, Jack.</i>

707
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:42,578
<i>Write and tell me you love me."</i>

708
01:18:46,078 --> 01:18:48,328
I stopped over at Barnard's.

709
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,415
He's throwing a party for us
tomorrow night.

710
01:18:50,515 --> 01:18:51,442
Everyone's invited,

711
01:18:51,443 --> 01:18:55,792
Pierre, Albie, Lionel, 
and Nkosi's coming up from paris.

712
01:18:57,536 --> 01:18:59,369
A new poem.

713
01:19:01,202 --> 01:19:02,535
It's not finished.

714
01:19:02,952 --> 01:19:05,460
Don't be coy. 
Let me read it.

715
01:19:05,461 --> 01:19:07,162
- No, it's not finished.
- Let me see it.

716
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:10,897
- Let me read it.
- It's not finished.

717
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:21,118
"Half of me is missing, Jack.
Write and tell me you love me"?

718
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:27,075
Well, half is certainly missing now.

719
01:19:43,808 --> 01:19:46,324
Hello, Ingrid.

720
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:47,783
Nkosi.

721
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:50,908
It's good to see you.

722
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:53,574
How's Paris?

723
01:19:54,907 --> 01:19:59,782
Beware of Europe.
For an african, it can never become home.

724
01:20:01,032 --> 01:20:03,032
Are you writing?

725
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:06,199
No.
I'm dried up,

726
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:08,824
waiting to become the child your poem,

727
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:12,990
waiting to raise the fist and
shout, 'AFRICA.'

728
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:39,239
You're drinking too much.

729
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:56,422
I've decided...

730
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:59,101
I'm not coming with you to Paris.

731
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:05,862
- We leave tomorrow.
- I have to finish my novel.

732
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:09,237
- I have to deliver it by the end of the month.
- But with me, you're not getting it?

733
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:13,278
Frankly, you drain me.

734
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,777
What?

735
01:21:20,862 --> 01:21:22,237
What's so funny?

736
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:26,021
Jack used those exact same words.

737
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:29,106
He said I drain him.

738
01:21:36,236 --> 01:21:38,402
I'm pregnant.

739
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:43,611
You...you can't be.

740
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,340
What...what...
what you doing?

741
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,484
I'm miscarrying.

742
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:58,943
- Or do you want our child?
- you can't do this to me.

743
01:24:44,267 --> 01:24:49,017
Dr. Jonker? This is Dr. Verraine 
from the Paris sanatorium.

744
01:24:49,226 --> 01:24:52,350
- Did you receive my telegram?
- Yes, I did.

745
01:24:52,558 --> 01:24:56,808
Well, I cannot proceed with the electroshock
therapy unless I have your permission.

746
01:24:57,975 --> 01:25:01,100
You have my permission.

747
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,807
I missed you more than sunsets.

748
01:25:34,473 --> 01:25:35,514
I missed you.

749
01:25:37,514 --> 01:25:39,723
Come.

750
01:25:45,389 --> 01:25:49,327
I called Pa.
He's hunting in the southwest.

751
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,514
Of course.

752
01:25:52,223 --> 01:25:54,222
Good to see you.

753
01:25:54,337 --> 01:25:56,826
How are you all?

754
01:25:57,055 --> 01:25:59,430
Well, well.

755
01:26:00,263 --> 01:26:02,888
- Where's home this time?
- At me.

756
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:05,221
Thank you.

757
01:26:10,346 --> 01:26:12,763
You look well.

758
01:26:14,762 --> 01:26:17,012
How are you?

759
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:19,721
I'm tired.

760
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:25,886
Everything will be fine.

761
01:26:38,261 --> 01:26:40,238
You've been working on a new novel.

762
01:26:40,338 --> 01:26:43,927
Mhmm.
Like never before.

763
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:47,802
It's gushing out of me like a ripe well.

764
01:26:48,324 --> 01:26:50,927
I want you to read it.

765
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:03,760
I can't write anymore.

766
01:27:09,593 --> 01:27:13,051
Perhaps you should take off
your shoes.

767
01:27:44,382 --> 01:27:47,715
I want you and Simone to move
back into the Bungalow with me.

768
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,082
- I don't think so, Jack.
- Why not?

769
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:56,840
I'm not good for love anymore.

770
01:28:27,339 --> 01:28:28,380
Higher.

771
01:28:29,839 --> 01:28:32,089
Auntie, higher.

772
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:35,297
Push me higher.

773
01:28:39,754 --> 01:28:44,171
"If I had a world of own,
everything would be nonsense.

774
01:28:44,296 --> 01:28:48,179
Nothing would be what it is,
because everything would be what it isn't.

775
01:28:48,204 --> 01:28:51,420
And contrariwise, what it is,
it wouldn't be,

776
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:53,504
and what it wouldn't be,
it would."

777
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:57,545
Why does mummy never smile
anymore?

778
01:28:58,754 --> 01:29:00,920
I don't know, darling.

779
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:19,877
Mummy, I've got a secret
to tell you.

780
01:29:19,919 --> 01:29:21,752
What is it?

781
01:29:24,586 --> 01:29:27,294
Nothing.

782
01:29:30,919 --> 01:29:33,751
That's the secret to everything.

783
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:16,291
I have something for you.

784
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:20,875
Come off with your jacket.

785
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:38,499
It's your prize.

786
01:30:38,624 --> 01:30:40,582
Open it.

787
01:30:49,664 --> 01:30:51,582
Read this.

788
01:30:51,707 --> 01:30:56,822
"To dear Jack,
with all my deepest love, Ingrid. "

789
01:30:56,922 --> 01:30:59,365
Yes, but read the poem.

790
01:30:59,465 --> 01:31:02,330
It's 'WHITMAN.'

791
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,038
"If we go anywhere, we go together
to meet what happens.

792
01:31:13,247 --> 01:31:18,163
Maybe we'll be better off and
blither and learn something.

793
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:23,434
Maybe it is yourself now really
ushering me to the true songs.

794
01:31:23,538 --> 01:31:25,829
Who know?

795
01:31:25,954 --> 01:31:31,704
Maybe it is you, the mortal knob,
really undoing, turning.

So now, finally, good-bye
and farewell, my love."

797

Going home.

799
01:31:52,961 --> 01:31:55,878
- Well,...Ingrid.
- I'll be fine.

800

Ingrid.

801

Hello, miss.
You all right?

802
01:34:38,035 --> 01:34:40,061
<i>In the dark days...</i>

803
01:34:40,062 --> 01:34:42,820
<i>...when all seemed hopeless...</i>

804
01:34:42,821 --> 01:34:44,595
<i>in our country,</i>

805
01:34:45,028 --> 01:34:47,732
<i>when men refused</i>

806
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,880
<i>to hear her resonant voice,</i>

807
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:54,359
<i>she took her own life.</i>

808
01:34:54,484 --> 01:34:58,984
<i>She was both an afrikaner
and an african.</i>

809
01:35:00,401 --> 01:35:03,651
<i>Her name is Ingrid Jonker.</i>

810
01:35:05,818 --> 01:35:08,651
<i>She wrote, and I quote,</i>

811
01:35:09,776 --> 01:35:12,609
<i>"The child is not dead.</i>

812
01:35:14,359 --> 01:35:20,387
<i>The child lifts his fists
against his mother,</i>

813
01:35:20,388 --> 01:35:22,804
<i>who shouts, 'AFRICA.'</i>

814
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:26,826
<i>The child is not dead,</i>

815
01:35:26,827 --> 01:35:31,120
<i>not at Langa nor at Nyanga</i>

816
01:35:31,382 --> 01:35:36,025
<i>nor at Orlando
nor at Sharpeville</i>

817
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:40,247
<i>nor at the police post at Philippi,</i>

818
01:35:40,347 --> 01:35:45,675
<i>where he lies with a bullet 
through his brain.</i>

819
01:35:46,982 --> 01:35:55,441
<i>The child who only wanted to play
in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere.</i>

820
01:35:56,441 --> 01:36:03,065
<i>The child, grown to a man,
treks on through all africa.</i>

821
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:10,814
<i>The child, grown into a giant,
journeys over the whole world</i>

822
01:36:11,606 --> 01:36:13,564
<i>Without a pass."</i>
