1
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,804
To my brother ANTONIO

2
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,734
Where am I?

3
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,849
Where have they put me?

4
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:48,458
Who brought me here?

5
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,422
The spiral...

6
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,056
is like life itself.

7
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:13,757
Get out of the way!
Are you crazy?

8
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:14,984
Let's go! Hurry up!

9
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,336
Where am I?

10
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,214
May I help you, sir?

11
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:46,717
Cayetana.

12
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,155
Cayetana.

13
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,822
What did those animals do to you?

14
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:01,533
- Watch where you're going!
- I'm sorry.

15
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:06,007
Forget it, René.
He's just a crazy foreigner.

16
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:09,072
You can't just bump into people!

17
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,047
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

18
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,584
I already told you I'm sorry.

19
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:17,018
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
So what?

20
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,141
Rosarito.

21
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,810
What are you doing here, Father?

22
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:51,420
Come on. Let's go home.

23
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:04,260
If the doctor told you
to stay in bed...

24
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:07,168
then you should stay in bed.

25
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:10,310
And if you do get up,
then stay indoors.

26
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:14,511
If you survive this,
you were born lucky.

27
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:18,482
How could you go out
in your nightshirt in the rain?

28
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:20,515
Oh, Francisco.

29
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:24,955
You must've been the laughingstock...

30
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,319
of the whole town.

31
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,153
That's all she worries about.

32
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,195
What people will say.

33
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,966
I'm fine. I'm fine.

34
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,433
Am I?

35
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,008
Normal, just normal.

36
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:44,694
Leandro.

37
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,177
As we were saying...

38
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:49,479
I don't share your optimism.

39
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,779
As long as Ferdinand VII
is in power...

40
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,786
pigheadedness and corruption...

41
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:58,681
will continue along
their respective paths...

42
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,620
and for us Liberals,
they'll make our lives impossible.

43
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:07,856
"It's the same everywhere."

44
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:09,801
It's the same everywhere...

45
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:11,697
No, no.

46
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:13,704
I'm staying here.

47
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,808
If I die, let them bury me.

48
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,010
I'm fine here in Bordeaux.

49
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,376
I like the city,
the countryside, the climate.

50
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:23,877
The food is good.

51
00:12:24,184 --> 00:12:26,175
The people are hospitable.

52
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,714
And the wine...

53
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,515
fantastic.

54
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:35,226
And you're all here,
my old friends.

55
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,555
The only thing I miss...

56
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,231
is my villa in Madrid.

57
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,337
And your lithographs?

58
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:47,538
They're coming along slowly.

59
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,905
My eyes get tired.

60
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:53,936
I've decided to call them
"Prints of Bulls."

61
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:55,742
What do you think?

62
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:01,076
"The Bulls...

63
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:04,616
of Bordeaux."

64
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,094
What are you doing here, Rosarito?
Go on, get out!

65
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,124
I like it.

66
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,932
Bathtime's over, gentlemen.

67
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:17,763
That's it?

68
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:22,432
Can't I even have a peaceful
conversation with friends?

69
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,209
Sit down, Leandro.

70
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,247
I'll come back to say good-bye.

71
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:32,468
Good-bye...

72
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,554
- Leocadia.
- Good-bye, Leandro.

73
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:38,284
You know you're always welcome.

74
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,825
You abuse me because I'm old!

75
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,225
You're wrong if you think...

76
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:45,456
you'll get away with it.
I'm warning you.

77
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:48,628
I'm not going to die!

78
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,605
I'm going to live
at least 99 years...

79
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,268
like Titian!

80
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:56,941
God willing!

81
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:58,528
Come now.

82
00:13:58,912 --> 00:13:59,970
Settle down.

83
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:02,638
No more tantrums.

84
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:07,776
You're becoming an old grouch.

85
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,752
What would I do without you, Leocadia?

86
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:07,266
That gentleman
is staring at you, Cayetana.

87
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,040
Who is she?

88
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,307
The one laughing with Godoy.

89
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,418
The Duchess of Alba.

90
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:23,253
Be careful.

91
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:25,649
She's a dangerous woman.

92
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,438
My greatest ambition
was to be the Court Painter.

93
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:53,843
But the other candidates
had powerful patrons.

94
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:57,210
It was a very exclusive circle.

95
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,146
First I had to make
a name for myself.

96
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:04,123
That meant having to flatter
powerful people.

97
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,521
Here, in the Osuna's salon...

98
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,653
gathered the most intelligent
people in Spain.

99
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:15,759
The best-educated,
the most ambitious politicians...

100
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:18,369
and the most beautiful
and elegant women.

101
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,508
I liked that world, I must admit,
but I didn't fit in.

102
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,408
Those aristocrats, politicians...

103
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,378
and thinkers, all influenced
by French culture...

104
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,245
had the power to change our country.

105
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,021
That power gave my life meaning...

106
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:39,423
and to this end,
using my efforts and my art...

107
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,193
I dedicated myself.

108
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:45,526
I had everything I wanted.

109
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,228
My art as a painter...

110
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,929
was recognized by everyone.

111
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:52,530
Well...

112
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,867
nearly everyone.

113
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:58,938
Rosarito...

114
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,745
You're not listening.

115
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:08,821
As I grew famous with time...

116
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,820
my enemies also grew more numerous.

117
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:14,958
Especially after I was named
the Court Painter.

118
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,891
Take your valerian, Dad.

119
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:19,759
I was earning more than I needed.

120
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,997
I had more commissions
than I could handle...

121
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,566
and my family life...

122
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,335
was happy enough.

123
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,443
Though I can't say
I was a good husband.

124
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,177
I wasn't a good husband...

125
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,646
Rosarito.

126
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,909
María Josefa...

127
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:42,913
was a good woman.

128
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:46,292
But Bayeu, her brother...

129
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:48,618
was a bad painter...

130
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,858
- and a bore.
- The valerian, Dad.

131
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:54,993
What was I saying?

132
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:00,437
Bayeu was a bore...

133
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:01,766
Right.

134
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,935
I loved her,
but in a different way.

135
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,379
The valerian...

136
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,382
It's repulsive!

137
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:18,387
You all are going to kill me!

138
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,411
Rosarito!

139
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,227
Rosarito, come here!

140
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,960
Oh, well.

141
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:46,882
I've ruined everything.

142
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,397
Be careful.
Don't cut yourself.

143
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,036
We do it for your own good!

144
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:13,236
If you act like this, I'll leave!

145
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,778
You understand?

146
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,754
Cover yourself
and put on your robe!

147
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:25,022
- Put it on or I'm leaving.
- Wait.

148
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,125
I'll put it on.

149
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,622
I'll cover my neck...

150
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,963
I'll wear the plush slippers...

151
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,759
and I'll drink the valerian.

152
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,361
- All right?
- All right.

153
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:44,623
Where's your mother?

154
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:46,262
Buying food.

155
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:52,641
Did I ever tell you...

156
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:54,576
how I went deaf?

157
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:02,088
It's a gift from the gods, my child.

158
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:04,889
Since the age of 45...

159
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:06,729
my life has been a miracle.

160
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:09,966
Have I never told you?

161
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,060
No. What happened?

162
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:15,334
You're lying.

163
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:18,973
What was I saying?

164
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:21,846
That you want the valerian.

165
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:23,532
Right!

166
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:27,017
You should hear my story.

167
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:31,656
Immaturity and the sins of youth...

168
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,161
plunged me down into hell, my child.

169
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,490
I was very ill.

170
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:41,858
At the very gates of death.

171
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:44,702
Everyone took me for dead...

172
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:47,366
and with the devil at my side.

173
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,536
But as you can see...

174
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:51,609
I'm still here.

175
00:22:52,178 --> 00:22:55,841
Old and deaf as a post,
yet here I am.

176
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:59,943
I can't even keep count
of all my dead friends.

177
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,656
At first I kept a list
and told myself:

178
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,285
"How sad."

179
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:07,718
But then I thought:

180
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:11,460
"How lucky it wasn't me."

181
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,370
The deafness...

182
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,200
is total.

183
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,235
With everything else,
it wouldn't...

184
00:23:58,611 --> 00:23:59,908
be so bad.

185
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:04,844
But the illness has weakened him
significantly.

186
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,710
I fear for his life.

187
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:10,789
He won't see a priest.

188
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:14,890
- He refused the extreme unction.
- You must insist.

189
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:18,296
His condition is very serious.
Have you told his family?

190
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,860
His wife is on her way.

191
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:22,418
I don't know.

192
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,065
He might not see the morning.

193
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,908
Well, it's in God's hands now.

194
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:33,442
I've done all I can.

195
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:02,796
No, no, no...

196
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,459
I don't want to die!

197
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:06,169
No! No!

198
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:09,307
I don't want to die. No!

199
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:53,015
Deafness isolated me
from the world...

200
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:57,614
and for a time
I was bitter and solitary.

201
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,759
I didn't want to see
or talk to anyone.

202
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:03,857
From then on I got headaches...

203
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,588
that left me battered.

204
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:08,598
Never again will I hear
the sound of water...

205
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,431
children laughing...

206
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,429
women's voices.

207
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:18,407
Never again would I hear
birds singing...

208
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:20,537
the sound of the wind...

209
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,981
the thunder of a summer storm.

210
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:27,450
Never again will I hear the music...

211
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,451
which had once soothed me so.

212
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,751
That's when I started to work...

213
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,494
on my "Caprichos."

214
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,677
It's often been argued
that men are worse than women...

215
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:55,175
and the reverse.

216
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:58,583
We're all the same.

217
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:01,314
"Made for each other."

218
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,325
What a sacrifice.

219
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,625
That's how the world is.

220
00:28:19,806 --> 00:28:21,467
Good advice.

221
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:26,869
Advice is only as good
as he who gives it.

222
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:37,347
The old woman knows all too well
to pull her stockings tight.

223
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:52,399
"The Bogeyman is coming"...

224
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:56,865
their parents say.

225
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:01,244
They plant fear of things
which don't exist.

226
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,882
They make the child
fear the "Bogeyman"...

227
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:07,216
more than the men who invented him.

228
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,056
Cayetana...

229
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:20,559
my love...

230
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:22,993
my life.

231
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:26,495
Where are you?

232
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:30,601
What did those animals do to you?

233
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,214
Cayetana, my love.

234
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,911
What did those animals do to you?

235
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:48,887
The imagination without reason...

236
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,062
brings forth impossible monsters.

237
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,268
But joined to it...

238
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:16,218
is the mother of the arts,
and the source of marvels.

239
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,004
The imagination...

240
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:36,431
joined with reason...

241
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:39,778
is the mother of the arts...

242
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:42,974
and the source of marvels.

243
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,412
What are you saying?

244
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:48,849
Nothing. Did I say something?

245
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:50,682
I didn't say anything.

246
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,951
Did I say something?

247
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:54,709
Yes, you did.

248
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:56,519
Your neck.

249
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:00,192
Now you're decent.

250
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:04,099
Mutton dressed as lamb...

251
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:06,199
is still mutton.

252
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:09,191
Let's go.

253
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:37,894
How are you, Father?
Did you sleep well?

254
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:40,031
Go on, child. Go on.

255
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:42,040
Don't let me stop you.

256
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:44,539
The girl has made great progress.

257
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,544
- Rosarito, let's have a minuet.
- Yes, ma'am.

258
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:17,908
No, no.

259
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:21,796
Nothing.

260
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:24,232
Nothing.

261
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:28,217
This morning I thought I heard music.

262
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,549
I thought that perhaps...

263
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:32,607
But nothing.

264
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:35,791
I feel the vibrations...

265
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:39,690
but I can't distinguish the notes.

266
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:54,069
"The Life and Miracles
of the Glorious San Antonio of Padua...

267
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:57,512
Shining Sun of the Church"...

268
00:32:57,683 --> 00:33:00,652
- Go on.
- "The Illustrious One...

269
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,185
Glory of Portugal...

270
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:05,488
Honor of Spain,
Treasure of Italy...

271
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:07,489
Terror of Hell...

272
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,820
Perpetual Crusher of Heresy...

273
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:12,726
amongst the Saints par excellence...

274
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,430
the Miracle Worker."

275
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:17,426
A little excessive,
don't you think?

276
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,364
It was the usual rhetoric.

277
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,223
Goya.

278
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,070
- Goya.
- Yes.

279
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:27,269
We'd like you to reenact
the life of the Saint...

280
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,845
and especially the miracle that...

281
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,101
Well...

282
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:35,845
Let's see...

283
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,119
Here it is.

284
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:43,561
"San Antonio finds himself in Padua...

285
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:45,557
and moves...

286
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,230
miraculously to Lisbon...

287
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:52,637
where his father,
Martín de Bullones...

288
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,804
- has just been..."
- Father...

289
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,770
- Allow me to read.
- Of course.

290
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,780
"...finds himself in Padua...

291
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:07,548
moves miraculously to Lisbon...

292
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,983
where his father,
Martín de Bullones...

293
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,926
has just been unjustly
condemned to death...

294
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:17,485
for killing a man.

295
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:22,332
San Antonio convinces the court
to delay the execution...

296
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:26,164
and calls the murdered man
as witness...

297
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,966
to his father's innocence."

298
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,633
"The murdered man's grave
is opened.

299
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:34,109
The body has a slit throat...

300
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,645
and chest wounds.

301
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,249
San Antonio turns to the body
and asks:"

302
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,668
Tell me...

303
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:43,312
was it my father, here present...

304
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:46,620
Martín de Bullones,
who took your life?

305
00:34:58,037 --> 00:35:01,973
Is my father guilty of this crime?

306
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:05,803
Martín de Bullones is innocent...

307
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,440
of this crime.

308
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,147
The dead man speaks.

309
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,476
He must know who the killer is.

310
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:14,676
Who then, is the real assassin?

311
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:18,617
He is!
He is my assassin!

312
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,620
Forgive me, Lord! Forgive me!

313
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,834
I wanted to avoid the mythological...

314
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:37,365
to integrate the sacred theme
of the miracle with Madrid's people.

315
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,804
San Isidro was where
locals of all classes...

316
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,676
came to celebrate the Saint.

317
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,650
So I went there myself...

318
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:48,887
as I tried to decide
how to paint the dome.

319
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:05,394
Not that one.
Give me the other one.

320
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:07,088
Under that one.

321
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,998
Do you like this one?

322
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,510
Water, fresh water!

323
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,263
Nobody move. Let's see.

324
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:54,404
Point over there,
towards the eyes of the dead body.

325
00:38:55,174 --> 00:38:57,165
Patience. We're almost finished.

326
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:49,558
You have to go to bed.
Mom will be angry.

327
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:51,756
What do you think?

328
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:56,256
After the bulls, I'll do
a new series of"Caprichos."

329
00:39:57,102 --> 00:40:00,902
Do you think I could sell
my "Disasters of War?"

330
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,007
I'd like to go back to my etchings...

331
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,806
but my wrists and my sight are...

332
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:08,507
Sit down.

333
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:14,150
Stop complaining.
You complain all the time...

334
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,087
you old devil.

335
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:20,375
Let's see.

336
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:26,428
What do you think of this?

337
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,434
Very good.

338
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,361
You're coming along very well.

339
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:35,699
Someday you'll be better
than your father.

340
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,008
Copying is good.

341
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,777
You learn from the old masters.
I did it too.

342
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:44,438
- It loosens your hand.
- But...

343
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:47,709
You're still very young.

344
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,448
It doesn't matter.

345
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:53,386
Little by little you have to find
your own path.

346
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,153
The path...

347
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,693
which only you can follow.

348
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:00,832
Accept influence from other people.

349
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,728
It's necessary.

350
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:05,226
But to each his own.

351
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:08,730
For better or for worse,
do it your way.

352
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,237
I fought bulls when I was young.

353
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:15,038
I could have been great.
I had the abilities.

354
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:17,372
I paid my dues, you know.

355
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:21,508
Until one day a bull got too close
and half-crippled me.

356
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,820
- Nobody knows that.
- Secret, secret.

357
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,261
I fear nobody, child,
with a sword in my hand.

358
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:35,224
I've never been much
for fighting with weapons...

359
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:38,928
and now, at my age...

360
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,867
Well, I can fight with my brushes,
can't I?

361
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,041
Do you know how old I am?

362
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,104
Eighty.

363
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,338
Older.

364
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,544
Since the age of 45
my life has been a miracle.

365
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:56,111
- Have I told you the story?
- No, never.

366
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:59,348
Well, another time.

367
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,585
I'm going to tell you a...

368
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:04,084
A secret, secret.

369
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:06,729
I'm know I'm deaf...

370
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,300
but now I hear things
I'd never heard before.

371
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:11,933
And you know why?

372
00:42:12,538 --> 00:42:15,405
Because now I hear
with my internal ears.

373
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,706
You can do it, too.

374
00:42:18,944 --> 00:42:19,994
Do you want to?

375
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:23,972
Close your eyes and concentrate.

376
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,447
Close your eyes.

377
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:30,380
Listen.

378
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:32,874
Listen.

379
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:37,792
What do you hear?

380
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,086
Don't you hear something?

381
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:44,118
Yes.

382
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,003
But nothing special.

383
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,602
Distant voices...

384
00:42:49,274 --> 00:42:51,606
cavalry bells...

385
00:42:52,277 --> 00:42:53,801
the sound of a cart...

386
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:58,238
- a baby crying.
- No! That's not it!

387
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:02,751
Can't you hear
a terrible muffled sound...

388
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,984
like hundreds of bulls
trampling the ground?

389
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:10,352
Can't you hear the shriek
of a woman who cries...

390
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:12,653
because they've killed her son?

391
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:15,798
Can't you hear her cries of pain?

392
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,492
Can't you hear the boom of a cannon...

393
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,331
and rifles being fired...

394
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,967
and the howl of a wild beast?

395
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:25,302
Listen!

396
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:27,361
Listen!

397
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:40,018
You have to put more into it,
Rosarito.

398
00:43:40,392 --> 00:43:42,360
You have to make an effort.

399
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:46,991
Without imagination,
we're nothing more than animals.

400
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,024
Are you with me?

401
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,200
With your imagination
you can commit the worst crime...

402
00:43:54,706 --> 00:43:56,731
and nobody will punish you.

403
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:00,540
You can rise to the heavens,
or fall down into hell...

404
00:44:00,746 --> 00:44:04,011
be enormous, or infinitely small...

405
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,584
be an artistic genius,
or the best strategist...

406
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:11,719
or the most powerful politician.

407
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:15,924
There's only one danger, child.

408
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,323
You have to know when to stop...

409
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:22,493
or you could be devoured
by darkness...

410
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:24,696
and insanity.

411
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:26,887
Yes.

412
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:29,434
Now concentrate.

413
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:31,906
Close your eyes.

414
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:37,212
Let the images and thoughts
enter your mind.

415
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:44,015
Can you see how lightning
tears the sky apart...

416
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:47,124
and warns us
of the powerful thunder to come?

417
00:44:50,629 --> 00:44:51,926
I hear it, Father.

418
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,097
Can you see your father
in another time?

419
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:56,795
In another place?

420
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,100
Concentrate!

421
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,445
Why aren't you in bed?

422
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:51,516
- I'm afraid.
- Of what? The storm?

423
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:54,852
It's over now.

424
00:45:55,661 --> 00:45:57,526
Did you have a bad dream?

425
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,034
What did you dream about this time?

426
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,102
Don't you trust me?

427
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:11,674
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

428
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:13,094
Secret...

429
00:46:13,211 --> 00:46:14,261
secret.

430
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,510
A mad dog was chasing me.

431
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:20,277
I was running
and he was behind me.

432
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:21,851
He had huge teeth.

433
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:23,453
Slower, child.

434
00:46:23,855 --> 00:46:25,823
Suddenly the mad dog...

435
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,118
stuck his head round the mountain.

436
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:31,826
He had white teeth,
sharp like knives...

437
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:33,224
and he wanted to eat me.

438
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,216
Well.

439
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:37,558
That was a bad dream.

440
00:46:38,503 --> 00:46:39,663
Luckily there's...

441
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:41,665
no mad dog here.

442
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,539
Him? Poor thing.

443
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:49,678
He's not mad.

444
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:52,714
He just doesn't know where he is.

445
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:54,368
Look at him.

446
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,979
He's lost, you see?

447
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:01,753
That's why he's looking
around like that.

448
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:03,356
He's sinking.

449
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:05,613
Maybe.

450
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:07,481
What's that?

451
00:47:10,168 --> 00:47:11,430
People flying.

452
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:17,667
- Wouldn't you like to fly?
- Yes, but I don't have wings.

453
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,001
There are no limits...

454
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,579
to fancy and invention, my child.

455
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,844
Come on, let's go to sleep.

456
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:33,521
Do you know what the biggest monster
in the universe is?

457
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:35,242
No?

458
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:40,696
Man. Only man's cruelty surpasses
that of the animal kingdom.

459
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,297
Animals are innocent
of the cruelties they commit.

460
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:47,971
They only follow their instincts.

461
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,575
But man, on the other hand...

462
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:54,040
knows when he does harm.

463
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:56,163
What do you think?

464
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,273
That's the difference.

465
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:01,245
Now go to sleep.

466
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,949
Sweet dreams, my child.

467
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:11,627
Leave the nightmares to old men.

468
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,967
The storm woke her up.

469
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:18,282
Are you all right, my child?

470
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,796
Good night.

471
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:22,637
Good night, Mummy.

472
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:05,375
Why must you paint the whole house
with your strange things?

473
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:11,077
These paintings are dark and sad.

474
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,188
Can't you paint something happy?

475
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:16,443
Like what?

476
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:19,386
Spring landscapes?

477
00:49:20,398 --> 00:49:22,127
Bowls with flowers?

478
00:49:22,968 --> 00:49:25,528
Happy people smiling?

479
00:49:26,404 --> 00:49:28,531
Children and lovers?

480
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:32,902
These are not happy times.

481
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:36,975
These paintings
could bring us problems.

482
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:40,709
I'll paint what I like
on the walls of my own house.

483
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,212
I don't understand.

484
00:49:44,256 --> 00:49:48,283
What is this interest
in monsters and nightmares?

485
00:49:49,728 --> 00:49:52,424
It's hard for me to see things
the way you do.

486
00:49:58,003 --> 00:49:59,630
Destroy them...

487
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:02,406
if you must.

488
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:05,833
You and the child come first.

489
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:13,917
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

490
00:50:14,252 --> 00:50:15,685
Are you coming?

491
00:50:15,854 --> 00:50:18,687
I can't. The paint's drying.

492
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:22,589
The night is made for sleep.

493
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:24,254
And for painting.

494
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:50,458
Dear friends...

495
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:55,190
from the exile imposed upon us
by circumstance...

496
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:59,598
Well, anyway.
This verse is for all of you.

497
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,701
"Spaniard,
if you go to France...

498
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,105
And you are thirsty,
by any chance...

499
00:55:07,111 --> 00:55:10,672
Water alone you mustn't drink,
or Barabbas your ship will sink.

500
00:55:12,116 --> 00:55:13,708
Mix it with a little zest...

501
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,188
Or just don't go,
drinking wine of old Bordeaux...

502
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:22,185
And leave the chocolate
to the rest."

503
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:25,846
Gentlemen...

504
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:28,325
To liberty!

505
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,466
To liberty!

506
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,695
To a Spain free from tyranny.

507
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:37,164
To an illustrious Spain...

508
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,237
without war and cruelty.

509
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,721
Long live the liberals

510
00:55:56,527 --> 00:55:59,690
Let Ferdinand VII die

511
00:56:01,165 --> 00:56:04,328
Long live the liberals

512
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,894
Let Goya, Moratín and Salcedo

513
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:10,401
Stay with us

514
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,043
In Bordeaux

515
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:16,905
Stay with us in Bordeaux

516
00:56:17,515 --> 00:56:20,780
Long live the liberals

517
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,880
Let's have a dance!

518
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,390
Bravo! Wonderful!

519
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:18,902
Thank you very much.

520
00:59:12,223 --> 00:59:13,383
Duchess, please.

521
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:16,588
Would you mind turning a bit
to the left?

522
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:21,465
That's it.

523
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:22,516
Right there.

524
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,953
Maestro, must I...

525
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,596
- stand the whole time?
- Remember, Duchess.

526
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:56,494
I'm deaf. If you speak slowly,
I'll understand.

527
00:59:59,737 --> 01:00:03,173
Must I stand the whole time?

528
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:04,973
Only today, Duchess.

529
01:00:07,445 --> 01:00:09,504
Later I'll work from the sketches.

530
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:16,943
- Would you like to rest?
- No, that's all right.

531
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:19,180
One must pay a price for art...

532
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:22,621
and this will be a masterpiece.

533
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:24,527
Right, maestro?

534
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,669
What is it, Josefina?

535
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:36,502
Excuse me, Duchess. No...

536
01:00:36,874 --> 01:00:38,603
If you need me, call me.

537
01:00:38,876 --> 01:00:40,173
I'll be downstairs.

538
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:44,110
Good night, Duchess.

539
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,643
Good night.

540
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,992
I hope to someday say this painting...

541
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,390
was my best ever.

542
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:00,013
Goya.

543
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,290
Let's drop the protocol.

544
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,661
Call me Cayetana.

545
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:10,167
They say you always work at night.

546
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:13,069
Is there a reason?

547
01:01:13,644 --> 01:01:15,703
The colors, Duchess. Cayetana.

548
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,649
The colors are different
by candlelight.

549
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:21,148
Warmer and more beautiful.

550
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:25,415
So we should always view
the paintings at night?

551
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,350
Perhaps.

552
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,151
Perhaps.

553
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:32,057
- The night is made for love.
- Excuse me?

554
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:35,659
The night is made for sleep.

555
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,701
Or so they say.

556
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:40,663
And for painting...

557
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,068
and love.

558
01:01:47,878 --> 01:01:50,005
I've heard of your "love" affairs.

559
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,572
And I of yours...

560
01:01:53,351 --> 01:01:54,409
Cayetana.

561
01:02:12,737 --> 01:02:14,227
All right, that's it.

562
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,000
The moment of truth.

563
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:55,844
An end to our suffering.

564
01:02:57,748 --> 01:02:58,798
Let's do it.

565
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,290
It's coming out!

566
01:03:10,428 --> 01:03:11,918
It's beautiful, Father.

567
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:22,767
It's beautiful.

568
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,531
It's your best lithograph ever, Father.

569
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:31,205
You've done an excellent job,
Mr. Goya.

570
01:03:31,382 --> 01:03:32,781
What do you think?

571
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,213
Not bad, not bad.

572
01:03:35,886 --> 01:03:36,944
Thank you.

573
01:03:57,641 --> 01:03:59,302
Why paint me naked?

574
01:04:00,678 --> 01:04:04,011
Because that's how God brought you
into this world. Naked.

575
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,941
Naked we are all the same
in the eyes of the Lord.

576
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,778
Not me.

577
01:04:11,288 --> 01:04:13,017
I'm not like all people.

578
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:14,821
I'm me.

579
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,853
You're right. You're Cayetana...

580
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,628
Duchess of Alba.

581
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:22,993
What's that? I can't hear you.

582
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,532
I'm a little deaf.

583
01:04:25,836 --> 01:04:29,294
Let's see if you understand this.

584
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:32,175
You're a shameless barbarian,
incapable of self-control...

585
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:35,873
you're a basic lover,
though particularly sensitive...

586
01:04:35,874 --> 01:04:38,047
and you're arrogant
and obstinate as well.

587
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:40,414
If you can guess what I said...

588
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,815
you'll receive a reward.

589
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:45,849
"Barbarian" isn't fair...

590
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:47,824
but I like the word.

591
01:04:48,692 --> 01:04:52,685
"Obstinate," I concede.
"Arrogant," well, I am from Aragon.

592
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,361
Now it's my turn.

593
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,394
You're beautiful...

594
01:04:59,703 --> 01:05:01,068
intelligent...

595
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:02,889
and sensitive...

596
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:06,400
which makes you just like
most women I've met.

597
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:09,904
You're also whimsical,
spoiled, and violent.

598
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:12,079
Which is why I'm crazy about you.

599
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,614
Now for my reward.

600
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,862
You're an animal!
You're hurting me!

601
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:41,571
I love how you sharpen your claws...

602
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:46,910
before you pounce upon your victim.

603
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:51,979
Now you're being yourself.

604
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:53,788
Naked, in the flesh.

605
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:55,124
I know you...

606
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,286
- Cayetana.
- No, you don't.

607
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:59,395
Nobody really knows me!

608
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:01,292
I know you better than myself.

609
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:03,599
I could draw your body by memory.

610
01:06:07,938 --> 01:06:09,166
Because I love you.

611
01:06:14,745 --> 01:06:16,610
You like fat women.

612
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,838
What?

613
01:06:18,148 --> 01:06:20,582
You like fat women...

614
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:24,182
with round faces
and large breasts.

615
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,418
I like you.

616
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,960
Your sharp face...

617
01:06:31,662 --> 01:06:33,186
your slender neck...

618
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:36,359
your round shoulders...

619
01:06:38,135 --> 01:06:40,831
your ass...
the ass of an aristocrat.

620
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:45,502
Your beautiful breasts...

621
01:06:48,178 --> 01:06:50,112
made for my hands.

622
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:52,875
You're mine...

623
01:06:53,684 --> 01:06:54,946
and I'm yours.

624
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:02,720
Only Goya's.

625
01:07:04,728 --> 01:07:07,162
Only Goya's.
Only Goya's.

626
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,525
How possessive!

627
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:28,211
Cayetana...

628
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:30,653
my true love.

629
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:33,581
So full of life.

630
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:36,750
Your soft skin...

631
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,995
your lips...

632
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:42,692
temptingly moist.

633
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:45,718
Your mouth...

634
01:07:46,704 --> 01:07:47,754
Love...

635
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,288
life...

636
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:50,957
death.

637
01:07:52,776 --> 01:07:55,006
Time erases everything.

638
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:56,996
No...

639
01:07:57,214 --> 01:07:58,264
not everything...

640
01:07:58,749 --> 01:08:00,011
What do you want?

641
01:08:01,752 --> 01:08:03,617
Don't be so curious.

642
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,237
Was she as beautiful as they say?

643
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:33,044
You wouldn't understand.

644
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:35,579
You're still a child.

645
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:37,980
- I'm a woman.
- Of course.

646
01:08:38,555 --> 01:08:41,786
I've been a woman
for some time, Father.

647
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:45,450
You can't keep treating me
like a little girl.

648
01:08:46,397 --> 01:08:49,093
I know much more about life
than you two think.

649
01:08:57,808 --> 01:08:58,858
Father.

650
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,404
It's true.

651
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:05,846
You're a woman.

652
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:10,579
Time passes so quickly.

653
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:12,505
All right.

654
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:16,789
I'll talk to you the way
a man would to a close friend.

655
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,829
But what I tell you...

656
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,265
must be kept a secret.

657
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,862
It's very private...

658
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:28,769
and must stay between us.

659
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,766
Secret, secret.

660
01:09:32,643 --> 01:09:33,701
You understand?

661
01:09:35,612 --> 01:09:37,546
Come on.
Help me.

662
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:40,378
I have no strength.

663
01:09:40,951 --> 01:09:42,009
Help me.

664
01:09:58,168 --> 01:09:59,726
Day and night...

665
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:02,305
I thought only of her.

666
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,905
I couldn't do anything else.

667
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:11,209
Day and night I wanted
to caress her...

668
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,241
to kiss her lips, her breasts...

669
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,710
to feel her body.

670
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,351
I was jealous of her lovers...

671
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,927
of anyone who even looked at her.

672
01:10:28,031 --> 01:10:29,081
Look.

673
01:10:32,236 --> 01:10:33,567
Only Goya's.

674
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,735
She was whimsical...

675
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,267
vehement, passionate.

676
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,942
At times melancholic and sad.

677
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:47,410
What is it?

678
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:48,943
What's wrong?

679
01:10:49,953 --> 01:10:52,012
- Are you ill?
- No.

680
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:55,123
She said they were setting
a trap for her...

681
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:57,017
and that she was in danger.

682
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:00,790
Why? Who from?

683
01:11:01,765 --> 01:11:03,926
Cayetana just laughed...

684
01:11:04,401 --> 01:11:07,131
and went back
to being frivolous again.

685
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:09,902
She liked risk.

686
01:11:10,774 --> 01:11:11,900
She played games...

687
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:15,443
both with love and politics.

688
01:11:15,913 --> 01:11:17,278
A double game.

689
01:11:18,415 --> 01:11:22,408
These are dangerous games
for the times we live in.

690
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:40,161
They poisoned her!
Who poisoned her?

691
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:45,403
They said she preferred
to die than to face...

692
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:46,803
old age.

693
01:11:47,411 --> 01:11:48,844
They said she was ill.

694
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:52,411
All lies.

695
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:55,976
Cayetana was part...

696
01:11:56,753 --> 01:11:59,187
of a dark political plot...

697
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,491
to overthrow the Queen.

698
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,683
She hated the Queen.

699
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:06,759
And the Queen had her killed.

700
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,122
The Queen?

701
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:10,164
The Queen poisoned her?

702
01:12:11,134 --> 01:12:12,294
How?

703
01:12:13,303 --> 01:12:14,463
That witch...

704
01:12:15,005 --> 01:12:16,097
hated her.

705
01:12:17,841 --> 01:12:20,605
I had to paint the Queen many times...

706
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:24,104
and she always seemed
so unlikable to me.

707
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:28,707
Her mouth had a certain
mean-spirited expression.

708
01:12:31,154 --> 01:12:32,451
She hated Cayetana.

709
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:34,680
She hated her beauty...

710
01:12:35,025 --> 01:12:37,357
her ease of manner,
her vitality...

711
01:12:37,794 --> 01:12:39,989
and she wanted her wealth.

712
01:12:41,031 --> 01:12:43,226
It was also known...

713
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:46,001
that Godoy, the Queen's lover...

714
01:12:46,703 --> 01:12:49,570
had also been with the Duchess.

715
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,472
Queen María Luisa...

716
01:12:55,212 --> 01:12:56,509
poisoned her...

717
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,307
with Godoy's help.

718
01:13:00,317 --> 01:13:02,342
Isn't Godoy your friend?

719
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,344
So much for friends.

720
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:08,056
But he was good to me.

721
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,655
He went from being a soldier...

722
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:16,896
to ruler of Spain...

723
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:22,203
thanks entirely to his conquest
of the royal bed.

724
01:13:24,374 --> 01:13:26,706
But besides being a good lover...

725
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,377
he was intelligent...

726
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:29,738
and crafty...

727
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,679
like a chameleon.

728
01:13:32,182 --> 01:13:35,276
He had a limitless ambition
for power...

729
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:39,052
and a special talent for scheming.

730
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,556
His influence over the Queen
was notorious...

731
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:46,787
and nothing happened in the palace...

732
01:13:47,197 --> 01:13:48,425
without his consent.

733
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:51,290
It's all so dirty.

734
01:13:54,037 --> 01:13:55,197
Poor soul.

735
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:59,704
To die poisoned, like an animal.

736
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,637
The Queen and Godoy...

737
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:08,709
divided her jewels and paintings
between them.

738
01:14:09,453 --> 01:14:11,444
Godoy kept Velázquez's...

739
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:13,980
"Venus in the Mirror."

740
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:15,816
And now...

741
01:14:16,226 --> 01:14:19,627
I'm going to show you
my most guarded secret.

742
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:30,565
Godoy, didn't that painting belong
to the Duchess?

743
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:33,504
It did, but not anymore.

744
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:39,179
- What do you think, Goya?
- Pardon?

745
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:41,316
What do you think?

746
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:43,649
It's a masterpiece.

747
01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:48,649
Quite a compliment,
from one artist to another.

748
01:14:49,593 --> 01:14:51,117
A gracious comparison.

749
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:54,320
I've always thought highly
of Velázquez.

750
01:14:55,966 --> 01:14:59,333
And now, if you please.
This way. Over here.

751
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:10,139
This is Jordaens' "Venus."

752
01:15:12,783 --> 01:15:16,879
And now, gentlemen,
for my favorite painting.

753
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,182
Come closer.

754
01:15:20,357 --> 01:15:21,407
Closer.

755
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:23,685
Here it is.

756
01:15:25,495 --> 01:15:28,487
It's beautiful.
Isn't it one of Goya's?

757
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:30,860
The others are better...

758
01:15:31,034 --> 01:15:33,366
Patience, my friends.

759
01:15:33,537 --> 01:15:36,131
This painting has a secret.

760
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:37,801
Who's the model?

761
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:41,336
- You'll never guess.
- Is it Pepita Tudó?

762
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:44,306
That's of little importance.

763
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:47,674
Now, gentlemen...

764
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,913
Your attention, please.

765
01:15:57,394 --> 01:15:58,861
Very ingenious!

766
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:00,690
This is something else!

767
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:02,524
Who is she?

768
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,232
Nobody knows?

769
01:16:06,536 --> 01:16:08,026
It's an imaginary portrait.

770
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:12,064
You must be careful
with the Inquisition.

771
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,866
They're out looking
for sinners again.

772
01:16:15,045 --> 01:16:17,707
Gentlemen, I advise discretion.

773
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:21,011
There's a dark room
at the San Fernando Academy...

774
01:16:21,184 --> 01:16:23,778
where certain paintings are kept.

775
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:26,756
We don't want these to end up there.

776
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:28,720
I was a coward at times.

777
01:16:29,526 --> 01:16:33,519
I was weak,
and I'm not proud of it.

778
01:16:34,598 --> 01:16:36,463
At times I have lied...

779
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:40,596
or said yes
when I should have said no.

780
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:44,863
I've painted stupid people
unworthy of my brush.

781
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:47,032
But I had no choice.

782
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:50,577
I did paint people I admired.

783
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:52,738
In my defense, I must say...

784
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:55,612
that I have worked a great deal.

785
01:16:56,086 --> 01:16:58,646
I have sacrificed and persevered...

786
01:16:58,955 --> 01:17:02,447
to overcome the hostility and envy
of my colleagues...

787
01:17:02,626 --> 01:17:04,457
the criticisms of some...

788
01:17:05,095 --> 01:17:07,757
and the dangers of the Inquisition.

789
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:10,458
It wasn't easy to become...

790
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:13,964
Court Painter
and Director of the Academy.

791
01:17:14,137 --> 01:17:16,264
But if there's one consolation...

792
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,903
it's that I never made concessions.

793
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:22,506
Well, a few concessions.
Human weaknesses.

794
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:27,773
It wasn't easy to survive
in that court full of puppets.

795
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:34,153
To think, I was once
even proud to be there.

796
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,856
What Spain really needed...

797
01:17:37,294 --> 01:17:40,286
was for everyone
to learn to read and write.

798
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:44,095
To follow the example of France
and the Enlightenment.

799
01:17:44,434 --> 01:17:45,484
Here...

800
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:49,461
the only deciding factors
were ignorance...

801
01:17:49,773 --> 01:17:52,674
corruption, and calumny.

802
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:37,554
What's wrong?

803
01:22:39,395 --> 01:22:40,589
I'm cold.

804
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:57,408
You have a fever again.

805
01:22:57,981 --> 01:22:59,346
I'm just...

806
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,282
a useless old man.

807
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:04,118
Don't say that.

808
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:07,512
You're just ill, that's all.

809
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,819
You'll be all right.

810
01:23:12,295 --> 01:23:13,345
You'll see.

811
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:20,131
You've always been strong, Francisco.

812
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:21,868
I'm cold.

813
01:23:22,472 --> 01:23:23,700
Hold me.

814
01:23:26,142 --> 01:23:27,336
I had a dream.

815
01:23:31,347 --> 01:23:32,814
About what?

816
01:23:35,652 --> 01:23:36,702
I don't know.

817
01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:39,404
I don't know.

818
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:43,890
What was it?

819
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:46,945
Come on.

820
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:48,792
Get some rest.

821
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:51,963
Rest and sleep.

822
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,665
Sleep.

823
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,500
Sleep.

824
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:01,233
What would I do without you...

825
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:03,473
Leocadia?

826
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:08,073
Sleep, Francisco.

827
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:36,137
There it is.
"The Family," by Diego Velázquez.

828
01:24:37,747 --> 01:24:39,408
It's a very good painting.

829
01:24:40,249 --> 01:24:42,376
The composition, the colors...

830
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:45,185
A bit rough in the execution.

831
01:24:48,057 --> 01:24:50,651
How does he raise it like that?

832
01:24:52,061 --> 01:24:53,111
It looks alive.

833
01:24:54,998 --> 01:24:57,159
As if it took no effort to paint.

834
01:24:57,333 --> 01:25:01,429
That roughness is deliberate.
It adds a certain spontaneity.

835
01:25:01,604 --> 01:25:04,038
It saves him from having
to paint the details.

836
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,035
In my opinion...

837
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:09,872
the upper part
of the painting is useless.

838
01:25:10,446 --> 01:25:13,074
This format has never been
my favorite.

839
01:25:21,891 --> 01:25:22,941
Is it him?

840
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:36,602
He's looking in the mirror.

841
01:25:38,775 --> 01:25:41,744
Or is the whole image
reflected in the mirror?

842
01:25:41,978 --> 01:25:43,275
Or both.

843
01:25:44,113 --> 01:25:45,580
I have things to do.

844
01:25:45,982 --> 01:25:49,611
Stay as long as you like.
I'll be upstairs.

845
01:25:52,889 --> 01:25:54,083
I almost forgot.

846
01:25:54,457 --> 01:25:58,393
Tell Josefa
we'll be expecting her tomorrow.

847
01:25:58,628 --> 01:25:59,959
Yes, yes. Don't worry.

848
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:21,449
For years I'd been searching...

849
01:26:21,684 --> 01:26:23,015
but I didn't know why.

850
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,185
There it was!

851
01:26:25,755 --> 01:26:28,918
Everything explained.
Clear. Obvious.

852
01:26:29,192 --> 01:26:30,659
A revelation.

853
01:26:31,427 --> 01:26:33,622
That was how I wanted to paint.

854
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:35,661
It looked unfinished...

855
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:38,483
slight...

856
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:42,168
apparently effortless...

857
01:26:43,372 --> 01:26:45,499
outside time, space and place.

858
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:49,107
And such delicacy and wisdom.

859
01:26:56,853 --> 01:26:59,788
Beyond all physical
and palpable reality...

860
01:27:03,526 --> 01:27:04,959
another dimension.

861
01:27:07,063 --> 01:27:08,724
Defined only in painting...

862
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:11,490
a mirror which deforms life...

863
01:27:12,335 --> 01:27:13,859
an instant reflected...

864
01:27:15,138 --> 01:27:17,629
a magical reality
where all is possible.

865
01:27:19,642 --> 01:27:21,872
I'll never have
Velázquez's serenity...

866
01:27:22,512 --> 01:27:25,208
because I am more passionate.

867
01:27:25,681 --> 01:27:28,081
I have had three masters:

868
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:30,977
Velázquez, Rembrandt...

869
01:27:31,654 --> 01:27:33,019
and Nature.

870
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:53,505
Rembrandt...

871
01:27:55,077 --> 01:27:56,271
Velázquez...

872
01:27:58,915 --> 01:28:00,280
and imagination...

873
01:28:03,886 --> 01:28:05,376
Imagination?

874
01:28:08,624 --> 01:28:11,957
What a sinister period
of history I've seen.

875
01:28:13,129 --> 01:28:14,357
I'd have chosen...

876
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:16,464
other things for my country.

877
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,861
But ignorance...

878
01:28:19,702 --> 01:28:22,398
plots and corruption...

879
01:28:22,605 --> 01:28:24,937
have prevailed over everything.

880
01:28:25,408 --> 01:28:29,105
We Liberals believed
that France, our model...

881
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:32,440
would help us to enlighten
an illiterate people...

882
01:28:32,782 --> 01:28:35,546
abandoned by God
and their monarchs.

883
01:28:35,885 --> 01:28:37,978
But France sought only
its own profit.

884
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:41,123
The invasion of Spain
by the French army...

885
01:28:41,557 --> 01:28:43,923
the imposition of a new monarch...

886
01:28:44,794 --> 01:28:47,058
and later the sheer impudence...

887
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,563
of Napoleon's own brother...

888
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,068
deciding our fate...

889
01:28:53,803 --> 01:28:55,771
wore out our patience.

890
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:32,766
Mother!

891
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,898
Mother!

892
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,770
My dear children.
Walk.

893
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:50,168
Mother!

894
01:31:30,426 --> 01:31:31,984
Mother!

895
01:32:16,038 --> 01:32:17,164
Father!

896
01:32:18,974 --> 01:32:21,602
Aim...  Fire!

897
01:32:27,049 --> 01:32:28,099
Halt!

898
01:32:31,153 --> 01:32:32,552
Aim...  Fire!

899
01:32:38,127 --> 01:32:40,220
Murderers!

900
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:41,888
Halt!

901
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,630
Aim...
Fire!

902
01:32:51,574 --> 01:32:52,700
Halt!

903
01:32:55,311 --> 01:32:57,176
Aim...  Fire!

904
01:33:03,252 --> 01:33:04,344
Halt!

905
01:33:05,855 --> 01:33:08,153
Aim...  Fire!

906
01:33:16,665 --> 01:33:18,257
Hit him again!

907
01:33:18,434 --> 01:33:21,062
Harder! Hit him again!

908
01:36:41,603 --> 01:36:42,797
My life...

909
01:36:43,572 --> 01:36:46,439
has gone by like a gust of wind.

910
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,270
I've forgotten...

911
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:56,441
how I was as a child.

912
01:37:00,289 --> 01:37:01,586
I forget...

913
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:04,922
my youth...

914
01:37:07,262 --> 01:37:08,593
and now...

915
01:37:12,801 --> 01:37:14,735
Who am I now?

916
01:38:41,356 --> 01:38:43,017
Rosarito...

917
01:38:52,401 --> 01:38:54,062
Rosarito...

918
01:38:58,907 --> 01:39:00,340
My child...

919
01:39:21,597 --> 01:39:22,647
Father...

920
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:25,894
Where are you?

921
01:39:26,368 --> 01:39:27,926
I'm here, Father.

922
01:39:30,472 --> 01:39:32,235
Cayetana...

923
01:39:36,311 --> 01:39:37,938
Cayetana...

924
01:41:19,114 --> 01:41:25,144
"After Goya, modern painting begins."
André Malraux
