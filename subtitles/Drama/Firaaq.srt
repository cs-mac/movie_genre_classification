1
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,288
Give these corpses a
little respect, Uncle.

2
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,382
Oh, God.

3
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:05,354
Oh, God.

4
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,322
Go.
- Oh, God.

5
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,307
Oh, God! Oh, God!

6
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,408
Oh, God.

7
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:07,317
By the Grace of God. God..

8
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,322
Sakina.

9
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,331
No, it's someone else.

10
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,367
Uncle.

11
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,270
Uncle, come here.

12
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,193
What do we do about her?

13
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,286
We can't bury a Hindu corpse.

14
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,265
Uncle. Hey, Uncle. What
are you doing, Uncle?

15
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,208
Have you gone mad? Leave it. Leave it.
- Let me.

16
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,269
Leave it.
- Let this snake die.

17
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,183
Finished everything.

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,252
Uncle. She has died.
- Don't stop me. Let me go.

19
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,277
How will you kill the dead?

20
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,356
I've gone mad.

21
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,394
It would be better if
they don't leave tomorrow.

22
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,438
How long would we have
stayed hidden in their hovel?

23
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,399
Sameer sir sheltered you for
the entire month in such times.

24
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,409
If you could, you would
have left for Delhi with him.

25
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,377
Yes, I would have. You too.

26
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,346
He has kept with so much difficulty.

27
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,359
He stays in such a big house. Pool park.

28
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,427
What danger does he face?

29
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,430
Don't forget that he had given
you money to buy the rickshaw.

30
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,391
Yes, but I had paid him back the money.

31
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,380
What have they done? Oh, God.

32
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,405
Everything is lost.

33
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,411
I had told you to fix
another lock in the house.

34
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,537
So, it's my fault.

35
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,444
Idiot.
- Oh, God.

36
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:07,550
You filthy idiots. I'll deal with you.

37
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,434
What will we do now?

38
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,572
They had burnt everything.

39
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,898
Where did this come from?

40
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,481
Henna.

41
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,745
What? - Of my
henna. - Don't lie.

42
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,078
Since Nazo has been born, you
haven't gone to apply henna.

43
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,518
I didn't give Sameer sir his money.

44
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:20,632
What? Why did you do that?

45
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,605
You think you are very clever.

46
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,647
You're not worried about the house.

47
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,582
Were you going to mend the broken sofa?

48
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,618
You wanted to sit on the sofa. Sit now.

49
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,610
Sit, you idiot.

50
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,592
I told you so many times.

51
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,528
I told you so many
times that we will go..

52
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,517
..and see the house once. But no.

53
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,530
What if they had killed you?
- That was better than this.

54
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,613
She forgot to add salt again.

55
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,570
Get the salt.

56
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,619
Once the riots stop, the
vegetable vendor will come.

57
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,955
Otherwise, we would have to
make do with onions and potatoes.

58
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,727
What are you thinking
about these days? Give me.

59
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,129
No one was knocking.

60
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,573
I think she has gone crazy.

61
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,711
'But anyone can actually..'

62
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,008
I'm going to Ritesh's house.

63
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,103
Dear, learn a little, though
you are not going to school.

64
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,306
Am I taking this bag for nothing then?

65
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,209
This is an astounding statement
on the security situation..

66
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,255
..in Gujarat, especially
the remote areas..

67
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,380
..which are away from the media gaze.

68
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,325
These English newsreaders. Filthy liars.

69
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,453
'The police officers we met at the..'

70
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,430
These rogues were silent
when Hindus were killed.

71
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,397
Keep watching. The entire world will hit them.
- Yes.

72
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,072
Brother Sanjeev, what will happen now?

73
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,144
I had told you to give one
Black Label (brand of liquor)..

74
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,154
..bottle to that officer.
You didn't listen to me.

75
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,091
And now, you say, ''Brother
Sanjeev, what will happen now?''

76
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,058
''What will happen now?''

77
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,095
If they come here with the warrant..

78
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,087
There is no F.I.R. How
will they get a warrant?

79
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,136
If you waste time in eating,
that fellow will go away. Get up.

80
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,042
It's 8 o'clock. Make something good.

81
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,176
Are you going out?
- No.

82
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,189
I have a habit of standing
in the middle of the door..

83
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,020
..and twirling the scooter keys.

84
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,083
Come on now.

85
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,196
Today, a truck with vegetables
is standing at the square.

86
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,096
Buy some good vegetables.

87
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,169
What happened? Again
you are lost somewhere?

88
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:41,223
Sister. Sister. Door. They
will kill me. Open. Open.

89
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,069
Open the door. Open the
door. Open. They will kill me.

90
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,096
They will kill me. They will cut me.

91
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,156
He will keep repairing the
entire world's instruments.

92
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,134
But this dead TV won't
be repaired till I die.

93
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,137
Everything can be heard.

94
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,243
The TV is meant for watching.

95
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,249
You will know more about the world..

96
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,208
..if you develop the habit of listening.

97
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,214
I keep listening to the hazy
sound of the TV and your snores.

98
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,284
If you listen carefully, then
you would find rhythm there too.

99
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,256
But you don't have such intellect.

100
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,256
Yes, you are right.

101
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,327
I'm serving you since 40
years for my little brains.

102
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:58,333
Stop meddling with this
box. Prepare for the morning.

103
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,206
Where is sugar candy for tomorrow?
- It is full.

104
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,217
This is full?

105
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,211
It is full according to
the people who will come.

106
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,250
You'll see that more
people will come tomorrow.

107
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,158
Every Thursday night, you
never stop from ordering..

108
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,324
..for worldly things, moving
furniture and spreading carpets.

109
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,198
And I too obey like a fool.

110
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,238
And who comes on
Saturday? Only your doctor.

111
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,365
Wake up, Mr. Khan. Open your eyes.

112
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,302
It's not enough to keep
listening in such times.

113
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,318
Now, why are you worried?

114
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,309
I will break the three into
six if more people come.

115
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,231
I don't know how I will
sing without Mr. Khan.

116
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,267
I'm really feeling very guilty.
- Forget it.

117
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,277
Now, we've decided, right?

118
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,319
I just wish we didn't had
to watch that CD today.

119
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:20,256
Really? I feel finally
there will be some closure.

120
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,394
We are leaving this city.
What more closure do you want?

121
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,300
What's the use of watching
the store getting robbed?

122
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,395
Listen, what time did
you call the movers?

123
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,364
They said they will
come at 8am tomorrow.

124
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,337
But while talking to
me, it finally hit me.

125
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,281
We are actually moving.

126
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,378
You always have a delayed
response to everything, right?

127
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,345
Watch out.

128
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,284
Are you blind? - Hey. - Get
out. - Hey. - Will you kill me?

129
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,366
I had just serviced and brought it.

130
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,300
Please. Please. Please.
If you come at such speed..

131
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,335
ls it okay, Sameer?

132
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,300
First, you hit and then you say 'okay'.

133
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,373
Brother Sameer, forget about our speed.

134
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,308
This is bound to happen
when ladies drive the car.

135
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,445
It happened for the first time.

136
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,413
First time or last, but I have
to bear the expenses. Oh, you..

137
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,407
Look here, everything is bashed up.
Just look at this.- Oh, God.

138
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,357
This will not solve my problem.
Go eat snacks at Mehta's with this.

139
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,426
Okay. Okay.

140
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,430
Come on, now, who is
going to argue with him?

141
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,404
It wasn't my fault. I swear.
It wasn't my fault. Just..

142
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,372
I know, darling. It's okay. Sit.

143
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,467
Did you see this? It was our
mistake, but he paid for it.

144
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,374
This is what I call smartness.

145
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,438
She was very beautiful.

146
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,184
Let's go.

147
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:58,223
Kavita, hurry up.
- Give the receiver to the inspector.

148
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,190
Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,317
Did you meet your aunt? Come on now.

150
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,252
Hi, Sameer. - Hi. -
The CD has not come yet.

151
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,322
Raman has been waiting
since the last two hours.

152
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,262
Typical.
- Sit, sit.

153
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,371
Who has my CD?
- No fun. Go back to your room.

154
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,305
Come on. Okay.
- Mummy.

155
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,242
I had talked about the
payment. What's new?

156
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,245
I too want to watch see.
- No, its not children. I'm sorry.

157
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,237
Please. - No. - I should remind you
that you are returning what's mine.

158
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,284
You can't imagine these children
recounting those horrors.

159
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,220
The activists here are saying that
the options may be just as bad.

160
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,278
What did you hear?

161
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,261
They beat everyone, unrobed
them, raped and killed them.

162
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,331
Burnt them. - Your daughter
was in it too. - Yes, she was.

163
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,300
ls Kesar going to come or not?

164
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,269
What was her name?
- Afsana.

165
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,337
I don't know.

166
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,237
My brother and I were sitting outside.

167
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,274
The poor man was lame in one leg..

168
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,401
..but when he broke the net
and went out, he was stabbed.

169
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,346
She was standing behind,
so, the girl was stabbed too.

170
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:59,249
Whether you kill or cut..
Kill or cut. Here and there..

171
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,287
Swords stabbing. Petrol fumes.

172
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,625
What are you doing?

173
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,559
Slowly.

174
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,731
'When they burnt our houses, they..'

175
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,734
Weapons. Even children
were carrying weapons.

176
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,725
The elders carried rifles.

177
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:23,640
We wear saris and speak
Gujarati, that's why we escaped.

178
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,701
Everywhere here..
- And turn off the TV and close the curtains.

179
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,612
Look at the walls. The
walls are spoiled too.

180
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,683
There are iron marks on the walls too.

181
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,781
What did they do? They pulled
us out from inside and..

182
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:51,625
Sister. Sister. Open the door.
They'll kill me. They'll kill me.

183
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,761
Open.

184
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,655
These rogues have finished everything.

185
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,859
They did not leave anything.

186
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,827
Do you think Mehul's gang has done this?

187
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,730
They hate you since the
affair and the Toll gate.

188
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,825
He'll do so much.

189
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,582
What is that?

190
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,582
Nothing. It's a pendant.

191
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,522
Your friend's. Jyoti. Ask
her. She will surely know.

192
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,628
Why? Mehul is one of her
relatives, that's why.

193
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,631
Where are you going?

194
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,668
To Munna. I'll come at 10.

195
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,658
Hey.

196
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,694
Listen.

197
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,630
Be careful.

198
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,320
Greetings to God.

199
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,488
Greetings to God.

200
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,428
Oh, my God.

201
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,345
Come on, wake up.

202
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:51,346
What kind of medicine am I having?

203
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,358
Listen, call Subhash.

204
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,364
He will be at the hospital
right now. Talk to him at night.

205
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,431
If you want, shall I arrange
for Mr. Shafiq to talk to you?

206
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,462
I want medicine, not an amulet.
- Then bear it.

207
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:14,378
I'll bear it better if you prepare
some poppy seed juice for me.

208
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:41,529
''He led my hand with
his own selfish reasons.''

209
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:51,449
''He led my hand with
his own selfish reasons.''

210
00:20:52,451 --> 00:21:01,416
''My hand. The evening
plays hide and seek.''

211
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:10,434
''He led my hand with
his own selfish reasons.''

212
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,493
Have this.

213
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,439
All right. My God.

214
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,566
The Muslims are being killed ruthlessly.

215
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,591
Aren't you grieved about that?

216
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,530
Mr. Karim, I'm sad because
a man is killing a man.

217
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,538
Listen, get me the
'Surmandal' from above.

218
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,608
I've to give it to little Maya.

219
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,622
Mr. Khan.

220
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,593
None of your disciples are Muslim.

221
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,606
Have you every thought?
- It's God's will.

222
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:27,638
Maybe the Muslims don't respect music.

223
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,637
It's not respect.

224
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,641
No Muslim has escaped here
in a radius of ten miles.

225
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,620
You have your medicine
and sleep peacefully.

226
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,520
And I stay awake the entire night.

227
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,615
Why? What are you scared of?
- Yes, why will I?

228
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,550
Everyone is God's child here.

229
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,529
Here Hindu and Muslim
stay happily together.

230
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,535
Go. See who is it?

231
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:10,684
Come. You will live long.
- I was going to Mr. Joshi.

232
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,558
I thought I should meet him. How is he?

233
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,586
He feels very sleepy.
- That's good. Delicacies for you.

234
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,101
Greetings, Mr. Khan.
- Live long. Live long.

235
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,435
How are you? - Absolutely
fine. - Show me.

236
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,410
Brother Karim was telling that..

237
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,399
..you get very sleepy
with these medicines.

238
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,436
He is jealous.
- Yes.

239
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,441
He stays awake the entire night
worrying about his welfare.

240
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,180
Yes.
- And mine too.

241
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,486
And listen, this..
- One minute.

242
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:52,162
This is for your daughter. Maya.

243
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,128
Mr. Khan, how can I take this?

244
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,190
This is your childhood souvenir.

245
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,202
So what? It has not become old like me.
- Oh, no.

246
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,437
I will bring Maya and you
can give it to her yourself.

247
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,205
She will be very happy.
- That's fine too.

248
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,207
I'll leave.
- Live long.

249
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,422
His blood pressure is high.
- ls he worried about something?

250
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,159
Doctor, you know that
no one except you came..

251
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,458
..in the Saturday gathering
in the last three weeks.

252
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,425
How can I tell him why
other people don't come?

253
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,226
Come.

254
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,499
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

255
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,456
You know, I just can't
get over it, friend.

256
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,458
How did they come to know that
Sameer was a dormant partner?

257
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,256
Because big brother's watching.

258
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,531
What?
- Did you read?

259
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,529
They have got databases of
all Muslim-owned businesses.

260
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,492
Yes, but..

261
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,233
Apart from some bank
papers and legal documents..

262
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,569
..Sameer's name shows nowhere, friend.

263
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,245
Ketki, leave it. Now, I
don't want to ask all this.

264
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,474
Yes, leave it.

265
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,254
I had promised Sameer
that I will learn this.

266
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,256
And now see. Now, it's the last day.

267
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,528
He is really fond of tea.

268
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,269
ln his family, all are fond of it.

269
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,607
ln fact, father says that
Muslims are allowed more tea..

270
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,268
..because they are not allowed alcohol.

271
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,301
But Sameer drinks.

272
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,506
And I have never seen
him pray or anything.

273
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,585
Really, he is so not a Muslim.
- But he is, Ketki.

274
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,587
He is.

275
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,624
Somewhere on the list in
big bold letters is written..

276
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,285
..Sameer Arshad Sheikh.

277
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,590
I was not joking when I said
that big brother is watching.

278
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,291
Tell me honestly, Anu.

279
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,934
Do you ever regret marrying a Muslim?

280
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,336
No.

281
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,637
When we got married, I knew
it was not going to be easy.

282
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,345
But this last month has taken that
to a completely different level.

283
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,545
What do you think?

284
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,554
Delhi is going to be
much different from here.

285
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,555
Your brother is also
there. ln U.S. of A.

286
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,593
His life is hardly a picnic, friend.

287
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,626
So what you are saying is that
no matter where I go I'm done for.

288
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,330
What I'm saying is, this is
your home. Just leave the rest.

289
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,337
It is easy for you to say.

290
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,639
You don't have to hide if some
Hindu fundamentalist kills someone.

291
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,353
If some lslamic extremist
bombs someplace in the world..

292
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,384
..we've to hang our heads in shame.

293
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,594
What?

294
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,395
We?

295
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,373
I don't know 'me' became 'we'.
- Tea is ready.

296
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,665
Coming.

297
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:31,671
Sister, take some more.

298
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,411
You can never say what
happens at such times.

299
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,686
No, it's very expensive.

300
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,619
Mother!
- Hey, can't you see? You are running blindly.

301
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,454
Did you hurt yourself?

302
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,669
Are you hungry?

303
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,771
Come, come with me.

304
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,452
Come.

305
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:37,471
Are you a Muslim? What is your name?
- Mohsin.

306
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,495
Take this. Eat it.

307
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,515
Aarti.
- Coming, Father.

308
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,512
'Did Kesar return?'

309
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,512
Later, okay.

310
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,281
Come.

311
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,359
Come.

312
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,274
No, he has sent a child.

313
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,277
Where is he?

314
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,314
Come. Come.

315
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,379
Go to father. There is
no need to be scared.

316
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,324
He can't even stand.
- Come here. - Go.

317
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,431
What is your name?

318
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,433
Mohan.

319
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,405
He is so small. What work can he do?

320
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,441
Come here.

321
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,449
Go and wash it.

322
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,397
Amen.
- Amen.

323
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,428
Come. Let's go.

324
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,381
Father did so much for our neighbours.

325
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,509
But so few people came at such a moment.

326
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,388
Yes, dear.

327
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:36,125
More people would have come
if it was an ordinary priest.

328
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,288
Well, I'm pleased
that you came at least.

329
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,156
He doesn't go anywhere. But
he insisted to come here.

330
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:49,136
It was my duty to
come. Don't worry, dear.

331
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,209
God is the giver.

332
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,237
Father was exactly like
you. Hardly any earnings.

333
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,218
A house which may
topple over at anytime.

334
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,279
And he would say that God is the giver.

335
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:13,152
If you need anything, ask
me unhesitatingly. Okay?

336
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,199
I should leave now.
- Have some lentil pilaf at least.

337
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,328
No, I will eat something after
I'm done with my medicines.

338
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,195
Live long.

339
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,352
The idiot saw us and left.

340
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:39,187
Who will take two oldies?
- You have decided not to see.

341
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,227
Will you go to Hirabaug society?
- No.

342
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,323
What happened?
- What will happen? Shook his head.

343
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,362
Maybe he doesn't want
to go to that side.

344
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,331
Why will a Muslim go to that area?

345
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:01,200
lsn't his life dear to him?
- You are too much.

346
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:05,247
Do one thing, wait here. I'll
go and look at the corner.

347
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,035
How much is this sugar candy for?
- Rs.20 per kilo.

348
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:41,074
Rs.20 a kilo.
- Leave it, Brother.

349
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,211
It's enough if you get
sugar candy at such times.

350
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,212
Mr. Khan.

351
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,050
Mr. Khan, come. Come. I
told you to wait there. You.

352
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:55,122
Come. Sit. Let's go.

353
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,167
Rs.20 a kilo. -
What? - Sugar candy.

354
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,147
Have you found the prices these days?

355
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,140
And you wanted to help Sakina.

356
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,109
What would you give
her if she really asked?

357
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,147
Your old sitar or the broken TV.

358
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,248
Stop him. Stop him.

359
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,152
Hey. - Stop him.
- Hey. Stop him.

360
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,224
Why are you stopping him?
Look. Where are you going?

361
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,135
Mr. Khan. Listen. Hey.

362
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,275
Where is the mosque?
- Where are you going?

363
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,243
The Wali mosque was here.

364
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,204
Hey. You would have been
hurt. What are you doing?

365
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,209
The Wali mosque was here.
- They broke it in the riots.

366
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,087
Shut up. You have lost your mind.

367
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:57,287
No, I may forget. The mosque was here.

368
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,096
It wasn't here.
- How can it disappear like that?

369
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,132
It was on the other road.
It wasn't here. Come. Yes.

370
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,191
Sit. Sit.

371
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,274
Let's go.

372
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,222
Munira.

373
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,170
Jyoti.
- I can't believe it.

374
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,212
It was worse. I'm cleaning
it since yesterday.

375
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:54,307
Do you know who has done it?
- No, I was at my aunt's.

376
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,229
It's good that you were not here.

377
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,326
When did this happen?

378
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,239
Don't think about it
now. What's the use?

379
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,219
Take this.

380
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,355
I brought hiding it from mummy.

381
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:39,285
You knew that the kitchen will be in this condition.
- No.

382
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,357
I didn't think that it
would have been so burnt.

383
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,363
Give it to me.
- Go, keep it outside.

384
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,252
We've to go to apply
henna in the evening today.

385
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,409
Are you coming?

386
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,324
Have you lost it?

387
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:19,393
Munira, look. You need money
now. They are very rich.

388
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,339
Just the bride and a few more. That's it.
- No.

389
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,333
5000 each for both of us.

390
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,279
5.

391
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,341
Truly?
- Yes, so.

392
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,286
They have to pay if they
get married in such times.

393
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,346
Oh, God. I'll place it outside.

394
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,365
But I don't have henna. -
What? - I don't have henna.

395
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,691
Don't worry. I have got lots of henna.

396
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,829
You've even thought of this.

397
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,465
Then? I'm your best friend, right?

398
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,436
Then tell me who did all this?

399
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:10,320
I told you I don't know. I
was at my aunt's. Leave it.

400
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,390
Okay, when will we return
if we go to apply henna?

401
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,393
Hanif is coming at 10.
- We are sure to come by 9.

402
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,320
Oh, come.

403
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,401
People have been raped, killed,
burnt alive for no fault of theirs.

404
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,369
Anu, there are always
two sides to a coin.

405
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,302
If those people hadn't
started this violence..

406
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,400
..things wouldn't have been
this bad. No offence, Sameer.

407
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,437
I can't believe you're
justifying this madness.

408
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,379
Tell me. You tell me.

409
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,315
When your maid eloped
with your jewellery..

410
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,444
You didn't go torch the whole
Chara community, did you?

411
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,421
Hey guys. Please. Come on.

412
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,479
You're leaving tomorrow, right?

413
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,359
And can we change the topic please?

414
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,923
And in any case, we too
have our own share of loss.

415
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,435
A loss that's covered by insurance.

416
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,167
Let's go. We've got tons to do.
- Sit.

417
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,444
Hold there. That must be Rahul.

418
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,537
Hail the Goddess.

419
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,418
We've come to take donation
for the Goddess Lakshmi temple.

420
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,176
It's okay.

421
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:24,127
That's it. Such a big
bungalow but you are so stingy.

422
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,886
Goddess Lakshmi won't be
satisfied with this much.

423
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,991
My dear, whether Mother Goddess is
appeased or not, but you should be.

424
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:31,957
You are right.

425
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,470
Name?
- Sameer.

426
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,507
Sameer what?

427
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,031
Desai.

428
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,015
Mother Lakshmi will
shower you with wealth.

429
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,573
You too.

430
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,390
Look, madam, you didn't turn
into a Muslim after marriage..

431
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,554
..but this gentleman has turned Hindu.

432
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,456
And that too with your surname.

433
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,399
You don't know how many times..

434
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,495
..I've silently thanked his
parents for naming him Sameer.

435
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,403
Actually, I didn't even know that..

436
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,567
..Sameer was a Muslim
name until I met you.

437
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,442
It's in Arabic.

438
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,474
It means the companion who
talks to you in the evening.

439
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,581
These days.. quite the whole day.

440
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,586
Too scared to open his mouth.

441
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:35,454
There were many. Everyone was shouting.

442
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,359
They burnt my mother and brother too.

443
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:44,364
They even killed my younger
sister, aunt and uncle.

444
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,402
You saw all that?

445
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,373
Some even brought swords.

446
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,256
They killed aunt after unclothing her.

447
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,361
But they didn't disrobe the men.

448
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,389
And where were you?

449
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,458
I was hiding in the dustbin.

450
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,459
Then?

451
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,302
Then uncle Yusuf took
me to the survival camp.

452
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,467
But I want to go to father.

453
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,308
Where is your father?

454
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,449
I don't know.

455
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,283
Father had gone to the
shop when they had come.

456
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,459
Maybe your mother escaped.
Had she worn a black stole?

457
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,319
No, my mother only wears saris.

458
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,517
Come here.

459
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,425
Come.

460
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,443
Let me see.

461
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,486
My name is not Mohan, but Mohsin.

462
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,549
Mohsin in the kitchen
and Mohan outside. Okay?

463
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,556
I don't want to return to the camp.

464
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,562
Will you stay here as Mohan?

465
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,537
Will you go to look for my father first?

466
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,569
They had burnt you too.

467
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:11,172
'Brother, say something.'

468
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,164
What are you telling me to
speak? What is left now to speak?

469
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,008
Brother I really never knew.

470
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:19,978
You fool, you should have checked.

471
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:22,183
If we would have known that
the report is already filed..

472
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,052
..at the police station, we wouldn't
have looked like fools there.

473
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:26,086
But Barot had told me..

474
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:27,110
To hell with your Barot.

475
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:31,124
That DCP wants some scapegoat.

476
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,685
He will catch two-three
like you and put behind bars.

477
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:35,820
And the rest will go scot-free.

478
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:40,760
Brother, I know all the names.
- Oh, my God!

479
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,033
You fool, you must never be
a witness in this. Understood?

480
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,127
It is a rape case. You
will be in for seven years.

481
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:48,164
Because of you, even
I am trapped in this.

482
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,009
Get some water.

483
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,170
You are asking how did this happen?

484
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,112
There was lot of beating.
All women are safe here.

485
00:43:57,751 --> 00:44:00,219
They are safe at the
society in the back.

486
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:02,088
The police came at 12 at night..

487
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:05,253
You enjoyed doing that?

488
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:09,257
Tell me. Tell me. You
can always tell me.

489
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,133
I was not the only one.

490
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:18,703
Are you bringing water
or are you digging a well?

491
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:21,030
I am scared.

492
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:25,434
I'm scared.
- Don't get scared. No one comes to the kitchen.

493
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:31,108
Sit here quietly. Sit here.
Okay? Nothing will happen.

494
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:32,841
I promise.

495
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,559
They did not think twice when
they saw these young girls.

496
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:46,232
They dishonoured them.

497
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:50,394
Those who don't have any honour,
how can they get dishonoured?

498
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:51,994
And do you have any honour?

499
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,680
'She is Shabana.'
- I mean..

500
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,483
Come inside.

501
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:34,145
I don't like to beat like this.

502
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,010
'Deven, are you coming now or
are you going to stay here?'

503
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:42,055
'Come on.'

504
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,769
Mohsin.

505
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:57,352
Oh, God.

506
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,372
Who is it? - Me,
Munna. - Who? - Munna.

507
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,469
Brother Hanif.
- Come.

508
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,382
Sit.

509
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:23,513
I was told about your uncle from Munna.

510
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:31,488
God will manage him.
I couldn't save my own.

511
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:37,333
I didn't know that such
a big riot will occur..

512
00:47:37,404 --> 00:47:39,372
..when they came to burn our house.

513
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:43,375
But I somehow took
out uncle from inside.

514
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,410
And then he ran straight
towards the circle.

515
00:47:45,546 --> 00:47:48,447
But the police asked us to
go towards the Patipara road.

516
00:47:49,516 --> 00:47:53,350
But a bigger mob than that
was as if waiting for us..

517
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,480
..with tridents and
swords there. The rogues.

518
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,184
I didn't know what happened.

519
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,187
I had held uncle's hand
firmly. But I don't know..

520
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:04,230
Stop it, Lala.

521
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:10,134
I've seen more dead people
than you've seen live people.

522
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:19,169
Make the child sleep inside.
Look at her, she is so scared.

523
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:21,148
Look at her.

524
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,082
She doesn't let go of the
child even while preparing food.

525
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:25,174
She takes him along even
when she goes to the toilet.

526
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:28,254
What's the use of living like the dead?

527
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,280
I'll kill them.

528
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,162
You can think like that
since you were away.

529
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:39,256
But don't we feel like
finishing off the rogues?

530
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:42,169
Then let's go and kill
them. Let's go now.

531
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,194
Who will you kill? -
What? - Who will you kill?

532
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,197
I will kill Mehul first.

533
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:52,279
Mehul?
- I will tell him what a pile of ashes is.

534
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:54,144
The idiot. Fie on him.

535
00:48:56,183 --> 00:49:00,142
Wait. - The rogues
have come here. - Open.

536
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:04,087
Hey! Hey! Wait!

537
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:10,229
Flow the water. Sir,
what are you doing? This.

538
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:12,298
Who is in uniform?

539
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,267
Who is in uniform?

540
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:17,235
Sir, you.
- Then why are you asking questions?

541
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:20,307
And if you are really
interested in asking questions..

542
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,275
..then come to the police station,
you will get all your answers.

543
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,211
Drop this, why are you just standing?

544
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:29,248
Did you see?

545
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:32,376
Did you see how nicely
they are looking after us?

546
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:38,314
We store water in drums
to extinguish fire.

547
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:41,182
And these people.

548
00:49:42,296 --> 00:49:44,196
And these people come and empty them.

549
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:57,209
Not anymore. I'll go mad.
- Listen.

550
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:01,339
Do you still have Suleiman's pistol?

551
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:04,284
Tell him. Who will he tell?

552
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,255
I would have saved uncle if I had it.

553
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:12,358
Suleiman had taken it long back.
- Henpecked.

554
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:14,351
The rogue has fled to Surat.

555
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:21,157
I just want a weapon
for today. That's it.

556
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,301
Have you ever seen a pistol?

557
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,339
I don't know if the
pistol is in the shop.

558
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:31,310
But uncle Altaf has the
key to Suleiman's shop.

559
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,414
Are you thinking the same as me?

560
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:37,350
Bring the pistol. Bring it.
And shoot me on the head.

561
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,317
Have you gone mad?
- Yes, I've gone mad.

562
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:42,219
I prepared bread in the
bakery my entire life.

563
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:49,388
What wrong did I do? What wrong did I do?
- The pistol..

564
00:51:10,384 --> 00:51:12,318
Where is Halim?

565
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:15,321
Go home. There are riots going on ahead.

566
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:21,318
Go home. Run.

567
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:30,461
One day we must go..

568
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:33,473
Hey you small fellow. Hey you.

569
00:51:33,473 --> 00:51:35,407
Come here.
- Come here.

570
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,435
Why are you in a hurry
and where are you going?

571
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,379
He had stolen those berries,
that's why he was running away.

572
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:44,416
Ask him his name. His name.
- What is your name?

573
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,387
Mohan.

574
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,450
And this Mohan?
- Mohan?

575
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,294
Bring him here.
- Bring him here.

576
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,326
Dear, do you know what punishment..

577
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:59,331
..they give to a thief in Saudi Arabia?

578
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:01,296
They cut off the hands.

579
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,370
They hang you upside-down and whip you.

580
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,359
Look, he got scared. He got scared.

581
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:05,427
Where is your house?
Where is your house?

582
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:10,308
He is pointing there.
- Why are you standing here?

583
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,436
Run away before the police arrive here.

584
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:16,312
Go! He has been
standing here since long.

585
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:31,953
This is sick.

586
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:37,336
Look, she has got a Honda
waiting for her, friend.

587
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:42,366
Fatso, show me your face.

588
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:45,176
lf she had shown her face,
then these policemen..

589
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,212
..would have taken millions from her.

590
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,215
Stop. Stop. Stop. Rewind. Rewind.

591
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,309
Pause. Pause.

592
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:58,357
The person who ran into your car.
- What?

593
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,318
You didn't note down the idiot's number.

594
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,289
No. I was even smarter.

595
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:12,203
I gave them Rs.800
for damaging our car..

596
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,332
..and looting our store.
Great, Sameer Sheikh. Brilliant.

597
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:17,367
Hey. Enough.

598
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,372
It's not your fault.
- Of course, it is.

599
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:24,305
Can't you see it?

600
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:28,286
To begin with, your store was
looted because I'm your partner.

601
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:34,257
Well, yes. But I wouldn't have
had that store without you.

602
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:36,386
Yes, right. You wouldn't have
had that store without me.

603
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,363
Now, you don't have
that store because of me.

604
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,301
Look, friend. Think it this way.

605
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:46,303
You had to pay because Anu was with you.

606
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,365
This is the system here.
We live in such a country.

607
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,337
Didn't I give Rs.10,000 or
this CD which is mine. Tell me.

608
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:56,278
And that also just for five minutes.

609
00:53:57,384 --> 00:53:59,318
I didn't pay because Anu was with me.

610
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:09,151
I paid because I was scared.

611
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:10,285
Hey Sameer. Come on.

612
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:13,290
I'm not going to let you
play the victim. Okay? Please.

613
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:17,134
Stop.
- Do you know what's being a victim?

614
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:21,240
Did you ever change
your name for any work?

615
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,303
Do you have to think twice before
praising a Pakistani player?

616
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:29,176
Do you ever have to
worry about someone..

617
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:30,513
..stripping down your pants to check your..
- Hey. Hey.

618
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,276
Come on. Come on. Don't
over react, friend.

619
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,181
Don't overdo this.

620
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,312
Didn't anyone strip-search
you? - But I could be.

621
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,249
And that terrifies me.

622
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:48,300
Sameer, we all have been
scared at some point of time.

623
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,335
Who are you?

624
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,338
Sameer.

625
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,305
You can thank my parents a
thousand times for naming me Sameer.

626
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:04,249
But I can feel the burden of that name.

627
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:06,252
Really?

628
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,184
And what happened when the person..

629
00:55:08,255 --> 00:55:09,279
..who came to ask for
donation asked Sameer?

630
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:11,221
Then you should have said Sameer Sheikh.

631
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,280
Why didn't you say Sameer Sheikh?

632
00:55:14,294 --> 00:55:17,229
Because I've no courage,
okay. I'm terrified.

633
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:31,776
What a way to live.

634
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,280
They got my store and I decided to run.

635
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:44,323
You know what?

636
00:55:46,826 --> 00:55:50,284
We don't need to go to Delhi. Yes.

637
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:53,296
We shouldn't go to Delhi.

638
00:55:58,371 --> 00:56:02,398
Seriously, Anu. Can we reconsider this?

639
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:10,315
Don't do this to me.
Please, don't do this.

640
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,249
15 days ago, you gave
me a million reasons..

641
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:16,289
..why this move is a good thing for us.

642
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:19,324
I hated the idea. Absolutely hated it.

643
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,352
And then I started convincing myself.

644
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:28,401
Now. Just now, you told
me how scared you are.

645
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:33,303
Do you think that after hearing
this I will want to stay here?

646
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:40,345
You are Sameer Arshad Sheikh.

647
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,513
And this isn't going to change anywhere.

648
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:54,288
We have our life packed in boxes.

649
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:57,396
And the movers are coming at 8.

650
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,262
I want to go home.

651
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:25,357
When did you come
from your aunt's house?

652
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:29,417
ln the morning today.
- When had you gone?

653
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:33,354
I don't remember. I
told you I don't know.

654
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:40,429
Shut up. Wear it silently,
otherwise you'll catch cold.

655
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:44,569
I won't spare the
rogues once I catch them.

656
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,445
Munira, feel happy. There
is a wedding in this house.

657
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:56,478
Your mood is okay. That's enough.

658
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:04,555
They know me. Come.

659
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,545
What was after that? I got lost.

660
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:24,517
I was lost myself.

661
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:34,451
I suddenly remembered the first
time I went to Wali mosque.

662
00:58:37,197 --> 00:58:38,425
October..

663
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:43,399
1960.

664
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:47,440
It was a full moon night.

665
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,308
And it was surprising that
it rained the entire day.

666
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:56,541
And priest and I had sung
the Raga Malhar on the radio.

667
00:58:57,817 --> 00:59:03,153
Then he told me that he will
drop me home. So, I went.

668
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:10,488
Then suddenly, he stopped his
scooter in the way at Wali mosque.

669
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:14,332
And started singing Wali's song.

670
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:24,433
The music echoes because
this heart stays there.

671
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:34,351
The mosque washed by rain and
glittering with moonlight..

672
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,457
I suddenly saw something moving there.

673
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:46,297
Do you know what was it? A mouse.

674
00:59:48,568 --> 00:59:55,371
We three were lost in Wali's
poetry in the darkness of the night.

675
00:59:56,409 --> 01:00:01,540
No one moved. Not me, not the priest.

676
01:00:01,915 --> 01:00:05,510
And not even Lord Ganesha's mouse.

677
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:12,425
How will you think? They
were distributing letters.

678
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:16,418
That eradicate this mini-Pakistan.

679
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,554
People would come here
from Lahore in trucks.

680
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:25,998
My sister-in-law
and cousin had come..

681
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:28,402
Wali was from the South.

682
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:35,145
But he loved Gujarat so much
that he became one of here.

683
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:42,019
Whenever I would pass by his mosque..

684
01:00:42,088 --> 01:00:45,114
..I would stop to read the prayers.

685
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:55,033
When I read in the newspaper
that his mosque was broken..

686
01:00:56,836 --> 01:00:59,805
..then I found out
who Wali Gujarati was.

687
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:10,082
I knew.

688
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:18,214
I knew we were on the right spot.

689
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,229
The thumb like this.. One
minute. Lift your thumb.

690
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:39,111
What were you doing so late at night?

691
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:43,205
I was cutting gourds for
dessert for you and doctor.

692
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:47,186
All this is because of
this idiot television.

693
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:51,122
How do we turn it off?
- We've to go to the hospital.

694
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:55,092
The wound is not deep but
have to be sewn. Let's go.

695
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:57,094
Yes, let's go. Don't waste time.

696
01:01:57,163 --> 01:01:59,290
Let's go.
- Mr. Khan, wait. We two will just come.

697
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,123
Come.

698
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:05,260
Come. Come. -
Careful. - Yes.

699
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:14,212
That's nice. Now, it looks
like a real henna ceremony.

700
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:16,249
Hardly, friend.

701
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:18,149
Do you remember Sonia's wedding?

702
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:20,219
Just for the henna ceremony,
there were 50 people.

703
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:21,253
I don't think so.
- So..

704
01:02:22,288 --> 01:02:25,121
Aunt, Vineet and his friends had
given such a lovely performance.

705
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:26,158
ls it?

706
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:29,195
Just like Shah Rukh.
- Then you too do it.

707
01:02:29,195 --> 01:02:31,331
Oh, God, I've so many plans.

708
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,231
These riots have ruined everything.

709
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:36,132
But where are we involved in that?
- It is one and the same thing.

710
01:02:36,202 --> 01:02:39,296
Aunt, let's not take this too lightly.
- Yes, that's true.

711
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,173
Yesterday I received an
e-mail from my friend.

712
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:45,244
That had all the Muslim
rickshaw numbers to be involved.

713
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:47,144
Oh, my God. I am so scared.

714
01:02:47,213 --> 01:02:48,180
What if they kill them?

715
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,145
Anyways, forget it, please.

716
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:52,148
Let's just have some fun, friend.

717
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:53,319
What are you doing?
- Oh!

718
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:56,288
She does not see properly.

719
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,358
No. - Come on. - I am
just getting done. Please.

720
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,317
Come on.
- Sister, come on. Come on, dance. Come on.

721
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:09,302
''What has happened
to me? Why am I lost?''

722
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:12,271
You are sure that you haven't
seen anyone entering my house.

723
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,336
lf you ask me repeatedly will
I say that I've seen someone?

724
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:20,345
''Your eyes are intoxicating
and your tresses are tousled.''

725
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:22,313
''What have you done to yourself?''

726
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,316
Hanif said that you'll know everything.

727
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,253
''I have met someone.''

728
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:28,242
Whatever happened, Munira?

729
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:33,258
We know that Mehul brother and
Hanif brother were never friends.

730
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:37,296
But this thing never bothered us.

731
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:39,265
''I met someone.''

732
01:03:39,265 --> 01:03:40,289
Why do you start now?

733
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,323
You started it.

734
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,235
''I met someone.''
- ''You have met her.''

735
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:47,407
''I met someone.''
- ''You have met her.''

736
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,274
I think Mehul's gang has done this.

737
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:56,247
I don't know. People can
do anything at such times.

738
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,387
Come on, all of you take a
break and have some snacks. Come.

739
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:04,312
Go and get tea. Go.

740
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:14,366
Give to me. - No,
it's okay. - Munira.

741
01:04:22,975 --> 01:04:24,306
Stop it.

742
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:28,302
Papa, why isn't mummy
serving food today?

743
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:32,351
My dear, your Mother has gone crazy.

744
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:44,320
Have you gone mad?

745
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,297
What are you doing?

746
01:04:52,672 --> 01:04:54,264
ln the morning. you opened your
mouth and now you have become deaf?

747
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,271
I will beat you up again.

748
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,403
You wretched female.

749
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:25,505
Uncle Altaf will meet
you at Suleiman's shop.

750
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,405
I can't go leaving Zahira alone.

751
01:05:27,473 --> 01:05:31,511
Hey. - Who is
it? - It's Goga.

752
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,446
Goga, what are you doing
here? Come, let's go home.

753
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:40,342
Goga.
- What? What yours?

754
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,513
He says that he likes
Preity Zinta a lot.

755
01:05:44,457 --> 01:05:49,326
He is the son of the uncle who was killed.
- Come home. Come on.

756
01:05:49,395 --> 01:05:50,419
Let him come with us.

757
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,395
How can he go alone without me?

758
01:05:52,465 --> 01:05:56,333
Then you too come.
- Yes, you come too. Come.

759
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:01,439
Okay, if the neighbour comes and
sits with Zahira, I will come too.

760
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,508
It'll be good for me to leave home too.

761
01:06:04,844 --> 01:06:06,436
Okay, come fast.

762
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:10,380
He is like this.
- Yes, since childhood.

763
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,348
He became like this after he
was wounded in the head once.

764
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:17,353
Does he know? - What? -
That his father has died.

765
01:06:17,423 --> 01:06:18,515
How could I know if he knows or not?

766
01:06:19,525 --> 01:06:20,492
Give me.

767
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:26,432
Hanif, when did you start?

768
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:27,524
Friend, I started this
since I was tensed.

769
01:06:28,467 --> 01:06:33,427
Hurry up, sit. We've to return
soon. - Be careful. - Let's go.

770
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,575
Lucky, prepare four omelettes.
I will come in some time.

771
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,549
Some people carry on
like nothing happened.

772
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,519
Because they can.
- And we can't.

773
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,446
That's why we must leave.

774
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:55,426
Come, Mr. Sameer. After a long time.

775
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:57,462
Lucky's night has become double lucky.

776
01:06:58,531 --> 01:07:02,399
Two delicious bun omelettes. -
One without chilli. - Correct.

777
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:05,561
Very good. Very good.
- Shall we pack it? It's getting late.

778
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,439
No, madam. Sit. Please sit.

779
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:12,510
Come, let's eat it piping hot here. Sit.

780
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,614
Lucky, how are you?
- Yes. Nothing, sir.

781
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,486
These riots have ruined our business.

782
01:07:23,189 --> 01:07:26,283
I can't even ask the
shopkeeper for riot discount..

783
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:27,584
..when things are so expensive.

784
01:07:30,062 --> 01:07:33,657
Don't worry. Your omelette is a
hit, forget about other things.

785
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,461
What can I say, sir? I've to
feed the entire army for free.

786
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,607
Just to stay here and that too alone.

787
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,608
But where is Chhotya?

788
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:48,512
He hasn't come since
the riots have started.

789
01:07:50,016 --> 01:07:51,483
May God keep him safe.

790
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:02,559
Listen. We'll be fine in Delhi.

791
01:08:05,131 --> 01:08:08,589
A fresh start is always a good thing.
- Yes.

792
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,570
Whatever doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

793
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:16,472
Sir, if these people
had not started this..

794
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,567
..then the city wouldn't
have been like this.

795
01:08:19,278 --> 01:08:21,508
It's in their blood to
riot. ln their blood.

796
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:23,615
We are being taught to tolerate.

797
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,618
And they are taught
to be fundamentalists.

798
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,614
Then Chhotya should be a fundamentalist too.
- Yes?

799
01:08:31,724 --> 01:08:33,487
Chhotya, a fundamentalist.

800
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:35,526
That poor boy cannot even kill an ant.

801
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,665
But Chhotya is not like him.
I have seen many Muslims.

802
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,624
They are very strict.

803
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:49,238
I'm a Muslim.
- Stop it.

804
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,342
You crack good jokes.

805
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:55,339
I'm not joking. I'm truly a Muslim.

806
01:08:56,348 --> 01:08:57,372
Will you stop it, Sameer?

807
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:02,210
Sir, such jokes are
dangerous at such times.

808
01:09:02,455 --> 01:09:07,290
You can't say anything.
You don't know when.. Sir.

809
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,224
Come. Come. What will you have?

810
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:11,226
Omelette, scrambled egg or boiled egg?

811
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:12,421
Come on, wind up.

812
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:14,389
There is going to be commotion today.

813
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:18,232
And you two also move on.

814
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:23,238
One minute, sir, I am
just finishing this.

815
01:09:23,943 --> 01:09:25,638
At such times, you must
not fulfil your wishes.

816
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:29,106
Come on. You had enough.

817
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,542
No, sir. We are going. ln
fact, we are leaving the city.

818
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,481
He likes Lucky's omelette, that's why..

819
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,420
For the last time.

820
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:39,550
Come.

821
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,616
What is your name you said?

822
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:44,592
My name is Anuradha Desai
and this is my husband Sameer.

823
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,557
Make Mr. Desai understand.

824
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:48,496
Don't try to act smart.
- Yes.

825
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,568
Go now.
- Yes.

826
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:51,660
Give this to Chhotya when you meet him.

827
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:01,738
Sir, I will tell you one thing.

828
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:03,837
I am not Mr. Desai.

829
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:06,409
I am Mr. Sheikh.

830
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,449
Sheikh? Then why did you lie?

831
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:16,087
I did not lie. My name is Sameer Sheikh.

832
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:18,755
And she is my wife Anuradha Desai.

833
01:10:19,665 --> 01:10:24,193
Now, I know why you act so smart.

834
01:10:24,436 --> 01:10:25,300
Come on, go now.

835
01:10:25,404 --> 01:10:26,632
Yes, we are going.

836
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:28,434
Go straight to Pakistan

837
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,443
Come on, now wind up.

838
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:33,333
Why did you do that?

839
01:10:37,383 --> 01:10:41,285
It just feels good. Very good.

840
01:10:52,064 --> 01:10:53,326
Uncle Yusuf.

841
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:57,728
Mohsin. What are you doing here?

842
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:01,134
Come. Careful.

843
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:06,211
You said that father will
come to the camp to fetch me.

844
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:12,283
But he didn't come.
- How did you come here?

845
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:16,377
I ran away from the camp alone.
- Mad boy.

846
01:11:18,057 --> 01:11:22,050
You shouldn't roam alone
at night. Come. Sit.

847
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:24,929
I'll go and drop you. Sit.

848
01:11:31,971 --> 01:11:34,496
Uncle. Give me Suleiman's keys.

849
01:11:38,577 --> 01:11:43,514
I know who broke Suleiman's
shop. They won't escape now.

850
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:48,953
Don't you understand?
Why do you act so smart?

851
01:11:50,022 --> 01:11:52,923
Will the dead return?

852
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,149
Give me the key.

853
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:09,105
Wait. Wait. Drop him at
Sabur camp before leaving.

854
01:12:09,308 --> 01:12:10,275
I can't go to the camp now.

855
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:13,003
Fear God a little. These things..

856
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:20,182
The poor boy is an orphan.
- Hurry up, then.

857
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:25,013
Come, Mohsin, he will
drop you at the camp. Okay?

858
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:28,392
I'll come tomorrow morning to meet.
- With father?

859
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:32,220
Come. Come dear. Come.

860
01:12:42,675 --> 01:12:44,575
Drop him at the campo first.

861
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:56,543
I'm very scared.
- Don't worry. We have reached.

862
01:13:00,526 --> 01:13:03,393
Wait. - Come, come.
- Open the boot.

863
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,864
Stop. Stop. Park here.

864
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,565
Don't be scared. Do you have
the spot on your forehead?

865
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:20,605
It's so late. Hanif will kill me.
- Wait, I'll see.. - Hey, come.

866
01:13:20,779 --> 01:13:21,837
Hey, come here. Come this way.

867
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:26,875
At this time?

868
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:32,219
Sir.. sir, we are returning
home after applying henna.

869
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:33,153
License. Show me.

870
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:35,089
I have. I have my license.

871
01:13:40,466 --> 01:13:41,455
We both had gone.

872
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,062
Okay. Okay. Come on
go. Don't waste time.

873
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:47,105
Thank you.

874
01:13:55,047 --> 01:13:57,709
Mohsin, come here. Come.

875
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:08,485
Be careful of the broken glass.

876
01:14:11,096 --> 01:14:15,931
Sit. Silence. Don't do anything here.

877
01:14:45,764 --> 01:14:47,698
Who is it? Who is it?

878
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:49,801
It's us. Open.
- Munna? - Open.

879
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:54,062
We have come.
- We've left the rickshaw at the Red Door..

880
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,307
Careful..

881
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:11,678
Oh, God.

882
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,731
Who is he?
- What can I do?

883
01:15:20,232 --> 01:15:21,324
Uncle Yusuf gave his
responsibility to me.

884
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,760
I have to drop him at the Sabur.

885
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:28,196
Hey. What is your name?

886
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:37,710
Where is that pistol? Where is it?

887
01:15:38,717 --> 01:15:41,618
First, remove this garbage, after
that I'll find the secret cabinet.

888
01:15:43,522 --> 01:15:45,615
The rogue Suleiman was very rich.

889
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,415
What's the use of riches?

890
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:50,293
He fled as soon as the storm started.

891
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:53,330
He did the right thing. It's
better than living scared here.

892
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:56,298
That's right.
- You'll say so.

893
01:15:56,401 --> 01:15:58,232
You had run too.

894
01:15:59,271 --> 01:16:01,205
I don't know how you got
comfort among the Hindus.

895
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:05,274
And you must have got good
comfort among the Muslims.

896
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,782
Look, the idiot named
his shop 'Parimal'.

897
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:13,875
What's the use of a Hindu name?

898
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:15,450
Friend, you can't do anything.

899
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:19,558
lf we don't get anything,
then I take up a weapon..

900
01:16:19,558 --> 01:16:20,855
The place from where
weapons were procured..

901
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:21,926
..was in curfew the whole time.

902
01:16:22,928 --> 01:16:24,896
And anyway, when you are
scared even to breathe..

903
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:26,358
..you don't think about weapons.

904
01:16:27,566 --> 01:16:31,559
I thought a lot about
guns, pistols, bombs.

905
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:34,939
But I was reminded
of my mother the most.

906
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:36,830
But I couldn't do anything.

907
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,645
My body still reeks of burnt corpses.

908
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:43,972
I dream of blood. Their
burnt pieces of flesh..

909
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:45,947
I killed the rogue.

910
01:16:56,228 --> 01:16:59,220
It's so late. Where
is your secret cabinet?

911
01:16:59,331 --> 01:17:02,232
There is no secret cabinet.
He is fooling us. ldiot.

912
01:17:12,244 --> 01:17:13,233
Got it?

913
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,180
Show me.

914
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:34,988
ls it real?

915
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,056
Yes.

916
01:17:36,168 --> 01:17:38,159
It seems small, but it's real.

917
01:17:40,505 --> 01:17:43,406
Be careful. It may contain bullets.
- Open and see.

918
01:17:44,543 --> 01:17:45,532
See.

919
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,141
It doesn't contain anything.

920
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:33,685
They stabbed the boy and they
pulled the girl by her hair.

921
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:37,488
And I came running here.

922
01:18:37,829 --> 01:18:41,856
Children are dying of hunger.

923
01:18:46,905 --> 01:18:48,930
How will we satisfy our hunger?

924
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:58,249
Everything is over.

925
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:03,479
Everything is finished.

926
01:19:45,997 --> 01:19:47,965
They sewed it and it's done.

927
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:58,266
Leave it. There is no need.
- Oh, no.

928
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,604
Nothing has happened to me. I'll do it.
- There is no need.

929
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,204
There will be meeting tomorrow.

930
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:07,410
What do you mean?

931
01:20:11,523 --> 01:20:15,459
You were right. I was wrong.

932
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:28,130
Oh, God. It's of no use. It's of no use.

933
01:20:29,674 --> 01:20:30,663
Mr. Khan.

934
01:20:31,943 --> 01:20:35,003
What will happen to us if you lose hope?

935
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:40,884
The seven melodies don't
have strength enough..

936
01:20:41,052 --> 01:20:43,077
..to face such hatred.

937
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:08,334
Where were you running to?

938
01:21:12,584 --> 01:21:14,176
Wait here. I'll go and see.

939
01:21:14,386 --> 01:21:17,355
'What are you doing?'

940
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:22,916
Come on from here.

941
01:21:23,195 --> 01:21:30,124
Come on sit inside.

942
01:21:30,268 --> 01:21:33,101
Go. Go. Go from here. Go.

943
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,271
Munira.
- What happened?

944
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:40,706
Don't say anything. Come
quietly with me. Come.

945
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:41,779
Tell me.

946
01:21:42,681 --> 01:21:43,670
What happened?

947
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:45,814
The police are saying that
there are weapons in your house.

948
01:21:46,017 --> 01:21:48,042
What?
- Come. Come. Come.

949
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:53,581
Weapons in our house..

950
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,487
Speak softly. Everyone
will find out at home.

951
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:08,639
Look, stay here till those
people are there. Sit here.

952
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:18,247
Make Nazo sleep here.
- Do you want anything?

953
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,284
Why don't they find those
rogues who had burnt our house..

954
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:22,443
..instead of finding weapons there?
- Softly.

955
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:23,977
Nazo will wake up.

956
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:35,423
You still won't tell me.

957
01:22:37,402 --> 01:22:39,336
That's enough. Stop it.

958
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,205
Here are clothes. Change.

959
01:22:56,454 --> 01:22:59,389
Whom are you saving by
remaining silent? Me or you?

960
01:22:59,591 --> 01:23:02,617
God, leave it.
- It's easy for you.

961
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:04,228
Your house was not burnt.

962
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,364
But you're still
burning. What about that?

963
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:09,261
Look, Jyoti, tell the
truth. You were there.

964
01:23:09,367 --> 01:23:13,770
I won't tell Hanif anything. I swear.
- My pendant?

965
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:17,664
My pendant..

966
01:23:27,052 --> 01:23:29,043
What? What did you say?

967
01:23:31,156 --> 01:23:34,057
My pendant. Mother has given me.

968
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:38,221
I've dropped it somewhere.
- You had come to my house.

969
01:23:39,164 --> 01:23:40,131
What?

970
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:44,758
Hanif found your pendant.
You saw everything.

971
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:50,639
Why did you do this?

972
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:52,009
Mehul told you to.

973
01:23:52,243 --> 01:23:53,210
What?

974
01:23:53,345 --> 01:23:56,143
Tell me. Did you take
kerosene from my kitchen?

975
01:23:56,247 --> 01:23:57,236
Or had you brought yours?

976
01:24:51,102 --> 01:24:52,091
We just found one bullet.

977
01:24:53,038 --> 01:24:54,005
And that one is big.

978
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,232
I'm telling you, it'll fit.

979
01:25:06,818 --> 01:25:07,785
Done?

980
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:14,322
Friend, you were right.

981
01:25:14,893 --> 01:25:16,019
Now, what will you do with this pistol?

982
01:25:16,828 --> 01:25:18,227
The same I wanted to do the entire day.

983
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,666
I'll tell that idiot Mehul what fear is.

984
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:25,236
And what then?
- What then? I will go home.

985
01:25:25,503 --> 01:25:27,437
Or whatever that's left of a home.

986
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:30,731
And if some mob comes home
and takes away your daughter..

987
01:25:30,809 --> 01:25:33,778
What will you do then?
- I'll kill all. - How?

988
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:37,477
You will waste this one bullet on Mehul.

989
01:25:41,519 --> 01:25:45,387
Look, I'm the one who
requires this pistol.

990
01:25:45,657 --> 01:25:47,625
You've seen how the
police behave with us.

991
01:25:48,326 --> 01:25:49,350
But your house was not burnt.

992
01:25:49,994 --> 01:25:51,052
You know that my wife is pregnant.

993
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:54,597
One minute. I brought the shop key.

994
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:55,655
I cut the bullet to fit.

995
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,702
That's why I've the first
right to this pistol.

996
01:25:57,869 --> 01:26:01,100
I told you in the beginning
that I need weapons.

997
01:26:01,306 --> 01:26:03,240
What have you done for so many days?
- And what did you do?

998
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,376
You were hiding and
enjoying for one month.

999
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:08,536
Enjoying. I was hiding in
that hovel. I was scared..

1000
01:26:08,847 --> 01:26:10,838
Ask me what it is to live in fear.

1001
01:26:11,349 --> 01:26:13,374
Only I've right over the pistol here.

1002
01:26:13,518 --> 01:26:15,383
Yes. Everything is about you.

1003
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,522
You have always been concerned
about yourself since I know you.

1004
01:26:18,723 --> 01:26:21,556
Shut up. How do you know
what he has gone through?

1005
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:23,194
And how do you know
what I've gone through?

1006
01:26:23,194 --> 01:26:25,128
I do not smell of corpses
but that doesn't mean..

1007
01:26:25,196 --> 01:26:26,857
..that I haven't gone through anything.
- Leave it.

1008
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:29,695
Anyway, Suleiman had given the
key to uncle Yusuf and not you.

1009
01:26:29,968 --> 01:26:30,992
He would have given
me, if I had been here.

1010
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,364
The rogue has changed
his colour so fast.

1011
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:34,335
You called him henpecked at first.

1012
01:26:34,472 --> 01:26:36,940
Yes, I said. So? - Hey.
You are no less. - Meaning?

1013
01:26:37,008 --> 01:26:38,999
Leave it. Everyone knows
who rules your house.

1014
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:43,012
Yes, you take the pistol. As it
is, Munira is equal to 50 bullets.

1015
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:45,947
You. ldiot.
- Leave it.

1016
01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:56,651
There was only one bullet.

1017
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,492
Father.
- Don't be scared. Nothing has happened.

1018
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:06,434
Come. Come here.

1019
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:17,137
Shut up. Shut up..
- Police..

1020
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,182
What is he saying?
- He says he will manage the police.

1021
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,217
Then let him go.
- Have you gone mad?

1022
01:27:21,419 --> 01:27:23,387
They won't be able to make
him say anything. Let him go.

1023
01:27:23,555 --> 01:27:26,422
Okay, go. Distract
the police. Be careful.

1024
01:27:26,591 --> 01:27:27,649
Come, let's move from here. Come.

1025
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,584
Come, let's go. Come fast.

1026
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:48,502
Hanif, I can't leave Goga behind.

1027
01:27:48,713 --> 01:27:51,682
Come. He will look after himself. Come.
- No, you go.

1028
01:27:51,983 --> 01:27:52,972
I. Run. Run.

1029
01:27:57,755 --> 01:28:01,691
Come here. Come here. Yes

1030
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,595
Where did the sound of firing come from?

1031
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:10,799
He is dumb, but he can hear.

1032
01:28:10,969 --> 01:28:12,368
Where did the sound of firing come from?

1033
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:14,631
Sir, leave it. I will
ask him. I will ask him.

1034
01:28:14,806 --> 01:28:16,671
Where did the sound of firing come from?

1035
01:28:16,741 --> 01:28:18,766
From there?

1036
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:20,099
No, I can't go leaving him.

1037
01:28:20,311 --> 01:28:23,644
From here?
- No, he is a child.

1038
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,818
What? Yes! Yes, that is it.

1039
01:28:26,818 --> 01:28:28,683
Not a bomb explosion, but
the firing of the bullet.

1040
01:28:30,755 --> 01:28:33,349
Why are you looking down? Look up. Fool.

1041
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:35,656
Hanif, run away with the child. Go.

1042
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:39,819
Sir! Sir!
- There is someone.

1043
01:28:39,998 --> 01:28:41,590
Sir, let him go. He is my brother.

1044
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:43,065
He hasn't done anything.
- He is your brother.

1045
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:45,192
Both of you together are..

1046
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:48,294
Wait, idiots.

1047
01:28:56,347 --> 01:28:57,439
Hey you, wait.

1048
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:01,018
I say, just stop.

1049
01:29:42,427 --> 01:29:44,827
Hide here. I'll come to fetch you.

1050
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,140
Who was he?

1051
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,709
He was a Muslim.

1052
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,088
Which side did he go?
- This way.

1053
01:33:15,473 --> 01:33:18,442
There is still time. Why
did you wake up so soon?

1054
01:33:24,382 --> 01:33:26,350
What happened? What happened?

1055
01:33:30,321 --> 01:33:33,347
I just realised something.
- What?

1056
01:33:34,759 --> 01:33:39,560
Every single box in this
house is packed with my fears.

1057
01:33:42,133 --> 01:33:43,293
So, what's the point of moving?

1058
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:48,360
What do you mean?

1059
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:57,106
When you said that I'm
Sameer Arshad Sheikh..

1060
01:33:59,483 --> 01:34:04,443
And this isn't going to
change anywhere. Anywhere.

1061
01:34:10,428 --> 01:34:12,328
But what if we are
scared again tomorrow?

1062
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:23,206
Maybe. But this is our house.
So, just forget the rest.

1063
01:34:31,649 --> 01:34:33,583
Sorry for the delayed response.

1064
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:56,762
Aarti.

1065
01:34:59,644 --> 01:35:00,668
Where did she disappear?

1066
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,255
Aarti.

1067
01:37:41,038 --> 01:37:42,005
Will you play?
