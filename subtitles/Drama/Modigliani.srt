1
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,568
Do you know what love is?

2
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:24,296
Real love?

3
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:31,236
Have you ever loved so deeply...

4
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:36,008
that you have condemned
yourself to eternity in hell?

5
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,984
I have.

6
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,062
59 seconds.

7
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,074
Dinner for me.

8
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,178
Mr. Picasso,
you haven't signed it.

9
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,419
I said I'm buying dinner,
not the restaurant.

10
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,629
Pablo, have you seen?

11
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,604
Competition, us?
We are all geniuses.

12
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:44,939
If Picasso doesn't enter,
I, Diego Rivera, I win it again.

13
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,604
- Maybe.
- I thought he was dead.

14
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,243
Jeanne...

15
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,280
What in God's name you think
you are doing?

16
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:26,249
He needs to see his daughter.

17
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:29,582
No one should see that
bastard Jew child.

18
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:33,022
You'll come home now. And,
if you don't obey this moment...

19
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,495
you'll leave me no alternative.

20
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:40,626
You can't let my baby
live away from me.

21
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:44,534
You are my daughter.
I can do anything.

22
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,808
I think we should try.

23
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,407
All right.

24
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,748
Stake.
Rare.

25
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,330
Good evening, everyone.

26
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,309
Good evening.

27
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:26,902
Tonight, I walked
across the bridge.

28
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:30,274
But there was
no bridge there.

29
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:34,484
I carried a bag
full of love...

30
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:38,448
but no one to share it with.

31
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,356
And then...

32
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,430
I thought of you.
All of you.

33
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,927
Love!

34
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,408
We don't have to look
any further.

35
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:58,743
The future of art
is in a woman's face.

36
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,415
Beautiful.

37
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,985
Pablo Picasso!

38
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:09,450
Tell me, Pablo,
how do you make love to a cube?

39
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:43,150
Hello, Pablo.

40
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,160
Did you miss me?

41
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,611
Thank you.

42
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:12,943
- Good work.
- Why do you hate me so much?

43
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,485
I love you, Pablo.
It's myself I hate.

44
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,021
Good night.

45
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,498
Music.

46
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:34,574
What do you think of him?

47
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,572
A God.

48
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,889
How do we do?

49
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:57,931
Sooner or later somebody
will catch on.

50
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,302
Get out of that, Modigliani.
You need sun.

51
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:03,700
And let you starve?

52
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,898
I don't think I could have
that on my conscience.

53
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,907
Good night.

54
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,802
- Modi, what do I do?
- Save it for Beatrice.

55
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:37,504
- You can't change destiny.
- What destiny?

56
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:41,706
Hers.
To be with him.

57
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,460
Stay here.

58
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,167
Come here.

59
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:27,485
This dog is stupid.

60
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,749
Wait, wait.

61
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,185
Here.

62
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,685
Come here.

63
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:38,093
Here it is.

64
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,166
It's all right.

65
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:41,892
Come here.

66
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,630
Come here.

67
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:52,031
Jeanne...

68
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,038
How do you know my name?

69
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:59,340
I had to.
I am...

70
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:03,213
Modigliani. I know who you are.
We all know who you are.

71
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:06,145
Even the dog knew
who you were.

72
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,513
Come, I wanna see you
in the rain.

73
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:11,886
Don't be afraid.

74
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:17,297
I love the rain.
I love what it says.

75
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:20,798
How interesting.
Now the rain speaks.

76
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:23,199
- Yes.
- What does it say?

77
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,667
Says you need a hat.

78
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,968
Thank you.

79
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:32,769
First you have to show me
your drawing.

80
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,441
- I'm not an artist.
- You let me tell you that.

81
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:41,680
No drawing,
no hat.

82
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:47,822
- Okay. The hat first.
- Hat first.

83
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:15,846
This is how you see me?

84
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:19,019
That's how everybody
see Modigliani.

85
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,423
I'm sorry.

86
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,066
Call me Modi.

87
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,634
Okay, Modi.

88
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:43,414
Now I'll paint you. You come
see me and I'll paint you.

89
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:46,912
- Lf I'm lucky one day...
- What?

90
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,150
I'll paint your eyes.

91
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:57,626
With your reputation?
You think I'm crazy?

92
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:25,082
What do you think?

93
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:29,588
Where are my eyes?

94
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,601
Too far away,
I couldn't see them.

95
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:04,762
When I know your soul,
I'll paint your eyes.

96
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,491
Look at daddy's work.

97
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,388
You're very late, monsieur.
Everybody's waiting for you.

98
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,595
Excuse me.

99
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,860
Beautiful.

100
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:49,001
You have beautiful bones.
I could paint you.

101
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,373
Ten Francs.
Talk to Martinez.

102
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,637
The one and only, Martinez.

103
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,085
You keep them waiting.
It's not fair.

104
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:06,716
They've got a lot of money
and no taste.

105
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,428
I'm a buyer.

106
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:12,031
Even though you've kept me waiting,
I think your paintings are...

107
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,529
interesting.

108
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:18,963
Interesting?

109
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,635
He's got galleries
in New York, Modi.

110
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,108
Really?

111
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:33,783
Biggest galleries in New York?
Interesting.

112
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,150
That's funny.

113
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:38,692
Like you said, they've got money
but no taste.

114
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,185
Very funny.

115
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:57,837
Modigliani,
how dare you embarrass me?

116
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,814
Where are you going?

117
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:12,985
Go back to your sheep.

118
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,725
If you walk away,
don't come back.

119
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:19,062
Farewell, Martinez.

120
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,302
Search the house.

121
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:42,006
It is here stated
that the Modigliani family...

122
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:46,779
in fare taxes, owes to
the Italian Republic.

123
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:50,650
It's therefore stated that
the Modigliani family...

124
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,919
shall be relieved of all properties,
household or other items...

125
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:58,293
that can be sold for the purpose
of the Italian Republic.

126
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:01,334
Ancient law of Italy states...

127
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:07,270
whatever a pregnant woman has
in the bed, she can keep.

128
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:10,368
We claim this right.

129
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:15,141
- Jews were never fool.
- Son of a bitch.

130
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:19,948
Are you not going to write down
everything we have on the bed?

131
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:22,487
Don't worry.
I intend to do so.

132
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,089
Five chairs...

133
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:27,292
two chandeliers...

134
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,761
two tables...

135
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,924
three blankets

136
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:38,170
four paintings...

137
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:41,737
one large mirror...

138
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:46,069
one base...

139
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,980
two carpets...

140
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:54,210
two holds...

141
00:18:56,724 --> 00:18:58,624
a sewing machine...

142
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,530
Mama...

143
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,063
papa...

144
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,269
grandpa...

145
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,858
Amen.

146
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,917
Help me, father.
What have I done wrong?

147
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:08,521
I fell in love.
Is that a sin?

148
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:11,164
No, my dear.

149
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,098
The sin would be
to never have loved at all.

150
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,466
I don't know what to do.

151
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:22,074
I don't know what I want.

152
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:25,205
I miss him.

153
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,507
I miss him.

154
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,343
I can't lose him.

155
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:34,116
Why does one man
hate another...

156
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,284
just because of his faith?

157
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,052
The church doesn't hate Modi,
does it, Father?

158
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:43,128
The church is not
the enemy here.

159
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:47,462
Your faith is not the enemy.

160
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:51,697
You must be strong
for you and for the baby.

161
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,608
It is for the best.
You'll see, my dear.

162
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:09,087
The world is a cruel place
for a child who has a stigma.

163
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,474
Stop.
Stop, look at me.

164
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:32,741
You stupid girl.

165
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,815
You are a child. You do not know
what you are doing.

166
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,579
And do you? Do you know
what you're doing, papa?

167
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:43,285
Remember what you did?
Remember?

168
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:20,849
Poor bastards. They don't even
know what they'll fight for.

169
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:23,862
They're not supposed to.

170
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:34,030
Stop the car.

171
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:38,872
Modigliani!

172
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:49,122
You do not walk out on me.
I walk out on you.

173
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:52,415
For the damage.
Buy everyone a drink.

174
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,354
But not for you.
I stopped that.

175
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,194
Drive on.

176
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,597
- I think she's over there.
- It's a she?

177
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:47,239
Excuse me, monsieur. Are you
looking for Maurice Utrillo?

178
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,344
Who are you?

179
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,417
I'm a strangled chicken.

180
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:54,612
Why don't you help me?
I do.

181
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,482
I found her!

182
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:01,293
Isn't she glorious?

183
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:05,360
She's gonna win
the competition.

184
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:08,434
- You never said anything about it.
- You never asked.

185
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:10,730
- Come on, help me.
- This is meat.

186
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:14,104
Get this of my face.

187
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:18,936
Shit.

188
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,675
Good evening, ladies.

189
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,054
- I love you.
- I love you.

190
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:04,680
I love you.

191
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:11,764
- I missed you.
- Let's take care of that.

192
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:16,168
Where have you been?

193
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,238
Looking for you.

194
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:42,420
- Like that?
- That's beautiful.

195
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:23,294
Where are you going?

196
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,291
Where are you going?

197
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:30,430
What's wrong?

198
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,574
Have you looked around?

199
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:44,339
You think it's right a baby
come to a place like this?

200
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,857
Look at me.
I have nothing for you.

201
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,423
I am nothing.

202
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:58,521
I am nothing.

203
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:05,503
I can't be a father
to my own child.

204
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:09,068
I can't.

205
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:16,114
So, that's it.
You just run away.

206
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:18,274
I do best.

207
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,458
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

208
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:32,053
You're too damn selfish
to be sorry.

209
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,723
I walked away from my baby
to be with you.

210
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:36,426
You should go back.

211
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:39,003
You can be the girl you were
when I first met you.

212
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:41,232
Remember her?
Remember?

213
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:44,773
Would she put up with this?

214
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:49,646
No.

215
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:51,273
Would she put up with me?

216
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:53,419
No.

217
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:02,588
This one?

218
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,260
Why not?

219
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:07,731
I don't know which painting
you want. Point, or choose.

220
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:16,439
The Matisse.
What big guy we have to take.

221
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,943
Very well.

222
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:29,249
Jeanne, how are you?
How is Modi?

223
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:32,152
I haven't seen him.
I didn't know where he is.

224
00:29:37,797 --> 00:29:40,265
- What is the problem?
- I need your help.

225
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,834
What is it?

226
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:44,232
I want you to go to Picasso.

227
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:48,431
Ask him to hang his artwork
beside his in the new exhibition.

228
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:54,207
Yes, anything.

229
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:56,607
Zbo!

230
00:29:57,117 --> 00:30:00,018
Modi and Picasso...

231
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,482
Modi will kill me
if I do such a thing.

232
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:08,154
I'm sorry, Jeanne.
I can't.

233
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:12,355
If Modi's work hang beside Pablo's,
there's a chance of good sale.

234
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:16,663
We need money, Zbo.
Please.

235
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,469
Please!

236
00:30:18,938 --> 00:30:20,997
I love you both.

237
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:23,075
But you're better off
with your family.

238
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:27,339
At least the child would have
a better chance in life.

239
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:33,051
I am wasting my breath.

240
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:36,187
I'm always wasting
my breath.

241
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:38,550
Let's think.

242
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:50,829
I know.

243
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:57,839
It's something you could do.

244
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,645
It will be bold.

245
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,773
It's his way to say he's sorry
for the other night.

246
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:08,046
For the other night?
And the nights before that?

247
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:13,118
Let me see, one canvas
per insult.

248
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,888
- Olga, how many?
- Hundreds, Pablo.

249
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:28,465
Let me paint you, Jeanne.
I'll make you immortal.

250
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:32,271
That's just too much responsibility
for these shoulders.

251
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,751
My answer is no.

252
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,587
Wait.

253
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:06,475
Look handsome
like Modigliani?

254
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,938
There's just no comparison.

255
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:16,021
He'll hang one painting,
but there is one condition.

256
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,330
You can go now.

257
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:44,740
- You're up to something. What?
- Keep dusting.

258
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,154
Modi!

259
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,723
Modigliani!

260
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:53,189
Where is he?

261
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:57,855
Finally.

262
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,265
- Oh, shit.
- What you want with my son, bastard?

263
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:03,294
Good.

264
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:04,628
Wait.

265
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:07,271
Hold that.

266
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:09,967
You haven't sold a painting
in 6 months. Kill him.

267
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:16,244
You shoot me, you can kiss yourself
goodbye. I won't organize it.

268
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:22,512
- Stop.
- You said I could kill him.

269
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,453
Later.
Kill him later.

270
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:30,218
Come out, you coward.
Come have some wine.

271
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:49,281
Please, take this.

272
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,284
Modi, have you given thought
of the competition?

273
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:55,377
The prize gives a lot of money.

274
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:02,285
The whole Paris is dreaming
of the day.

275
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:04,260
You and Picasso
compete together.

276
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,421
Yes, me and Picasso.

277
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:10,568
You said something
about a show?

278
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:14,138
It's not much of a show.
It's more of a favor.

279
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,573
Pablo has offered to hang one of
your paintings in his exhibition.

280
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:20,772
A favor?

281
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,877
Pablo Picasso is doing
Modigliani a favor?

282
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:28,852
- What's the matter with you?
- You have to care now.

283
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,847
It is your family
with Jeanne.

284
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,392
You wanna do me a favor?

285
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:38,123
- I need money for a doctor.
- No, Modi, please.

286
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:40,665
I need money
for a doctor.

287
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,030
Promise me you'll not
drink it all away.

288
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:46,171
Okay, take your picture.

289
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,913
What if the doctor drinks?

290
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:06,587
Am I dying?

291
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:10,153
You said you had tuberculosis
as a child.

292
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,792
But I feel much better now.

293
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,533
It never left you.

294
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:20,432
You can dress now.

295
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:24,877
Your lungs are working with
less than half their capacity.

296
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:29,609
If you continue to use
drugs and alcohol...

297
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,249
you will not live
past this year.

298
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:35,243
This medicine will help
your cough.

299
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,198
- Maybe you shouldn't go there.
- Fuck them.

300
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,733
Put on some horns.
Come on.

301
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:11,014
- Why are you so nervous?
- Nothing.

302
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:15,710
- What did the doctor say?
- She said I should find a new agent.

303
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,153
Good.

304
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:20,451
Let's get out of here.
I'm fed up with them.

305
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:26,922
- There he is.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

306
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,601
Modi, what do you have
to say for yourself?

307
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:33,762
- Hello, Gertrude.
- Don't Gertrude me.

308
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,001
Four days I've waited.
For days!

309
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:41,203
Am I not good enough to paint?
Not pretty enough perhaps?

310
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:46,311
These eyes are not so good to paint
something so sophisticated.

311
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:51,088
Bold.
Horse shit!

312
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:54,560
Tomorrow morning, my apartment,
ten o'clock sharp.

313
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,321
Sharp, you hear me?

314
00:37:56,462 --> 00:37:59,431
Do not worry. I promise you.
He will be there.

315
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:01,827
Ladies and gentlemen...

316
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:04,868
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention please?

317
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:11,601
Welcome to the 10th exhibition
of work of the artist Picasso.

318
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:14,076
And Modigliani, asshole!

319
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:17,273
And the distinct works
of Modigliani.

320
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:30,154
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Picasso...

321
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:33,826
to work your progress.

322
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:41,971
Oh, no.

323
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:19,495
Modi, wait.

324
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:21,363
Wait!

325
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,838
I did it for you.
To help you.

326
00:40:27,046 --> 00:40:31,642
- I don't need that kind of help.
- Fine. Do it for your baby.

327
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:37,789
You know what she needs?
She needs you.

328
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:40,124
Yes, she needs you.

329
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,761
Yes, it's papa.

330
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:52,166
- He should go.
- Why?

331
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:55,331
Your father will be home soon.
He can't be here.

332
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:57,204
Can I come with him?

333
00:40:57,376 --> 00:41:03,372
Then what? Let him
abuse you again? Destroy you?

334
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:07,282
I don't wanna hear.
I don't wanna hear that.

335
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,580
Modi, let's go.

336
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,691
I told him.

337
00:41:23,836 --> 00:41:28,569
I warned you. If you choose
to be with that Jew...

338
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:33,844
I would have no alternative but
to inform the authorities...

339
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:36,210
that you are an unfit mother.

340
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:42,243
After which, they'll take your child
and you'll never see her again.

341
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,759
See how beautiful she is?

342
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,739
Look at her.
Look at her.

343
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:28,731
Granpapa...

344
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,247
I'll be watching you.

345
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:46,537
Hello, Madame Stein.

346
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:48,645
So?

347
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:50,547
What?

348
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:52,741
Jeanne, you dummy.

349
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:55,786
That was a clever stroke
she played there last night.

350
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:57,985
Right girl, that one.

351
00:43:58,357 --> 00:44:01,155
So, did you kiss
and make out?

352
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:08,927
She's better off without me.

353
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:13,269
My abandoned ass!

354
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:22,105
- Do you want some advice?
- Do I have a choice?

355
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:25,715
Oh, no.
Enter the competition.

356
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:29,712
I bet the minute you do,
Pablo will too.

357
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,820
Never.
He's too proud.

358
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:38,593
Plus, he doesn't need the money.

359
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:44,529
Maybe.
But you do.

360
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:49,935
You're right.

361
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:00,818
- With or without?
- What?

362
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:03,113
The cream on your mouth.

363
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:07,456
Let's go.

364
00:45:13,265 --> 00:45:15,130
Give me one good reason why.

365
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:19,135
Rivera, Kisling, Utrillo,
Soutine...

366
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:25,368
Modigliani.
You just said the wrong name.

367
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:29,038
Olga, tell him he must compete
in the competition.

368
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:32,582
You must compete
in the competition.

369
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,849
I'm making dinner.
How was?

370
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:38,389
Straight.

371
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:42,950
Who told you he'll be there?

372
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:45,995
Gertrude.
He has a scratch.

373
00:45:46,198 --> 00:45:49,065
He needs the money badly.
He has no choice.

374
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:52,662
I don't believe her.
She lies for a living.

375
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:55,373
Please, Pablo.

376
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:58,032
It will be so much fun.

377
00:45:58,377 --> 00:46:01,210
Paris has become so tedious
since the war.

378
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,371
Let's bring back the life.

379
00:46:03,515 --> 00:46:06,916
Fine works, champagne.
All night drinking and laughing.

380
00:46:07,886 --> 00:46:10,946
Get into the ring.
Play with the bull.

381
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:16,288
I am the bull.

382
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:24,235
Fish.
Let's eat.

383
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:30,533
I love it.

384
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:06,606
Modigliani!

385
00:47:06,712 --> 00:47:08,407
Pablo!

386
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,743
How are you,
Amedeo Modigliani?

387
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:13,976
What do you call it?

388
00:47:15,654 --> 00:47:17,713
It's a great day.

389
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:22,219
Good morning, matador.

390
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:29,463
Let me ask you a question.
You have entered the competition?

391
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:33,868
Answer me!

392
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,757
Don't touch my work!

393
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:35,900
Don't touch my work!
You don't have the right.

394
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:39,299
Get your hands off of my work!

395
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:59,416
You have money?

396
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:06,989
I can make you very happy
if you have money.

397
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,931
I have nothing.

398
00:49:12,237 --> 00:49:14,205
Run!

399
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,343
Police!

400
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,827
Are you okay, Modi?

401
00:49:46,605 --> 00:49:48,596
Who paid the fine?

402
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:50,808
Who paid the fine?

403
00:49:50,943 --> 00:49:53,503
We don't know. Whoever it was
didn't want to say.

404
00:49:53,645 --> 00:49:55,010
Find out.

405
00:49:55,113 --> 00:49:58,048
If I find out who it was, I'd first
try to sell him your paintings.

406
00:49:58,283 --> 00:50:00,342
Then I will thank you.

407
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:07,380
What?

408
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:11,290
It's Utrillo.

409
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:16,058
- What?
- He's back in the asylum.

410
00:50:16,335 --> 00:50:19,202
His mother told the police
and they put him away.

411
00:50:19,438 --> 00:50:22,839
Modi, this is a sign from God
that things must change.

412
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:25,535
Where was God when Utrillo
needed Him?

413
00:50:37,856 --> 00:50:41,485
You've got here too late.
Should have seen this morning.

414
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:45,022
Your father visited the child's
welfare this morning.

415
00:50:46,531 --> 00:50:49,523
He's recommended they take
custody of the baby.

416
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:55,066
Did you hear me?

417
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:59,136
- You're going to lose your child.
- I have no choice!

418
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:03,007
- Your child.
- I have no choice!

419
00:51:03,215 --> 00:51:07,584
You could choose your baby.

420
00:51:08,654 --> 00:51:10,952
He's dying.

421
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:15,022
You're dying with him.

422
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:12,643
Maurice, it's me, Modi.

423
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:16,981
It's me.

424
00:52:33,405 --> 00:52:35,703
It's okay.

425
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:51,280
Everything will be fine.
I'll get you out of here.

426
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:57,759
It's an old dream.
You know this is my life.

427
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:00,796
She won't be sorry for me.
She'll be happy.

428
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:04,095
You mad bastard.

429
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:12,410
A little haxixe?

430
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:39,832
- Promise me.
- Promise you what?

431
00:53:40,272 --> 00:53:42,433
That you won't let me die here.

432
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:46,978
I've seen what they do
with buddies around here.

433
00:53:48,647 --> 00:53:52,139
I don't want that.
Promise me.

434
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:55,018
I don't know.

435
00:53:56,588 --> 00:54:00,718
I promise.

436
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:05,018
- I'm cold.
- It's okay. I got you.

437
00:54:05,163 --> 00:54:07,154
I wish I could hug you.

438
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:09,496
I'm so cold.

439
00:54:52,277 --> 00:54:56,646
Welcome.
I'm overwhelmed.

440
00:54:57,649 --> 00:55:02,450
- Jeanne, you look great.
- You look gorgeous.

441
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:07,017
I love your shoes.

442
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:09,552
- Enjoy the party.
- Thank you.

443
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:14,596
- You should thank Picasso.
- For what?

444
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:17,860
For letting you out.

445
00:55:22,974 --> 00:55:24,703
Modi!

446
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:28,411
What a nice vision!

447
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:31,005
Dance?

448
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:35,711
- Modi.
- Thank you.

449
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:37,582
Pablo is over there.

450
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:51,996
- The famous Picasso.
- Matador.

451
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:01,037
I didn't ask you to bail me out.

452
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:03,773
You want to pay me back?
Let's see.

453
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:10,845
Why don't you come tomorrow? We'll
go to a trip to the countryside.

454
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:13,451
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

455
00:56:13,592 --> 00:56:17,528
- Only if Olga comes.
- You really like my wife?

456
00:56:18,863 --> 00:56:22,128
Everybody really likes your wife.

457
00:56:29,674 --> 00:56:32,404
Tonight is a night
for dancing.

458
00:56:32,544 --> 00:56:34,705
When a samurai
gets his sword...

459
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:37,141
he must draw blood.

460
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,085
Who lives here?

461
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:00,625
You'll see.

462
00:58:33,732 --> 00:58:37,896
- Renoir.
- Come meet God.

463
00:59:15,273 --> 00:59:17,400
This man looks mad.

464
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:23,876
Are you mad?

465
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:34,749
They scare you.
Deformity.

466
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:39,028
The genius sucked out
through the fingernails.

467
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:42,760
They don't bother me.

468
00:59:43,735 --> 00:59:48,900
Liar.
He's a liar, Pablo?

469
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:56,803
May I ask you, how much
a place like this cost?

470
00:59:57,048 --> 01:00:00,017
Two paintings.
Small.

471
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:05,748
I have two cars in the stables.
A scratch for each.

472
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:09,753
And this Rodin.

473
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:14,955
I gave one little pencil drawing
of a flowerpot.

474
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,427
No flower.
Just a pot.

475
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,271
You into sell?

476
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:29,143
Modigliani is on the verge.

477
01:00:30,748 --> 01:00:34,240
On the verge.
Let's say no.

478
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:36,419
"Le précipice. "
The cliff.

479
01:00:37,088 --> 01:00:44,358
Where all artists converge
and jump to their fate.

480
01:00:52,036 --> 01:00:59,841
Nudes mostly, occasional
portraits, drink...

481
01:01:00,545 --> 01:01:02,945
- Yes?
- Yes.

482
01:01:03,948 --> 01:01:08,749
- How did you know?
- Pablo told me.

483
01:01:11,689 --> 01:01:15,056
I've never liked
painting nudes myself.

484
01:01:15,894 --> 01:01:19,625
Most of the women in my time
were too fat.

485
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:24,565
And ugly.
Very ugly.

486
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:30,473
I like them tall and slim.

487
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:35,103
So, it's late.
We should go.

488
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:49,827
Amedeo Modigliani...

489
01:01:51,996 --> 01:01:54,760
are you mad?

490
01:02:08,046 --> 01:02:10,207
I knew that.

491
01:02:19,057 --> 01:02:20,922
You'll enter the competition?

492
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:24,626
Will you?

493
01:02:26,831 --> 01:02:29,061
You see what painting
can bring?

494
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:32,970
Comfort, wealth, security.

495
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:37,769
Only a fool starts to starve.
Paris is trying them.

496
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:44,305
So paint, make money, get old,
fuck as many women as you can...

497
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:48,074
but drink with moderation.

498
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:53,988
The gospel according to Picasso.

499
01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:05,293
You can't fight me now.

500
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:10,197
So let me ask you,
are you mocking me?

501
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:15,744
I try.

502
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:19,846
Sometimes I don't succeed.
Sometimes...

503
01:03:20,585 --> 01:03:25,420
You see, Modi, there is a difference
between you and me...

504
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:28,958
success.

505
01:03:29,127 --> 01:03:31,254
It is.

506
01:03:46,544 --> 01:03:49,741
I am Picasso,
the famous Picasso.

507
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:51,974
This is my car.
I am the driver.

508
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:55,551
These are my dreams.
I bought them from God.

509
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:58,016
You like my hat?

510
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:03,754
I am Modigliani,
the crazy Italian fuck.

511
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:11,365
Sit down, Matador.
You're scaring the peasants.

512
01:04:29,454 --> 01:04:33,720
Her neck is not so long.
She has her father's neck. Short.

513
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:38,028
- Yes...
- I like...

514
01:04:38,162 --> 01:04:39,754
Excuse me.

515
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:42,365
- Not so long.
- Okay, I know.

516
01:04:43,134 --> 01:04:46,797
Go back. Out of my way.
Thank you.

517
01:04:56,581 --> 01:04:59,277
- Don't touch my painting.
- You're ruining it because...

518
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:01,783
I'm the painter.
You're ruining the painting.

519
01:05:01,953 --> 01:05:05,354
It's very wide.
Of course you're the painter.

520
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:13,325
You paint it.

521
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:22,788
You like it?
It's for you.

522
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,991
I'm not paying for this.

523
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:06,744
To Livorno.

524
01:06:48,902 --> 01:06:53,359
You promised you
wouldn't let me die here.

525
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,412
Maurice, you're safe.

526
01:08:51,123 --> 01:08:54,715
Get away from him!
All of you, get out!

527
01:08:54,892 --> 01:08:56,222
Get out!

528
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,890
Get out!

529
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:03,151
Want him to become what you've
become? You think it's romantic?

530
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:07,187
It's how it should be?
Get out!

531
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:14,662
Have some water.

532
01:09:30,907 --> 01:09:32,635
How do you feel?

533
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:35,140
I don't know.

534
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,242
They said I shouldn't leave you.

535
01:09:40,978 --> 01:09:45,309
So I won't.

536
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,444
Never again.

537
01:09:55,318 --> 01:10:02,083
- The rain speaks.
- Really? What does it say?

538
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:11,554
It says, "Don't cry,
my love.

539
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:16,391
Modi is here. "

540
01:10:40,805 --> 01:10:45,068
- How do you feel?
- Alive.

541
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,370
You should thank Zbo.

542
01:10:50,509 --> 01:10:52,372
He gave us the money
to come here.

543
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:57,602
If he'd only sold my work
he could come here more often.

544
01:10:59,313 --> 01:11:01,779
Well, I'm trying.

545
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:06,373
That was the most beautiful meal.
Thank you. Great stuff.

546
01:11:07,717 --> 01:11:10,240
So, tell us, what else
is happening is Paris?

547
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:14,241
Nothing new.
The same as before.

548
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:17,751
Just watching everyone get ready
for the competition.

549
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:24,556
- Well, Modi...
- No.

550
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,391
I'm going to rest.
I'm tired.

551
01:11:33,795 --> 01:11:37,421
- Remember: No drink.
- No drink.

552
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:47,728
- I love you.
- I love you.

553
01:11:49,735 --> 01:11:52,031
Good night.
See you later.

554
01:11:55,371 --> 01:12:01,067
- May I see your work?
- What for? You never sell anything.

555
01:12:02,274 --> 01:12:04,103
Beautiful.

556
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,070
A poetry.

557
01:12:07,242 --> 01:12:12,006
Modi, prepare yourself. We're gonna
need all of this in Paris...

558
01:12:12,278 --> 01:12:15,712
for your one-man show.

559
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:20,111
You heard me right.

560
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:24,048
Bertha Veil loved the nudes
so much...

561
01:12:24,184 --> 01:12:27,709
she wants to hang
everything you have.

562
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:35,419
Did you hear me?

563
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:42,458
Bertha Veil is giving you your
very own one-man show.

564
01:13:26,378 --> 01:13:28,435
Bravo, Modigliani!

565
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:31,236
They're exquisite.

566
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:36,405
Jeanne, great Jeanne.

567
01:13:36,615 --> 01:13:39,548
Mrs. Veil,
you're the organizer?

568
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:42,549
You know I am.
You live just across the street.

569
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:45,708
You shall remove a painting
from your gallery window.

570
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:48,319
I will do not.

571
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:56,320
Como back with this tomorrow.

572
01:13:56,457 --> 01:13:58,286
If you don't remove
the paintings...

573
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,324
my men will do it for you.

574
01:14:00,393 --> 01:14:02,087
And we'll close down the show.

575
01:14:02,193 --> 01:14:03,988
This is outrageous.

576
01:14:04,094 --> 01:14:07,959
Are they pictures of your mother,
your sister?

577
01:14:10,997 --> 01:14:12,895
Do as he says.

578
01:14:13,832 --> 01:14:15,423
Do as he says.

579
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:23,335
Why, Modi?

580
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,800
I'm impressed.

581
01:14:35,308 --> 01:14:38,900
By the way, I hope
you won't be offended...

582
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:41,542
the painting you gave me
as a gift...

583
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:44,144
the one Jeanne brought me...

584
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:48,007
the other night I was
inspired by something...

585
01:14:48,181 --> 01:14:52,308
a felt hat.
Yes, a felt hat.

586
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:57,911
I didn't have a canvas.
It was 4 in the morning.

587
01:14:58,052 --> 01:15:00,177
Make your point, Spanish.

588
01:15:01,787 --> 01:15:04,379
I used your painting.

589
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:15,087
Do you forgive me?

590
01:15:30,933 --> 01:15:33,195
Let's go.

591
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:43,634
I think I like
the new Modigliani.

592
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:46,234
Yes, I think I do.

593
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,502
Let's look around.

594
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,209
I'm tired.

595
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:08,178
I'm not.

596
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:11,339
That's because
you're not pregnant.

597
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:20,451
- So.
- Go, go.

598
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:23,418
- See you later. Bye!
- Can you stop the bus, please.

599
01:16:27,024 --> 01:16:31,617
Tell me, Modigliani.
How does a blind man paint?

600
01:16:34,794 --> 01:16:36,488
You don't know.

601
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:48,326
He paints what nobody sees!
What nobody sees!

602
01:16:56,204 --> 01:16:57,192
Go!

603
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:16,737
What?

604
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:19,504
He gave your baby
to the welfare.

605
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:20,905
What?

606
01:17:21,014 --> 01:17:24,209
Your baby. Your beautiful little
girl is now in strange hands.

607
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:27,878
And all because you can't
live a normal life...

608
01:17:27,984 --> 01:17:30,280
like the rest of the world
around you.

609
01:17:36,756 --> 01:17:40,315
Get out and show your face!
Show your face!

610
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,457
You see me?
You see the Jew?

611
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:48,821
Go away or I'll call the police.

612
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,689
You'd better call the police.

613
01:18:08,603 --> 01:18:12,037
- Where is my baby?
- You get away from me.

614
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:16,967
Where is my baby?

615
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:18,935
Somewhere where
you'll never find her.

616
01:18:25,144 --> 01:18:30,669
Go on.

617
01:18:30,845 --> 01:18:32,902
Do it.
Do it.

618
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,642
No one's here.

619
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:42,043
Tomorrow you can tell the whole
world a Jew threatened your life.

620
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,315
A Jew.
Do it!

621
01:18:48,753 --> 01:18:50,219
Do it!

622
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,545
Do it!

623
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:57,755
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where is my baby?

624
01:18:57,924 --> 01:19:00,015
You...

625
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:04,684
you have neither resource
nor conditions to raise her.

626
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:24,525
Watch me.

627
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:02,210
I forgive you.

628
01:30:35,967 --> 01:30:39,264
Modi?
Hello? Have you finished yet?

629
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:43,869
Yes and I want you to take
the painting to the competition.

630
01:30:44,204 --> 01:30:48,297
What about you?
Remember it starts today.

631
01:30:48,473 --> 01:30:51,133
Don't let the painting
out of your sight.

632
01:30:51,674 --> 01:30:54,573
- Where are you?
- City Hall.

633
01:30:54,676 --> 01:30:55,767
What for?

634
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:57,898
Marriage license.
I'm going to marry Jeanne.

635
01:30:59,378 --> 01:31:02,004
Silence, uh?

636
01:31:37,495 --> 01:31:39,484
Modigliani,
marriage license.

637
01:31:39,696 --> 01:31:41,026
Yes, sit down.

638
01:31:57,504 --> 01:31:59,299
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

639
01:31:59,971 --> 01:32:01,903
Me too.

640
01:32:02,506 --> 01:32:04,097
Congratulations.

641
01:32:14,978 --> 01:32:17,103
Excuse me.

642
01:32:21,046 --> 01:32:22,478
You have children?

643
01:32:23,515 --> 01:32:25,845
I have one and one on the way.

644
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:29,878
It's important children.

645
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:32,749
Very important.

646
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,550
Go away!

647
01:32:44,857 --> 01:32:48,120
I'm crazy, you know?
I will do something.

648
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:49,757
Go away!

649
01:33:04,266 --> 01:33:05,960
Excuse me,
I'm going to the corner.

650
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:28,808
No, no. You do not touch
this painting.

651
01:33:29,011 --> 01:33:30,568
It's my painting.

652
01:33:30,745 --> 01:33:32,802
What's going on here?

653
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:37,113
It's the police.
They get the painting.

654
01:33:37,281 --> 01:33:38,770
If something happens
to this painting...

655
01:33:38,881 --> 01:33:41,370
you'll spend the rest of my life
as a eunuch.

656
01:33:41,483 --> 01:33:43,711
A eunuch!
Understood?

657
01:33:46,618 --> 01:33:48,481
Good.
Bye-bye, eunuch.

658
01:33:52,388 --> 01:33:53,752
Eunuch.

659
01:34:01,624 --> 01:34:03,215
Be careful.

660
01:34:04,393 --> 01:34:06,325
What about the others?

661
01:34:06,561 --> 01:34:09,494
- They're hanged.
- All of them?

662
01:34:10,662 --> 01:34:13,390
All of them.

663
01:34:15,498 --> 01:34:19,329
So, now we'll know.

664
01:34:23,634 --> 01:34:25,157
Monsieur?

665
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:36,871
- What time is it?
- Closing time.

666
01:34:37,007 --> 01:34:38,405
You must leave now.

667
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:43,598
Madame, I must have my
marriage license today.

668
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:47,109
- Monday, nine o'clock.
- Don't understand. I need it today.

669
01:34:47,245 --> 01:34:49,734
I need it today.

670
01:34:49,879 --> 01:34:53,142
Monsieur, we all have families.
We need to go home too.

671
01:34:53,281 --> 01:34:57,009
I have a baby coming
any day.

672
01:34:58,317 --> 01:35:01,876
And I have a beautiful daughter.
Please.

673
01:35:04,953 --> 01:35:06,976
Please.

674
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:11,482
You are a painter, aren't you?

675
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:15,820
Yes.

676
01:35:16,558 --> 01:35:20,117
- Me too.
- I can see that.

677
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,786
Very well...

678
01:35:26,863 --> 01:35:30,762
- sign here.
- Thank you, ma'am.

679
01:35:51,073 --> 01:35:53,039
What's wrong with it?

680
01:35:53,207 --> 01:35:56,368
The color.
Flash with my painting.

681
01:37:16,645 --> 01:37:17,633
Cheers.

682
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:32,174
You will pay for the drink.

683
01:37:32,351 --> 01:37:35,977
I have five thousand Francs.
Today I buy everybody a drink.

684
01:37:55,395 --> 01:37:56,691
To Livorno.

685
01:38:29,843 --> 01:38:31,434
Cheers.

686
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:52,215
Jeanne, here!

687
01:38:57,555 --> 01:38:59,885
- Is he here?
- I thought he'd be with you.

688
01:39:00,023 --> 01:39:01,319
No, no...

689
01:39:09,027 --> 01:39:12,426
Mommy, thank you so much.

690
01:39:13,163 --> 01:39:16,289
I thought maybe she
would bring him luck.

691
01:39:16,731 --> 01:39:18,197
Thank you.

692
01:39:19,999 --> 01:39:22,727
Where is the great Modigliani?

693
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:34,628
The trumpets of silence.

694
01:39:34,872 --> 01:39:37,361
Ships of peace
make me sleep.

695
01:39:37,506 --> 01:39:39,699
The cradle swings
when the morning comes.

696
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:43,030
I wrote that myself when
I was alone in the night.

697
01:39:43,209 --> 01:39:46,506
But no longer.

698
01:39:47,944 --> 01:39:50,604
Today is the prove
that I'm a rich man.

699
01:39:50,746 --> 01:39:52,609
Rich beyond belief.

700
01:40:24,694 --> 01:40:28,354
Ladies and gentlemen, attention.
It's time.

701
01:40:32,664 --> 01:40:36,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Soutine.

702
01:40:48,537 --> 01:40:50,799
Diego Rivera.

703
01:40:51,773 --> 01:40:53,830
"Mexico".

704
01:41:13,749 --> 01:41:16,545
Kisling.
"Fear".

705
01:41:28,922 --> 01:41:32,014
Utrillo.
"Madness".

706
01:41:50,032 --> 01:41:52,362
Picasso.
Title...

707
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,225
"Modigliani".

708
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:43,477
And finally,
I give you Modigliani.

709
01:42:44,322 --> 01:42:49,222
Title: "Jeanne".

710
01:42:59,229 --> 01:43:03,322
When I know your soul,
I'll paint your eyes.

711
01:46:14,249 --> 01:46:15,909
Don't worry.

712
01:46:16,517 --> 01:46:18,177
My hands...

713
01:46:19,684 --> 01:46:21,582
my hands.

714
01:46:24,419 --> 01:46:25,817
You'll be okay.

715
01:46:33,824 --> 01:46:35,949
Jeanne...

716
01:46:36,892 --> 01:46:41,622
It's okay.
Sleep, dear. Sleep.

717
01:46:46,329 --> 01:46:51,161
In my pocket.

718
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:05,801
I wanted to surprise you.

719
01:47:09,273 --> 01:47:14,105
I'll always be your wife.

720
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:16,197
Modi!

721
01:47:16,409 --> 01:47:18,967
It's us!

722
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:20,839
I can't see nothing.

723
01:47:26,181 --> 01:47:29,342
- In the name of God!
- What happened?

724
01:47:29,448 --> 01:47:31,744
Get away from him.

725
01:47:31,883 --> 01:47:33,611
He needs a doctor.

726
01:47:45,255 --> 01:47:47,949
Don't take him from me.

727
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:54,119
Don't take him!

728
01:47:57,227 --> 01:48:00,023
Don't take him from me!

729
01:48:00,662 --> 01:48:03,686
Don't take him from me!

730
01:48:05,464 --> 01:48:12,024
Don't take him from me!
Please.

731
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:24,804
Watch his head.

732
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,602
Modi, stay with us.

733
01:48:30,809 --> 01:48:32,275
Oh, my God.

734
01:49:15,162 --> 01:49:16,492
Excuse us.

735
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:53,974
Jeanne...

736
01:49:57,047 --> 01:50:00,980
Always and forever.

737
01:50:04,416 --> 01:50:06,507
I'm here.

738
01:50:07,752 --> 01:50:10,344
I'm here.

739
01:50:55,706 --> 01:50:57,934
It's time to end this madness.

740
01:51:40,092 --> 01:51:45,254
Wait for me, my love.
Wait for me.

741
01:52:31,882 --> 01:52:33,610
Wait...

742
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:40,441
Jeanne...

743
01:53:43,413 --> 01:53:46,676
I offer my
deepest sympathies.

744
01:53:47,315 --> 01:53:50,680
I can't imagine
how you feel.

745
01:53:52,918 --> 01:53:55,180
You know what I feel?

746
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:00,945
Pablo, shall I tell you?

747
01:54:05,423 --> 01:54:08,913
I feel nothing.

748
01:54:11,993 --> 01:54:14,960
I have a baby in my belly...

749
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:20,253
another heart beating...

750
01:54:21,931 --> 01:54:24,989
another soul craving...

751
01:54:27,333 --> 01:54:31,699
and I'm empty,
like your glass.

752
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:40,029
You'll go home.

753
01:54:42,339 --> 01:54:47,773
You'll always live a full
and rich life.

754
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:54,944
But I swear to God...
when your time comes...

755
01:54:57,346 --> 01:55:00,745
when you leave
at your death bed...

756
01:55:04,416 --> 01:55:08,008
the name Modigliani...

757
01:55:08,718 --> 01:55:11,241
will not be far
from your lips.

758
01:55:20,189 --> 01:55:23,588
You can never paint
over this night.

759
01:55:23,724 --> 01:55:25,486
It belongs to him.

760
01:55:48,302 --> 01:55:55,204
I saw him dance once
by the statue of Balzac.

761
01:55:56,773 --> 01:56:03,174
So beautiful his face,
so graceful his dance...

762
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:09,206
as he swang to the song,
he smiled...

763
01:56:10,412 --> 01:56:15,869
He was all the things
I was once.

764
01:56:17,448 --> 01:56:23,542
So, I stole that moment,
and locked it away in my mind...

765
01:56:23,985 --> 01:56:30,284
to be there, to comfort me
in my empty days.

766
01:56:31,821 --> 01:56:35,118
Auguste Renoir.

767
01:56:52,497 --> 01:56:56,931
Papa sends you all the love
of the world.

768
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:06,564
When you grow up, you'll feel
our love wherever you go.

769
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:39,714
I want you to know...

770
01:57:41,453 --> 01:57:43,282
and try to understand...

771
01:57:45,221 --> 01:57:47,278
try to forgive me.

772
01:57:57,274 --> 01:58:00,072
