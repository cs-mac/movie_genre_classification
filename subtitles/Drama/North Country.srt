1
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,060
- Lady, you sit in your nice house
- Karen.

2
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,370
clean floors, your bottled water,
your flowers on Valentine's Day

3
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,680
and you think you're tough?

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,360
Wear my shoes. Tell me tough.

5
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,500
Work a day in the pit, tell me tough.

6
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,190
I'm sure we're all
sufficiently impressed, Mrs. Aimes.

7
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,700
There is no "Mrs. " here.

8
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,500
- No. I didn't go to the police.
- What did you do?

9
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,560
What I had to.

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,851
Karen, stop crying.
Sammy, let's go!

11
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,450
It's just gonna
piss him off some more.

12
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,750
Look at my face.

13
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,520
Don't toss shoulders at me!
Sammy, goddamn it!

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,060
It's okay, it's okay. Okay, come on.

15
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,720
Come on, come on. You can do it, baby.

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,690
There you go. Good girl.

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,760
Who's a good girl, huh?

18
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,110
We're not coming back, right?

19
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,030
Come on.

20
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,820
Hey, Mom.

21
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,350
- Oh, dear God.
- I'm fine, I'm okay.

22
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,790
Say hi to your grandkids.

23
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,630
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Look at you beauties.

24
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,340
Hi, Grandma.

25
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,550
You working nights?

26
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
So

27
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,150
he catch you with another man?

28
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,870
Is that why he laid hands on you?

29
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,340
You're really asking me that?

30
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,880
This wasn't the first time
you'd disappointed your father, was it?

31
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,830
Wasn't the first time
he disappointed me elther.

32
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,740
How old were you
when you had your first child?

33
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,530
Here you go.

34
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,310
Bobby Sharp!
I'm gonna beat you good.

35
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,780
Come on, you wanna blow out of here?

36
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,780
Who is Sammy's father?

37
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,630
I don't know who Sammy's father is.

38
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,240
Is that because you've had
so many sexual partners?

39
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,260
The body of Christ.

40
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,280
The body of Christ.

41
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,580
The body of Christ.

42
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,590
Always was a beauty, your girl.

43
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,130
Boys, cut it out!

44
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,950
Poor Alice. That girl has been nothing
but trouble for her since day one.

45
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,570
Got two kids with two
different fathers already.

46
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,570
- Heck of a shame.
- Those kids are just

47
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,100
gobbling up my crispy bars.

48
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,800
Nobody makes them better.

49
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,240
I don't know what you put in those
things, but it just can't be legal.

50
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:18,900
Oh, yeah. Everybody seems to like them.

51
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,000
Probably on a bender
when he did it.

52
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,510
What I figured.

53
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,579
So you take him out to the shed,
give him a talking to.

54
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,691
They'll work it out.

55
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,290
I mean, Beth left me a dozen times
before we worked out the kinks.

56
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,830
Did she?

57
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,000
How did you first hear that Pearson
Taconite and Steel was hiring women?

58
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,820
- Wanna lean back there?
- Okay.

59
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,280
Oh, my Glory?

60
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,150
Yeah?

61
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,000
No way. Josey? No way!

62
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,730
Look at you, all grown up.

63
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,310
Yeah, all grown up, washing hair.

64
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,460
And married? Who's the lucky?

65
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,460
Oh, jeez.

66
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,790
Okay. Who's the unlucky?

67
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,860
Me, I suppose.

68
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,140
You're a crap storyteller.

69
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,321
You left out the part

70
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:19,681
where you tell all his friends
he likes to wear your panties.

71
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,320
How about I tell them the truth?
Beats his wife. Bad enough, ain't it?

72
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,660
- You weren't kidding. You're good.
- So I'm back living with my folks.

73
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,740
Only now I got
two more mouths to feed.

74
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,530
The mine's hiring, you know.

75
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,410
What do you even do up there?
You a secretary?

76
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,680
No. I drive truck.

77
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,940
- You drive truck?
- Yours truly, first woman ever.

78
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,670
Now, isn't that a heck of a?

79
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,870
That's weird.

80
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,790
Money isn't weird,
I'll tell you that much.

81
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,160
Going for gold.

82
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,110
Shouldn't have put down the beer.

83
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,340
Balance. Everybody knows, can't throw
darts without a beer in the other hand.

84
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,680
Would a soda work?

85
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,890
Nope. Dart knows.

86
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,830
That's why it's never gonna be
an Olympic event.

87
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,340
They don't allow drinking.

88
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,210
Why don't we buy the girls
another round and test the theory?

89
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,010
Maybe later. Okay?

90
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,550
Jeez, Glory.

91
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,030
You come working up at the mine,
you gotta ignore that crap.

92
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,730
Who says I'm working at the mine?

93
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,810
Wouldn't you like to make the same
kind of money your dad does?

94
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,770
You wanna be a lesbian now?

95
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,990
I wanna be a lesbian.

96
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,130
How come I have to eat
if I'm not hungry?

97
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,660
Because people are starving in China.

98
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,270
People are starving right here.

99
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,210
Clean plates, both of you.

100
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,720
I haven't made a decision yet.

101
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,100
But the mine pays six times
what I'm making now.

102
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,640
Do you have any idea how many accidents
there've been since this started?

103
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,930
Somebody will be killed
because of them women.

104
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,940
I can't afford a place by washing hair.

105
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,560
So you stay here.

106
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,836
She's a grown woman with kids.

107
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:22,880
She's not gonna be living
with her folks.

108
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,070
All clear.

109
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,940
- Clear of what?
- You're not pregnant.

110
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,560
I already told you that.

111
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,670
Well, company just wants to be sure
before they hire you.

112
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,270
It's to clean yourself with.

113
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,440
You submitted to the exam willingly,
correct?

114
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,640
Yeah. I submitted.

115
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,662
Before your law firm hired you,

116
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,019
they put your feet in the air
and look around your insides?

117
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,660
- I got you.
- You got me?

118
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm gonna get you then.
I'm gonna get you then.

119
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,340
Come here, baby.

120
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,420
Hey, Jo.

121
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,530
What are you doing here, Wayne?

122
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,870
Come to bring you back home.

123
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,970
Karen. In the house.

124
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,180
- Can't talk anymore. Get in the
Come here!

125
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,320
Come by here
and think everything is okay?

126
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,890
- You know what?
- It's not okay.

127
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,320
- Get in the car!
- It's over!

128
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,960
So how about we let your
mom and dad talk in private?

129
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,730
- Get out of here!
- He's not my father.

130
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,430
He is your husband, you know.

131
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,540
He beat me, Mom.
More than once, more than lightly.

132
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,050
A man needs a job.

133
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,150
Wayne beat me because he was out
of work? That's what you're saying?

134
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm just saying,
everyone needs a purpose.

135
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,000
Your purpose is those kids.

136
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,660
Your father's is that mine.

137
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,540
And if you take a job up there

138
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,220
Well, it'll shame him.

139
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,020
You should think about that.

140
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,571
Sammy, open the glove box.

141
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,144
There's a piece of paper
on top of the pile.

142
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,770
Hold it on the dash, would you?

143
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,480
- Hey!
- Hey! Sorry about this.

144
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,120
That's what guest rooms are for.

145
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,530
Come on, honey,
I'll show you where your room is.

146
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,290
- Hiya.
- This is Kyle.

147
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,990
Hiya.

148
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,040
Wow, look at this.

149
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
All right. So all right, there's
We're doing a little work.

150
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,510
How long are they staying?

151
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,590
I don't know. Just a little while.

152
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,520
No such thing, and you know it.

153
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,490
Oh, come on.

154
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,320
She's kind of girlie to be a miner.

155
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,650
Okay, now, what are you?
Cowboy or a cowgirl?

156
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,270
- I'm a cowgirl.
- No, not up there, you're not.

157
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,640
Gotta get your cowboy on.

158
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,910
What's that?
I thought it was just your hand.

159
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,490
Yeah. That's the thing about arthritis.
It spreads like a nasty rumor.

160
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,390
You know they don't want us
up there. Right?

161
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,670
Yeah, I got that.

162
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
The mine is a shit pit.

163
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,100
Dirt everywhere. Loud as all get-out.

164
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,640
You'll be hauling, lifting

165
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,160
driving and all sorts of other things a
woman shouldn't be doing, if you ask me

166
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,960
but Supreme Court didn't ask me,
did they?

167
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,770
You must be Hank's daughter.

168
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,480
You're late. Got your paperwork?

169
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,520
Yeah. Yes, sir. I got my consent form.

170
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,710
Yeah. The doc says you look darn good
under those clothes.

171
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
Sense of humor, ladies.

172
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,640
Rule-o numero uno.

173
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,910
Okay, grab your gear
and meet me outside.

174
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,520
We're gonna take a tour.

175
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,540
- What?
- What a homo!

176
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,850
You know they do.

177
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,000
Cunts.

178
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,700
Ear protection, ladies!

179
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,260
Hank, I need a five-minute break.

180
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,410
You took a coffee break an hour ago.

181
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,740
That's the point, Hank. She's been
drinking coffee like everyone else.

182
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,550
Hey, Glory, are you talking
as a union rep

183
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,860
or just butting into anybody's
business as usual?

184
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,030
All I'm saying is that you can
whip it out anytime, Hank.

185
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,070
We gotta pull the coveralls
all the way down, you know?

186
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,870
We start peeing in our seats

187
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,920
I don't think the next shift's
gonna be too happy about it.

188
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,890
You got another load to get.
So pull them up and go get it.

189
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:54,020
This down here is taconite.
That's what pays bills.

190
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,100
We've taken to calling this area
the Powder Room.

191
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,800
Catchy, don't you think?

192
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,070
Especially since you girls
will be the ones cleaning it.

193
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,990
So. So, Arlen, which one of these girls
is gonna be my bitch?

194
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,760
Ladies, meet Bobby Sharp.

195
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,730
He runs the Powder Room,
where they're short one body.

196
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,470
And we want a nice body. No fatties.

197
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,680
Give me the one on the right.

198
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,070
Ladies.

199
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,390
Cock tease.

200
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,490
Fuck you.

201
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,920
Fuck! You don't have to eat my face.

202
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,660
It's cool.

203
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,300
Just take it easy.

204
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,020
Shit.

205
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,030
You two just bought yourselves
a Saturday in my classroom.

206
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,130
Let's go.

207
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,610
Let's go, guys.

208
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,340
At least
they spelled it right this time.

209
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,410
So how'd it go?

210
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,710
Good. Yeah.

211
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,250
Heard you were in the Powder Room
with that Bobby Sharp.

212
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,230
Weren't you two friends
in high school or something?

213
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,340
We were never friends.

214
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,890
You should get that checked out.

215
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,350
My mom's got arthritis
and she never tapes her wrist up.

216
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,620
You should look in that first.

217
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,540
Ham and cheese.

218
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,010
What were you expecting?

219
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,910
You never know in this place.

220
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,560
Come on, let's sit with the girls.

221
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,560
Meet the ladies.

222
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,100
Ladies, ladies. Josey Aimes.

223
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,610
Oh, hey. Big Betty.
Pleased to meet you.

224
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,940
- Nice to meet you.
- There used to be two Bettys.

225
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,710
- Big and Little. Little quit.
- Why?

226
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,350
Too little.

227
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,850
- I'm Peg.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

228
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,530
- Hey, you too.
- Hey.

229
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,960
- Guys.
- How you doing?

230
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,230
Hey! No getting off
in the lunchroom, ladies.

231
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,190
It won't leave the toilet seat up.
It won't fart in bed. I might marry it.

232
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,360
Right?

233
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,960
You don't mind, do you?

234
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,910
Okay, if there's nothing else,
I move to adjourn.

235
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,780
- There's one more thing.
- What's that?

236
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,010
- Porta-Johns.
- Here we go again.

237
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,090
I got one girl with a bladder infection
from holding it in all day.

238
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,630
Maybe Pete over there likes sitting
in his own pee, but I don't.

239
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,100
Like it or not, I represent members
of this union who happen to be female.

240
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,520
If we do get management
to give you girls Porta-Johns

241
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,880
what are you gonna do for us?

242
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,120
Didn't you hear, Pete?

243
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,110
Discount blowjobs,
for everybody but you.

244
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,190
Down here.

245
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,540
Found your way back?

246
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,240
I'm not retarded.

247
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,680
Come on in.

248
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,170
Take a look at this.

249
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,790
See that?

250
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,000
It's a Hamilton.
It's about 60 years old.

251
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,250
You mind if I go watch your TV?

252
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,350
No.

253
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,090
He's always in the basement with
his stupid watches. He's weird.

254
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,600
He's not weird. He's nice.

255
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,830
He used to work at Pearson
till he hurt his back or something.

256
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,950
- Good morning.
- Morning. Table for four, please.

257
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,550
Right this way.

258
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,180
Have you talked to Wayne yet?

259
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,950
No, Sammy,
I haven't talked to Wayne yet.

260
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,130
Maybe he'll call us tonight.

261
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,910
I don't think so, sweetheart.

262
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,370
Why not?

263
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,410
He's a little busy right now.

264
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,860
I think you're one of my girls, right?

265
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,240
Pardon me, I'm Donald Pearson.
I believe you work for me.

266
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,210
Yeah. Josey Aimes. Nice to meet you.

267
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,260
These are my kids, Sammy, Karen.

268
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,730
Hi. I was down to the plant this week
and I remembered your face.

269
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,100
Welcome aboard.

270
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,370
If you have any problems,
you make sure you come and see me.

271
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,280
Thank you.

272
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,920
Enjoy your meal.

273
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,990
Thanks.

274
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,860
Oh, jeez, that's my boss.

275
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,100
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

276
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,000
Before we eat, I wanna say something.

277
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,261
This is our first time
in a nice restaurant.

278
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,334
And I just think...

279
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:01,790
- Are you gonna cry?
- Can you mind your mouth?

280
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,080
I know things have been hard.

281
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,870
But they're gonna get better,
all right?

282
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,050
- They're gonna change.
- I knew you were gonna cry.

283
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,400
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you two, right?

284
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,170
Nice. She can put her hands
on the hose.

285
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,030
Come on, ladies!
Gotta appreciate the talent.

286
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,560
It's a pretty good likeness, I'd say.

287
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,340
Hi, I'm Earl.
I don't think we've met yet.

288
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,880
How about a cigarette, then?

289
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,950
- Go fuck yourself.
- Oh, be nice now, darling.

290
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,980
Come on, how about the smoke?

291
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,940
No, it's okay. I'll get it myself.

292
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,460
- Come on, Earl.
- All right, fun's over.

293
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,220
Just trying to see if she's got
a full pack. She don't.

294
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,690
You're okay.

295
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,060
All right, back to work,
slacker, come on.

296
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,930
Boy Scout.

297
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,310
- You okay?
- Yeah.

298
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,210
Do you even know
what's going on out there?

299
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,160
Sweetheart, this country's
elected a president

300
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,130
who's letting the world flood
our market with cheap steel.

301
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,000
We're knee-deep in layoffs.
Mines are closing left and right.

302
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,110
What's this got to do with Earl
laying hands on Sherry like that?

303
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,840
Are you hearing a word
of what I'm saying?

304
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,520
You're taking jobs
where there aren't any to take.

305
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,160
These boys aren't your friends.
I'm not your friend.

306
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,300
You got no business being here
and you damn well know it.

307
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,940
But you're not hearing that, are you?

308
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,300
So let's try something new.

309
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,950
How about: Work hard, keep your
mouth shut and take it like a man.

310
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,240
All right.

311
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,280
Maybe I'll go see Mr. Pearson.
He said come to him if I had a problem.

312
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,510
No, you don't see Pearson.
I see Pearson.

313
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,750
You know? When you've got a real
problem, take it up with me

314
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,360
and I'll be happy to help.

315
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,260
All right?

316
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,830
You know, it's a shame that
this stuff is toxic as hell.

317
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,630
Otherwise, it would be good
to put a little

318
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,310
You know?

319
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,110
You like a little Boy Scout love,
don't you?

320
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,980
You know, the key is in the lube.

321
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,790
Otherwise, it's just a bunch
of squealing and moaning

322
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,190
You should see your face, Josey.

323
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,570
Why, you?
Why, you think I'm serious?

324
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,940
I'm just fucking with you.
Where's your sense of humor?

325
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,360
Honey, you gotta get a gator's skin on,
you're gonna work in this stinkhole.

326
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,170
Just promise me something,
do not go to Arlen with this one.

327
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,750
Keep whining and moaning.

328
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,110
We're doing the exact thing
they want us to do.

329
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,730
Screw that. We can take
any crap they dish out, can't we?

330
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,940
I just don't want them to have
any reason to get rid of you, is all.

331
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,140
Glory?

332
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,460
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna thank you.

333
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,960
- Oh, what for?
- For this.

334
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
First time in my life
I'm making my own money.

335
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,720
I can feed my kids.

336
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,210
I'm gonna get us our own place.

337
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,900
I just feel like for the first time
in my life, like I'm

338
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,660
You're living?

339
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,010
Yeah. Living.

340
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,950
She asking for alimony?

341
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,270
No. She's offering to pay me alimony.

342
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,330
You taking it?

343
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,110
Hey, I already feel like half a man,
I should wear a miniskirt too?

344
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,730
Come on!

345
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,280
Don't drink them all yourself?

346
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,890
Don't dare me.
Ready to meet my girl yet?

347
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,950
- She's that one, blond, skinny one.
- One more time!

348
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,400
What do you think?

349
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,540
I'm taking a break
from women for a while.

350
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,230
"Taking a break. "
What is that, New York talk?

351
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,470
- It's like, regroup.
- Re-what?

352
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,550
That's what old Bill here says
he's doing back in town. Regrouping.

353
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,460
They must have a whole
other language in New York.

354
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,090
Oh, yeah, I brought you
something back from New York.

355
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,670
Well, now we're having a conversation.

356
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,710
Shooters.

357
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,680
- No, I didn't order these.
- No, it's okay. Hal bought them.

358
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,730
- Why are we the only ones dancing?
- You call that dancing?

359
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,900
Last time I danced like that
I ended up with twins.

360
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,294
Here's to broad shoulders,
leather skin,

361
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:47,771
and a belly
I can rest my drink on.

362
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,870
Hey, I heard Glory's new friend
is living with you.

363
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,580
You got a three-way going or what?

364
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,160
Bitch is on my crew. If you ask me,
this shit's out of control.

365
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,700
Funny thing, I didn't ask you.

366
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,690
Come on. Let's go, come on.

367
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,570
Please, take it easy.

368
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,440
What are you gonna do? My taxes?

369
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,480
You shouldn't have done that, Earl.

370
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,080
Come on.

371
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,260
Hey!

372
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,160
Come on.

373
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,870
Take it easy.

374
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,190
Welcome home, pal.

375
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,880
- Thanks.
- What a fucking asshole.

376
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,750
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

377
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,670
Welcome back to the range.

378
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,040
Okay, come on, now.

379
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,700
Give me the bunny, give me the bunny,
give me the bunny.

380
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,090
Yes! I got a bunny!

381
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,960
I got a bunny, everyone!

382
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,060
Why haven't you asked me to dance?

383
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,060
Not much of a dancer.

384
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,450
Sherry.

385
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,020
Bill.

386
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,060
So I hear you're some kind
of hockey star up in Carlson.

387
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,180
High school. Long, long time ago.

388
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,510
So you wanna dance?

389
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,160
Sherry, you got a lot of guys
to choose from in this place.

390
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,870
I know you're not a homo.

391
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

392
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,480
So you wanna dance or not?

393
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:17,200
I don't think you do.
I'm wearing underwear older than you.

394
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,110
You really are a homo.

395
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,450
Evening, ladies.

396
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,590
Evening, man.

397
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,040
Just one dance? Your friends here
will keep an eye on us.

398
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,140
All right, sure.

399
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,900
Are you nice, Ricky?

400
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,510
You seem nice.

401
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,390
Hurry. Get out, get out, get out.

402
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,440
You fucking suck.
You told me to have fun.

403
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,500
I didn't say do it till you puke.

404
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,120
Ah, great, where is Sammy?

405
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,900
Found him.

406
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,010
Where are your clothes?

407
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,950
Barfed on them.

408
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,110
Runs in the family.

409
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,230
All right, let's go. No more.

410
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,340
All right.

411
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,610
Stop singing that song, Sammy.

412
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,450
- Why not? It's a cool song.
- It's not a cool song.

413
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,800
- Will I get my own bedroom?
- Karen, please, no screaming.

414
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,140
- Seriously.
- Hey, nobody's talking to you.

415
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,280
- Then why am I even here?
- You're still a part of this family.

416
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,730
Oh, so now we're a family?

417
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,430
What the hell's the matter with you?

418
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,480
Karen, honey.

419
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,600
- It's pink, isn't it?
- Yeah.

420
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,970
It's great.

421
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,940
I just don't know if I can come up
with 20 percent down.

422
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,840
Can you do 10?

423
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,490
- How about 5?
- We can work something out.

424
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,060
How about that, huh?
What do you guys think?

425
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,560
- Definitely. Take it.
- I think it sucks.

426
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,463
Someday, you're gonna beg me

427
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:38,297
to forgive you
for being such a horse's ass

428
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:40,731
on the biggest day of my life.
And I won't.

429
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,220
Holy crap.

430
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,660
Look at that long face.

431
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,870
Somebody thought I forgot
about her, huh? But I didn't.

432
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,030
There's a surprise outside.
Cover your eyes.

433
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,610
- You ready?
- Yeah.

434
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,540
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

435
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,320
Okay?

436
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,390
There it is.

437
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,130
Well, I'm sure the neighbors heard.

438
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,910
- Come on, Sammy.
- Get on there.

439
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,020
Now you're gonna bounce really high.

440
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,070
Come on. Come on, Karen.

441
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,760
So, Josey, I know I've been
giving you a hard time.

442
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,500
But I want you to know that
I had a talk with the guys.

443
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,110
And I'm gonna give it a shot, okay?

444
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,940
Give what a shot?

445
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,660
You know, being cool with you
and whatnot.

446
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,900
Okay. All right.

447
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,730
As you can see, the conveyor's down.

448
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,780
So I need someone to get up there,
see if something's clogging the works.

449
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,850
If all's smooth in the tube,
you just come on home.

450
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,780
Think you can do it?

451
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,330
All right.

452
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,270
Go on. Nothing to be scared of.

453
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,610
All clear on number four.
I repeat, all clear on number four.

454
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,330
Oh, God.

455
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,510
Can you imagine falling down there?

456
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,610
Nobody would ever find you.

457
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,270
Two minutes, five ton of rock
would be on top of you.

458
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,620
Hello!

459
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,250
Oh, man. I remember the first
few times I came out here.

460
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,080
Oh, I hated it.

461
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,490
Then I realized, you know,
I could just stand out here, you know

462
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,360
and smoke a joint
and what have you

463
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,710
nobody'd be the wiser.

464
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,830
I mean, we're totally fucking alone.

465
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,020
So, what do you say, Josey,
you wanna, I don't know

466
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,660
kiss and make up?

467
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,600
- Come on, just one kiss.
- I'm going back.

468
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,400
Hey, come on, what's the matter
with you, Josey?

469
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,410
It's not like Am I hurting you?

470
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,910
I ain't hurting you, am I?

471
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,450
All right, fine then.

472
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,860
Go on.

473
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,170
No, that was pretty typical behavior,
you wanna know the truth.

474
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,900
What do you mean, "typical"?

475
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,780
Josey made a lot
of mountains from molehills.

476
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,720
Always misconstruing things,
you know, paranoid stuff.

477
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,160
She was pretty emotional.

478
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,701
When she told you what happened
out in the number four conveyor,

479
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:57,724
what did you do?

480
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,580
I yanked Bobby into my office
for a sit-down.

481
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,910
- He said she
- Objection. Hearsay.

482
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,180
- Sustained.
- Mr. Pavich

483
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,560
how do you know who to believe
in a situation like that?

484
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,830
Your Honor, is she kidding
with that question?

485
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,060
Maybe she could ask if he likes
piña coladas and walks in the rain.

486
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,430
Are you kidding with that objection,
Mr. White?

487
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,210
Because it's denied.
The witness may answer.

488
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,280
Look, men will always walk the line.

489
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,890
It's when they cross over it

490
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,600
is when most gals
give them a slap on the hand

491
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,370
get them back on their side
of that line.

492
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,570
That's how men and women have been
handling problems since Adam and Eve.

493
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,190
Okay, guys, that's it.

494
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,200
I'm out of here.

495
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,290
- Hey, you want a ride?
- Josey, stay a moment, would you?

496
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,510
I'd like to have a word with you.

497
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,380
Later.

498
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,110
Don't stick me.

499
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,080
That looks great.

500
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,260
Okay. We'll get it straight this time.

501
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,660
Stand up straight.

502
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,250
Was that my dress?

503
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:59,370
- A little young for Communion, no?
- No, never too young to be with God.

504
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,720
You been watching this?

505
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,490
- He referred to the size
of his own penis

506
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,000
- Oh, dear God. Turn it off.
as being larger than norm

507
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,270
That poor man's family.

508
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,970
- Alice?
- Here.

509
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,920
Great. I'm not staying long.

510
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,530
Just wanna let you know Sammy's
got a game on Sunday.

511
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,690
We're busy Sunday.

512
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,800
Don't do this to him.

513
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,080
You're doing it to him.
You can quit anytime.

514
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,830
Pop. We got a house.

515
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,130
- We got the loan and everything.
- You want me to congratulate you?

516
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,393
You act like I'm stealing.

517
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:50,227
I work damn hard every day,
same as you.

518
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:57,280
- Now you're the same as me.
- Oh, no. There's a few differences.

519
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,160
You don't go scared of what they
write about you on walls

520
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,760
or what kind of disgusting thing
you might find in your locker.

521
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,837
You don't gotta be scared
that one of these days

522
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:07,183
you'll come to work
and get raped.

523
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,680
You done?

524
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,130
Yeah, I'm done.

525
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,220
Come on!

526
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,370
Faster!

527
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,210
What are you doing bringing him?

528
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,820
- I'll see you over there.
- Lf at first you don't succeed

529
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,540
- Thanks, Bill.
- Thanks.

530
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,830
- What's that all about?
- He's famous.

531
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,030
They got a picture of him
in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

532
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,320
Bill. Bill. Josey, I don't think
you and Bill have met, have you?

533
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,320
No, we haven't.

534
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,010
- Hi.
- Hi.

535
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,140
Hi.

536
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,740
- Which one's yours?
- There he is, number 12.

537
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,740
Tell me he's not 0-for-cute.

538
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,640
Get a new project. I'm fine.

539
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,570
Well, look at that.

540
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,270
Good for him.

541
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,780
Oh, God!

542
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,770
- Inside, Sammy!
- Get off the board!

543
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,330
Oh, Jesus, I hate this game.

544
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,770
Kid's pretty quick on the ice.

545
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,050
Go, go, go.

546
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,060
- Pass it out! Pass it out!
- I'm open!

547
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,060
What?

548
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,360
Nobody passes anymore.

549
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,700
Why didn't you pass?

550
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,170
My dad would kill me
if I passed the puck to you.

551
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,090
You want some chili?

552
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,050
Yeah, I'll go with you.

553
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,420
But you said you weren't hungry.

554
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,990
Gotta be smart to be a lawyer, right?

555
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,830
You have a high opinion of lawyers.

556
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,110
Man, I love the sounds, you know?

557
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,660
Wood knocking on the ice.
The slush of the blades.

558
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,830
Figured hockey wouldn't
take care of me forever.

559
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,940
Thought a law degree might.

560
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,980
- What happened?
- Don't listen to me.

561
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:41,020
I'm in a bitter phase. What about you?
What do you do?

562
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,070
I work at Pearson's.

563
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,040
- In the mine?
- Yep.

564
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,100
You don't smell like a miner.

565
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,540
- You Josey Aimes?
- Yeah.

566
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,390
Stay the hell away from my husband.

567
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,930
Goddamn mining whores.

568
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,220
You keep away from Bobby,
you know what's good for you!

569
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,552
Bobby? Bobby Sharp?

570
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,538
Tossing your ass around
lost your marriage.

571
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,240
Don't think I'm gonna
let you mess with mine.

572
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,550
You hear that?

573
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,220
Is it true?

574
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,100
Jesus Christ.

575
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:25,880
Everybody heard. My father, my kids.

576
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,314
I mean,
can somebody say things like that?

577
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:29,315
You know, legally or whatever?

578
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,620
- In front of the whole goddamn world?
- Only if it's true.

579
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,240
Well, it's not. He came on to me.

580
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,500
- Then it's slander.
- What are you gonna do, sue him?

581
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,440
Well, could I?

582
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:45,280
Best thing you could do
is just let it go.

583
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,230
Miss Aimes? Hi, I'm Stacey.

584
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:54,570
- Sammy's girlfriend?
- Sammy's got a girlfriend?

585
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,270
Sammy says to tell you that
he's gonna stay at my house tonight.

586
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,750
Is that so? And where is Sammy?

587
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,580
He's over there in my mom's car,
and she said it's fine.

588
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,170
- Really? Sammy's mom says it's not.
- Hey, Josey, come on.

589
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,470
Great job today.

590
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,720
Sammy. Get out of the car now!

591
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,620
- He's very upset, maybe
- Don't tell me about my son.

592
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,070
- Get out.
- No!

593
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,800
- I said, get out of the car, now!
- Let go!

594
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,810
Get out of the car! Go to the truck.

595
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,812
You're a whore,
just like everyone says.

596
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,336
Don't ever talk to me like that!

597
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,990
Hey, hey! Josey, stop it, now!

598
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,600
You're gonna tell me
how to be a parent?

599
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,410
Glory,
with all your personal experience?

600
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,110
Karen, get in the truck.
Now, get in the truck!

601
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:02,030
You want a show? Huh?
Is that what you want?

602
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,600
You can all go to hell!

603
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,940
After that she kind of lost it.

604
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,280
When you say "lost it"?

605
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,590
Ranting all the time about
how we shouldn't take it anymore

606
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:28,040
how the company wasn't protecting us,
the union wasn't protecting us.

607
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,180
What did she think
you needed protection from?

608
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,052
Don't know.

609
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:37,997
Did you have problems getting along
with the men at the mine?

610
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,006
I didn't bother them.

611
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,670
They didn't bother me.

612
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:51,680
Hey, Peg! Three for a dollar.
Got change for a dollar?

613
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,830
You kill me. She was like:

614
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,081
It's what they've been talking
about on the news every day,

615
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:10,446
sexual harassment.

616
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,850
- Hey, Sherry?
- Yeah?

617
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,370
- What's this one do?
- Exfoliator, 11.99.

618
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,300
- Oh, gee.
- All right.

619
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,270
- Hello?
- It's me.

620
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,970
Glory can't make it.
She's got a bad flu.

621
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,920
- Oh, no, I need her here.
- I told you, Josey, she's sick.

622
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,550
Well, can I talk to her?

623
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:30,960
Josey, she's not coming, all right?

624
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,440
What are you doing?

625
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:04,220
What I was saying was
I think we should go to Pearson.

626
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,470
- You know? Tell him what's going on.
- What do you get out of this?

627
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,270
Jeez, Peg, I'm just trying
to make things better.

628
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,257
Not you. I'm talking to Sherry.

629
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:15,371
How much do you get paid
to sell this stuff?

630
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:16,550
Five percent of each sale.

631
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,960
Don't expect to get rich from me.
I'm not buying.

632
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,190
- What about what happened to you, Peg?
- That's my business.

633
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,540
Actually, it's all of our business.

634
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,510
- It's happening to all of us.
- Tell you one thing

635
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,550
I'm sick of having my ass grabbed
by a bunch of old men.

636
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,190
Maybe you've been asking for it.

637
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:37,230
- Ever think of that?
- Up yours, Peg.

638
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,770
Hey, you could quit tomorrow.
Go sell your face cream.

639
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,470
- I need my job.
- You don't know shit about me.

640
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,030
I need this job just as much as you.

641
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,150
Okay, okay. Now, what would you
even say to Pearson?

642
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,190
That we've been sexually harassed?

643
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,274
Honey,
he'd laugh you out of his office.

644
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:55,960
Not to mention
what the guys'd do to us.

645
00:58:56,586 --> 00:58:58,743
- That "never rat on a brother" crap.
- Yeah?

646
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,899
Union oath says,
"Respect fellow members. "

647
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,290
Where's our respect?

648
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,020
Where is it?

649
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,990
Come on, who's coming with me?

650
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,230
- What else you got there?
- A lot.

651
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,470
Will it get all the soot off my hands?

652
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,650
Sherry, Sherry, quite contrary
Kiss my ass, it's really hairy

653
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,050
Oh, a real funny guy.

654
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,880
What are you doing in the pit?

655
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:48,120
- Filling in for Glory while she's out.
- In time to use the new Porta-Jane?

656
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:51,170
You don't mind, we took
a big dump in that this morning.

657
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,900
Oh, how charming.

658
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,740
Sherry!

659
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,040
Hey, cut it out! Stop it!

660
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,850
Cut it out!

661
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,760
- What the hell's going on?
- They got Sherry in the crapper!

662
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,130
Stop it, guys!
Cut it out, it's not funny!

663
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,270
- Somebody's gonna get hurt.
- Knock it off!

664
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,740
Let her out! That's enough.

665
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,770
Turn this fucker over!

666
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,830
What the hell?

667
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,190
Send her in, please.

668
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,010
Miss Aimes. Sorry to keep you
waiting so long. Please, sit.

669
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,820
Gentlemen.

670
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,920
I asked some of my colleagues
to sit in, if you don't mind.

671
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,690
- No.
- I believe you know Mr. Pavich?

672
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,404
Yes, I do.
Mr. Pavich was the one who told me

673
01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:27,548
I had to take a day off work
to come and see you.

674
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,350
- I didn't want to waste your time.
- I appreciate that.

675
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,450
But it's not a waste at all.

676
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:36,120
Miss Aimes has a problem,
and we're gonna solve it.

677
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,670
Thank you, Mr. Pearson.

678
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,740
That's That's really great.

679
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,340
I didn't want to forget anything,
so I wrote a couple of things down

680
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,610
on a piece of paper here.

681
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,930
Excuse me, Josey
Do you mind if I call you Josey?

682
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,800
- No.
- I'd like to make this easier for you

683
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,310
if you don't mind.

684
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,170
I know what you're going to tell me.
I've been well-briefed.

685
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,010
Great. I just thought
that a few of these

686
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,740
Please, I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

687
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,870
Okay.

688
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,470
Well, the current union
contract requires

689
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:20,210
that an employee provide us
with two weeks' notice

690
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,180
before leaving his position.

691
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,980
However, given how obviously
emotional this has been for you

692
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,690
we're willing to do something
special in this case.

693
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,340
We've decided to waive
the two-week requirement

694
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,496
and allow you
to tender your resignation

695
01:03:34,497 --> 01:03:35,623
effective immediately.

696
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,750
No. I'm sorry, I'm not resigning.

697
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,735
Mr. Pavich will take care
of the details.

698
01:03:44,736 --> 01:03:45,913
- I'll be happy to.
- No.

699
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,970
I'm not quitting.

700
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,140
I need this job.

701
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,720
Then I suggest you spend less time
stirring up your female co-workers

702
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:03,030
and less time in the beds
of your married male co-workers

703
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:07,640
and more time trying to find ways
to improve your job performance.

704
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,910
Does anyone else have anything to add?

705
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,990
That says it.

706
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:22,860
Josey, thank you again
for making the drive down here.

707
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,270
Now, if you don't mind,
we have other business.

708
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,600
- To teach at Oral Roberts University
opened up.

709
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,220
When I informed him
that I was leaving in July

710
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,650
I recall that his response
was that now I would no longer

711
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,320
have an excuse
for not going out with him.

712
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,560
I told him that I still preferred
not to do so.

713
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,100
Where have you been?

714
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,950
He made a comment
that I will vividly remember.

715
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,770
He said that if I ever told
anyone of his behavior

716
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:07,225
that it would ruin his career.

717
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,130
This was not an apology

718
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:18,110
- Sammy, can I come in?
- Why?

719
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,990
I was only 20 minutes late.

720
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,890
- Don't freak.
- You know, I'm still the mom here.

721
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,930
Yeah, right.

722
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,390
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

723
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,880
Just most people's mothers
cook and clean.

724
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,810
They don't work at the mine.

725
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,830
Remember you used to tell me you
want to be a doctor when you grew up?

726
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,560
- So?
- So.

727
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:52,700
I used to tell you
you could be anything you want.

728
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,520
Isn't it the same for me?

729
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:57,563
Aren't I allowed
to be anything I want?

730
01:05:57,564 --> 01:05:59,746
Not when you're doing
someone else's job.

731
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:05,370
Bill White's signing some autographs
down at the rink on Saturday.

732
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,410
- We could go
- I don't want an autograph

733
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:10,550
from one of your loser boyfriends.
- He's not my boyfriend.

734
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,510
And he's not a loser.

735
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,390
He broke some record
in high school or something.

736
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,500
- Yeah. A million years ago.
- Jesus, I'm trying here, you know.

737
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,430
It was something we could do together.

738
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,500
- You love hockey
- I quit the team.

739
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,420
You quit?

740
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,350
When?

741
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,880
Who cares?

742
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,750
I care.

743
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,400
You love that team.
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

744
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:38,900
Because I don't want to talk to you.

745
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,570
Don't you get it?

746
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,720
I'll get her to call you.

747
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,920
I'm not leaving till I see her.

748
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,340
She doesn't have the flu, Josey.

749
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,870
God.

750
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,820
Guess he told you, huh?

751
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,670
- How you feeling?
- Great.

752
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,420
I never heard of
I mean, I've heard of Lou Gehrig.

753
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,290
- I just never knew about the disease.
- I know.

754
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,960
It's

755
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,290
It's kind of like piece by piece,
your body quits listening to you.

756
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,540
Like a bullheaded teenager.

757
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:55,180
So how's Sammy doing?

758
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,910
Hates me.

759
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:00,360
I'd like to say time heals all, but

760
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,500
Sure you should be drinking that?

761
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:11,520
Well, sooner or later, my liver's gonna
crash and burn on me, so until then

762
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,720
I'm still in the driver's seat.

763
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,790
You never could keep a secret.

764
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:22,100
Me? The whole town knows
I only have one ball because of you.

765
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:25,800
- You only got one what?
- Now the whole town knows.

766
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,280
Jeez.

767
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:32,060
- Does it? I mean, can you?
- Works great.

768
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:34,820
You only need one. A big one.

769
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,460
Oh, God.

770
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,680
Watch out.

771
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,810
- Okay?
- Yeah.

772
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,810
- Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom?
- No, go ahead.

773
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,235
But come back smiling,

774
01:09:01,236 --> 01:09:03,851
or I'll describe to you
what's gonna happen to my asshole.

775
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,540
- God, what's that smell?
- Toilets overflowed again.

776
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:54,320
I suggest you ladies
get some sponges and buckets

777
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,220
and get that room cleaned
before somebody gets sick.

778
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,350
- What's going on?
- Go in.

779
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,330
Look for yourself.

780
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:07,740
Oh, my God.

781
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,230
They can't do this to us.

782
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,460
Sure, they can.

783
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,210
They're gonna keep on doing it worse,
as long as you keep opening your mouth.

784
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,620
- Sherry, what they did to you
- You didn't help any.

785
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,550
That's for sure.

786
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,210
Don't look at me.
This is our lives you're screwing with.

787
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:40,740
Your mess, start cleaning.

788
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:57,070
Hey, Josey, how you like
your new scratch-and-sniff wallpaper?

789
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,720
Was it him? Was it?

790
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,550
I give a piece of my check
to that union, like everyone else.

791
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:08,590
You fucked up.
What do you want me to say?

792
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,760
Hey, lovebirds, wanna get to work?
Or should I dim the lights for you?

793
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,050
Josey, get your ass down here.
I got a job for you in the Powder Room.

794
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:35,070
You're one crazy bitch, you know that?

795
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,420
- You said you had a job for me.
- Yeah.

796
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,570
You like that, don't you?

797
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,752
You like that.

798
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:48,323
To grab your pussy like that,
don't you?

799
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,380
Forgot you like it a little rough.

800
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:01,070
You're gonna learn the goddamn rules
if I have to beat them into you myself.

801
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:09,150
Damn you, Josey.

802
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,550
He attacked me.

803
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,280
- Who attacked you?
- Bobby, in the Powder Room, just now.

804
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,390
- Bobby, you lay a hand on her?
- Sure you wanna ask that, Rick?

805
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,610
The answer's no.
I wasn't in the Powder Room all day.

806
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,660
He was working the concentrator
with me all afternoon.

807
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:06,560
See? You gonna call me and Earl
liars now? Come on.

808
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:10,190
Ricky.

809
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:38,560
Can somebody drive me home, please?

810
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:42,100
- Where's your dad?
- He's on nights.

811
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,130
- Just take my keys from my locker.
- Betty.

812
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,110
Don't.

813
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,500
Where do you think you're going?

814
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,080
I quit.

815
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,471
The rules are clear.

816
01:14:09,472 --> 01:14:11,519
Go around the union,
you broke your oath.

817
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:12,965
Period, the end.

818
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,160
Glory.

819
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,000
- What you doing here?
- What's it look like?

820
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,640
I'm here for the meeting.

821
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:28,250
Well, you're not an employee anymore.
You're not required to be here.

822
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,680
Yeah, well. Thought maybe
I could help you out.

823
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,740
Kind of out of control up there,
isn't it?

824
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,750
I'm not saying Josey should've
gone to management or anything

825
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,790
We were all sorry to hear you're sick.

826
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,430
- Glory
- Don't. Don't help me.

827
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,530
I mean, if you help me, I'll cry.
Please don't.

828
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,140
Need an autographed hockey puck?

829
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:07,980
- Got a hundred of them out here.
- I need a lawyer.

830
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,290
I wanna sue the mine.
The company. All of them.

831
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:14,760
Well, good luck with that.

832
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:19,240
I'm saying I wanna hire you.

833
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:23,240
Sorry, don't do that anymore.

834
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,750
That sucks, because you're
the only lawyer I ever met.

835
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,330
Well, the good news is,
all roads lead to lawyers.

836
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,740
Tell you what.
I will buy you a beer, though.

837
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:39,210
I don't need a beer.

838
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,410
I need a lawyer.

839
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:45,417
Josey, the illusion is that...

840
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:47,618
all your problems
are solved in a courtroom.

841
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,140
The reality is that even
when you win, you don't win.

842
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,000
I know, but I'm right.

843
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:57,370
I'm sure you are, but right
has nothing to do with the real world.

844
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,190
Look at Anita Hill. Because she's you.

845
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,330
You think you're outgunned at the mine,
wait till you get to a courtroom.

846
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,400
It's called
the "nuts and sluts defense. "

847
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:09,930
You're elther nuts and you imagined it,
or a slut and you asked for it.

848
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:12,880
elther way, it's not pleasant.

849
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:19,710
Take my advice. Find another job.
Start over.

850
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,630
I don't have any start-over left.

851
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:30,710
- Look, you're a beautiful girl
- Yeah, I'm a beautiful girl.

852
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,550
I could find a guy to take care of me.

853
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,290
I'm done looking to be taken care of.

854
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,920
I wanna take care of myself.
Take care of my kids.

855
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:46,770
You know it's happening to all of us.

856
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,410
Every woman up there.

857
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:57,100
But you don't give a shit, do you?

858
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:19,140
If somebody like her came to see me
back in New York with this dogshit case

859
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,610
you know what I'd do?

860
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,760
I'd take it.

861
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,960
Settle quick, pocket the contingency

862
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:29,220
make more money than her,
never see a courtroom.

863
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,330
Pearson would never settle.

864
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,630
- Sure he would.
- No.

865
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,240
It would be her word
against everybody else.

866
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:40,820
All the guys up there can't be bad,
which makes some of them witnesses.

867
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:45,260
That mine is bread and butter
for people around here.

868
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,230
Nobody wants to shit where they eat.

869
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:56,220
What is this place?
Like a pet cemetery or something?

870
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,490
Why, you got a lot of pet elk at home?

871
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,500
So they never picked on Glory, why?

872
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,510
Would you wanna
pick a fight with Glory?

873
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,050
No, Glory became a union rep early on.
She did some good things.

874
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:17,890
Got their respect.

875
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,390
Plus, she doesn't wanna
run with the herd.

876
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,060
- Keeps her head above the fray.
- Safety in numbers.

877
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,640
Herds. They stay together,
they have a chance.

878
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:35,660
They separate, they're easy prey.

879
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,650
Can you get the other women?

880
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,500
You know what a class action is?

881
01:19:56,670 --> 01:20:00,270
It's when a bunch of plaintiffs
have the same issue.

882
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,740
File a claim on behalf
of the whole group, the class.

883
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,880
It's tough for the company
to argue that you're all lying.

884
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:11,430
You're all crazy.
It's why you have to get the others.

885
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:17,770
Why'd you change your mind?

886
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,820
It's never been done before.

887
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,920
Sexual harassment class action.

888
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,170
So you'd be doing this
just because it's never been done.

889
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,850
Yeah.

890
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,620
Can you live with that?

891
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:47,560
Sue them?

892
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:50,170
- Are you kidding?
- You know what's going on up there.

893
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,970
Life is too short, trust me.

894
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,610
Not too short
to do something good with it.

895
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,180
How do you know? You're still alive.

896
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:04,690
- So are you, you know.
- You call this alive?

897
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,410
Get out of here.

898
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,780
- I didn't
- Get the hell

899
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,320
out of here.

900
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,620
It's not just one or two bad guys.

901
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:36,450
It takes a village
to do what's being done here.

902
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,730
I'm not saying all of them.

903
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,770
But enough of them.

904
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,970
In the plant, out in the pit,
and even up in the offices

905
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:50,140
all with the foot on the throat
of every woman in that mine.

906
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,971
It's not just my client
who needs relief from this court,

907
01:21:52,972 --> 01:21:53,875
Your Honor.

908
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:56,830
We are asking for an injunction
to protect all the women.

909
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,800
Further, we ask the court
to certify a class.

910
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:02,420
A class made up of every woman
working at Pearson

911
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:06,090
because every one of them
deserves protection under the law.

912
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,150
Doesn't a class actually require
more than one plaintiff?

913
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:12,100
This complaint was filed
on behalf of one Josey Aimes.

914
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,890
The key word being "one. "

915
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:17,470
By comparison, we have affidavits
from 13 women

916
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,040
all stating there have been
no incidents of abuse

917
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:22,420
That is not true.

918
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:23,850
Hey.

919
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,060
Sit down.

920
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,430
- It's not true.
- Sit down.

921
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:39,110
Your Honor, are you as confused
as we are?

922
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:44,250
I don't think Miss Conlin is supposed
to be waving around a pile of paper

923
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,990
without letting us
see it first, is she?

924
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,543
No, she's not. Miss Conlin.

925
01:22:48,544 --> 01:22:50,250
They'll be submitted
to the court today.

926
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,620
It doesn't matter what kind of document
they've been intimidated into signing

927
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,280
- Give me a break.
- Please.

928
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,890
- Get me three plaintiffs.
- Your Honor, please.

929
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,762
Counselor,
if those affidavits are legitimate,

930
01:23:02,763 --> 01:23:04,625
you shouldn't have an objection.

931
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:08,080
I'll continue to hear evidence
on Aimes v. Pearson, et al.

932
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:11,217
If you find three plaintiffs
with similar grievances,

933
01:23:11,218 --> 01:23:12,945
I'll give you your class action.

934
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,360
Thank you, Your Honor.

935
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,760
Okay, then, here we go.

936
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:29,620
We'll just hold it against your throat.

937
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:31,980
Push the button.
Push the button.

938
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:35,030
- There you go. Give it a try now.
- Glory.

939
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,860
Ms. Dodge?

940
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:40,763
My name is Leslie Conlin.
I'm an attorney.

941
01:23:40,764 --> 01:23:42,819
I represent
Pearson Taconite and Steel.

942
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,330
We know who you are.

943
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,040
What do you want?

944
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,290
The other women have signed
these affidavits on behalf of the mine.

945
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,790
I brought one for you to look at.

946
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:54,230
Get the hell out of here.

947
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,430
- I said, get out.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

948
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,980
She's not represented by counsel.
I have the right

949
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,700
She's represented by me.

950
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,970
I'll have to ask you to leave.

951
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,160
As long as you're alive,
you can be subpoenaed.

952
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,990
- Why, you!
- Fuck you.

953
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,690
Bitch.

954
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:14,900
You keep this crap away from us,
you understand?

955
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,810
Glory.

956
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,850
The reason I'm here
is to ask you to reconsider.

957
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,120
Jesus, are you fucking kidding?

958
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:29,460
It's not your decision, Kyle.
It's hers.

959
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:36,370
Glory, you know all this is not just
about Josey. This affects everybody.

960
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,160
She already decided.

961
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,770
You think I don't want to
stick it up their asses?

962
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:55,850
- Then why don't you do it?
- And what if we lost?

963
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,948
And I had to go back
to that mine every day

964
01:24:57,949 --> 01:24:59,346
and face those sons of bitches.

965
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,490
No way.

966
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,840
Who else you got so far?

967
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:11,380
It'd just be you and me.

968
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:13,490
Are you crazy?

969
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:19,590
You know what they did to me.

970
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,700
No way, man.

971
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:26,340
I got my own problems.

972
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,650
Hey, Mama. You okay?

973
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,793
If she gets
any of the other women,

974
01:25:59,794 --> 01:26:02,310
they'll get their class
and you'll lose this case.

975
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,050
Leslie, why do you think I hired you?

976
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:07,780
Because you're the smartest lawyer
I could find?

977
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:12,930
No. I hired you because you were
the smartest woman lawyer I could find.

978
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,370
But if you're getting soft,
I need to know now.

979
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,170
I'm not soft.

980
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,980
- But I am pragmatic.
- Do the Minnesota Vikings

981
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:23,420
have to put a girl in at quarterback?
Of course not.

982
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,500
Some things are for men
and some things are for women.

983
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:29,530
- Mining is men's work.
- Like lawyering.

984
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:33,520
See, a man would never
say something like that.

985
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,480
Women take everything too personally.

986
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:38,050
You're gonna take it personally
if she wins.

987
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:41,490
First of all, you're not insured
for punitive damages.

988
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:44,562
Plus, a loss here will change
the way you run your business.

989
01:26:44,562 --> 01:26:46,520
Porta-Johns will be a blip
on the radar.

990
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,084
There'll be paid leaves
for pregnancies.

991
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,855
And more lawyers to draft
a sexual-harassment policy.

992
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,090
Not to mention
that you will have helped establish

993
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:59,090
a legal precedent that will affect
every single company in America

994
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:03,570
including the Minnesota Vikings.
- Except she's not going to win.

995
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:07,570
This woman is a single welfare mother
with two kids out of wedlock

996
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,670
a sordid sexual history
- We don't know if that's true.

997
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,490
Send him in, please.

998
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,990
Mr. Sharp.

999
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,870
Would you share with Miss Conlin
what you told me today?

1000
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,180
Mom?

1001
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,010
Everything all right?

1002
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,160
How are you and the kids supposed
to eat if you don't have a job?

1003
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,920
I'm your mother, Josey.

1004
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,300
I haven't always been
the best at it, I know.

1005
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:58,370
But I'm here.

1006
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:03,110
You give away my hard-earned money,
then you toss your shoulders at me?

1007
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,880
I didn't give it away.

1008
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,790
- I gave it to Josey.
- I work hard for that money, Alice.

1009
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:09,700
Oh, and I don't?

1010
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,070
Maybe I should charge you
for every load of laundry.

1011
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:17,050
She said Bobby Sharp
attacked her at the mine.

1012
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:22,560
- Not the story I heard.
- There's only one story, Hank.

1013
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:23,679
Your daughter's.

1014
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,680
Those girls are asking for trouble.

1015
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:30,870
Oh, are you saying Josey asked for it?

1016
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,530
I'm saying I had to find some sandpaper
for the bathroom wall the other day.

1017
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,160
Stuff was scratched
right into the metal.

1018
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:39,490
- What's going on up there?
- They don't belong.

1019
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,490
- They never did, and you know it.
- I know she's our daughter.

1020
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:45,430
Our daughter's brought nothing
but shame on this family.

1021
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,290
And I'm so goddamn sick of her!

1022
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:01,430
She had a baby, Henry.

1023
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,400
She didn't rob a bank.

1024
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:35,160
Alice.

1025
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,370
- Is Hank with you?
- No.

1026
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,480
He's not.

1027
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:48,380
I need a room, Tom.

1028
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,620
You know, I can't help it
if she wants to get into my pants.

1029
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,240
Oh, Jesus.

1030
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:38,490
You okay?

1031
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:43,290
I never did anything to this bitch.

1032
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:45,570
That's right.

1033
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,000
Now she wants to sue all of us?

1034
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,380
You know what a class action is,
don't you?

1035
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,460
It means it's all of them
against all of us!

1036
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,990
That's right, this bitch wants to take

1037
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,860
every single swinging dick
in this room to court.

1038
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:06,170
Now, the other women have shown us
something here in the past few months.

1039
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,840
Telling the truth for a change.

1040
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,610
How about you?
How about that, huh?

1041
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:13,920
Who knew? Who knew?

1042
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,600
How about you, ladies?

1043
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,160
I just hope nobody's thinking
of breaking the ranks.

1044
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:25,050
Okay, that's it, let's go.

1045
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,360
Okay.

1046
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:39,370
We all thank Mr. Sharp and the others
for their enthusiastic comments.

1047
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,170
Before we take the oath,

1048
01:31:41,171 --> 01:31:44,295
are there any other brothers
who want a turn at the gavel?

1049
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:47,090
Yeah, I'd like a turn at the gavel.

1050
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:51,260
Oh, she's really lost it now.

1051
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,270
Get the fuck out of here!

1052
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,513
Get your ass home!

1053
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,695
I asked if any brothers
would like to speak.

1054
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,185
Bylaws say no meeting can adjourn

1055
01:32:06,186 --> 01:32:09,499
if a member wants to speak
his or her mind.

1056
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,800
I got your gavel right here, bitch!

1057
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,390
I am s

1058
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,590
I'm still a member of this union.

1059
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:35,820
- Come on. Come on!
- Well?

1060
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:38,120
- Say it!
- Yeah!

1061
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,960
- My My name is Josey Aimes, and
- Hey, Josey!

1062
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:45,070
Show us your tits!

1063
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:54,584
Don't look at me, Hank!

1064
01:32:54,585 --> 01:32:56,712
I'm not the one
who can't control his family.

1065
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,840
Rules say she gets to talk.

1066
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,670
You can have the gavel next,
but right now she's got it.

1067
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,600
- I'll take it next and
- All right, but she's got it!

1068
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:07,780
She's got it.

1069
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:19,570
- Can't hear you.
- I can't hear you.

1070
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:23,040
My father never wanted me to work here.

1071
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,870
- That's right.
- Sit on this and talk.

1072
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,410
Pretty much stopped talking to me
because of it.

1073
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:34,260
Some of you here think
I wanna shut down the mine.

1074
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,800
Don't worry, sweetheart,
we won't let it happen!

1075
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:44,340
I don't wanna shut down the mine.

1076
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,120
I just wanna go to work
like everyone else.

1077
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,900
Get paid end of the week,
feed my kids, and hell

1078
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:54,530
maybe now and then have enough
for a beer at Tee-Gees Saturday night.

1079
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:58,340
And not a woman in that back row
don't know what I'm talking about.

1080
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,730
You all know what's been done.

1081
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:06,230
- Time's up!
- We need these jobs.

1082
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:09,460
And it's not gonna stop
until we say stop!

1083
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,910
- Three-minute rule!
- There's no three-minute rule!

1084
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,450
You heard the man! Get the fuck out!

1085
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:17,880
It's not gonna stop until we say stop!

1086
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:23,000
- I have a right to say
- Give me that, please.

1087
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,160
- Three-minute rule.
- There's no three-minute rule!

1088
01:34:29,610 --> 01:34:32,310
- May I have it, please?
- Pop.

1089
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:34,280
- I'm not done.
- I know. Please.

1090
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,220
- Come on, Hank.
- Please.

1091
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,370
Come here, baby.

1092
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:49,670
Stay with me.

1093
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,190
- Let her go, Hank.
- Come on, let her go.

1094
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:03,040
My name is Hank Aimes.

1095
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:08,210
- And I been a ranger all of my life.
- So have I!

1096
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:12,590
But I ain't never
been ashamed of it till now.

1097
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:22,300
When we take our wives and daughters
to the company barbecue

1098
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:25,420
I don't ever hear anybody
calling them those names

1099
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,350
like "bitches" and "whores"
and worse.

1100
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,360
I don't ever see nobody grabbing them
by their privates or, you know

1101
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,530
drawing pictures of them on
the bathroom walls doing unspeakables.

1102
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,210
Unspeakables.

1103
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,920
So, what's changed?

1104
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,000
She's still my daughter.

1105
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,870
Isn't she?

1106
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,280
It's a heck of a thing

1107
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:05,920
watch one of your own
get treated that way, you know.

1108
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,480
You're all supposed to be my friends.

1109
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,190
My brothers. Well

1110
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:24,530
Right now, I don't have a friend
in this room.

1111
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:34,280
Fact, the only one here
that I'm not ashamed of

1112
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:36,490
is my daughter.

1113
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,790
Oh, it's tough stuff, getting up
in front of all those sons of bitches.

1114
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:41,890
No. "Tough" is sticking this shit out
day after day

1115
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,920
without bitching and moaning.

1116
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,070
What are you doing in here?

1117
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:52,070
That stuff really gets the soot
off your hands.

1118
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,800
Doesn't it?

1119
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:57,410
All I'm saying

1120
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,665
it's easy for her to get up there
and say whatever she wants

1121
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:01,785
when she already quit.

1122
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:05,490
- The rest of us still gotta work here.
- Easy? I'd like to see you do it.

1123
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,190
It's easy when you're crazy.

1124
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,880
She's definitely crazy.

1125
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,580
- Let me borrow some of that cream.
- Buy your own.

1126
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:18,780
- Creep took half of mine.
- So you're okay getting on that stand

1127
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,230
and saying she's lying, right?

1128
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,900
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

1129
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,470
Plus, we all signed
those affidavits already

1130
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:28,160
which means we don't have
a choice anymore, right?

1131
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,350
Right, Betty?

1132
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,800
Oh, God.

1133
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,940
Oh, fuck.

1134
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,380
Who is Sammy's father?

1135
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,790
I don't know who Sammy's father is.

1136
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,270
Because you've had so many
sexual partners?

1137
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:03,040
Objection. Plaintiff's sexual history
is irrelevant, Your Honor.

1138
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,810
Overruled.

1139
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,800
Miss Conlin, who is the gentleman
entering the courtroom?

1140
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:19,260
Mr. Paul Lattavansky, Your Honor,
Miss Aimes' high school teacher.

1141
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,600
We've subpoenaed him
as an impeachment witness.

1142
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:25,190
I have so many objections,
I don't know where to start.

1143
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,550
- Witness will answer.
- Again:

1144
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,300
- Miss Aimes, who is Sammy's father?
- My son

1145
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:35,270
has got nothing to do
with any of this.

1146
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,800
Is it true that you and your teacher

1147
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,880
Mr. Lattavansky, had a sexual
relationship at one time?

1148
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,250
A "relationship"?

1149
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:46,920
What the hell you been
telling them, Bobby?

1150
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,910
Miss Aimes, did you not, at 16,
engage in a sexual relationship

1151
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,420
with your high school teacher?

1152
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,520
Oh, Josey, stay a moment, would you?

1153
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,290
I'd like to have a word with you.

1154
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:04,870
Later.

1155
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:08,060
Okay.

1156
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:16,280
What are you doing hanging around
a boy like Bobby Sharp?

1157
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,390
You have so much more going for you

1158
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:23,730
than a kid like that'll ever have.

1159
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,080
Do you like me, Josey?

1160
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:34,180
- Far as teachers go.
- Yeah.

1161
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,190
You're my favorite student.

1162
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:41,160
Did I ever tell you that?

1163
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,440
- No.
- Yeah.

1164
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:46,420
Frankly

1165
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:48,650
- Josey?
- Yeah?

1166
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,890
I'd like to think of you
as more than that.

1167
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:58,370
No, no, it's okay.

1168
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,700
Maybe even as a friend.

1169
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:38,850
- What are you doing?
- It's okay.

1170
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,920
- What are you doing?
- No, it's okay.

1171
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:44,790
- Please don't do this, Mr. L.
- No, it's okay.

1172
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,470
It'll be our little secret, okay?

1173
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,270
No, no, no!

1174
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,710
No!

1175
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:58,660
No! No, stop! Stop!

1176
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:02,160
Stop it!
I don't wanna do this! Stop it!

1177
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:05,700
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Stop!

1178
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,010
Stop!

1179
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:59,360
Are there any other witnesses
to this alleged rape?

1180
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:04,080
Anybody besides Mr. Sharp
that can corroborate your testimony?

1181
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:10,320
No.

1182
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:22,402
Isn't it true that there was no rape?

1183
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:26,620
You have a long history
of inappropriate sexual relationships.

1184
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,984
Objection. At the very least,
we're talking statutory rape.

1185
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:32,070
- It's outrageous.
- You raped my daughter

1186
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,510
- Hank!
- Order! Bailiff!

1187
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,380
- Help!
- Remove that man!

1188
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:42,920
- Remove that man! Remove him.
- Let go! Let go of me.

1189
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,930
Everybody take your seats.

1190
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,230
Miss Aimes? Miss Aimes,
return to the stand, please.

1191
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:51,370
Return to the stand, Miss Aimes!

1192
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:54,720
Your Honor, move for recess? Please.

1193
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,122
Josey, wait. Slow down.

1194
01:43:56,123 --> 01:43:57,585
I've gotta get home to Sammy.

1195
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:16,530
We're gonna stay here tonight.

1196
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:18,790
That's crazy, Mom.

1197
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:21,470
He's gonna come home.

1198
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,440
All the same.

1199
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,140
We're gonna stay here.

1200
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,750
I'd rather give you money

1201
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:27,260
if that's all right with you.

1202
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,440
That's a pretty old watch.

1203
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:33,110
Was just looking at it.

1204
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:45,020
She's lying, you know.
She didn't get raped by that teacher.

1205
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:48,640
She was just saying that
so she'll win her lawsuit.

1206
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:52,200
It's illegal for her to say that
if it's not true.

1207
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:54,580
She should go to jail.

1208
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,380
I don't care.

1209
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:00,290
She's a whore,
just like everybody says.

1210
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,370
I wonder if it's illegal to call
your own mother a whore.

1211
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:09,080
- Sure sounds bad enough to be.
- She's a liar.

1212
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,180
My father didn't die in the Army.

1213
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:15,160
He's a scumbag raper.

1214
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:19,470
- It's a hard truth to tell, Sammy.
- That's crap.

1215
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,770
- I got a right.
- Yeah, you got a lot of rights

1216
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:25,970
starting with the right
to be pissed off.

1217
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:30,350
In fact, you got a right to hate
the whole world right now.

1218
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:35,750
I don't hate the whole world.

1219
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:38,330
I just hate her.

1220
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:42,310
Takes a lot of work to hate someone.

1221
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,380
You ready to put in that kind of time?

1222
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,220
To really hate your mom

1223
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,113
you gotta think over
and over again

1224
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:53,799
about all the things
you hate about her.

1225
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,860
She's mean to you.

1226
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,670
Never proud of you.

1227
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:02,150
Never comes to watch
your hockey games.

1228
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,989
Leaves you hungry,
never buys you clothes.

1229
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:06,443
I'm not stupid.

1230
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:11,170
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that?

1231
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,600
I know she does all those things.

1232
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,590
Yeah.

1233
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,060
But you hate her anyway.

1234
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:24,490
Yeah.

1235
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,760
I hate her guts.

1236
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,960
Well, you're lucky.

1237
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:33,140
She never gave up on you
as quick as you're giving up on her.

1238
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:36,310
When she was a bit older
than you are now

1239
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:41,270
she got pregnant in a way
nobody should get pregnant.

1240
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:43,390
Would've been a lot easier

1241
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:45,260
to give you up to someone else.

1242
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,740
Nobody would've blamed her if she did,
but she didn't. She stuck by you.

1243
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:52,080
And she's still sticking by you

1244
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:54,920
even though she knows you hate her.

1245
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:56,990
She's still there waiting

1246
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,490
hoping you'll get your ass home.

1247
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,970
- Take it.
- What?

1248
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:11,980
Well, if you wanna run off,
you can sell it and use the money.

1249
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:15,330
Or just put it on your wrist.

1250
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,560
elther way, it's yours.

1251
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,090
One friend to another.

1252
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,200
Karen, go to bed.

1253
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:38,870
I'll wake you when he comes back.

1254
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:41,210
It's me.

1255
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:13,470
I didn't want you, Sammy.

1256
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:20,680
Something bad had happened to me,
and I just wanted it to be over.

1257
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:27,330
But every day my belly grew,
and it just reminded me of it.

1258
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:34,940
Never even occurred to me
that there was a baby in there.

1259
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:39,590
That you were in there.

1260
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,780
That day, what that man did to me

1261
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,420
it made me into something different.

1262
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:56,210
And I guess

1263
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:01,590
I guess I thought

1264
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:05,140
it said something about
who you were too.

1265
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:10,080
I was a girl who was raped,
and you were this

1266
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:11,780
thing

1267
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:15,120
that just kept reminding me of it.

1268
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,440
Oh, God, I've dreaded this conversation
since the day you were born.

1269
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:29,290
I don't want any more secrets
between us.

1270
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:39,410
This one night

1271
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:43,120
I was lying in bed

1272
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:46,150
and you moved inside me

1273
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:51,440
like this tiny little butterfly,
just fluttering around in there.

1274
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:56,140
And all of a sudden, I realized

1275
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,050
I just knew

1276
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,420
I knew you weren't his.

1277
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:06,090
You were mine.

1278
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:08,750
You were my baby.

1279
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:11,140
And we were gonna be in it together.

1280
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:14,170
Just the two of us.

1281
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:21,710
You had nothing to do
with that ugliness, you hear me?

1282
01:51:21,711 --> 01:51:22,740
Nothing.

1283
01:51:27,170 --> 01:51:31,120
And there's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do to be your mom.

1284
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:01,570
I should've told you.

1285
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:08,540
It's over, isn't it?

1286
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:13,220
Not yet.

1287
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:27,020
Mr. Sharp, do you know the difference
between consensual sex and rape?

1288
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,710
Oh, yeah.

1289
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:31,450
But when you're having a good time
like she was

1290
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:33,830
ain't no rape. That's for damn sure.

1291
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:38,000
Are you a virgin?

1292
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,800
- No. I ain't a virgin.
- Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

1293
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:45,450
She can ask about my client's sexual
history, but I can't ask this witness?

1294
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:47,560
No, you can't. Sustained.

1295
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,390
- Why didn't you help her?
- Objection.

1296
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,000
You saw Josey being attacked.

1297
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:53,970
Miss Aimes' testimony has not been
corroborated by evidence.

1298
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:57,550
Nelther has his. And my client
would like to prove that he's lying.

1299
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,510
I'm allowing it. For now.

1300
01:53:01,290 --> 01:53:02,720
Bobby?

1301
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:06,600
When you saw Josey being attacked,
why didn't you help her?

1302
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:10,230
You know, you can use
all the lawyer mumbo-jumbo you want

1303
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:13,870
this still was no attack.
- I asked around about you, Bobby.

1304
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:16,680
- Folks say you're kind of soft.
- They ain't man enough

1305
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:20,350
to say it to my face.
- Are you a red-ice player, then?

1306
01:53:21,790 --> 01:53:23,560
- How's that?
- I had a coach used to say:

1307
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,640
"Win or lose,
leave your blood on the ice. "

1308
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:28,580
Good coach.

1309
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:30,010
Yeah.

1310
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,310
You're what coach would call

1311
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,950
a yellow-ice player.

1312
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,460
The kind that wets his pants
when things get rough.

1313
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,720
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Denied.

1314
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:40,431
She was your friend.

1315
01:53:40,432 --> 01:53:43,181
You watched him
put his filthy hands on her,

1316
01:53:43,182 --> 01:53:44,266
and you ran away.

1317
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:47,010
- It wasn't like that.
- Your Honor.

1318
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:50,350
- Sustained. Mr. White
- He held her down, spread her legs

1319
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:55,560
jammed himself up inside her?
- Mr. White!

1320
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,300
Rangers are hard as steel, huh?

1321
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,000
Not this one.

1322
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,040
This one's made of butter.

1323
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:07,850
You gonna keep lying about your friend,
or you gonna stand up and be a man?

1324
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,360
- Objection.
- I'm not lying.

1325
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,690
- You wanna run right now, don't you?
- Fuck you.

1326
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:13,450
- That's enough.
- You wanna run?

1327
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:14,746
I didn't run.

1328
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:16,916
Or you gonna put your guts
on the ice?

1329
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,870
What's it gonna be? Yellow?

1330
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,870
Or red?

1331
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:24,150
Yellow or red?

1332
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:28,750
- Yellow or red?!
- What was I supposed to do?!

1333
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,640
He was raping her, wasn't he?

1334
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,220
Yeah.

1335
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,700
And you ran.

1336
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,540
What was I supposed to do?

1337
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:05,200
What are you supposed to do

1338
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:10,680
when the ones with all the power
are hurting those with none?

1339
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:16,340
Well, for starters, you stand up.

1340
01:55:17,790 --> 01:55:20,390
You stand up and tell the truth.

1341
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,790
You stand up

1342
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:24,860
for your friends.

1343
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:28,060
- Objection, Your Honor.
- You stand up

1344
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:30,840
even when you're all alone.

1345
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:34,420
- You stand up.
- All right.

1346
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,820
- Mr. White, if you are through...
- Excuse me.

1347
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:38,620
What is going on back there?

1348
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:42,240
This is Glory.

1349
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:46,200
She worked at Pearson's.

1350
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:48,640
She wants to say:

1351
01:55:50,890 --> 01:55:54,190
"My name is Glory Dodge.

1352
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,430
And I'm not fucking dead yet.

1353
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:00,470
I stand with Josey. "

1354
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:14,411
Your Honor?

1355
01:56:14,412 --> 01:56:16,154
Your Honor said
we needed three plaintiffs.

1356
01:56:16,289 --> 01:56:17,440
It's still only two.

1357
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:13,860
Ready?

1358
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:17,040
Yeah!

1359
01:58:17,210 --> 01:58:18,470
Nice.

1360
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,520
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

1361
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:33,300
Hey, your son was just telling me
how rich you guys are now.

1362
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:35,730
- Oh, really?
- You gonna buy me a car?

1363
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:38,587
No.
You're not old enough to drive yet.

1364
01:58:38,588 --> 01:58:39,360
So?

1365
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:59,690
Why are we stopping?

1366
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:03,160
Well, if you want a car someday,
you gotta know how to drive it, right?

1367
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,830
First lesson:

1368
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,370
Driver sits behind the wheel.

1369
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:09,810
Come on, move your butt.

1370
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,470
Seat belt.

1371
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:16,050
All right.

1372
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,740
- What do I do?
- Okay.

1373
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,100
Put your foot on the accelerator.
Gently, okay?

1374
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:23,830
And stay on the road if you can.

1375
01:59:25,010 --> 01:59:26,500
Go on, go on.

1376
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:33,380
All right. Let's take a tiny
little bit at a time. Okay.

1377
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:35,250
Slow down.

1378
01:59:35,430 --> 01:59:38,120
Slow down, racecar driver.

1379
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:42,070
There you go. You're a natural.
