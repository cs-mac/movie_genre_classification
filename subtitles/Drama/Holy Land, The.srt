1
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
Knights, I bid you welcome
to your new home.

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,560
Let us ride to...Camelot!

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,320
# We're knights of the Round Table

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,880
# We dance when ere we're able

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,960
We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impecc-able

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,440
# We dine well here in Camelot

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
# We eat jam and ham
and Spam a lot... #

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,240
There was always a feeling

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,960
that perhaps we could
make a film together,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,800
a really new, original film.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,280
# ..We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formid-able... #

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
We set out basically to
make an ordinary film,

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,800
and we were saved from our own
mediocrity by the lack of money.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,680
# ..Diaphragm a lot! #

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
I often think about it as
having a sort of quality

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,680
that Hard Day's Night has,
which is about young men

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,840
not quite knowing what they're doing
but making it work anyway.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,640
# ..In war we're tough and able... #

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,800
I think we went into this movie
not really understanding at all

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
that we'd probably cut off
far more than we could chew.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,360
# ..I have to push the pram a lot. #

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,240
On second thoughts, let's not go
to Camelot. It is a silly place.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,080
These days, Monty Python's silliness
is part of the comic language.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Their TV sketches and
movies are regularly voted

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,520
amongst the greatest comedy ever made.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,760
Millions of fans can still quote
Python chapter and verse,

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,440
and frequently do,
and now a Python musical

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,880
is doing big business across the world.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,880
But hard as it may be to believe now,
the Pythons' illustrious status

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,240
as kings of comedy
was not always certain.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Back in 1973, the team
was beginning to fracture.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,200
Things weren't looking good for Monty.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,600
John in particular felt a bit
restricted by the group,

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,600
felt we'd done as much as we could do.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,160
He drifted off to start
doing Fawlty Towers.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
Python had taken my life over!

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,640
If we weren't doing a stage show,
we were doing a TV series,

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,320
preparing for a film, making
a record or doing a book.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,320
I didn't want to do
Python all the time.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,520
The others were having such a
good time it didn't bother them,

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,960
but I wanted to strike out
in other directions.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,240
And now for something
completely different.

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,080
A couple of them were very cross
with me for not wanting to do

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,520
any more, although I'd not really
wanted to do the third series.

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,080
But I think that was mainly
Terry Jones, who I remember

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
talked about betrayal,
or some words like that,

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,360
and Graham Chapman was very critical.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,040
Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam,
in particular,

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,520
were anxious to do an original movie,
always anxious to do that,

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,000
because they were interested
in directing.

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,280
We'd all gotten a bit itchy
to do something bigger,

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,720
and so the thought of doing
a movie was quite intriguing.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,560
There was never a question
that I didn't want to do the movie

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
cos that interested me.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,760
In a sense, making The Holy Grail
was starting all over again,

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,720
something that we believed in
and very few other people did.

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,520
Five of the future Pythons
had met while at university,

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,320
and they all worked together
for the first time

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
on the BBC's famed satirical show
The Frost Report.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,840
Chapman and Cleese were
tempted across to ITV,

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,840
writing and performing
At Last The 1948 Show,

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,040
while Palin, Idle and Jones

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,560
scripted and starred in the teatime
kids hit Do Not Adjust Your Set.

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Terry Gilliam first met
John Cleese in New York,

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
and when he came to London,

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Cleese put him in touch with
the Do Not Adjust Your Set team.

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,880
So when the two shows finished,
there were six talents on the loose,

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,000
seeking an outlet for their unique
comedy tastes and ideas.

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,400
What else could they do
apart from join forces

70
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,400
and call their collective effort...

71
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,760
Monty Python's Flying Circus.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,000
PALIN: The first series
went out in October 1969,

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,800
and very rapidly,
against all the odds at the time,

74
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,160
we were offered another series
and a third series, and we did,

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,840
er...three series by 1972.

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,520
Also, during that time, we'd done
various albums, we'd done two books,

77
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,280
and we'd done a film called And Now
For Something Completely Different.

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,440
We decided somewhere along the line,
maybe after the second series,

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,880
that we would write a movie,

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,040
we would do a movie which we
would control and we would direct.

81
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,640
The Pythons' first film

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,000
had been designed to help
them crack the US market.

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,000
It was overseen by Flying Circus
director Ian McNaughton

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,000
and financed by the UK arm of Playboy.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,280
But the team found themselves
fighting for control of the movie

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,280
with the financiers, so for Holy Grail

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,800
they were determined to take control
themselves and be able to go...

88
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,000
RASPBERRY

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,120
During the shooting of the
television series, Terry and I

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
were both sort of convinced
we could do it

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
better than Ian McNaughton
or whoever else was directing.

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,520
I mean, we always railing at the fact
that, "Oh, the light's not right!"

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,240
Everything was cheap,
and especially at the BBC

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
comedy was treated rather shabbily.

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,600
CLEESE:Terry often got into
fights with Ian McNaughton

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,000
about how the television
series was being shot,

97
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,520
and he and Terry Gilliam both
had much better visual senses

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
than I did, and they felt,
I think quite correctly,

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,760
that they could do the
visuals much better.

100
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,360
Get in! Get in!

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,400
They'd had a good look at television,

102
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,760
turned it upside down,
turned it inside out,

103
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,480
and I think they were just
restless for doing some more.

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,440
You know, maybe they needed
to do their Sergeant Pepper

105
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
or their White Album.

106
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,760
The idea of doing a movie really
appealed to us, and I think

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,360
both Terry and I were convinced
we wanted to be movie directors,

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
and so basically we just
proposed to the group,

109
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,760
"Anybody named Terry can
direct," and the others agreed.

110
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,360
So the Terrys would be taking
turns in the director's chair,

111
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,720
but there was still one question.
What were they going to direct?

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Terry Jones and myself had
begun a sort of script about...

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
the Middle Ages and flying
coconuts and all that -

114
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,000
it was actually the beginning of the
film - and Arthur coming to the walls

115
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,920
and trying to talk to people who just
went on about unladen swallows.

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
The first time we wrote it,
it was sort of...

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,600
it was filled with sort of sketchy
things. There was a lot of things

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,360
in Harrods, it was modern day.
It vaguely was Graily.

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,640
We had no idea how to do narrative
in a movie, and I don't think we do it

120
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,840
particularly well in Holy Grail,
because we were sketch writers,

121
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,680
and we just wrote a lot of sketches.
It took us an incredibly long time

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
to actually get to the script
that you see on the screen.

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,000
It was perfectly clear that
the most successful part of it

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,240
was about Arthur and the Grail,
and so we junked all the rest of it

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,680
and said, "Well, let's write a movie

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,480
"about Arthur and
the quest for the Grail."

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
And that's how it began,
and people just started writing...

128
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,120
writing pieces, as we always did.
I mean, Python was...

129
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
We'd have an idea of what we're
doing, go and write, write, write,

130
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,080
and then start cramming it all together

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,720
and throwing out most of the
good stuff and leaving the dross.

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,080
Can you give me a brief
synopsis of the film?

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Is that possible in the space
of half an hour or so?

134
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Well, I don't think it is,
really. I don't think it is.

135
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Well, try then in 30 seconds.

136
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,200
Right. It's about a search
for the Holy Grail, you see,

137
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,040
which is a large sort of creature
a bit like a dodo with a big beak.

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,120
There was a lot of fighting about the
material all the way through Python,

139
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,320
but that was kinda good, 'cause
a lot of it was creative tension,

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,920
which I think you have to have.

141
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,680
I think we must have been writing
towards each of us playing a knight,

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,440
and John would be Lancelot
and Michael would be Galahad

143
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,520
and I'd be Robin and Terry
would be Bedevere.

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,520
And Terry Gilliam was Patsy,
of course. So I think we must,

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
at a certain point, have realised we
were all gonna play a knight each.

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,480
So with the knights all cast,

147
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,000
who'd be the man who would be king...

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Arthur?

149
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
Woah there!

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,840
I think Graham must have read Arthur
in some of the early read-throughs,

151
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,400
and he was terrific and had this
sort of long-suffering gravity,

152
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
and he looked good.

153
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,360
There was something about
Graham that just was...

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,920
not quite magisterial but aloof.

155
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,360
It is I, Arthur, son of
Uther Pendragon,

156
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,120
from the castle of Camelot,

157
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,480
King of the Britons,
defeater of the Saxons,

158
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,880
sovereign of all England!

159
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
Pull the other one!

160
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,440
I am!

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,800
One of the joys of Python was
playing lots of different characters.

162
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,120
To give up the chance of
doing a lot of characters

163
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,720
to be this regular, sort
of rather straight figure

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,640
that goes all way through
is quite a sort of sacrifice,

165
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,720
and Graham seemed happy to do it.

166
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
It was the smartest choice we made,
because he was a brilliant Arthur,

167
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,280
and I think we also discovered,
in that sense,

168
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,280
he became the straight...the centre
around which the madness spun.

169
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,080
What's it like being a film star?

170
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm not. I'm just a...just an extra,
really.You're just an extra?

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,280
Yes. It's the crown and this
that probably makes you...

172
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,800
Yeah, I was looking for Graham. Ah,
yes, he's around somewhere. Is he?

173
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,520
Now the Pythons only needed one
small thing to make the movie -

174
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,680
money. To help them find it, they
turned to their industry contacts.

175
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,600
Mark Forstater first met
Terry Gilliam in New York

176
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
and was now working in London
as an independent film producer.

177
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,400
Together with the Pythons,

178
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,400
he approached theatrical
impresario Michael White,

179
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,280
who had worked with Chapman
and Cleese back in 1963.

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
White's colleague, John Goldstone,

181
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,520
had been at the recording
of the very first Flying Circus.

182
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,320
As Python fans, they were
interested in investing in the film,

183
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,400
but they seemed to be the only ones.

184
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,840
We were turned down
by every financing source

185
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,160
because they didn't
trust the new directors,

186
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,440
they didn't know what they would get,

187
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
um, so we basically couldn't raise

188
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,520
any finance from industry sources.

189
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,280
Python was too...
dangerous, in a way, for them.

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,080
It was unconventional...and, um,

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,280
didn't indicate any kind
of narrative form

192
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,920
that would convert into a film.

193
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,040
The Pythons had released
their records on Charisma,

194
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320
a label run by Tony Stratton-Smith,

195
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,720
and Stratton-Smith had
some very good ideas

196
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
about who would be crazy
enough to invest in the Pythons.

197
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
For bands like Genesis,
Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd,

198
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,600
it was unlikely they'd see
their hard-earned again.

199
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,640
You'd probably need to be
on drugs to take that chance.

200
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,160
Luckily, some of them were.

201
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,280
Rock'n'roll really understood Python

202
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,560
a lot more than the conventional
film-financing entities.

203
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,640
I think we were supposed
to be a tax loss

204
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
but, unfortunately,
I think we made money.

205
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,400
We probably made their tax
problems worse in the end!

206
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,080
They didn't do it as an investment,
in the sense of,

207
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,680
"Well, let's see if we can
make money out of this."

208
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
I think it was trying
to support something

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,120
that they really enjoyed
and really liked.

210
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,120
There was a synchronicity
between the two, I don't know why.

211
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
Pop groups used to watch Python
on the road and all that sort of thing.

212
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,400
They felt there was a kind of kinship

213
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,720
between their music and our form
of comedy, a kind of subversiveness,

214
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
or slight rebelliousness, or whatever,

215
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,800
something fresh, I don't know.

216
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,640
But, you know, thank you...
Zep, and thank you, Genesis.

217
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
With the cash in the bank
and the Pythons in control,

218
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,040
the Holy Grail was good to go.

219
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,040
Lights, camera, action!

220
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,920
Well, sort of.

221
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,160
GILLIAM: The first day of filming
for these two novice directors,

222
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,480
we were up in Glencoe at Seven Sisters,

223
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,880
and we had to carry all the
gear up a mountainside to get to

224
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,240
the Bridge of Death, which
Hamish McInnes and his mountaineers

225
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,480
had built across this wonderful gorge.

226
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,720
And there we are at
the top of this thing,

227
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,560
and almost from the first shot
the camera breaks.

228
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,840
It got worse from there on,
let's say that we...

229
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,480
That ended up being a fairly good day.

230
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,560
The other great discovery on that day,

231
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,080
besides the fact that the camera
wasn't working, Graham Chapman,

232
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,880
who had professed to be
this great mountaineer,

233
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,440
who'd adventure anywhere,

234
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,280
suddenly was terrified of walking
across the bridge and couldn't.

235
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Graham sort of admitted later,
when he gave up drinking,

236
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,240
that he'd had a few drinks that
morning and it was a bit of DTs.

237
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,600
Just shaking a bit at
the prospect of doing it.

238
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,240
Well, you'd need a few
drinks to cross this,

239
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,960
but sober or not, none of the
Pythons fancied making the trip.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,760
It's actually played by
the first assistant director

241
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,960
going across as Graham.
Everything was really funny that day.

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Ask me the questions, bridge
keeper. I'm not afraid!

243
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,120
What is your name? My name
is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

244
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,520
What is your quest?

245
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,360
To seek the Holy Grail.

246
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,280
What is your favourite colour?

247
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Blue.Right, off you go.

248
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,320
Oh, thank you.

249
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,480
We did it very simply.
We just said everybody,

250
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,280
when asked the questions,
they were sort of squatting down.

251
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,520
What is the capital of Assyria?

252
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,200
And when they got the wrong answer,
they would just jump in the air.

253
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,880
I don't know that!

254
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,520
Aaaah!

255
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,520
And then we'd cut to another shot

256
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,520
where we threw a dummy into the gorge.

257
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,280
It couldn't have been cruder,

258
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
and it works!

259
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,120
To anyone who knew anything
about Glencoe, driving through

260
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,760
and seeing the head of Mountain
Rescue throwing people one by one

261
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,440
into this great crevasse would
have seemed a bit sort of worrying!

262
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,360
Also throwing himself into the
film and into the the low budget

263
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,320
was ex-Bonzo Dog Doodah
Band member Neil Innes,

264
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,280
a Python collaborator and musical
adviser from Do Not Adjust Your Set.

265
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,960
This time round, Innes
would not only be playing

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,400
a series of small roles, he'd
also be writing the film's score.

267
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
What are you exactly
contributing to the film? Erm...

268
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,880
Terror and heroics in certain points,
really do a job with the music

269
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,960
to either create the lump in the throat

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,600
or make the back hairs stick out.

271
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,520
Yes, I was going to be doing the music,

272
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,440
but quite frankly that didn't
really sort of excite me that much.

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,000
I've always wanted to do movie music,

274
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,720
but I knew it was such a low budget,
the music budget was only £3,000.

275
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,440
But the budget restrictions would
also help turn an inspirational idea

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,080
into the film's most loved running gag.

277
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
The original sketch that
Terry and I had written,

278
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,480
the horsemen went, "Clippety-clop,"
and someone with coconuts.

279
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,320
And we suddenly thought, "Well,
let's do all the horses like that,

280
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,960
so we don't have to have horses,

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,040
we don't have to be able to ride,
we could save a lot of money,

282
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,360
"no animals on set and
all that sort of thing."

283
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,640
And so the coconuts, which were
originally an economy measure,

284
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,200
became one of the sort of things
people remember most about the film.

285
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
I think the fact that we had

286
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,240
so little money made us
much more inventive,

287
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,080
like the coconuts, you know,
it was a perfect example.

288
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,320
You can't have horses, of course
you can't, so you do coconuts,

289
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
which is funny in itself and also
does make it rather easier to shoot.

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,000
After fierce disagreements
about migrating swallows...

291
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,000
A five-ounce bird could not
carry a one-pound coconut!

292
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,960
Well, it doesn't matter!...wrangling
with politically aware peasants...

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,480
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power

294
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,640
just cos some watery tart
threw a sword at you!

295
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,440
..and conquering the ludicrously
resilient Black Knight...

296
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,720
All right, we'll call it a draw.

297
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,600
..Arthur starts finding
recruits for his Round Table.

298
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,200
First, Bedevere, a knight
wise in the ways of science

299
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,640
with a unique method
of witch finding...

300
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,480
Why do witches burn?

301
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,240
Cos they're made of...wood?Good!

302
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,960
..and an interesting take on geology.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,400
And that, my liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

304
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,800
This new learning amazes me,
Sir Bedevere.

305
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Arthur and his entourage
come face to face with God,

306
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,000
who has a task for them.

307
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,400
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.

308
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,600
Look well, Arthur, for it is
your sacred task to seek this grail.

309
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
That is your purpose, Arthur,

310
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
the quest for the Holy Grail!

311
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,440
A blessing, a blessing from the Lord!

312
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,120
God be praised!

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,600
The king and his knights
set out on their quest,

314
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,240
but if the plot had
finally kicked off

315
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,480
on the screen, off it the duress
of filming was even beginning

316
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,960
to get to the officially
most nicest Python of all.

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,640
It brought out the bad
side of Mike Palin.

318
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Mr Nice was, for a brief moment,
not very,

319
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,880
because we had him as the mud-eater.

320
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,520
For a start, it meant that
you had to be filthy, so you...

321
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,920
you wash in the morning,
you have a shower,

322
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,920
you clean your teeth,
you go onto set

323
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,480
and get mud put all over you,

324
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,640
you know, teeth blacked out.

325
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,280
We actually had placed,
very carefully in the mud,

326
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,160
the edible mud,

327
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,960
but all the mud surrounding it

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,840
seemed to have been pigswill
and shit and piss!

329
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,360
"Oh, don't worry, we've
got you some chocolate.

330
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
"But it's exactly the
same colour as the mud,

331
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,560
"so no-one will be able to tell."

332
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,720
Including me! So I got there,
"Where's the chocolate?"

333
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,560
I'd scoop up a bit, and maybe a half
is chocolate, the other half is mud,

334
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,800
and it seemed to be a
place where pigs shat

335
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,520
and all that sort of thing,
it was just disgusting.

336
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,320
Michael kept stuffing stuff
in his mouth, eating it,

337
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,640
and then Terry Gilliam
would shout, "Cut!"

338
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,200
because the cart had come
in a fraction too early

339
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,400
or a fraction too late,

340
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,600
and by the eighth take...Michael
was hating chewing on this awful mud!

341
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,240
And I went through and I felt very...

342
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,560
And at the end, I said,
"Now, what was wrong with that?

343
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,312
What was wrong with
that?" And they said,

344
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:09,920
"I'm afraid we could just see the
top of the mud-eater's back."

345
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,920
And I just went, "Aaaah!"
you know, and I remember

346
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,880
going completely spare, and I was so
angry I just threw myself in the air,

347
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,307
dropped down into the mud
and just jiggled about in the mud

348
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,143
like some sort of rebel hound
or something like that,

349
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,800
waved my arms and legs around and say,
"I don't want to do this any more!"

350
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,640
and generally had a
rather grand hissy fit.

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,983
And there was a...brief pause,

352
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:38,440
and Graham and John just
spontaneously broke into applause.

353
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
And John says it's one of the very,
very few times he's ever seen me

354
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,440
really lose my temper, and
he was mightily impressed.

355
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,040
Alas, Palin's medley of mud
and pigshit had been for nothing

356
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,520
with the scene mostly ending
up on the cutting-room floor.

357
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,344
Ouch!

358
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:57,480
But at least he had a warm bath to
look forward to at the end of the day.

359
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,040
When the first assistant
director shouted,

360
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,400
"Cut, that's a wrap!"

361
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,520
there was this extraordinary rush,
people sprinted to all the vehicles

362
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,404
that were there to try
and get back to the hotel,

363
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:14,760
because there was only enough
hot water for half the crew.

364
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,560
Here we were out in Scotland,
and it was cold and it was wet

365
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,000
and it was sunny and it was
dirty and it was everything,

366
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,129
and it was really an unpleasant
life for certain urbanites

367
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,240
that happened to be
living in the group.

368
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,749
And where Terry and I
wallowed in the mud,

369
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm afraid John, Graham
and Eric didn't!

370
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,000
John and I struck
out for pastures new.

371
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,840
We found something called
the Hydro Hotel in...

372
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,201
not far away, about 20 minutes
away, and we moved in there,

373
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:46,080
and everybody was, "Are you
going to leave us all?"

374
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,120
We'd go, "No, we just want
a hot bath, you know, gosh!"

375
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,311
And so we moved in,
and as we got there,

376
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:54,720
there were all these beautiful
women just walked in and arrived,

377
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,760
and we went, "Lucky, really!"
And they were in our movie.

378
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,160
Leading those beautiful women was
Python favourite Carol Cleveland,

379
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,500
a regular in the TV shows
whenever a real woman was needed

380
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:08,480
instead of one of
the lads in drag.

381
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,960
Carol had featured in ITV series
like The Saint and Man In A Suitcase

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
before comedy opportunities
came her way.

383
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,280
One thing to another,
I found myself at the BBC,

384
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
doing a fair amount of work
being a glam stooge to people

385
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,440
like Ronnie Corbett, Ronnie Barker,
Spike Milligan, Charlie Drake, who

386
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,480
used to have his little nose right
there in my cleavage, I remember.

387
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,160
And, well, then the Pythons
heard about me.

388
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
Carol was great.

389
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Carol, within Python, was the only
woman we ever had that seemed to be

390
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,200
able to get the comedy and be beautiful
and fit in with everybody else.

391
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,560
No matter what we did to her,
she just sat in there beautifully.

392
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,280
I remember saying to
my husband at the time,

393
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,560
"Well, I don't know about this show.

394
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,120
"I don't think there'll be more
than five episodes, actually."

395
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,240
How wrong I was, happily!

396
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,960
Castle Anthrax, I wrote, of course,

397
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,520
because I was determined to get
some sex in Python for once.

398
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,080
Welcome, gentle sir knight.

399
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,400
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

400
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,920
The Castle Anthrax?

401
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
Yes. It's not a very good name, is it?

402
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,880
Oh, but we are nice, and we will
attend to your every, every need.

403
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,480
You are the keepers
of the Holy Grail?

404
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,440
The what? She was really
terrific in Castle Anthrax.

405
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,240
She just had that right attitude
 of sort of slightly

406
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,400
dominating, but a little bit
sort of enticing at the same time.

407
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
Zoot was a lady who was in charge of a

408
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,440
huge number of virgins aged
between 16 and 19 and a half.

409
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,640
I remember how incredibly
unsexy it all was.

410
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,768
It just seemed wonderful
in the script and all that,

411
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:56,224
all these girls would be on the bed

412
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:59,360
and sort of... you know,
caressing you and all that.

413
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,160
They're doctors?

414
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,520
As always, with filming, anything like
that gets reduced to a sort of job.

415
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,240
It's a bit like mending the
plumbing or something like that.

416
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,240
Dr Piglet, Dr Winston,
practise your art.

417
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,836
It was far from being the
wonderful full-on orgy

418
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,840
that I expected
when I wrote it.

419
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
Try to relax.

420
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,200
Are you sure that's absolutely
necessary? We must examine you.

421
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,200
There's nothing wrong with that.
Please, we are doctors.

422
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,146
We had about five takes as
he's being dragged away,

423
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,000
and we're just there
going, "Oh, oh!"

424
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,680
In the final take,
I just threw in at the end...

425
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,720
Shit! And everybody laughed and
they kept it in, which was quite fun.

426
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
My little bit of improvising
in the film.

427
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,520
It's my duty to sample
as much peril as I can.

428
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,120
We've got to find the Holy Grail. Come
on. Can't we have a bit of peril? No.

429
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,080
It's unhealthy. Bet you're gay.

430
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,680
No, I'm not.

431
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,400
There was tension in the air.

432
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,920
It didn't seem like a happy company.

433
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,880
The crew were very quiet
and looked a bit disgruntled.

434
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,840
I then discovered that the crew
in fact were on the verge of...

435
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,000
downing tools. There was nearly a
mutiny, because they got so fed up

436
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,640
with having these two directors who
seemed to be at odds with each other.

437
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,360
Two directors, a double-headed dog.

438
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,200
It was interesting, because
Terry and I seemed to be in

439
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,000
agreement about everything
before we started shooting.

440
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,160
About life, the cosmos, everything.

441
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,000
And as we started shooting,
it was clear that sometimes

442
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,120
we were saying opposite things
to the others in the group.

443
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,280
It's a dogsbody's job, directing.

444
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,960
It really is.

445
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,666
You've got to organise
things and work out

446
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:55,120
what you're doing in the morning.
It's a thankless task.

447
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,200
We do tag team directing.

448
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,122
He finishes that, and he'll come out

449
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:02,440
and exhaustedly tap me on the
shoulder, and I'll rush into action.

450
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,240
But you treat him with proper respect?

451
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,320
Well... HE LAUGHS

452
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,440
Well...there's never
been any mutual respect

453
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,280
within the Python group at all,
as you probably know.

454
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,000
But we're withholding a lot of the
criticism we would normally be making.

455
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,573
Terry and Terry Gilliam,
particularly Terry Gilliam,

456
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:25,040
was so enjoying the visual
look of it and all that.

457
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,529
And they sometimes had trouble
persuading someone like John

458
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,721
that it was very important to
crouch for another 12 minutes

459
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,320
so they could get the sun glancing
off the top of his helmet.

460
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,720
He didn't see the aesthetic value
of that particular shot.

461
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,160
He just felt it was very
uncomfortable. But he is tall,

462
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,320
and bending down is probably
more difficult for him.

463
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,400
The only thing that seemed to
matter was the look of the shot.

464
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,320
I did a take with Eric where
Eric was playing Concorde.

465
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,200
Come on, Concorde! ARROW THWACKS

466
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,840
Message for you, sir.

467
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,440
Concorde! Concorde, speak to me!

468
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,320
'I want you to realise that when
making a movie, you only do about'

469
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,240
three or four really good takes in
the whole movie, when it all flows.

470
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,400
When we did one, I was so proud.
I thought, "That was a great take."

471
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,360
Brave, brave Concorde!

472
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,520
You shall not have died in vain.

473
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,760
Er, I'm not quite dead, sir.

474
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,520
Well, you shall not have
been mortally wounded in vain.

475
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,280
I think I could pull through, sir.

476
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,080
Oh, I see.Actually, I think
I'm all right to come with you.

477
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,080
No, sweet Concorde, stay here.

478
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,671
I will send help as soon
as I've accomplished

479
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:44,440
a daring and heroic rescue
in my own particular...

480
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,440
Oh...

481
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,360
Idiom, sir?Idiom!

482
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I feel fine, actually...
Farewell, sweet Concorde!

483
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,760
I said, "How about that?"

484
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,920
And the cameraman and Terry
Jones said, "Not enough smoke."

485
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,120
And that kind of incensed me,

486
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,200
because I care about the writing,
the ideas and the performance.

487
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,520
So from then on, I made a
lot of sarcastic remarks.

488
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,600
"Was the smoke funny
enough in that take?"

489
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,680
So there was a bit of a tension
between the people who cared how

490
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,280
it looked and the people who were more
interested in what the film was about.

491
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,546
I think the moment it finally snapped
was when we were doing the scene

492
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,236
where the taunters are
pelting the knights

493
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:36,240
with cows and sheep and
everything over the battlements.

494
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,438
It was a
matte shot,

495
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:40,636
so I had to get everybody below
the parapet of the castle

496
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:46,200
so I could then cut a matte out and
throw these toy animals over later.

497
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Which meant digging a hole in
the ground to get low enough.

498
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,920
The others in the group had to be on
their knees to get these angles right.

499
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,640
John and Graham were the first to go,
and just got so angry

500
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,920
with me for these uncomfortable
positions I was putting them in.

501
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,840
I said, "This is your sketch.
I didn't write this sketch.

502
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,880
"I'm trying to make it work.
If you don't like it, I'm off".

503
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,808
I know I was a bit mean to
Terry Gilliam on one occasion,

504
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,328
because Terry was used to doing
animation and having these cut-outs,

505
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,505
and he would move
the cut-out a fraction

506
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,680
and then move another
cut-out a fraction.

507
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,400
He had a tendency to treat
the actors a bit like that.

508
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
He would say, "Can you
move a bit to the left?"

509
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,520
And we would do that and
 he'd say, "Back a bit".

510
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,320
And this would go on... for 15 minutes!

511
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,000
Once, I think I sort of exploded.

512
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,640
I said, "Will you get on with it?

513
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,800
"We're so uncomfortable!"

514
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,520
And I think that hurt his feelings,
poor chap, and he went and lay down.

515
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,640
I went off in a snit and lay down
in the grass some distance away.

516
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,400
"I'm not gonna play."
And Terry had to deal with him.

517
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,560
That was the moment that split it.

518
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,840
Terry Jones, I have to say,
was always slightly

519
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,760
more aware of the actors, being one
of the actors, being involved all the

520
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,519
time and having to
do a bit of directing

521
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,080
and then rush around and
be Sir Bedevere and all that.

522
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,320
What do you find is the most difficult
part of sustaining the effort?

523
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Getting up.In the morning?

524
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Yes, and putting clothes on.

525
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,360
It seemed to me the comedy
would be more effective

526
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,285
if you believed in that
world, if that world smelt

527
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:28,560
and you could taste
it and it was there.

528
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,640
Then you could do the most silly
things within that, and that

529
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,560
would give the comedy more weight.
I still think that's true.

530
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,701
They really did a
fantastic job.

531
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:46,880
When you see that boat sweeping in,
you think, "This is a proper movie."

532
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,956
And then it goes
back to being silly.

533
00:28:48,957 --> 00:28:52,600
But it's the properness of the movie
which sets it all up, I think.

534
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,440
After encountering the notorious
knights who say "Ni!",

535
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,000
Arthur and his noblemen embark
on one last push to find the Grail.

536
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,040
They meet Tim the Enchanter,
fight a killer rabbit,

537
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,520
throw the holy hand grenade,
cross the bridge of death before...

538
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,040
Jesus Christ!

539
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Baa!

540
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,287
Hello, dirty English knig-gets
and Monsieur Arthur King

541
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,040
who has the brain of a duck!

542
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
I came up with the ending.

543
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,040
I think it was just
out of desperation.

544
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,560
We were going towards a battle,
and we couldn't afford an army.

545
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,280
THEY YELL

546
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,292
I think they're something
like 25 students

547
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:37,480
from one university nearby who
are pretending to be the army.

548
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,640
SIREN

549
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,880
They're the ones, I'm sure!

550
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,800
I came up with the idea of
having the police arrest us.

551
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
Come on.

552
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,600
So it gets kind of conceptual.
I like that.

553
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,560
All right, sonny, that's enough.

554
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,040
CAMERA SMASHES

555
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,800
Injecting that modern character in,
I think, helped, made it very...

556
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,514
gave it the sense
of Python humour,

557
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:13,120
but also gave us a way of bringing
the whole thing to an end.

558
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,120
Bring the police in, arrest
everybody and stop the film.

559
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,120
That just seems so neat.

560
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,760
Once that idea had come up,
you couldn't resist it.

561
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,080
The decision to end it the
way they did is pretty brave.

562
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,720
I mean, we had some...and continue
to have very confused some audiences

563
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,720
who don't know when
to leave the theatre.

564
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,081
With the hardships and tensions
of filming behind them,

565
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,920
the suffering was surely over.

566
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,561
The Pythons could sit
back, ready to bask

567
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:44,920
in the warm glow of
audience approval.

568
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
End board.

569
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,520
We had a screening for the investors
after the soundtrack was mixed,

570
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,600
and it was probably

571
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,360
one of the worst events
I've ever had to attend,

572
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,944
because after the first couple of
minutes where there was some laughter,

573
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:11,080
it kind of sank into a quietness
for about 85 minutes.

574
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,571
By the end, it was almost embarrassing,

575
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,280
'cause no-one quite
knew where to look and

576
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,280
what to say to anybody at that stage.

577
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,596
It was one of those moments
where you think,

578
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:25,720
"God, what have we
done, after all this?"

579
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,400
And then it turns on Terry and me.

580
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,400
That's the problem when you're
the director. It was absolute death.

581
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I mean, the film was just...

582
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,920
not working.
And we'd spent all the money.

583
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,792
We had mixed the whole soundtrack.

584
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:42,880
This was music, dialogue,
everything but making the print.

585
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,163
Neil was the one that maybe
got the short end of the stick,

586
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:48,000
because he had written more music

587
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,960
that was then pulled off at
the last moment, because it

588
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,520
ended up...they got library
music that was more epic.

589
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,520
We just picked the music
that sounded like

590
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:04,480
old Hollywood films,
I mean, old medieval movies.

591
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,280
The decision to use library
music was the right one.

592
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,800
It is mock heroic,
so you want "Bom-da-da!"

593
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,480
Even though it was boring,

594
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,200
"Bom da dum da da da dum, dum,
dum, dum-dum, da-da-da dum."

595
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,920
It's not anywhere nearly as good as...

596
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,800
HE SINGS TUNE

597
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,280
Oh, the battles.

598
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,280
Oh, dear. If only...I'm sorry.

599
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm...becoming...overcome
with...self-pity.

600
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,983
Monty Python And The Holy Grail

601
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:38,360
had finally scraped
over the finishing line.

602
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
The dirty half-dozen had battled
with adversity, chaotic filming and

603
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,120
each other, but now they decided to
take one final, but fateful, risk.

604
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,520
Instead of premiering the film on home
turf, they would take it to New York.

605
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,198
Flying Circus had just
hit US TV screens,

606
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:57,840
but would the Americans turn
up to see them on celluloid?

607
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,528
When we got to New York, there were
people riding up and down Fifth Avenue,

608
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:05,810
clicking coconuts with banners saying,
"If you come and see this film,

609
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:08,280
the first thousand people
will get coconuts."

610
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,647
I remember being in New York,

611
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:14,680
and suddenly we were in
this hotel and people said,

612
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,978
"You gotta come and see
it" and you looked out

613
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:19,800
and there was this queue going
all the way round the block.

614
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,560
And all day long, it kept
going and going and going.

615
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,560
We were trapped inside the
theatre for the rest of the day.

616
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
People would come out and we'd
sign their bloody coconuts.

617
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,840
Impossible, by the way,
to sign a coconut.

618
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,680
Python breaking in America as it
did in '73-'74, was so important,

619
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,520
because suddenly we had
a whole new fan base.

620
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,160
And they discovered the series,
and suddenly we had this movie.

621
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
It really was one of the most
amazing days of my life, I think.

622
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,240
It was that sort of relief that
not only was it working, but it was

623
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,920
working on some extraordinary level
that we'd never realised was possible.

624
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,000
And it just grew from there.

625
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,600
And people loved it.

626
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,320
"Hey, these guys make films as well."
Good timing.

627
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,000
It was better than good.
Cracking the US market put

628
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,160
the Pythons on the road from cult
status to the comedy hall of fame.

629
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,480
The success of Holy Grail led to
Life Of Brian and The Meaning Of Life.

630
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,577
And they followed in the footsteps
of their rock investors

631
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:21,360
by selling out the
Hollywood Bowl.

632
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,360
# I'm a lumberjack, and I'm OK

633
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,680
# I sleep all night and I work all day

634
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,840
#I cut down trees... #

635
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,951
The boys have gone on to
prove that they could enjoy

636
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:33,680
separate careers and a
life after Monty Python.

637
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,640
Cardboard box...You're lucky.

638
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,912
John Cleese's first
stop in fleeing Python

639
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:41,043
was a little known
guesthouse in Torquay,

640
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:45,320
which he ran for a bit before heading
a lot further west to California.

641
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,122
He's not been forgotten
at home, though,

642
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:49,400
and still gets a bit of work
here from time to time.

643
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,960
Michael Palin's desire not to
be recognised saw him sail

644
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,320
all the way to the ends
of the Earth and back.

645
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,380
But his postcards home
proved so popular

646
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:05,040
that we keep sending
him away again.

647
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,280
How pay much she her you do.

648
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,120
Pebble number one three,
Bering Sea, ocean, sky.

649
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,480
Palin here, very cold, chill.

650
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,800
Terry Gilliam went back to America
to direct several big movies with

651
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,880
big visual ideas that sometimes
proved a bit too big for their budgets.

652
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,320
Terry Jones' overseas escapades
have taken him to Portuguese opera,

653
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,800
but he still enjoys the odd
spot of medieval merrymaking.

654
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,240
It appears that his great musical
talent lay in farting tunes.

655
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,960
Graham Chapman declined to give
an interview for this programme,

656
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,320
mostly because he shuffled
off to a better place in 1989.

657
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,880
His pals marked his passing
with due reverence.

658
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,440
Good riddance to him, the freeloading
bastard. I hope he fries.

659
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,453
Eric Idle's personal quest
took him from Rutland to LA,

660
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:01,166
where he finally found the Holy Grail

661
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:04,176
by lovingly ripping off
a half-remembered film

662
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:07,320
he'd once appeared in for a
musical called Spamalot.

663
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,336
I remember sitting there on the opening
night on Broadway and thinking,

664
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:14,606
"It's so gloriously
good-natured and silly

665
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:17,440
that it fills you with a kind of joy."

666
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,360
I don't think any of us were prepared

667
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
for what a success it was on stage.

668
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,693
Again, it caught the spirit of Python.

669
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:29,120
It was very fast, it was
jolly, silly, well done.

670
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,360
There was lots to watch and see.
That's what's important.

671
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,920
You can't do Python without
some sort of commitment.

672
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
As Spamalot makes its
triumphant coconut-shod way

673
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,624
from Broadway to London and beyond,

674
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,560
a new audience has discovered the
original material, and Monty Python

675
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,120
And The Holy Grail is once again
winning fans across the world.

676
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,713
Not bad for a film made
over 30 years ago

677
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:53,800
on a shoestring budget by
a bunch of movie novices.

678
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,507
There was something very
magical about this film

679
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,120
in that sense about how
everything came together

680
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,230
both in the filming,
the talents that came together

681
00:37:02,231 --> 00:37:04,720
and eventually how it
reached an audience.

682
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,160
It was our utter naivety and high
energy that produced this thing.

683
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,600
And I look back and say,
"I could never do that now.

684
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
"Those were other guys that did it".

685
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,120
But there was no stopping us.

686
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,914
What has been truly
wonderful is that I was

687
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:23,280
working with people who were
totally committed to what

688
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,760
they were doing, and committed to try
and make the very best of something.

689
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,412
The general kind of
spirit of Holy Grail,

690
00:37:31,413 --> 00:37:34,680
I think, now comes
through very well.

691
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,800
It's a good-natured film.

692
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,960
It's a silly film, held together very
much by Graham's performance.

693
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,680
How do you know so much about swallows?

694
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,240
You have to know these
things when you're a king.

695
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,480
I think it is probably closer
to a kind of reality

696
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,320
of our characters than
almost anything we've done.

697
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,440
John is a very angry Lancelot
who comes charging at things.

698
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,560
I do like to run away a lot,
you know, with a musician.

699
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,160
Michael, I think, is constantly tempted
by young women wearing very little.

700
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,360
And Gilliam is clearly Patsy
and Terry Jones is a sort of Bedevere,

701
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,280
constantly doing this and...you know.

702
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,080
It was extraordinarily demanding
physically, but we were young.

703
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,920
If I tried to do it now,
I'd be in hospital in two weeks.

704
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,880
I just have to write "Ni!"

705
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,240
on an autograph book, and people think

706
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,568
that's the funniest
thing you've ever done,

707
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:37,480
which saves you having to
write a very unfunny message.

708
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,800
Just say "Ni!" and people like it. Ni!
