1
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,052
Fucking hell, man.

2
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,250
- Where's the love, man?
- Somebody's got a problem.

3
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,587
Rich, you're driving like my fucking
granny, and my granny's dead.

4
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,961
- Sure, look at that car.
- And my granny's dead.

5
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,836
- Oh, my God!
- That is a Mustang.

6
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,510
- I did defend him.
- He still got slagged.

7
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,674
And everybody was still a bollocks
to him. That's not my fault.

8
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,636
- You failed in your mission.
- Yeah, I did, man. I did.

9
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,926
You should... You should just give up
your armband as class captain.

10
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,168
Because you fucked up.

11
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,420
Right, I'm fucking dropping
the two of youse off.

12
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,960
Oh, my God, man.

13
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,838
That was her first shot at that
and you just shot her down straight away.

14
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,588
You can make him a sandwich.
Whatever is gonna be nice, you think,

15
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,052
and you're just gonna have it.
That was nothing.

16
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,501
Well, no, I'm dressing it first
and then we're adding...

17
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,878
He likes to dress things before he...

18
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,425
Eat it anyway.

19
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:48,842
Yeah, well, maybe you'd like to eat it
when you farted on it.

20
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,052
- Chicken fillets, yeah?
- Yeah, for me.

21
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,840
You seriously didn't get mine?

22
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,091
You fucking...
What the fuck did I say to you?

23
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,917
- When are you going on your break?
- I'm going right now.

24
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,420
- "When's your break?"
- "I'm on my break now."

25
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,215
"You're on your break..."

26
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,880
Oh, here. Wait, wait, wait...

27
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,089
Jakesy.

28
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,302
- You alright, man?
- How's things?

29
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,296
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Are you well? What are you doing

30
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,840
- for the rest of the afternoon?
- Nothing.

31
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,211
OK, look. See that card?
All you have to do is...

32
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,755
- Take it?
- No, don't take it.

33
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,128
All you have to do
is give it a little rub.

34
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,551
- That is savage. Absolutely class.
- Slick, isn't he? He's slick.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,834
- Stop doing that. Fuck's sake.
- How did you fold that, though?

36
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,548
No.

37
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,717
- Hey, ladies.
- Guys, so nice of you to show up.

38
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,087
- Hey there, pecs.
- Thanks for having us down.

39
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,502
No worries, it'll be good.

40
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,050
- Who's the baby?
- This, ladies, is Magic Boy.

41
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,885
- Jake.
- Alright?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,298
He's the coolest.
Take care of him, yeah?

43
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:06,919
- What's your name?
- Jake.

44
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,256
This is the gaff.

45
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,300
- Stop being a retard.
- Rich, this is so adorable.

46
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,294
Done. I got it. I got it!

47
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,714
Bagsy top bunk.

48
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,170
Somebody said
there was a party here, lads.

49
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,215
- Hey, Ois.
- Come here to me, buddy.

50
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,256
- Good to see you. Alright?
- Good, man.

51
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,174
How's form? Alright, lads?
How's things?

52
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,840
- Hey, superstar.
- Hey, Sophie.

53
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,586
- What's going on? How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

54
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,008
- Yeah? Does your da know you're here?
- Come meet my friends.

55
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,503
- They'll freak the fuck...
- Jake, come here.

56
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,968
- This is Richard.
- Hey.

57
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,337
How are you? Rich. Nice to meet you.
How's it going, man?

58
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,961
Jake, do you know Sophie, by the way?
Have you met?

59
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,256
- Yeah, I've seen you before.
- How are you?

60
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,210
I definitely won't be going for a swim.

61
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,131
- So would you, Rich?
- What?

62
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,085
Sophie Kilroy.

63
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,427
- Fuck off, man.
- Of course he would.

64
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,467
- She's Pat's daughter, lads.
- And? You love him.

65
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,588
It would be like shagging your idol,
only not going gay, you know.

66
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,506
- Hey, Conor.
- Hey.

67
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,922
Conor, I'm freezing.

68
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,340
Oh, my God, Lara.

69
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,552
- Hi!
- Hi, Con-man, what's up?

70
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,419
Super-Rich. What's the craic?

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,594
I didn't know you guys were here.

72
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,545
Alright, lads.
I'm gonna go and be sociable.

73
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,631
Do you want a drink
or something?

74
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,136
- Hey, guys. Can I grab a water?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,843
Nice. Thanks.

76
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,709
Sorry, do you guys know each other?
Lara Hogan, this is Richard Karlsen.

77
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,210
- Hey.
- Hi.

78
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,802
- You down for long?
- Just tonight.

79
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,966
- Where are you staying at?
- Tent City.

80
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,542
- And yourself'?
- Just over by the pub over there.

81
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,044
There's a pub?

82
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,210
With a roof?

83
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,752
Here, where's Jake?

84
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,969
Here, man.
Look, you look about 12. Take that off.

85
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,634
Con.

86
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,344
Con-man. I got my invitation
to your party.

87
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,758
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man. Nice photo collage.

88
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,049
Everybody looks a twat in their
communion photos, to be fair.

89
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:50,011
I bet you looked shit cool
in yours, though, Rich.

90
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,551
Come to think of it, maybe I did.

91
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,841
- If I see a drink in his hand...
- No, we're all over 18.

92
00:05:55,958 --> 00:06:00,839
- Fine, but I won't serve children.
- I may look young, but I'm old money.

93
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,920
- It's Coke.
- Better be.

94
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,421
And no flashing your mickeys.
I know what you rugby lads are like.

95
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,715
You know I wouldn't allow that, Fiona.

96
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,093
Nice one, man.

97
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,841
- Told you I was shit.
- No, it was brilliant.

98
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,631
It was gorgeous.

99
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,926
Going for a smoke, man.

100
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,756
Oh, thanks.

101
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,502
Here.

102
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,967
Thank you.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,593
Here you are.

104
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,507
- I don't actually smoke.
- You're cutting loose?

105
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,629
Yeah, I'm going totally wild.

106
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,002
Go, Conor.

107
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,090
You're not a fan?

108
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:46,920
I just don't get the whole "lost
in the Celtic mists" intensity of it.

109
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,632
Plus, nobody knows
what the fuck he's saying.

110
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,008
- "I'm asleep and don't wake me."
- Well, I obviously got that bit.

111
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,798
Obviously.

112
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,297
Alright?

113
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,005
- Hey.
- What's up?

114
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,131
Just answer it.

115
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,876
- Magic Boy's mum's freaking out.
- You didn't check in, man?

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,253
- Get blazed.
- Give me that.

117
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,426
Richard Karlsen to the rescue.

118
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,761
Mrs Galvin.
Richard Karlsen here.

119
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,129
Yeah, Jake's grand. He's with me.

120
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,459
It's just this kind of unofficial
Raglan tradition we do.

121
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,086
We grab the Js
and bring the lads down the country

122
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,542
to show them what it's like
to be on the senior team.

123
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,011
Oh, yeah, he's being well looked after.

124
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:42,211
We've got a couple of fine Raglan boys
down here just watching out for him.

125
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,801
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:47,091
- He was out there working away and...
- Give me some magic.

127
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,917
He's brilliant. Exceptional.
He's a real credit to you, I must say.

128
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:52,919
I did indeed do it myself, yeah.

129
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:55,795
I want to see your titties.

130
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:56,964
Yeah.

131
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,552
I'll have him call you
first thing in the morning.

132
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,511
- Show me your tricks.
- Bye-bye.

133
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,840
Outstanding. What a performance...

134
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,292
- Fucking hell.
- How did you not break?

135
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,753
- Fucking idiot.
- How did you not break, man?

136
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,298
- Fair play.
- Fair play.

137
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,634
What's the teams?

138
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,627
I'll go with you. I'm not losing again.

139
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,548
You're shit when you play together.

140
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,921
You are the worst pool players
I've ever seen in my life.

141
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,219
I'm just gonna grab a beer.
Give me one sec.

142
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,052
Hey, man, Soph's in trouble.
Just come here.

143
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,344
Bye, guys.

144
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,131
- Sophie?
- Get lost.

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,174
- Come on, man, open the door.
- Fuck you.

146
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,545
Fuck off, she's a fucking kid.

147
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,920
Stay there.

148
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,919
- Sophie, come on.
- Just leave me alone.

149
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,795
Let's go. Come on. It's over now.

150
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,048
Come on.

151
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,380
- I like being carried by you.
- Sophie, behave.

152
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,172
Here's the good Samaritan man.

153
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,511
- Have a good time, did you?
- Alright.

154
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,795
- How's it going?
- Anyone want a nightcap?

155
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,136
Fuck off, I'm on my break.

156
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,835
I think that lads in general actually
wanna get on with each other,

157
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,928
- as opposed to girls who naturally...
- They just like to...

158
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:49,377
It's like that thing about horses.
Do you know what I mean? Apparently...

159
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,925
Apparently horses, right,
naturally exclude one another.

160
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,591
So if there's three horses in a field,

161
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,837
two of them will stick together
and shun the other one.

162
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,758
It's true. Like us, as in, you know,
we sort of hate each other.

163
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,425
Without getting too fucking gay
about it, right,

164
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,876
I'd talk to you lads
about pretty much anything.

165
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,834
Have you ever seen girls
in a bathroom together

166
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,552
talking about one of them being bulimic?

167
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,590
I don't walk into girls' bathrooms.

168
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:24,009
It's not funny, but it's fucking funny.
Seriously.

169
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,297
When have you done this?

170
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,170
It was a mate's gaff.
I went up to the jacks.

171
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,795
I walked in and I was like,
"Is it OK if I'm in here?"

172
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:34,797
There were people drinking everywhere
in the house so I said, "Is it OK?"

173
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:38,467
They're in there and it's like...
They were sobbing, and I was like,

174
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,086
"I wanna sit down
and see what's going on here."

175
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,714
They're like, "Oh, my God,
please just stop vomiting all the time."

176
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,803
"it's upsetting me.
Why can't you stop vomiting?"

177
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,887
"I think I've got it under control."
And I'm like...

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,709
"Are you fucking serious?"
It's creepy, man. That's creepy shit.

179
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,133
- But for them, that's talking.
- Exactly.

180
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,507
This doesn't classify as talking because
we're not talking about fucked-up stuff.

181
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,004
We're not all depressed, so it's not
talking. Do you know what I mean?

182
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,425
Like, you have to be upset
to have a chat.

183
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,715
Fuck that, like.

184
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,301
Oh, he's through!

185
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,427
Stop... Put me down.

186
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,544
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,840
They're doing it here on the beach.

188
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,167
- Hey, Liv.
- Hey, sweetheart.

189
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,511
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good to see you.

190
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,172
- And you.
- Aw.

191
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,587
I just wanted to say thanks
for the other day. Sophie told me.

192
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,756
Oh, yeah. That's no problem.

193
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,924
- Does her dad know?
- She was "at her mother's".

194
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:32,219
Pat's dying to see you. He'll probably
be all restrained and Protestant.

195
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,423
- So?
- So what?

196
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,385
So, any women in your life?

197
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,712
- I'm very close to my mum.
- Come on.

198
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,461
I'm a bit sick
of all the silly stuff, Liv.

199
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,961
At 18?

200
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,461
- There he is now.
- Hey, good to see you.

201
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,675
What's going on?

202
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,261
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Thanks for having us.

203
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,584
- What's the water like?
- It's fucking Baltic.

204
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,678
- Look what the tide washed in.
- Hey, Mum.

205
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,511
- Did you enjoy the free gaff?
- Yeah, can't complain.

206
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,552
Hello, beautiful son.

207
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,169
Hey, old Dad.

208
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,881
(Pat? This looks fantastic.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,504
- I think that's mine, actually.
- I remember you buying it.

210
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,469
Take it easy on them brews,
you're putting on weight.

211
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,551
One beer's not gonna do him any harm.

212
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,546
It's the boy refusing a drink
that he's competing against.

213
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,466
I know that boy. That's the boy
without friends, isn't it?

214
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:26,793
Skol!

215
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:30,296
Cheers, Peter. I've spent
six years teaching him to be a winner.

216
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,761
Success is good. I like success.

217
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,219
- Failure's not an option.
- That's it.

218
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,836
Failure's not an option,
it's a certainty.

219
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,882
- Here we go.
- It is, at some point, for most people.

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,843
- It makes them human.
- It's true.

221
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,508
Very deep, that. All those
long winter nights back in the day?

222
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,378
- A Scandinavian thing, I reckon.
- Big Scandinavian...

223
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,334
No, it's not a Scandinavian thing.
It's just a manic depressive thing.

224
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,543
- Skol.
- Slàinte.

225
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,964
- Slàinte.
- Skol.

226
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,551
Come on.

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,050
Dad, it is not warm out here. Alright?
It's not warm today.

228
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,795
- I thought you played rugby.
- I do play rugby.

229
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,170
That doesn't mean
I like the fucking cold.

230
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,510
Come on.

231
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,962
Yeah! Way to go, son.

232
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,261
You'll make a singer
out of me yet, Dad.

233
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,924
- What?
- You'll make a singer out of me yet.

234
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,544
Well, I'm not staying long.

235
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,799
Thanks very much, cheers.
See you again.

236
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:56,342
So, remind me, Richard.
Why are we here?

237
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,917
Because Conor's a team-mate of mine
and that means something, Eimear.

238
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,465
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Alright?

239
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,380
God, what is it with GAA jerseys?
They're always so fucking rank.

240
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,835
It's like they deliberately pick
the foulest shade of each colour.

241
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,041
Could you guys say it
any fucking louder?

242
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,503
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Hey.

243
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,172
- Alright'?
- For the day.

244
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,044
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday.

245
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,965
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

246
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,381
- Mr H, how are you?
- How's it going, son?

247
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,468
- Will you have a pint?
- I won't, I won't.

248
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,052
- Richard.
- Mrs Harris. You're looking great.

249
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,459
Go on! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

250
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,677
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

251
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:03,297
- 0-8-5-0-1-0-7-7-7-7.
- Sorry?

252
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,636
- It's my number.
- You're fast.

253
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,300
Zero-8-5...

254
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:12,011
- Richard, you're so full of shit.
- I am.

255
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,504
But I'm gonna tell you my number
again. If you remember it, great.

256
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,252
If you don't...

257
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,844
Fine, but my memory's like a sieve.

258
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,087
- Hey, how's it going?
- Never better. It's my birthday, right?

259
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,927
- How are you, Lara?
- Good.

260
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,010
- Super-Rich?
- I'm good, man.

261
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,299
- I thought you weren't drinking.
- Yeah, me too.

262
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,585
Conor, easy.

263
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,799
- You alright, Con-man?
- Yeah, sound, man.

264
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,128
No, you're not. Come on.

265
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,718
I'm fine, I'm fine.

266
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,969
Come on, we'll go back inside.

267
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,544
- Hey-
- Hey-

268
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,637
- How is he?
- Miserable. Walking it off.

269
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,959
- Everyone gets fucked up on their 18th.
- I suppose.

270
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,711
- He'll be grand.
- Yeah.

271
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,252
I better go.

272
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,544
Yeah.

273
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,381
- Bye, Lara.
- Safe home.

274
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:25,501
- What the fuck are you doing?
- The right thing. You should try it.

275
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,504
- Hello.
- Hey.

276
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,253
- I rang the door but...
- Erm...

277
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,545
Right, so, here's what I got
for you, OK?

278
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,672
I got... some red wine, right?
That's laid out on the table.

279
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:58,796
Best steaks in Wicklow
marinating right there.

280
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:02,717
Erm, I got you some salads,
some really nice French bread,

281
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,339
and I laid these out just in case
the sun decides to pop out. Alright?

282
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,886
We were supposed to eat first.

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,719
You should have emailed me
a copy of the schedule.

284
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,965
Just give me one sec, OK?
Just one sec.

285
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,669
You stay there. Don't go away.

286
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,717
I used to have a gerbil
that I won at, like, the day fair.

287
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,383
So I brought him home. I was only
about four and I called him Peter.

288
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,547
Right?

289
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,297
At the end of the day... I only bought
him that day, but at the end of the day,

290
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,170
I wanted to wash him
because I thought he needed a shower.

291
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,386
Shh! Listen.

292
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,334
First, I made him a little bed
in, like, a tissue box, right?

293
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,667
With tissue paper
and tiny little pillows.

294
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:34,422
And then I brought him into give him
a shower... well, a bath pretty much,

295
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:39,298
but I gave him a bath in a shot glass.
And I washed his arse first,

296
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:43,718
and then I thought that his head
would need to be washed. And he died.

297
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,881
I drowned him.

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,334
He was dead when he came out
of the fucking shot glass.

299
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,509
It's true.

300
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,717
What age were you?

301
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,382
About four or five. Fucking killed him.

302
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,674
All I was trying to do
was give him a bath as well.

303
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:03,252
Washed his head for too long...
and he drowned in a shot glass.

304
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,383
Fucking hell,
that is not a nice way to go.

305
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,130
Apparently it's peaceful... to drown.

306
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,548
Being drowned in a shot glass?

307
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,339
Yeah, I'd say he loved it.

308
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,257
How do gerbils usually wash?

309
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,252
Are you OK?

310
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,672
Uh-huh.

311
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:56,168
And I wrote, like, something like,
"They were dawdling,"

312
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:59,466
and everyone started laughing at me,
saying I made up that word.

313
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,917
And I was like,
"That is definitely a word."

314
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,131
- You made it up.
- No, it is a word.

315
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,424
Like, weird shit happens sometimes.

316
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,135
- Do you know?
- Yeah, that...

317
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,333
One night when I was going to sleep,
my wardrobe opened by itself

318
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,382
and all the shit fell out of my wardrobe
onto my bed.

319
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,844
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was weird.

320
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,917
That would... I wouldn't be able
to sleep. That's real creepy.

321
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:28,252
I slept with my mam then
for about, like, a month after that.

322
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,503
- What age were you?
- About seven or eight.

323
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,877
Aw.

324
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,919
Quick.

325
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,798
Its a really big house, like
a plantation house down in the country

326
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,011
with loads of land and horses

327
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,753
and fields and trees and rivers
and shit around it.

328
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,424
- And is there a fence?
- No.

329
00:25:56,542 --> 00:26:00,342
OK. You're at the kitchen table.
What's in front of you?

330
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,131
Erm...

331
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,051
My mum and dad and my grandparents
and a few of the lads, I'd say.

332
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,510
- That's nice.
- Yeah?

333
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,424
The size of the house
is supposed to be, like,

334
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:15,126
symbolic of your ambitions
in life and stuff.

335
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,675
And if you have a fence,
it means you're, like,

336
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:22,046
- closed off from people and stuff.
- Sweet, I've no fence.

337
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:26,923
And with your friends around the table
and stuff, that's real nice.

338
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:30,012
Like, warm, sociable,
people around you all the time.

339
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,542
Are you gonna play
professionally and study full time?

340
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,796
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

341
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,386
You're like the Rose of fucking Tralee.

342
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,007
I thought it was good
to be ambitious. Isn't it?

343
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,135
Or isn't it?

344
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,256
You've got everything worked out.

345
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,010
' Hi
' Hi.

346
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,172
Oh, my God.

347
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,169
- I haven't seen you in so long.
- I know!

348
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,589
- Hey.
- How are you?

349
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,881
Oisin not joining us?

350
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,548
No. He's not.

351
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,510
Oh, dear.

352
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,595
He's gorgeous, great body,
just brain-dead.

353
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,086
What did I say, man? Farrelly.

354
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,177
Oh, my God. Guys!

355
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,466
I thought they were just
the one-time deal, man.

356
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,756
Interesting development yourself.

357
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,802
- She's a big girl.
- Yeah, I know.

358
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,339
Play nice.

359
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,753
Alright guys?

360
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:10,967
Yeah.

361
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,212
- I'll leave you to it.
- It's OK. Stay.

362
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,755
Give us a minute.

363
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,048
Yeah. Sure.

364
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,594
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

365
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,344
- You alright'?
- Hm-hmm.

366
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:46,175
- Give us a shot of your cig, will you?
- You're not supposed to be smoking.

367
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,135
Just give us a shot.

368
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,593
Thanks, Eimear.

369
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,256
- How's it going?
- You alright?

370
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,003
- Just pay with a card, please?
- Yeah, pop it in there.

371
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,881
Hey, Con. How are you?

372
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,843
Hey, Rich.

373
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,502
Your PIN.

374
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,630
Nice top, man.

375
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,173
- That's a good look for you.
- Yeah?

376
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,461
- Thanks, man. Cheers.
- Thanks a lot, dude.

377
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,335
- Take it easy, Con, yeah?
- See you.

378
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,629
The joke is, the guard
goes over to the guy and says,

379
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,130
"Take your hands out of your fucking
pockets." But my mum tells it like this.

380
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,584
"And he says, 'Stop masticating."'

381
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,962
"And he goes over and says,
'Stop masturbating."'

382
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,669
We're going,

383
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:15,877
"Mum, the whole point of the joke
is that you don't use the word."

384
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,173
Anyway, that's my mum
trying to tell a joke.

385
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,670
She's about as subtle
as a train wreck.

386
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:24,840
It was very funny, though.

387
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:32,542
So, what do you wanna do
when you finish, at some point?

388
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,635
Erm, I'm not really sure yet.

389
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,380
So I think I'll just do arts in college,
and hopefully...

390
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,628
- You'll just do arts?
- By the end...

391
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,502
It's a good foundation, isn't it?

392
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:46,302
- Yeah, it is.
- Choices later on.

393
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,011
Are you OK?

394
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,468
Tired.

395
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,425
- Did you enjoy tonight?
- Yeah, it was nice.

396
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,968
Hmm.

397
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,135
You were quiet.

398
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,510
I talked.

399
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,257
To my mum, a bit.

400
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,469
Your dad, too.

401
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,631
Yeah, when you were asked stuff.

402
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,377
Why are you being mean?

403
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:54,047
I'm not. I'm just saying it was
a bit one-sided, you know?

404
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,636
I just wanted them
to get to know you a little.

405
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,344
Thanks, you've made me feel worse.

406
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,218
I'm sure they loved you.

407
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,215
You didn't. Why would they?

408
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:18,885
I'm not giving out to you. You know,
like, I didn't mean to upset you.

409
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,550
Do you think it's easy, meeting
your mum and dad for the first time?

410
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,218
You're right.

411
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,252
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:35,340
I need to sleep.

413
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:59,262
A whupping? You bought the ref,
everyone knows that.

414
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,345
You're gonna thank me
for teaching you some humility.

415
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,426
Anyone know
where we're going?

416
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,135
- Hey, Niall.
- Hey, Eimear.

417
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:11,254
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Yeah.

418
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,048
- Are you OK?
- Sure.

419
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,761
- New top?
- Oh, yeah.

420
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:37,926
Suits you.

421
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,378
Richard, I want you
to meet some people.

422
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,719
Guys, this is my boy.

423
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,253
Hi. How's it going? Richard Karlsen.

424
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,252
Sorry. Sorry.

425
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,503
He wasn't being rude, he's just wasted.

426
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,753
Maybe I just need
some of what you've had.

427
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,877
Maybe you do. It's really good.

428
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,677
You don't have to be such an arsehole.

429
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,926
Hey, Rich.

430
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,669
Lovers' tiff?

431
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:40,336
- Just bring her home, Jake, yeah?
- Whatever.

432
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,426
- Sorry.
- Who are you?

433
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,136
Too many people inside.
Daragh's freaking out.

434
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,628
I've been in.
One more won't make a difference.

435
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,923
No, no way.

436
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,298
Lara!

437
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,673
- Lara!
- Lara!

438
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,760
- Lara!
- I've been nice.

439
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,424
Now fuck off or I'll call the guards,
alright?

440
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:05,459
- What a fucking bell-end, isn't he?
- What?

441
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:09,588
What are you gonna do, magic us in,
Jake? Jesus Christ, man.

442
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,632
Open the fucking door! Come on!

443
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,135
Open the door.

444
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,464
Fuck's sake!

445
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,836
- Hey, you alright?
- Fuck off.

446
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,671
- What?
- You are in the shit.

447
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,590
Where the fuck have you been?

448
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,214
Puck's sake.

449
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,510
Daddy's car!

450
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,094
Here, get the fuck down, will you?

451
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,677
What the fuck is it to you?
You fucking arsehole.

452
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,295
- Where did you go'?
- Answer your phone, you'd know.

453
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,761
- Sorry?
- I rang you, like, 20 fucking times.

454
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,549
- Rich, it was pretty loud in there.
- Do you mind?

455
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,344
- Lara, are you OK?
- Conor, just get lost!

456
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,256
I'm getting a cab. Night.

457
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,005
Hang on a sec. Don't you
fucking show me up in front of him.

458
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:48,208
- That's all you care about?
- I'm sorry, OK?

459
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,667
I don't wanna talk.
I just wanna go home. Call you tomorrow.

460
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:54,420
- I'll come with you.
- No. Not like that.

461
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,927
Like what? Like what?

462
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,591
Rich! You fucking sort this out
when you're sober.

463
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,961
Fuck off, Conor!

464
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,960
He's not so great now, is he?

465
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,177
You fucking culchie cunt.

466
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,585
Jesus!

467
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,587
Richard, are you OK? Richard?

468
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,176
Fuck off!

469
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,427
No, leave him alone!

470
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,420
Lara, are you OK?

471
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,551
Fuck you!

472
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,676
Come on, let's go!

473
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,797
Rich, come on!

474
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,377
Oh, it walks.

475
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:51,132
- Can I have the rest of your coffee?
- Sure.

476
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:56,258
- What did you do to your nose?
- It was just Stevo dicking around.

477
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,252
I think it's quite nice, though.

478
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,922
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

479
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,255
Looks classy.

480
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,926
- Want some breakfast?
- Maybe in a while.

481
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,136
Gardal' launched a murder inquiry

482
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,675
after the body of an 18-year-old man
was found in the South Dublin area

483
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,966
in the early hours of the morning.
The disco very of the victim...

484
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,211
- You want this section?
- Just let me listen.

485
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,712
Gardai were called to a disturbance
involving a number of youths

486
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:24,087
outside a house party
in the Sandymount area of the city.

487
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,677
Gardai have appealed
for anyone with information

488
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:30,376
to contact the investigation team
at Irish Town Garda Station

489
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,462
or to call the Gerda freephone number
at 1800666111.

490
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,711
The cloud computing company...

491
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,176
Shite.

492
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,335
Stephen?

493
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,802
- Are you sure it was him?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!

494
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,214
Fuck!

495
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,127
My mum told me after mass.

496
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,879
- Does your mum know?
- No, I didn't tell my fucking mum.

497
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:40,296
Fuck. Could you tell him?

498
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,010
I fucking can't, man.

499
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,343
We should have checked him.

500
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:32,510
Put him in an ambulance.

501
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,752
We're fucked.

502
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:41,546
He got up and he walked away.
We didn't fucking know.

503
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,510
Yeah, it was an accident.

504
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,881
You fucking arsehole, man!

505
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,585
Con was shouting at the guy on the car.
Shoved him in full view of everybody.

506
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:59,292
- Then he backed off.
- Just let him fucking speak, Cian.

507
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,090
The guards were here.

508
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,672
What did they say?

509
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:08,875
- Anyone could have seen us with him.
- Who? Clo fucked off home.

510
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,173
She rang me
asking if I'd seen this brawl.

511
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:13,340
That's what everyone was talking about.

512
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,301
They have a list of names,

513
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:18,011
people they thought
might have been at the party.

514
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,127
Were you there?

515
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,549
If we stick to our story,
nobody can touch us.

516
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,044
Apart from Lara.

517
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,919
Have you spoken to her yet?

518
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,753
- Rich!
- No.

519
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:36,294
I will.

520
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:39,044
OK.

521
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,093
Lara, hey, it's me.

522
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,378
Just give me a shout when you can. OK?

523
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,093
Have the guards been to see you?

524
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,673
Come to take me away, then.

525
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,671
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Did you tell them?

526
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,550
- Well, what did you say?
- Jesus!

527
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:21,342
- I just need to know what you said.
- I lied, OK?

528
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:25,292
I said I left with Conor and went home
with you when they were fighting.

529
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,594
I'm going to hell.

530
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:32,508
- And you used my name?
- Fuck off, Richard.

531
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,715
What did you do to him?

532
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,381
Hey, it was an accident.

533
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,004
He was fine when we left.
He was getting up.

534
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,378
It was just this freak thing.

535
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:01,132
I can't believe this is happening to me.

536
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,378
You can only think of yourself?

537
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,176
I'm sorry.

538
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,127
I'm sorry.

539
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,093
I just...

540
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,260
My...

541
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,218
My head's just...

542
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:33,053
- Lara.
- I can't.

543
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:01,461
Hey, Aisling. How are you?
It's Richard Karlsen here.

544
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,677
Is there any chance
that my dad's around?

545
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:08,136
OK, grand. I mean, if he's...

546
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:12,007
Yeah. Great. I'll hold.

547
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,590
Morning, Richard.

548
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,085
Thank you so much
for coming in.

549
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,382
I couldn't see because
a lot of people had come over

550
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,094
and were gathering around
to see what was going on.

551
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,927
And where was Conor
during this?

552
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,171
Again, I'd found my girlfriend
at that point

553
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:29,672
and she was wanting to leave,
so... we went off together.

554
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:32,386
And did you see Conor
at any stage after that?

555
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,501
No.

556
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:37,505
I have to ask you, Richard,
how did you get that bruise?

557
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,878
In training. I'm a rugby player.

558
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,505
Hey.

559
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,176
I'm glad you came.

560
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:23,215
You're worried I'm gonna crack.

561
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,627
That's why you wanted to do this.

562
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,752
Yeah.

563
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,669
And I wanted to see you.

564
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,510
I'm sorry.

565
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:48,503
- I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
- You didn't make me hit him, OK.

566
00:50:56,583 --> 00:51:00,087
I haven't eaten in two days.
Do you wanna go and get some food?

567
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,087
Please don't call me again. Right?

568
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,754
I don't want to have anything
to do with you. I just...

569
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:11,052
- ..can't.
- Cian.

570
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:15,792
Please. Just don't.

571
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,052
- Aisling said you'd called.
- Yeah.

572
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:36,590
I was... You just sounded
a bit busy, you know.

573
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:38,051
Yeah, well...

574
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,302
- Can I sit?
- Yeah, sure.

575
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:47,169
Thank you.

576
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,506
Thank you, kind sir.

577
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:00,669
The tree house.

578
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,503
You were on and on about that,
you know?

579
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:10,004
"Can we get a tree house?
When can we get a tree house?"

580
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,799
You know, I just couldn't help you
at that point.

581
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:17,258
I was... I wasn't up to it.

582
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:23,127
So you just... started it yourself.

583
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:27,922
You must have been, what, ten? Nine?

584
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:33,001
Nine years. Nine years. Nine years old.

585
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,085
You...

586
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:40,171
...were dragging out the planks
from the shed

587
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:46,049
and digging in the posts,
and eventually I had to help you, so...

588
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,960
Remarkable little boy.

589
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,211
You didn't let me drag you down.

590
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:03,594
That's a great instinct, son.

591
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,093
Don't change that now.

592
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,672
Don't.

593
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:28,964
I know that... your mates
mean everything to you, but...

594
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,381
...there's gotta be a limit
to loyalty, son.

595
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,423
Dad... don't.

596
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,843
Were you there...

597
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,627
...when it happened to Conor?

598
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:13,176
It wasn't the fight they said.

599
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:26,419
I was away from all that with Lara...
and we were having a row.

600
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:34,919
Conor stepped in.

601
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,753
He was just constantly all over her.

602
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,757
And... I told him to back off
and he hit me.

603
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:59,715
So the lads jumped in...
just to sort him out.

604
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:03,050
And...

605
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,468
...it just got out of hand.

606
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,010
Which lads?

607
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,051
Stephen and Cian.

608
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,926
OK.

609
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,298
OK. OK.

610
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:49,628
Good, son. Thank you.

611
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,842
Thank you.

612
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:59,839
Dad, I did it. It was me. I kicked him
in the head and I killed him.

613
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,586
No. No.

614
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:06,589
No!

615
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,261
No. No!

616
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:15,344
I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm so sorry.

617
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,423
I killed him.

618
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:38,552
No. No.

619
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,340
What do I do?

620
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,090
I'm sorry. I...

621
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,505
I'm sorry.

622
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,675
Hey.

623
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:32,834
I've been thinking that maybe
you should go away for a while.

624
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,877
Go to the beach house.

625
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:40,469
- Sure, yeah. Of course.
- Yeah?

626
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,089
Great.

627
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,506
I'll let Mum know you're going.

628
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,959
Bring your phone...
if I wanna get in contact.

629
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:12,460
Dad.

630
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,423
Hey. Hey-

631
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:21,252
So how have you been?

632
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:24,301
Fine.

633
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:31,710
I've been talking to somebody.

634
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:36,044
I won't tell you who but...

635
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:41,136
...it seems that the investigation

636
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:45,676
is focusing on this thing with
the gate-crashers outside the house.

637
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:50,667
And that there are
no separate inquiries or suspects.

638
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,835
That's what he said.

639
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:09,170
Dad, does Mum know about any of this?

640
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,090
No.

641
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,711
- No.
- Right.

642
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,506
Can I come home now, Dad?
Is that OK?

643
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,965
Yeah, of course.

644
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:36,257
Your mother wants me to bring
the linen home, so...

645
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:08,510
- Hey-
- Hey-

646
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:13,505
- ls everybody inside?
- Don't worry, Dad's waiting for you.

647
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,127
Come here.

648
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:21,087
A few of us are going to the nets
if you wanna come down after.

649
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,712
Listen, I should probably get inside,
OK? See you.

650
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,218
You alright, man?

651
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,885
- Hey.
- Hey, Rich.

652
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,131
- You alright'?
- How are you?

653
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,801
Grab a few drinks there.

654
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:58,339
You alright, Rich?

655
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,381
(Pat? Have we all got a drink?

656
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:09,419
$0, guys...

657
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,836
...I know you're all hurting
at the moment.

658
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:19,256
But we're a team and teams pull together
through the tough times.

659
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,295
And I know you're all missing Conor,

660
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:26,671
and you're all angry
about what happened to him,

661
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:32,003
but for now, let's just take a moment
to say goodbye to a friend

662
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,002
and a great team-mate.

663
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,669
Goodbye to Conor.

664
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:39,011
To Conor.

665
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:46,377
Raglan men are we.

666
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:50,922
Faithful to our call.

667
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:56,005
Valiant' and brave we 're standing.

668
01:06:56,125 --> 01:07:00,005
Steadfast one and all.

669
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:04,755
Victory is ours to claim.

670
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:09,631
But honour is our goal.

671
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,256
We never will surrender truth.

672
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:17,800
On this our sacred soil.

673
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:20,670
Come on, Raglan! Come on!

674
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:24,717
Come on, Raglan! Come on, Raglan!

675
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:28,167
- Get in!
- Come on!

676
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37,050
- Seriously?
- That's what he said anyway.

677
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:43,967
OK, come on. Let's go get wasted, man.

678
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:48,837
- Think I'm just gonna go home, Steve.
- Come on.

679
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:52,090
Another time, man.

680
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:54,589
Alright.

681
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,710
- I'll see you.
- See you later.

682
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:59,670
Take it easy, lads. See youse.

683
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:36,085
Oh, my God, what's this? D4 youngsters
drinking in the scrublands?

684
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:38,176
Shock, horror.

685
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:41,714
" Hey, you.
- Hey.

686
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,710
- Party finished?
- Yeah.

687
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:47,337
- Beers. Go for it, lads.
- Cheers, man.

688
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:51,136
- Grab us one, Jake, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

689
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,503
- Sound.
- Cheers.

690
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,298
How's it going, lads? You alright?

691
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,586
Knacker drinking away.

692
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,261
- So, you alright?
- Yeah.

693
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,676
It's fucking mad.

694
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:14,176
- Listen, man, are we cool?
- Yeah.

695
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:17,091
- I was out of line.
- Don't worry about it, honestly.

696
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,334
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

697
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,756
Alright, man. Thanks.

698
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,003
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, no, I'm sorry.

699
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,131
Fucking bad night, like.

700
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:35,084
Have I come just a little bit
overdressed, maybe, guys?

701
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,633
Just a small bit overdressed here,
I think, perhaps.

702
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,549
- You got a fire going there, lads?
- No.

703
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:42,919
Sweet one.

704
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:46,125
They were all asking him questions
and he's going,

705
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:49,880
"Yeah, yeah," and then out of nowhere,
he just goes...

706
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,925
Hear about the guy who was playing rugby
and got one his balls ripped off?

707
01:09:57,042 --> 01:10:00,216
- This is an awful topic.
- It's a friend of mine's friend.

708
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,802
He took a really high tackle
and there was, like,

709
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:05,045
a whoosh and just... One of his balls...

710
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,511
It was apparently dangling
by the string.

711
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:08,751
No, stop it. Stop it.

712
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:12,084
Sorry, man.

713
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:20,084
So disgusting.
They were like, "Why is he screaming?"

714
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:23,792
- I got a splinter.
- Where? Let's see.

715
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:29,091
Oh, my God. Shit.
Have you tried getting it out?

716
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:33,467
Yes. Can you not see that I've gored it?
Look at the state of it.

717
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:36,336
- You did it badly. I'd know.
- Would you?

718
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:39,257
- Yeah.
- You're the Queen of Splinters?

719
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,553
Alright. I'm gonna head. School.

720
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:02,295
Oh, right, take it easy, man.
See you later on, right?

721
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:04,590
- Bye, honey.
- See you.

722
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,210
Oh, my God.

723
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:34,760
Whoa.

724
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:39,718
I have to pee.

725
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:03,507
"A great prophet has appeared
among us," they said.

726
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:05,923
"God has come to help his people."

727
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,845
This news about Jesus
spread throughout Judea

728
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,801
and the surrounding country.

729
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,881
This is the Gospel of the Lord.

730
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,594
Praise be the Lord, Jesus Christ.

731
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,255
Please be seated.

732
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,006
Dear friends...

733
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:43,967
- Eileen.
- It's wrong.

734
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:47,587
I know. Just have a seat.

735
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,881
I won't.

736
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,924
Things need to be said.

737
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:02,674
There were dozens of kids outside
that house when Conor was killed.

738
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,218
A lot would be here.

739
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,006
But do you know...

740
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:18,505
...how many were decent enough...
to come forward with information?

741
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:22,965
A handful.

742
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,343
Three.

743
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,131
Four.

744
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,502
Maybe.

745
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:41,005
Are you telling me...
nobody else remembers anything?

746
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,835
Nobody else knows...

747
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,218
...who killed...

748
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,131
...my boy?

749
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,377
Nobody else...

750
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,677
...suspects their own... safe son?

751
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,506
You know.

752
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:19,172
I know.. you know.

753
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:29,171
And you're breaking our hearts again...
for not speaking up.

754
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:52,419
I'm gonna hand myself in.

755
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,877
It's what I have to do.

756
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,465
Jesus, Richard.

757
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:08,713
Lara... it's the only way.

758
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:08,299
Then we could just take off'
after, you know?

759
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:13,219
Have completely diffierent lives.

760
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:33,381
God, I can breathe.

761
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:45,964
- You make it sound so easy.
- It is easy. We 'l just do it.

762
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,250
We 'll go to France. Spain.

763
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,718
Wherever.

764
01:17:57,958 --> 01:18:00,757
- Where do you wanna go?
- Everywhere.

765
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,297
Hey.

766
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,172
Hi.

767
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,210
I'll just tidy up a bit.

768
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:55,835
Bye.

769
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:56,841
If a party commits
a major breach of contract,

770
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:59,677
whether or not that party
can end the contract

771
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:02,136
depends on the surrounding...
