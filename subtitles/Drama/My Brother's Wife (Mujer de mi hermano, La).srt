1
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:04,321
My Brother's Wife

2
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,714
What would you do without me?

3
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,603
Ready.

4
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:56,179
I had my 20 grapes for breakfast.

5
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,210
Can't it be 21?

6
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,948
No, it has to be 20...

7
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,114
not one more.

8
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:04,784
You're nuts!

9
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,882
Maybe.

10
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:09,931
At least I don't talk to insects.

11
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,157
Zoe...

12
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,837
you're not going to mass
dressed like that, are you?

13
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,467
Better wear what I got you.

14
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,170
I don't like it, Ignacio.

15
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:25,240
Baby, this dress is too
flashy for mass...

16
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,575
There'll be a lot of people,
I don't like it.

17
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,545
Listen to me.

18
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,912
Did you find my mother's
prayer book?

19
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,049
Yes.

20
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,222
I hope it helps.

21
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,262
The Lord be with you.

22
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:43,729
And with your spirit.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,264
The blessing of Almighty God...

24
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:50,202
...Father, Son,
and the Holy Ghost...

25
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,397
...descend upon you.

26
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,275
Amen.

27
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,940
- You may go in peace.
- Thanks Be to God.

28
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,014
Alright?
Let's go.

29
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,927
- Hi, Santiago!
- Ignacio!

30
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,061
- Congratulations.
- Thanks a lot.

31
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:24,167
Parish priest, who'd say?

32
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:27,205
Monsignor Moretti has been very
generous with his decision.

33
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,334
I'm so glad you could come.

34
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:33,776
Zoe knows we cannot
lose faith, Santiago.

35
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,444
Faith is the main thing, Ignacio.

36
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,979
Zoe, you must be strong in spirit...

37
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,886
...to support your husband.

38
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,591
By the way...
...I'd like to recommend this book.

39
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,353
"Path", by Balaguer.

40
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,789
It will help a lot
with your problems.

41
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,299
We could talk about
it if you come visit.

42
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,893
I promise I'll read it.

43
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,506
Well, we're off...

44
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,542
My mother's expecting us
for lunch at her house.

45
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,573
God bless you.
Give my love to Christina.

46
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Excuse us.

47
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,206
Oh, Santiago!

48
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,109
Keep up the good behavior
and you'll become the Pope.

49
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,416
God willing, Ignacio.

50
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,625
You can't imagine
how sorry I am!

51
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,258
I really hoped the doctors had finally found
a way to give me a grandchild.

52
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,690
- Yes, it's a pity, Mother,
- Thank you, Mercedes.

53
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,634
There'll only be three of us again.

54
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,505
Why's that?
Isn't Gonzalo coming?

55
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,770
Oh, Gonzalo must be painting.

56
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,774
He forgets time when he works.

57
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:38,338
Son...

58
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,812
...why don't you call him for me?

59
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,711
If you ask him,
maybe he'll come.

60
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:59,866
A mother, Zoe,
is never wrong...

61
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,263
...my children aren't
the same anymore.

62
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,001
They were...

63
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,239
...more than brothers.
They were friends and...

64
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,379
...suddenly...

65
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,075
...something happened.

66
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,879
Boys' things.

67
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,653
I left him a message,
but I don't think he'll hear it.

68
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:28,326
Let's begin without him.

69
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:39,601
Hello.

70
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:48,576
- Hey, Raulito.
- Hi!

71
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,578
It can't be.

72
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:55,350
Impossible!
Gee, it must be a miracle.

73
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:58,455
Take that painting downstairs, please.

74
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,528
- How're you?
- What's up, sister-in-law?

75
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,825
- How're you?
- Fine. You?

76
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,799
Fine! Alright, man,
it's good to see you!

77
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:10,099
Same here. We waited for you
at your mother's house.

78
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,639
Yeah, I know, but I've been
really busy with the show and...

79
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:15,732
How's it going?

80
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:19,539
Better to ask how it went.
I'm already...

81
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,777
...taking down the paintings.

82
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,078
But come in and see
what's left of it.

83
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:29,815
This one is really nice.

84
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,026
Like it?

85
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:41,458
And why the unexpected pleasure?

86
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,497
Well, I came because...

87
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,632
...I want one of your
paintings in my room.

88
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,173
What do you think?

89
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:50,670
Really?

90
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:55,439
Well, choose one.
Which one do you like?

91
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,068
I like this one.

92
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,368
Then it's yours.

93
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,374
- Do I just take it.
- Sure.

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,510
This painting's worth
3 thousand dollars.

95
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:28,873
It's good, right?

96
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:33,948
Do I have to pay for that?

97
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:38,319
Yeah, well, I wouldn't take
your money, but...

98
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:41,021
...I know my brother's
going to enjoy it...

99
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,528
...so I'll have him pay for it.

100
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:50,966
- Hey.
- Hey.

101
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,767
What's that?

102
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,112
One of Gonzalo's paintings.

103
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,443
Not bad.

104
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:07,778
- You don't like it?
- I like it.

105
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:12,649
- If you don't, I won't hang it.
- No, I told you I did.

106
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,623
Did he give it to you?

107
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,031
Did he charge you?

108
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:25,070
Not much.

109
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:26,800
The son-of-a-bitch!

110
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,437
Isn't it enough with what
I send him every month?

111
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,938
Did he have to sell
you the damn painting?

112
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,272
Don't overreact, Ignacio,
it's just 3 thousand dollars.

113
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:36,544
It's not the money.

114
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,209
It's what he does.

115
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,022
I work my ass off in the factory
Dad left us.

116
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,921
And Gonzalo doesn't lift a finger.

117
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:46,926
He just stays home painting
or screwing around.

118
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:51,526
I send him a lot of cash
every month, Zoe,

119
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,328
so it's not money he needs.

120
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,333
It was in very poor taste
to charge you for the painting.

121
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,006
We can adopt if you want.

122
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:37,773
No.

123
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,506
Why not, Zoe?

124
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:41,081
It's not such a bad idea.

125
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,481
Look, if I can't conceive,
there must be a reason.

126
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:47,885
- It was God's will.
- No.

127
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:49,354
Maybe He wants us to adopt.

128
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,119
Leave God out of this.

129
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:53,819
So?

130
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,757
So nothing. We're not adopting.
I don't want to.

131
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,561
Honey...

132
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:06,099
...if I ever have a child,
I want him to look like me...

133
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,041
...smell like me...
my flesh and blood.

134
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:10,642
But we can't, darling.

135
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,914
You mean, you can't.

136
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,407
So what?

137
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,018
Would you have a kid
with another man?

138
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:22,954
No.

139
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,659
Love...

140
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,824
...I'm calling to tell you...

141
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:36,467
...I'm having lunch with Boris
so don't wait for me.

142
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,063
No.

143
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,971
Tell you later.

144
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:45,635
So do I, baby. Bye.

145
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,015
I had to lie to him.

146
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:53,187
I couldn't tell him I was with you.

147
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,279
Why?

148
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,151
What's wrong with you
being with me?

149
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:00,789
Nothing, but...

150
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,197
...Ignacio wouldn't approve
of me posing for you.

151
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,228
He wouldn't like you
painting me at all.

152
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,304
He'd go ballistic.

153
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:12,533
He's such an asshole.

154
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:14,832
Very good.

155
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,774
Don't smile so much.
There!

156
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,972
You still haven't told me
what the snapshots are for.

157
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:23,449
I'll tell you.
Move to the edge of the bed.

158
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:25,580
I take the pictures...

159
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:29,054
...turn them into slides,
I project them...

160
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:31,091
...and then I start painting on them.

161
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,390
- Is this alright?
- It's perfect.

162
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:42,569
You look tense. Why don't you
relax and lie down?

163
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,794
Go on!

164
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:47,841
Like that, right,
very good.

165
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:53,008
Ignacio... He's a lucky son-of-a-bitch.

166
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:56,648
He doesn't deserve
a goddess like you, man.

167
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,704
<i>- I can't take it anymore.</i>
- Hello?

168
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:21,298
<i>We only make love on Saturdays.

169
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,967
- Zoe?
<i>- Only on Saturdays?

170
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:24,975
He says he enjoys it more that way.

171
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,978
That he has better climaxes.

172
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:29,348
He has always been an asshole.

173
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,948
<i>You should've seen him</i>
<i>when he saw your painting.

174
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,521
<i>I can imagine,</i>
<i>He's jealous of me.

175
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:05,171
I don't know why he did it.
I swear I don't get it.

176
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,808
Jealousy.

177
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,117
He's jealous of me,
because he knows I'm happy.

178
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:16,087
He knows I love what I do,
and that bothers him.

179
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,989
He's so damn bitter about
working in a factory...

180
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:21,187
...because he never had
the guts to do what he likes.

181
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,059
Don't say that,
he's your brother.

182
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:25,564
- And he's my husband.
- I don't give a damn...

183
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,793
...that he's my brother, man.

184
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,327
He didn't have to treat
my painting like that.

185
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:33,732
You know how long it takes
to paint one of those?

186
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,339
I know, Gonza.
Maybe it was my fault.

187
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:38,605
I shouldn't have told him
you sold it to me.

188
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:41,443
That's not the problem, man.

189
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,780
He's got money to burn.
The thing is I painted it.

190
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:49,447
You know what?
I think... I'd better go.

191
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:51,448
Why?

192
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:54,818
I need to sleep.
I'm exhausted.

193
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,859
You can rest here.

194
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,490
I mean...

195
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,663
...you can have some wine and...

196
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:05,171
...if you're tired you can sleep.

197
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:07,807
Come on.

198
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,435
I'll be painting...

199
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,905
...and there won't be any fighting.

200
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,542
Hi.

201
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,379
Where were you?

202
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,146
Out.

203
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,682
Out where?

204
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,561
Why did you do it?

205
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:46,268
I don't know.

206
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,467
I lost it.

207
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:52,706
Forgive me, okay?

208
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,673
You're going crazy.

209
00:17:56,751 --> 00:18:00,118
It just bugged me that he
sold you the painting.

210
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,217
It made me angry.

211
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:03,880
Why?

212
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:08,291
- It shows he earns a living.
- No, it's not.

213
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,759
Gonzalo doesn't work.
He's a lazy bum...

214
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,298
...who lives off what
I give him each month.

215
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,833
It was my painting.
I liked it.

216
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:18,505
Yeah, sure, anything Gonzalo
paints is cute.

217
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:44,831
Is that why you called me?

218
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,460
How many times must
we go over this, honey?

219
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,365
We've been together
for three years, baby.

220
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,671
- So what?
- What do you mean?

221
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:57,410
Any couple that has been
together that long...

222
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,446
...should want to live together.

223
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:02,173
What part of it don't you get?

224
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,986
We aren't girlfriend
and boyfriend, babe.

225
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:08,852
I won't get married.

226
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,689
I don't want kids.

227
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,652
You and I are lovers, baby,
and we're good.

228
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,594
No strings attached,
no conflicts, man.

229
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,398
Save the bullshit
for someone else.

230
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:22,627
- Not for me.
- Don't you like my bullshit?

231
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:25,767
Then why don't you
get yourself another guy...

232
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,864
...to give you head
while I paint, huh?

233
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,634
I'm fed up with you.

234
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,070
Grow up, asshole!

235
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,841
I'll call you tomorrow when
the storm has blown over, doll.

236
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,163
Hi. I just wanted to tell
you I made a deposit.

237
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:02,640
I threw in a little extra because...

238
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,144
...it was a good quarter.

239
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:09,546
I'm sorry about the painting, dude.

240
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,380
I don't know what happened, man.

241
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,011
I think I lost it.

242
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:17,317
I lost it.
Fucking fag.

243
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,722
See you.

244
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:33,667
What's up, Zoe?

245
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:37,136
What're you up to?

246
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,945
I want to see you.

247
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,781
I called so you'd see
the photo before I paint it.

248
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,613
Did I tell you Ignacio called?

249
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,324
He wanted to meet,
but I told him to go to hell.

250
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,916
What did he say?

251
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,392
Just bullshit.

252
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:55,587
That if I sell you another painting...

253
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:57,061
...he's going to piss all over it.

254
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:00,058
He's a fool.
He's hopeless.

255
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,061
Truth is I don't know how
you can stand him.

256
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:07,766
I get to see you once in a while.

257
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,971
I haven't been able to get
you out of my head.

258
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,406
- Gonza...
- Jesus, I like you so much!

259
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,771
Me too, but...

260
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,339
this is wrong.

261
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,858
Promise me you'll keep it a secret.

262
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,154
Obviously, babe.
I'm a classy dame.

263
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:05,027
Discretion is one
of my greater virtues.

264
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:08,530
Don't you think
I've acted like a slut?

265
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:09,694
Not at all!

266
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:13,329
Besides, ladies have a right to act
like sluts now and then.

267
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:15,840
- But it's his brother!
- So?

268
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,568
Gonzalo's so hot.

269
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:19,339
He's such a stud.
I'm crazy about him!

270
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:21,508
I envy you, girl.

271
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:25,475
Don't feel bad.

272
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,347
Guilt...

273
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:30,056
...was invented by priests.

274
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,622
If your husband doesn't realize
he's neglecting you...

275
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,697
...that you're a lady, that you need
maintenance as well...

276
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:41,494
...it's only fair, it's only right that you look
for other ways to make up for it.

277
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,304
And there's nothing wrong
with kissing Gonzalo, what a stud...

278
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,431
...if he calls you again...

279
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:50,010
...don't miss your chance.

280
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:53,640
I don't know.
I feel like... a whore.

281
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,773
Well, if you're a whore,
where does that leave me?

282
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:07,923
How can you wear
two pairs of socks?

283
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:12,193
My feet are frozen.
Why? Does it bother you?

284
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,829
No, it just always surprises me.

285
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,401
I'm happier this way.

286
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:24,068
And do we have to listen
to this music night after night?

287
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:25,702
Turn it off if you want.

288
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:27,611
I'm going to bed.

289
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:30,946
I'm tired and I have a
business trip tomorrow.

290
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:32,947
- Again?
- Yes, again.

291
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:34,854
I don't have any help at the factory.

292
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,049
And I have to do all
the important things myself.

293
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:41,023
Don't be long.
I'll be waiting for you.

294
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,039
Darling?

295
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,375
I'm off to the airport.

296
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,210
Sure you won't come with me?

297
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,848
Well, I'll be back in two days.

298
00:24:37,385 --> 00:24:38,852
Call you tonight, okay?

299
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,591
Come in, Maria.

300
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,660
You look very nice today.

301
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:33,965
- Thanks, Maria.
- Ma'am...

302
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,703
... I've got to tell you something.
- Yes?

303
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,608
I found this in the microwave.

304
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:42,205
It's kind of burned. I think it's one
of those CDs with the funeral music...

305
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:43,749
... Mr. Ignacio likes.
- Well, then...

306
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:46,786
...I'm glad. Throw it away.
It's like there are...

307
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:49,788
...ghosts in the house.
- I agree, ma'am.

308
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,824
Fortunately, those ghosts go away
every now and then.

309
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,155
Looks like it.
Excuse me.

310
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,889
Call me if you need anything.

311
00:25:56,997 --> 00:25:58,589
Thank you, Maria.

312
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:19,046
Okay!
I put it on low.

313
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,653
Yes, ma'am, the egg's
almost done. What else?

314
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:23,155
The rice is in the pot, right?

315
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:26,784
Half an hour before,
you just press this.

316
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:27,883
Perfect!

317
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:29,929
You know what to do
with the salmon?

318
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,261
Yes, Maria, I remember
my cooking lessons.

319
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:37,133
Of course, ma'am. Are you sure
you won't need me tonight?

320
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:41,340
Yes. Don't worry.
In fact, you can take...

321
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,275
...the day off, tomorrow.
- If you want...

322
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:46,471
...I can stay and help you serve.

323
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,775
I like Mrs. Christina a lot.

324
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,448
No thanks, Maria.

325
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:12,900
- Who is it?
- Forgot my keys. Open up, babe.

326
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:15,739
Ignacio?

327
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,873
Come on, it's Gonzalo.
Open up, man!

328
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,123
- Hello.
- What's up?

329
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:38,490
- Did I scare you?
- Yes, you got me.

330
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,100
I would've loved
to see your face.

331
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,827
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

332
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:45,462
It's been a long time
since you've visited.

333
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:46,904
Yes, a very long time.

334
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:49,603
That dress is great.

335
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,642
Thanks.

336
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:52,211
You look very nice.

337
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:53,705
I brought wine.

338
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:56,783
Thanks, I spent all afternoon
in the kitchen.

339
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,580
Oh, yeah?
I spent all afternoon...

340
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,348
...thinking about you.
- Gonza, don't!

341
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:03,685
Don't what?
Just a little kiss.

342
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,554
No, this is Ignacio's house.

343
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,627
- So what?
- Gonza...

344
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,026
...I invited you for dinner
because I like hanging out...

345
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,624
...with you, but...
promise me you'll behave.

346
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,134
I promise.

347
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:24,941
Hello?

348
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,078
Hi, darling.

349
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:30,841
How are you?

350
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,543
<i>Fine, very well.

351
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,720
What were you up to?

352
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:37,354
<i>Nothing. I was about to have dinner.

353
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:40,391
Zoe, you sound stressed.
You alright?

354
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,688
<i>Yes, everything's fine.</i>
<i>You?

355
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,027
Fine, fine.

356
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,965
Heavy day, lots of work, but...

357
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:50,593
...I'm finally back at the hotel.

358
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,840
Zoe... do you love me?

359
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,801
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Why? Do you doubt it?

360
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,778
No, I don't.

361
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:03,614
I'd just like to hear you say it.

362
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,685
<i>Well, then, I love you,</i>
<i>I love you, I love you.

363
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,152
Alright.

364
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:10,223
Three times is enough.

365
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:11,984
See you on Wednesday.

366
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,483
Sleep well.

367
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,835
Recently I've been thinking
about your wedding day.

368
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:27,096
Truth is,
what a boring wedding.

369
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:30,168
Average age: 84

370
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:34,106
I danced with all my aunts,
and my Mom's friends...

371
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:37,478
Gee, how boring!
Really, guys.

372
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,451
I recall...

373
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:45,948
...when I chased you
to the bathroom, remember?

374
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,449
Yeah.

375
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:48,619
What an ordeal that was.

376
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:53,356
First... I had to keep
an eye on Ignacio.

377
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,163
Then, get away from
all the old broads.

378
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,333
You don't know how much
I wanted to kiss you then.

379
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:02,440
But you didn't want to.

380
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:25,595
Why don't you leave him?

381
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:30,403
I mean, it must be a bummer to be with
someone who doesn't make love to you, huh?

382
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:35,807
I can't.
I don't like being alone.

383
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,937
I don't want to live alone.
I don't...

384
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,708
I don't... like sleeping alone.

385
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,777
You've got me.

386
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:48,185
You're my brother-in-law.
I can't be with you.

387
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,450
You've got me as a friend, man.

388
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,289
Well...

389
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:07,869
... I'll be going now.
- No, don't go. Stay.

390
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:15,375
You want me to sleep here?

391
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:18,511
Yes.

392
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,518
I don't want to sleep alone.

393
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:24,952
Not today.

394
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:32,659
Well, can I borrow a pillow and a blanket,
I'll stay here. No problem.

395
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:37,365
Why don't you sleep over there?

396
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:41,035
Over where?

397
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:44,140
Upstairs, with me.

398
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,807
Nothing will happen.

399
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,442
I just want you to keep me company.

400
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,422
Yeah?

401
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,219
Well.

402
00:32:00,594 --> 00:32:02,027
Want some PJs?

403
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:06,658
To tell you the truth,
if you don't mind...

404
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,131
I wear my shorts to bed.

405
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,370
No, I don't mind.

406
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,712
Gonza?

407
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,364
I need a hug.

408
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:30,275
I've dreamed about
you many times.

409
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:36,219
Have you touched yourself
thinking of me?

410
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:41,720
Yes.

411
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:44,355
And you?

412
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,029
Have you touched yourself
thinking of me?

413
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:50,170
No.

414
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,966
I don't believe you.

415
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:56,943
Then don't.

416
00:33:57,811 --> 00:33:59,642
I don't believe you, you liar.

417
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,147
I don't believe you.

418
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:09,013
Wait!

419
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:11,222
No, no, no!

420
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,634
Oh, I can't believe this.

421
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,809
No, don't go.

422
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:33,124
Boris!

423
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,227
This is delicious.

424
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:42,861
For the love of God!
Wipe that guilty look off your face.

425
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,564
I wish I woke up with something
to feel guilty about.

426
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:48,573
Look at how he left,
that is...

427
00:37:48,742 --> 00:37:50,539
Who cares how he left?

428
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:52,771
What matters is how you came.

429
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:56,644
How was it?

430
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,975
It was divine.

431
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:02,914
Well... nothing, excellent.
It's alright.

432
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:05,386
It's just that...

433
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,551
...now you have...

434
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,561
...to go back...

435
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:13,190
...to your husband's
bed like a good girl...

436
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,995
...and forget Gonzalo.

437
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:21,101
Well, if you want a lover,
well... I won't criticize you.

438
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:25,576
I'm a philanthropist with my ass.
I give it to the neediest.

439
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,344
But not you.

440
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:31,676
You can't do it with
Gonzalito anymore.

441
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,537
Oh, this is so good, baby!

442
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:03,673
So good!

443
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:05,216
- Tell me.
- What, baby?

444
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:07,149
Have you been with other women?

445
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:10,483
Just answer me.

446
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:12,556
Don't stop baby.

447
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,193
Don't stop.

448
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:15,727
Answer me.

449
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:18,190
But come on,
how can you ask that?

450
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:19,287
Swear it.

451
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,399
- Don't stop baby.
- Swear it.

452
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,798
- Swear it.
- I swear.

453
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:29,874
I swear on my brother.

454
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:31,569
Come on!

455
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:37,248
Who's the love of my life?

456
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,817
I am.

457
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:39,943
So?

458
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:41,680
So?

459
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,453
Talk dirty to me, baby.

460
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:57,169
Zoe...

461
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,839
...sweetheart,
is something wrong?

462
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:07,380
No.

463
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,649
I'm just very sensitive.

464
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,309
Do you want us...

465
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,352
...to adopt a child?

466
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,456
No.

467
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,725
It's not that.

468
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,532
Then what is it?

469
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:42,078
Are you sure
you love me, honey?

470
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:48,145
Of course, silly, of course.

471
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:50,321
Do you have any doubts?

472
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:55,993
Hold me.

473
00:40:57,364 --> 00:40:59,958
Come, come!

474
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,301
Kiss me, okay?

475
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,918
Remember today's not
Saturday, honey.

476
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:25,980
Sorry.

477
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,438
A bit more, Zoe.
Bend back a little, not too much.

478
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,349
Sorry, it's my phone.

479
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:03,296
Hello?

480
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:08,694
Hi, Ignacio.
What's up? I'm in yoga class.

481
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,203
No, no, no.
Go ahead, tell me.

482
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:17,008
Lunch? Well...

483
00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:20,972
Hold on.
I have another call.

484
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,510
Gonza?

485
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,116
Hi.

486
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:29,655
Why did you leave
without saying goodbye?

487
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,324
No, I'm not angry.

488
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:37,758
I can't right now.

489
00:42:42,202 --> 00:42:43,760
What hotel?

490
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,406
Alright, yes.

491
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:54,044
See you soon.

492
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:56,709
Kiss.

493
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:11,391
So... who was it?

494
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:13,321
Gonzalo.

495
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:16,629
You little slut!

496
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,395
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talking!

497
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,214
Shouldn't we be
taking precautions?

498
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:33,347
Are you on the pill or what?

499
00:43:33,753 --> 00:43:38,690
What for?
I can't have children.

500
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:43,725
I thought it was Ignacio
who couldn't.

501
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:48,327
Ignacio can't...
and neither can I.

502
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,167
Good.

503
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,203
Because I hate wearing condoms.

504
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:15,727
What are you doing here?

505
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:18,025
Enjoying the night.

506
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,296
And those flowers?

507
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:22,457
They're...

508
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:24,127
...for you.

509
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:26,266
Where shall I put them?

510
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:27,667
Throw them on me.

511
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:32,501
Go on, throw them on me.

512
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:35,513
Are you telling me to throw
the flowers in the pool?

513
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:37,173
Yes, what's the problem?

514
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:59,270
You're like a goddess.

515
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:01,306
Now, jump in.

516
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:03,900
No, you're nuts.
It's cold.

517
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,136
Come on, honey,
the water's delicious.

518
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:08,077
Are you crazy?
I'm not wearing...

519
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:10,376
...my trunks, Zoe.
- Oh, how awful!

520
00:45:10,483 --> 00:45:14,783
The master of the house
can't go skinny-dipping...

521
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:17,516
...with his wife in his own house.
Don't be silly. Jump in.

522
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:21,426
Alright...

523
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:22,688
...fine.

524
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:43,105
- I'll catch a cold!
- You're such an old lady.

525
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:44,478
No, baby.

526
00:45:48,855 --> 00:45:50,254
What is it?

527
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,187
Don't know.
I'm cold, sweetheart.

528
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:56,684
I'm sorry, but I'm getting out.
I'm too cold.

529
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:19,273
How's Boris?

530
00:46:20,086 --> 00:46:21,747
Devastated.

531
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,954
Just imagine. He found
his boyfriend with a woman.

532
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:28,391
- You don't say.
- Poor thing.

533
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:40,236
Aren't you going to get dressed?

534
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:43,965
No.

535
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:47,945
You'll catch a cold
if you don't cover up.

536
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:52,840
Not...

537
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:56,384
...if you keep me warm.

538
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:00,849
Honey, what is it with you?

539
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:03,394
What are you on?

540
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,768
Why do you analyze
me all the time, Ignacio?

541
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,437
Better make love to me.

542
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:16,964
Today?

543
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:18,866
Yes, today.

544
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:22,774
And don't say
it's not Saturday.

545
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:25,875
Cut the crap.

546
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,058
Honey, that's the way I am.

547
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:38,222
I don't feel like it
if it's not Saturday.

548
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,700
But tomorrow's Saturday, darling.

549
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:43,926
Yes?

550
00:48:02,689 --> 00:48:03,849
What are you doing?

551
00:48:11,698 --> 00:48:14,428
You'd rather masturbate
than make love to me?

552
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:17,993
No, silly,
of course not.

553
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,468
I just couldn't sleep.

554
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,766
And I thought...

555
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:26,845
...maybe I could relax
a bit more like this.

556
00:48:28,748 --> 00:48:30,682
Who were you thinking about?

557
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:34,147
You.

558
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:37,986
Promise?

559
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:40,452
Promise.

560
00:48:44,997 --> 00:48:47,261
If you were thinking about me...

561
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:49,527
...why didn't you wake me up?

562
00:48:52,772 --> 00:48:54,103
I don't know. It's...

563
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:56,164
I didn't want to.

564
00:48:56,943 --> 00:49:00,208
You looked so sweet
sleeping that...

565
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,178
...I didn't want to wake you up.

566
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:04,778
But waking up like this...

567
00:49:05,752 --> 00:49:07,720
...is better than sleeping.

568
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:09,813
Much better.

569
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:06,711
I went to see your dad this morning.

570
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:08,973
I took him lilies. So pretty.

571
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,673
Excuse me...
This was made just for you.

572
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,775
It's fish.

573
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,952
I'm allergic.
Zoe didn't tell you?

574
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:21,021
About 10 years ago...

575
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:23,857
...I had a fish stew
that almost killed me.

576
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,830
There's chicken in the fridge, Maria.

577
00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:29,093
I'll prepare it for you.
Excuse me.

578
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:30,169
Thank you.

579
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:32,399
Anyway, we'll wait for Gonzalo.

580
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,796
He's not coming, Mom.

581
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:36,236
Gonzalo doesn't like this house.

582
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,240
Look, your brother
may always be late...

583
00:50:38,344 --> 00:50:41,006
...and lazy, but you two?

584
00:50:41,113 --> 00:50:42,876
He loves you very much.

585
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:45,280
Besides, he promised me he'd come.

586
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:48,318
Don't worry, love, it must
be Gonzalo. I'll get it.

587
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:49,852
Maria, get the door, please.

588
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:03,991
What's up?

589
00:51:05,204 --> 00:51:07,399
- Am I very late?
- No, come in.

590
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:09,133
We're used to it.

591
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:14,772
How's the man with the money?

592
00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:16,845
Fine, fine.

593
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:19,309
I'm glad you came, Gonzalo.

594
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,379
- Come on!
- No, seriously...

595
00:51:22,488 --> 00:51:26,254
...Gonzalo, we're brothers.
It's wrong to be so far apart, man.

596
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:28,517
You know that in this house,
we love you very much.

597
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:32,026
As much as you love
my paintings, asshole?

598
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,560
Look...

599
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:37,829
...Gonzalo, I wanted to
apologize personally...

600
00:51:37,937 --> 00:51:40,906
...for what I did.
I don't know what came over me.

601
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:43,601
It was stupid and rash.
Will you forgive me?

602
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:48,976
Come on, man, I don't want
any jealousy between us.

603
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,015
We're brothers, Gonzalo.

604
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:54,516
Quite the contrary. I'm glad you're here
in your house, having lunch with the family.

605
00:51:55,454 --> 00:51:57,149
Come on.
Mom's waiting for us.

606
00:51:58,357 --> 00:51:59,517
In fact...

607
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:02,526
...we should have lunch together
once a week, man.

608
00:52:02,795 --> 00:52:04,956
- What do you say?
- As long as you're buying...

609
00:52:05,064 --> 00:52:06,361
...I'm okay with that.

610
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:09,527
Thanks.

611
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:13,136
How's the most beautiful
woman on the planet?

612
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,498
- At last.
- Hey.

613
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,369
- How are you, mother?
- Very well.

614
00:52:18,477 --> 00:52:20,468
It's good to see you.
Hey, sis.

615
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:21,910
Hi, Gonza!

616
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,948
- How're you doing?
- Fine.

617
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,178
- Brought a bottle of wine.
- Thanks. You shouldn't have.

618
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:28,719
Yes, I should, sis.

619
00:52:29,655 --> 00:52:31,919
How are you?
Everything alright?

620
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:34,925
- Besides you being late.
- Yeah, sorry.

621
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,756
Oh, well...
we already know it's not...

622
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,262
...one of your strong points.
- Sorry.

623
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,696
Why didn't you bring
your girlfriend?

624
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:43,200
Which one?

625
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:48,268
The latest. The South American
actress, was it?

626
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:50,338
Laura.
Yes, she's from Venezuela, ma'.

627
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:51,501
Right, Laura.

628
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,204
Are you still seeing her?

629
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:56,144
Like all the others.

630
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:02,576
Good. I'm glad, son.
She's a charming girl.

631
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:04,121
Yes, charming, ma'.

632
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:08,084
You should start looking
for a woman to marry.

633
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,126
- Marry? Me?
- Of course.

634
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,757
Ma', you know I don't
have any plans.

635
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:18,962
...to marry anybody.
- Oh, dear!

636
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,039
You should think
about being a father.

637
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,801
And making me a grandmother.

638
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:24,704
Alright, give him time.

639
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,005
He just hasn't found
the right woman.

640
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,339
So what?

641
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:31,615
And if I can't have children
like Ignacio, then what?

642
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:33,183
Don't be silly, man!

643
00:53:34,787 --> 00:53:37,881
So the future of this family
depends on me?

644
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:40,951
Jesus!
I feel so proud!

645
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,188
Excuse me. I'll go open
Gonzalo's bottle.

646
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,230
Excuse me.

647
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:54,067
And wash those filthy hands.

648
00:53:54,173 --> 00:53:55,367
Yes, ma'.

649
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:08,384
Maria, take that to the dining room
and serve it.

650
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:23,334
Gonza, not here!

651
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,082
Want me to come
and fuck you good?

652
00:54:41,187 --> 00:54:42,176
Tell me.

653
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,616
Want that?

654
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:55,363
Maria, begin preparing the dessert.

655
00:54:55,468 --> 00:54:56,958
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:54:58,137 --> 00:55:00,867
Maria, may I have a glass
of water, please.

657
00:55:13,886 --> 00:55:15,513
Was it good for you?

658
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:19,819
Just good or very, very good?

659
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:22,985
Very good.

660
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,522
How's Ignacio in the sack?

661
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:30,393
Let's say he's...

662
00:55:30,503 --> 00:55:33,063
...so-so.
- That means he sucks.

663
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,633
When we met,
he wasn't like that.

664
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:38,174
He was a good lover.

665
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:43,138
Or maybe I didn't know what
a good lover was like.

666
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,115
That's more like it.

667
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:48,780
But now it's a disaster.

668
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,682
I have the feeling...

669
00:55:51,323 --> 00:55:52,984
...he only does it
because he has to.

670
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,226
And when he does,
his head's somewhere else.

671
00:55:57,763 --> 00:56:01,665
You know why?
Because I think he doesn't like women.

672
00:56:04,036 --> 00:56:05,867
Why do you say that?

673
00:56:09,775 --> 00:56:12,801
Don't know.
I think he's a repressed fag.

674
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:15,871
Are you serious?

675
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:17,907
Yes...

676
00:56:18,017 --> 00:56:20,815
...although I know he'll never accept it.

677
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,020
Why do you say that?

678
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:27,652
Intuition.

679
00:56:29,728 --> 00:56:31,559
Sheer intuition.

680
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,070
Tell me the truth.

681
00:56:39,171 --> 00:56:41,571
Your 'gay-dar' never fails.

682
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:45,167
Thanks, but... Let's see...

683
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:50,010
The truth, the truth, the truth...

684
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,174
The truth is I don't
think your husband...

685
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:56,186
...is a closet gay.

686
00:56:58,057 --> 00:56:59,046
No.

687
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:00,715
To me...

688
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:06,988
...he's a crazed fag locked up in his
granny's dusty trunk with seven locks.

689
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,329
Poor thing!

690
00:57:10,436 --> 00:57:14,099
I feel sorry for him, because I can't
imagine when he'll come out of that closet...

691
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:16,868
...of that trunk, in there
where he's locked up.

692
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:18,973
But how?
Why do you say that?

693
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:23,913
Because sleeping with you and not wanting
to screw you every day, to me, seems...

694
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,984
...it's a crime.
A crime, my dear.

695
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:28,348
An unmentionable crime.

696
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,249
He doesn't like to make love to me.

697
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:32,324
No, no, no.
I'm talking about fucking.

698
00:57:32,424 --> 00:57:33,982
Real, honest-to-God-fucking.

699
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:36,527
Riding, humping, shagging,
as they say.

700
00:57:37,129 --> 00:57:38,221
And if your husband doesn't
want to fuck you...

701
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:41,129
...either he's really a fag
or he's impotent.

702
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:45,101
No, not impotent. That he isn't.
I know that for a fact.

703
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:46,932
Well, you're right about that.
I know it too.

704
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,399
What?

705
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:52,910
No, not the way you think.
Don't be silly.

706
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,113
I'm just kidding.
How can you even think?

707
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,947
Ready, sir.
That was the last one.

708
00:58:05,057 --> 00:58:08,254
I don't know why the last one
always hurts the most.

709
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:16,829
- Aurorita, give me a massage.
- Of course, sir.

710
00:58:25,444 --> 00:58:26,741
Shit!

711
00:58:33,752 --> 00:58:36,312
What do you say we leave
the massage for another day?

712
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:37,389
- Alright.
- I'll call you.

713
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:39,480
- Fine.
- Thanks.

714
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:42,757
Mariana, didn't I tell you
no interruptions?

715
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:44,725
<i>You stood me up, man.

716
00:58:45,164 --> 00:58:47,598
Weren't we going to have
dinner once a week?

717
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:52,498
Oh, you forgot!

718
00:58:54,006 --> 00:58:56,167
No, don't worry.
It's okay, man.

719
00:58:57,009 --> 00:58:59,534
I told you not to sweat it, man.

720
00:59:01,213 --> 00:59:04,046
But I will send you the bill, okay?

721
00:59:05,451 --> 00:59:06,975
Bye.

722
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:11,782
May I have the menu, please?

723
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:16,018
And a bottle of whisky,
blue label.

724
00:59:16,128 --> 00:59:17,755
- Right away, sir.
- Thanks.

725
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:00,464
What did you do?

726
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,032
What's that?

727
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:07,711
You said you wouldn't
wax your back anymore.

728
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,782
I don't like it, Zoe.

729
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:15,720
It makes me feel older.

730
01:00:16,722 --> 01:00:19,691
Besides, I want to be
attractive for you, babe.

731
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:24,924
You didn't think there was
another woman, did you?

732
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:31,926
Ignacio, I need to ask you something.

733
01:00:32,938 --> 01:00:34,405
Yes, sweetheart?

734
01:00:39,645 --> 01:00:41,875
Have you ever been with a man?

735
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:47,043
Yes.

736
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,215
I was with one today.

737
01:00:51,089 --> 01:00:53,319
An engineer from the factory.

738
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:58,089
We were together, checking out
the machinery we want to buy.

739
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,256
Don't get cute.
You know what I mean.

740
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:02,229
No, I don't know what you mean.

741
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:07,739
Have you ever...

742
01:01:08,774 --> 01:01:10,537
...had sex with another man?

743
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:17,677
No. Never.

744
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:23,587
Why do you ask me that, honey?

745
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:30,156
So you've never had sex with a man?

746
01:01:30,262 --> 01:01:32,230
I already told you.

747
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:36,464
I don't like men, Zoe.

748
01:01:38,504 --> 01:01:40,699
I like you.

749
01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:47,710
And I thought you'd ask me
something serious.

750
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:52,874
- Promise you're not gay.
- God! Zoe...

751
01:01:52,985 --> 01:01:55,010
...don't be silly. I don't have
to promise anything.

752
01:01:55,187 --> 01:01:57,587
- Promise.
- Alright, I promise.

753
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,054
Zoe...

754
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,061
...you are the love of my life.

755
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,558
No one else.

756
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,900
Now go to bed.
You're in a bad mood.

757
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,568
Gonza? Hey.

758
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:50,402
Fine.

759
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:54,609
I made a decision.

760
01:02:56,448 --> 01:02:58,211
I wrote him a letter.

761
01:03:14,967 --> 01:03:16,161
Maria...

762
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,064
...will you carry my bags
to the car, please?

763
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,296
Yes, ma'am.

764
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:04,272
Fuck!

765
01:04:08,253 --> 01:04:09,686
Who is it?

766
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,032
What do you want?

767
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,865
You're an asshole, Gonzalo.

768
01:04:27,339 --> 01:04:28,704
I love you too, motherfucker.

769
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:30,798
You're a son-of-a-bitch!

770
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,934
Hope Ma' doesn't hear you.

771
01:04:33,045 --> 01:04:34,979
How could you tell
Zoe I was a fag?

772
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,707
Don't touch me, man!

773
01:04:42,287 --> 01:04:43,618
Is that your problem?

774
01:04:43,722 --> 01:04:45,519
You and your fucking paintings!

775
01:04:45,624 --> 01:04:48,388
Don't touch my painting,
or I'll kick your ass.

776
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:50,256
Don't! Don't you dare
call me a fag again, asshole.

777
01:04:50,362 --> 01:04:51,386
Don't you dare.

778
01:04:54,232 --> 01:04:55,961
I forbid you to see Zoe again.

779
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:57,559
You hear me?

780
01:04:58,537 --> 01:04:59,799
What is it you want?

781
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:02,897
To destroy my marriage?
Is that it?

782
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:14,380
Who the fuck d'you think you are
to tell my wife I'm a fag?

783
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,946
Who do you think you are?

784
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:18,881
I only told her the truth, man.

785
01:05:21,259 --> 01:05:24,023
You think I don't remember,
asshole?

786
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:28,558
- What are you talking about?
- You know perfectly well...

787
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,362
...what I'm talking about,
you fag.

788
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,705
Tell me what you see here.

789
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:38,598
Nothing.

790
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:42,175
What do you see here, huh?

791
01:05:46,885 --> 01:05:50,048
What you see there
is that little boy's world, man.

792
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:55,348
A boy who's full of fear.
He's totally manipulated...

793
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:58,258
...because his older brother
wanted it that way, man.

794
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:02,294
I remember perfectly when you said

795
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,231
"Close your eyes, dude...

796
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:07,565
...and think about the girl
you like the most".

797
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,606
And when I finally
got to be with a woman...

798
01:06:10,709 --> 01:06:14,645
you know what's the first
thing I thought of?

799
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:19,511
You, man.

800
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:22,786
You, you fucking faggot.

801
01:06:26,725 --> 01:06:29,558
You molested me!
And I looked up to you, man.

802
01:06:31,096 --> 01:06:34,395
You were my idol.
I did everything...

803
01:06:34,499 --> 01:06:36,262
And now you come here
whining about stuff.

804
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,926
Fuck you, asshole!

805
01:06:41,973 --> 01:06:43,133
Get out of here!

806
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:47,669
Get out of here!

807
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,609
You're sick, Gonzalo.

808
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,284
Stay away from my wife.

809
01:07:55,547 --> 01:07:56,673
Zoe!

810
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,253
Fuck!

811
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,226
Gonzalo, you son-of-a-bitch.

812
01:08:17,736 --> 01:08:19,226
Son-of-a-bitch!

813
01:09:52,831 --> 01:09:55,561
I told Gonzalo I couldn't
get pregnant.

814
01:09:56,501 --> 01:09:58,435
- You lied to him!
- No, I didn't.

815
01:09:58,536 --> 01:09:59,867
I thought I couldn't.

816
01:10:02,607 --> 01:10:04,302
You must believe me Boris.

817
01:10:06,511 --> 01:10:08,536
Alright.
I believe you, sweetie.

818
01:10:10,682 --> 01:10:12,206
And now what?

819
01:10:13,385 --> 01:10:16,149
I'm sure you want to have
your baby anyway.

820
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:18,982
I think I do.

821
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,553
But...

822
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:29,826
...what if Gonzalo doesn't?

823
01:10:31,202 --> 01:10:33,500
If you want, you can have
it on your own.

824
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,834
I wouldn't like my child
to be fatherless.

825
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,610
Right.

826
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:49,212
If you want your child
to have a father...

827
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:52,621
...no problem.
I can be the father of your child.

828
01:10:54,692 --> 01:10:56,489
Just like that.

829
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:01,365
Just like that.

830
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:06,170
Me too, me too.
I mean, I adore myself.

831
01:11:08,706 --> 01:11:11,573
Would you really be willing?

832
01:11:13,445 --> 01:11:16,608
Of course, sweetie,
of course.

833
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,187
We admire the way
he's developed...

834
01:11:33,298 --> 01:11:35,198
...his market.
- Mainly because...

835
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,927
...he did it when so many...

836
01:11:37,035 --> 01:11:39,503
...factories were closing.
- That's why we want...

837
01:11:39,604 --> 01:11:41,504
...you to participate...

838
01:11:41,606 --> 01:11:43,574
...in our companies.

839
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:45,906
Participate.

840
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:47,603
Yes.

841
01:11:47,712 --> 01:11:49,839
What is it exactly you want?

842
01:11:50,782 --> 01:11:51,874
You want my..?

843
01:11:56,855 --> 01:11:58,789
My advice or my capital?

844
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:03,049
It's obvious that someone
as well informed as you

845
01:12:03,161 --> 01:12:04,788
knows we've had capital problems...

846
01:12:04,963 --> 01:12:06,521
Excuse me for a moment.

847
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,071
Excuse me.

848
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:28,478
Could you tell me
if Ms. Zoe Edwards...

849
01:12:28,586 --> 01:12:32,181
...is staying in this hotel?
- May I have her name again?

850
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,279
Edwards.

851
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:08,783
But you said you
couldn't get pregnant.

852
01:13:08,893 --> 01:13:10,952
So I thought.

853
01:13:12,397 --> 01:13:15,230
Gonza, It's a miracle
that I'm pregnant.

854
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:17,660
A miracle?
Are you out of your mind?

855
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,838
What if it's in your head?

856
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:31,674
How can you be so certain that
you are pregnant? Come on.

857
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:34,044
I did three tests,
they were all positive.

858
01:13:34,219 --> 01:13:36,414
Jesus! For the love of God, man!

859
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,349
Those tests are shit, man,
they're just shit.

860
01:13:44,329 --> 01:13:45,796
What will you do?

861
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:51,566
Damnit!

862
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,037
And you haven't slept
with anybody else?

863
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,142
No.

864
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,341
How do you know
Ignacio' s not the father?

865
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:11,154
- Ignacio shoots blanks.
- Says who?

866
01:14:11,522 --> 01:14:14,582
The same doctors who said
you can't have kids?

867
01:14:15,093 --> 01:14:16,651
Don't fuck with me.

868
01:14:16,861 --> 01:14:20,854
If you're pregnant, which I doubt because
those tests you took are useless...

869
01:14:20,965 --> 01:14:23,058
...you have two choices.

870
01:14:23,735 --> 01:14:26,033
Either you tell Ignacio he's the father...

871
01:14:27,472 --> 01:14:28,530
...or you get rid of it.

872
01:14:31,242 --> 01:14:32,732
An abortion?

873
01:14:35,313 --> 01:14:37,611
Is that your advice?

874
01:14:38,249 --> 01:14:40,274
Either that or you tell
Ignacio he's the father.

875
01:14:40,385 --> 01:14:41,613
Those are your two choices.

876
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,883
You don't care
it's yours, do you?

877
01:14:50,895 --> 01:14:52,522
How can that be?

878
01:14:53,398 --> 01:14:56,265
How the fuck do I
know it's mine, huh?

879
01:14:57,602 --> 01:14:58,591
You lied to me.

880
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,038
You said you couldn't get pregnant and
now you want to have a child with me.

881
01:15:03,141 --> 01:15:05,006
Well, go screw yourself!

882
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:11,645
Don't call me.

883
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:15,378
Don't look me up, I don't want this
ever mentioned again.

884
01:15:15,486 --> 01:15:18,387
Once I leave this room
you don't know me, got it?

885
01:16:06,904 --> 01:16:07,893
Yes?

886
01:16:08,005 --> 01:16:10,098
Good morning, Ms. Berkley,
this just came for you.

887
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:15,741
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

888
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:42,764
<i>Congratulations, Ignacio.

889
01:16:44,575 --> 01:16:45,803
Don't be afraid, Zoe.

890
01:16:46,744 --> 01:16:49,269
I'll be discreet.

891
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:51,271
No one can forgive me.

892
01:16:51,382 --> 01:16:52,679
Don't say that.

893
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:56,811
We're all sinners and God always
forgives those who repent.

894
01:17:00,691 --> 01:17:02,591
I'm pregnant.

895
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,151
Shouldn't that make you happy?

896
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:08,826
Haven't you and Ignacio
tried for years?

897
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,130
Yes, but...

898
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:16,171
...Ignacio' s not the father.

899
01:17:26,484 --> 01:17:27,917
Who is it?

900
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:31,889
I can't tell you.

901
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:34,852
Tell me everything, Zoe.

902
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:36,449
Or God won't forgive you.

903
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:37,955
I can't.

904
01:17:40,498 --> 01:17:43,262
My guess is you haven't
considered an abortion.

905
01:17:43,768 --> 01:17:45,531
God wouldn't forgive that.

906
01:17:45,636 --> 01:17:47,001
Human life is sacred.

907
01:17:47,171 --> 01:17:49,264
You must have that child.

908
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,499
Ignacio will kill it.

909
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:53,001
Tell him it's his.

910
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,607
Tell him God works miracles.

911
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,449
Ignacio and I go a long way back...

912
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:03,679
...he's a very kind, noble soul.

913
01:18:04,355 --> 01:18:05,879
He'll believe you.

914
01:18:39,624 --> 01:18:41,387
In fact, Zoe...

915
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:43,585
...this goes against my ethics...

916
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:45,995
...but I empathize with you.

917
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:50,333
You can solve your problem here.

918
01:18:52,803 --> 01:18:55,499
Call them but don't mention me.

919
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:53,624
<i>Here lies Juan Ignacio Edwards</i>
<i>A memory of his beloved wife Christina

<i>I found your phone in the pool.

922
01:20:29,467 --> 01:20:32,925
<i>I'm sending you a new one</i>
<i>so you can call Gonzalo.

<i>If you press number 1</i>

<i>I still love you,</i>
<i>Ignacio.

926
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:17,769
I want to explain what happened.

927
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:22,070
You don't have to explain anything.

928
01:22:26,884 --> 01:22:28,647
Gonzalo wants me to get rid of it.

929
01:22:28,786 --> 01:22:31,983
Forget Gonzalo.
He's not worth it.

930
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:37,860
Only you and the baby matter.

931
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:43,461
Zoe, I'm with you.

932
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:47,998
I'll be your unconditional ally
for anything you need.

933
01:22:51,308 --> 01:22:53,606
If you want, I'll be the father
of your child.

934
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,838
But I must...

935
01:22:57,214 --> 01:23:00,274
...tell you something
before you say yes.

936
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,349
What?

937
01:23:21,672 --> 01:23:23,071
Tell me.

938
01:23:23,941 --> 01:23:25,306
It's embarrassing.

939
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,412
I've never told anyone.

940
01:23:32,449 --> 01:23:34,713
- Is there another woman?
- No.

941
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,594
I like men.

942
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,467
Zoe, I love you.

943
01:23:52,136 --> 01:23:54,661
I love you more than anything.

944
01:23:57,107 --> 01:23:59,302
But I like men.

945
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,907
I can't help it.

946
01:24:14,358 --> 01:24:16,292
Well, I want to be a mother.

947
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,490
I've dreamed about it for years.

948
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,075
And if you want
to be the father.

949
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,712
I'll never leave you.

950
01:24:38,883 --> 01:24:40,817
I wouldn't leave you
for any one else.

951
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:46,152
But if we're going to be together...

952
01:24:47,992 --> 01:24:52,326
...I need to now that if I feel like
being with a man, you won't say no.

953
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:03,505
It's only fair.

01:27:02,793 --> 01:27:04,090
isn't that right?

974
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:09,290
This is a miracle, he even has that little
dimple just like your Dad, Ignacio.

975
01:27:10,634 --> 01:27:14,035
Definitely,
he is an Edwards.

976
01:27:14,505 --> 01:27:15,972
I don't see he looks that much like me.

977
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:18,702
Come on, Ignacio, for God's sake...

978
01:27:18,809 --> 01:27:21,642
...this kid is your son,
wherever he might go.

979
01:27:21,879 --> 01:27:24,848
Also, a Mother is never wrong,

980
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,245
you cannot deny it.

981
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:27,748
No Mom,

982
01:27:27,851 --> 01:27:30,547
I do not deny anything anymore.

983
01:27:30,851 --> 01:28:30,547
