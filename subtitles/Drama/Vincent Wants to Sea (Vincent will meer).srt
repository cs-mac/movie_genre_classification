00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,929
"Where I am am, death is not."

3
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,655
"And where death death is, I am not."

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,533
And with that, he was right.

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,298
We are gathered here today,

6
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,169
to pay tribute to a loving mother
and a good friend.

7
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,254
Katharina loved life.
(Vincent shouts)

8
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,978
She tried to be there for everyone.

9
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,371
(whispers)
For her son; for her friends.

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,659
And often to the point of
ignoring her own needs.

11
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,612
Ah! Cunt!

12
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,293
Cunt! Fuck! Cunt!

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,296
(Religious song)

14
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,069
vincent wants to sea

15
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,379
Everywhere, these bottles!
- Where is this? San Vincente?

16
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,135
She wanted you to bring her there?

17
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,258
She didn't dare to ask you.

18
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,940
Can I see for a second, please?

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,893
When did she say that?

20
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,649
She's laughing there.

21
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,691
When was that?

22
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,653
Before you were born.

23
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,419
Are you going to move back in? With her?
- We're selling the house.

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,133
Why is this packed?

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,427
Why is it packed, Vincent?
- I was going to take her there.

26
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:07,328
- Where?
- There. To the sea.

27
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,579
Of all people, you, Vincent? Yeah?
- Yes. Me. You weren't there.

28
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,739
You? Going to the sea? You can't even
make it to the baker anymore.

29
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,734
You and your mother!
You watched over her good.

30
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,330
You held her hand,
while she drank and got drunk.

31
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,588
Are you disappointed because I can't play
football anymore? Because Mom drank? Or what?

32
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:29,547
Without you, she would have never drank!

33
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,572
I'm not going to a home!

34
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,299
You'll see. You'll like it.
You'll make do in no time.

35
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,416
There are lots of people your age there.
- People like me, you mean?

36
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,217
It wasn't easy to get a place here. Having
the right connections is everything.

37
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,173
You'll learn that too eventually.

38
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,451
Are you going to give me one?
- It's empty.

39
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,620
I got the impression that...
- Regardless. Curable and treatable,

40
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,976
those are two completely
different concepts.

41
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,922
The professor assured me that...
- Tourettes isn't curable per se,

42
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,980
But, except for a few specific
forms of behavioral therapy,

43
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,514
it's definitely possible for those afflicted,
to lead a relatively normal life.

44
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:33,890
(She clears her throat.)
Yeah, that's what I meant.

45
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,478
We work here with habit-reversal training.
This is a technique, in which patients learn

46
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,027
to reroute the tics, by expressing them
through other movements.

47
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,019
He wants that! Right, Vincent?
Let's do it!

48
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,978
Would you do me a favor?
- Of course.

49
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,618
Please wait outside. I would like to speak
with Vincent alone. Thank you.

50
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,453
Thursday morning at 8:30?

51
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,169
Just a second.
- Grünwald. I'll mark you down.

52
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,394
I'm not going to lie to you:
You will need to learn to live with it.

53
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:29,137
But you don't have to do that by yourself.

54
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,853
I want the shit to stop.

55
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,094
What would you do, if you had
better control of your tics?

56
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,099
Up until now, that wasn't even a possibility.
- But now it is one.

57
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,178
I don't know. A lot.
- Something more concrete?

58
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,856
Finish high school.
Maybe go to university.

59
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,698
Then let's give it a shot.

60
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,853
Yeah.

61
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,849
Until Christmas.
- Yep. You already told me.

62
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,178
Ah, and don't forget to vote!

63
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,931
I already filled out everything.
You only need to sign it.

64
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,933
Bye.

65
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,776
(Honk)

66
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,251
Because of your mother's death, it would
probably be better if you weren't alone.

67
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,376
So you'll have a double room.

68
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,693
Down here.

69
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,016
(Classical music)

70
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,296
(Knocking)

71
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,333
No.

72
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,579
Alexander?

73
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,759
Hello, Alexander.
- I didn't say "come in".

74
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,660
Come.

75
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,494
Pardon me, this here is Vincent.
- Hello.

76
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,333
Yeah, and?
- He'll be staying here for awhile.

77
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,333
What!?
- This is your bed, Vincent.

78
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,449
If anything is wrong, please come find me.
- Dr. Rose! This is my room!

79
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,997
You'll share the room with Vincent now.
- I can gladly sleep whereever.

80
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,956
Yes, good. He can sleep wherever. In House B...
- Alexander, I expect your cooperation!

81
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,049
Get settled in for now. I'll see how
you're doing by Monday at the latest.

82
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,453
Classical.

83
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,213
Bach.

84
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,418
The bathroom here is only for washing.If you
have to use the toilet... don't do it here.

85
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,016
(Music)

86
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,932
They'll throw you out for that.
- Why is that?

87
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,973
Is it something to smoke?
- No.

88
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,569
Right...
- No!

89
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,736
Marie.
- Huh?

90
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,889
I am Marie.
I'm to show you around the clinic.

91
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,699
No face mask today?
- Have you gained weight? You look so fat.

92
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,002
There's one ground rule in the clinic:
We shall do as we wish.

93
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:39,138
If you're caught with alcohol or drugs,
then you'll get thrown out.

94
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:41,881
What are you doing?
- I have to sneeze.

95
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,700
If they catch you, then they think you aren't
taking it seriously and so you must go.

96
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,659
So watch out. With the grass, or whatever
that was. This here is House B.

97
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,779
Cunt! Fuck you! Dirty slut! Sorry!
- Excuse me?

98
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,618
I didn't mean that. Tittyfuck!

99
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,976
Tourettes. Cunt.

100
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,494
There was one like that here before.
He shoved his hand into his belt like that.

101
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,579
And then there were two.
He looked like shit though.

102
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,413
Theater and table tennis.

103
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,492
TV.

104
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,859
You can take out books here.
They're all shit though.

105
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,535
Football.

106
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,097
Football, morning strechtes, gymnastics,
smokers' field... Whatever you want!

107
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,178
Kitchen. Cafeteria.
That's it. Any questions?

108
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,653
Um... Thanks for the tour.

109
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,815
It was a punishment. She said it
was a part of behavioral therapy.

110
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,372
Did you touch my figurines?
- No.

111
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,218
Shoes off!

112
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,654
Take your shoes off please!
Don't touch me!

113
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,173
What are you going to do in there?

114
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,092
Hello!

115
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,500
Do you hear me?

116
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,333
Leave my towels alone!
If you are taking a shit, I will flip out!

117
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,736
(Vincent makes a farting noise.)
NO! NO!!

118
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,973
Doctor! Doctor Rose!

119
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,496
(Vincent groans)

120
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,620
Are you masturbating?

121
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,498
That needs to be arranged for.

122
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,654
Can you play your music again?
Please?

123
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,936
(Classical music by Bach)

124
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,916
I am not interested in others,

125
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,316
in case Dr. Rose said anything about me.

126
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,935
She didn't.

127
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,493
Good.

128
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,573
Sorry!

129
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,694
Have you already eaten everything?
Then you can go.

130
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,416
(Music)

131
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,889
They can see you from the clinic.
- Hm.

132
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,053
Want any? Help me out?

133
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,373
With?

134
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,132
Thanks.
- Thanks for what you did during lunch.

135
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,133
Welcome.

136
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,060
Hey, Ho! Fuck you!

137
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,614
Bah! Must kiss!

138
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,211
What a weirdo!
- Film him. Photos can't capture it!

139
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:19,256
Little shits! Get lost!
Get out of here!
- Freak! What's wrong with you?

140
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,851
Turn that fucking thing off! Turn it off!
- Come get it! Come on!

141
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,456
Vincent, ignore them!
- Asshole! Come get it!

142
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,494
Come on!
(The boys scream.)

143
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,693
Run! Run!

144
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,009
Hey!
- Give me that fucking phone!

145
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,098
Are you crazy?
(Unintelligible screaming)

146
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,340
Shit, you're bleeding. Asshole!
- You'll be hearing from my dad, you ass!

147
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,419
What were you thinking Vincent?
Those were children! Children, Marie!

148
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,579
You know the problems
we have with the neighbors.
- I'm sorry.

149
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,544
Those were his personal rights!
They wouldn't stop filming him.

150
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:09,860
I didn't ask you.

151
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,217
I answered you anyway.
- That's no reason to beat somebody bloody!

152
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,378
He fell. Were you there?

153
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,573
Sorry.

154
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,178
Nothing happened.

155
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,498
Enough for now, Marie.

156
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,219
Vincent, would you please give
us a moment alone?

157
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,157
I have to talk with Marie
about her bloodwork.

158
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,134
Sit back down!
- Never! You wouldn't dare!

159
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,218
This isn't a game anymore, Marie!

160
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,334
I have a car.
We can drive anywhere!

161
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,293
Now?

162
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,618
Yes or no?
Where do you want to go?

163
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,700
To the sea. To Italy.

164
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,295
Ok.

165
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,616
(Music)

166
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,774
Here.
- You drive.

167
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,858
Why?
- I don't drive so well.

168
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,571
Stop! Stop!

169
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,453
Are you crazy? What were you doing there?

170
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,019
Give me back my Bach,
or else I'll report you!  - What?

171
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,579
My CD! I saw you pocket it!

172
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,818
Amicably. I'll give it back in the morning.
- No!

173
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,338
Give it to him. He'll shout back otherwise!

174
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,014
That's not your car.
That belongs to Dr. Rose.
You're planning to steal it.

175
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,613
No. We're borrowing it.
- Oh, borrowing?

176
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,649
Yeah Dr. Rose gave it to us, in order to get something.
Tell him.

177
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,858
She loaned it to us. Exactly.

178
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,891
Then you'd have no problem
if I went and asked her now.

179
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,456
(Music)

180
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,498
What now?
- We take him with us.

181
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,611
What?
- Come on!

182
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,136
(Music)

183
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,459
No! I said "stop"! Stop!
What now?

184
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,253
Out.
- What am I supposed to do here?

185
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,458
You want to get out. Here you go.
- Yeah, but not here. At home.

186
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,539
The clinic is hardly a home, Alex!
- I'm not getting out here. This is not nice!

187
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,498
No, this is not...
- Ah!

188
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,410
Quit it. Leave it for now, he's scared.
Let's go, okay?

189
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,496
(Music)

190
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,930
We should avoid highways.
There are cameras everywhere.

191
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,691
There are only highways on here though.
- To get to Italy, you have to take the Brenner though!

192
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,014
Shut up in the back!
Over the mountains to Austria works too, right?

193
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,499
What do you want in Italy anyway?
- To take a vacation.

194
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,934
Vincent and I want to take a proper vacation.
- Yeah right. Likely story.

195
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,893
You don't have to come. Fuck!

196
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,456
(Music)

197
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,696
(Thunder)

198
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,651
There are crumbs on the back seat. I want
to drive from now on. - Fuck you.

199
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,619
I also have a license.
And I drive better than you.

200
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,738
Okay, you can drive next time then, Alex.

201
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,456
(Music)

202
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,738
Okay, we're all set.
Whose holding up the show?

203
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,133
Come over here now.

204
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,337
Robert? Robert!

205
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,374
What now?
- You've got something here.

206
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,536
What?
(Cell-phone)

207
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,619
Cell phones off! You won't need
them right now.  - Yeah. Galler.

208
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,973
What? Doctor who?
- Dr. Rose.

209
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,700
Oh yeah. Now? Yeah...

210
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,454
Does Vincent have his own cell phone?
- Not that I know of. Why?
Ask him yourself.

211
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,212
Yeah, that is unfortunately
not possible, because... Well,
I have to tell you, they stole my car.

212
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,893
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Mr. Galler?

213
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,658
For fuck's sake.

214
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,809
Magnificent cleaning there.
You really are a bit nuts, Alex.

215
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,498
And the gas for the Saab, please.

216
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,933
Pump two.

217
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,459
Not working.
- That can't be. Can you... cunt!

218
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,453
What?

219
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,979
Sorry.

220
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,494
Fuck. My card isn't working.
You have to pay.

221
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,780
I don't have anything.

222
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,896
And him?
- No idea.

223
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,580
Alex? Do you have money?
- Huh?

224
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,134
Do you have money?
- Money?

225
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,693
Shit!

226
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,529
And what do we do now?
- Look out, coming through.

227
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,773
Hm?

228
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,416
Alex? Get in the car.
- Are you planning to leave without paying?

229
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,498
Just do it!
- Get in. Now!

230
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,734
Don't touch me!
- Good. Then you can stay here.

231
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,401
Do you have the key?
Where's the car keys?

232
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:03,060
Here! We agreed that I can drive now.

233
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,312
Uh uh. It's my turn.
- Give them to me. Fucking shit!

234
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:07,206
- Let him drive. It doesn't
make a fucking difference.

235
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,649
Exactly!
- Jeez!

236
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,658
We agreed.
- The guy is coming!

237
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,738
Drive!
- How do I put it in gear?

238
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,769
Don't touch!
- Drive now!

239
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,179
Are you stupid?
- You have to get used to this kind of car.

240
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,456
Hey! Come back!

241
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,046
I'm a great driver!
- Stop right now! I'll hit you.

242
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:40,018
I'll drive into the ditch.
- You're not slowing down! Alex!

243
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:42,252
This is my space. Okay.
Yours is back there with the crumbs.

244
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:44,860
Cunt! You almost ran him over!
- Did you just call me a...?

245
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,217
That was his tourettes, you idiot!
- No, I meant that one!

246
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,773
Mr. Galler?

247
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,409
Have you notified the police?
- No.     - Good.

248
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,639
Tell me, how could something like this happen?
This is neglect of your custodial duties.

249
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,932
Sorry, but Vincent is 27.
He can go when he wants.

250
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:16,127
He doesn't need to ask for permission...
- He's handicapped!

251
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,648
Oh okay, so we should keep him confined?
- I don't see it that way.

252
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:21,627
Dr. Rose, I have the report.

253
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:23,917
The other two, they're also...
- Handicapped?

254
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,339
Yeah, whatever.

255
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:28,761
Alexander is obssessive compulsive
and Marie is anorexic.

256
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:33,140
Right. Well, he won't be going far.
I would like to see his room.

257
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,452
Why won't he get far?
- I froze his bank account.

258
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,579
He thinks I'm going to finance this?
- You son is in a state of shock.

259
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,856
His only parental figure just died.

260
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,752
He's in shock.
That's great.

261
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,739
You're hardly a parent to him.
- He's never done anything criminal before.

262
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,418
Ask yourself, why he's done this.
- How did he get your car keys?

263
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,657
(Cell phone)

264
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,213
Yeah?

265
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,895
Yes. No. Why?

266
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,374
Police!
(speaker phone)

267
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,458
Have you driven anywhere today?
- No, why?

268
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,498
There was a gas station theft.

269
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,611
Wait. I'm coming with you.

270
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,178
They are my patients. I would like
to be there. Let me grab my bag.

271
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,653
How much money do we have?

272
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,812
11 Euros.

273
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,611
Marie could eat for a year with that.
- Shut up, Alex.

274
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,779
You sure you don't want any?
- No thanks, I'm not hungry.

275
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,449
Do you want a salad maybe?
- Thanks, but no.

276
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,654
Look here, a cucumber.
- Leave me alone. You're not my doctor.

277
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,939
You can't be serious. - What?
Clean that up!

278
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,889
Wipe your fingers off. Who knows
where you hands have been.

279
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,932
Get out if
you're going to yell.

280
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,178
What's really in the box?

281
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,929
My mother.

282
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,620
Oh shit.

283
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,770
I mean, I thought maybe something like that,
but I thought it was a dog or something.

284
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,013
Nope.

285
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,699
I'm sorry...
Did you hear me?

286
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,580
Let's keep going.

287
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,149
I'll do it. I can manage alone.

288
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,221
Yes, please. Important thing
is that you drive a bit slower.

289
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:46,441
Don't worry.
I know how to speak with these people.

290
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:47,705
I've been doing this for years.
You can believe me.

291
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,860
I'm amazed at how close you
are to the common people!

292
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,493
And? What did you find out?

293
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,494
Let's try to stay calm.
- I see.

294
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,739
May I speak with him now?
- Sure, sure. Be my guest.

295
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,898
I need the number of the
marketing department for Pretrol AG.

296
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,053
Oh wow, this is a great
shop you got here!

297
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,973
Do you have Espresso?

298
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,812
Nowadays you can find
good espresso almost anywhere.

299
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:54,706
But 10 years ago?
Couldn't find good service!

300
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,336
Piss off. I don't know where they went.
I'm not withdrawing my complaint.

301
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,734
I'd do it myself if I could. Don't
get on my nerves now. 1.20 Euros.

302
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,691
The rest is for you. Buy
a little sense of humor with it.

303
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,818
And?
- No go. You messed it up.

304
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,130
The complaint has been withdrawn.
Their leaseholders are under good control.

305
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,454
Can I drop you at the train station?
I'm already late to an important appointment.

306
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,538
I thought we were looking for your son?

307
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,745
This is serious. I came along
in order to find my patients.

308
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:38,098
Yeah, Monika? Hi, it's me.
I'm done here.

309
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:40,242
The GPS says,
I'll be in at about 5:00 PM...

310
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,756
Pay attention!
If you leave me here,

311
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:45,478
I'll report Vincent as a car-thief.

312
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,839
Your connections won't help you!
I'll go to every fucking tabloid newspaper...

313
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,243
I will drag you through the mud.

314
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:55,909
I am going to bring this
girl back safely to the clinic.

315
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,552
Think! Where can they be?
They need to eat.

316
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,036
The boys at least...

317
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,972
Where can they get someting
to eat around here?

318
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:05,839
Around here?
They could be anywhere.

319
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,778
No, they couldn't.
- Why not?    - Because it's raining.

320
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,453
There, that's the highest setting.

321
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,420
It's going even slower.

322
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,336
(Music)

323
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,016
(Unintelligible talking)

324
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,530
It's stopped.

325
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,493
What?
- It's not raining anymore.

326
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,658
Where is Marie?
- Taking a leak, I suppose.

327
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,456
Okay, that's enough. We go back now.
- They must be somewhere around here!

328
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,138
10 Minutes. Please!

329
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,454
It stopped raining 30 minutes ago.
Waste of time now.

330
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,218
Fucking bullshit!

331
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:11,172
I quit 3 years ago.
Overnight. Cold turkey.

332
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,016
Five messages.

333
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,459
Mr. Galler.

334
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,973
Mr. Galler! They are here!

335
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,139
Don't rush in. We need to consider...
- Vincent!

336
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,813
Or not!

337
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,293
Vincent!

338
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,853
Vincent!

339
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,932
Fuck off.
- Who is that?

340
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,652
My father.
- What?

341
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,938
Where is Marie?     - No idea.
- Marie!

342
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,000
They're going to get a piece of my mind.

343
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,060
You should have let them be.
I'm warning you!

344
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,894
I'll do things my way and
you do things your way! Okay?

345
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,339
Mr. Galler, I won't allow it...
You'll ruin everything!

346
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,017
Mr. Galler! Hey!

347
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,014
Stop! Hey!

348
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,373
Marie!

349
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,853
Marie!

350
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,292
Get in! Get in!

351
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,813
Get out. Let's go, come on!

352
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,173
Where are your things?

353
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,978
Okay, let's go.
- Don't touch me.

354
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,133
What came over you?
Rob a gas station. You're crazy!

355
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,615
You could have ruined everything
that I've built up. You're worthless!

356
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:19,260
Worthless.
Fooled me.

357
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,268
Marie.

358
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:24,814
Not from you. Not you. Or did you
think that I'd allow this? Get in.

359
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:29,330
For all this to depend on you.
- Are you okay? Have you had enough to drink?

360
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,938
You're simply not going to do it.
- Here.

361
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,493
Excuse me.
- What now?

362
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,852
Are you planning on just leaving us here?
- You have a car.

363
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,653
Stop!

364
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,300
What?
- My bag!

365
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,131
Here you are. Your bag.

366
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,132
Hey!
- Sorry.

367
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,533
Hey!

368
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,573
Alexander!

369
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,413
Vincent!

370
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,128
Vincent!
- Alex, come on!

371
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,651
Hang on. I've got you.
- Don't touch me. Piss hands!

372
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,613
 I don't have piss hands!

373
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,172
Cool car!

374
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,500
And so clean!

375
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,059
Man, I like your father!
- You can have him.

376
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,013
We're going straight to hell.
- Yeah!

377
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,493
And I don't give a fuck!

378
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,494
What's wrong?

379
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,699
Everything you say is a cause for therapy!

380
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,675
Mind your own business!
- That's what I'm doing.

381
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:28,543
The girl is missing, she belongs in therapy,
and I'm on duty early tomorrow morning.

382
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:31,332
You think I have nothing better to do
than to look for your piggy-keychain here?

383
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,344
It's a good luck charm!
A little luck couldn't hurt.

384
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:36,257
You let them snatch the keys. Were it
not for you, I wouldn't be standing here!

385
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:37,741
Projecting.       - What?
Yeah, projecting your behavior.

386
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:40,085
Typical politician.
Always someone else's fault.

387
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:40,977
Fuck off.

388
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:46,327
Ah, second stage. Insults.
Now help me look some more.

389
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,070
Shit!       - What is it?
My phone.    - Yeah and?

390
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,995
My phone is in the car.   - And?
It's in MY car!

391
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,771
This is a catastrophe!
All of my numbers are in there!

392
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,484
It's showing San Vincente 17 times.
6 times in Spain, 9 times in Italy.

393
00:41:08,484 --> 00:41:09,921
What should I enter?

394
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,318
In Italy, on the sea!

395
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:16,467
On what sea?
I can't just put in "sea".

396
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:20,426
In Liguria there are 2, in Tuscany 5.
Ah! Something's vibrating!

397
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,498
What now?
- On my ass! Get rid of it!

398
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,700
(Cell phone)
What is that?

399
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,653
Hello?

400
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,660
For you.
- No.

401
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,692
He doesn't want to talk to you.
What?

402
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,776
(Music)

403
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,780
What did he say?

404
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,210
Nothing. Thank you.

405
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,094
What would you have done in his place?
- What kind of question is that?

406
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,179
You father tells you that you're worthless.
What would you do?

407
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,182
You can't compare us.
I'm not incompetent.

408
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:22,215
No.

409
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,971
My father always had respect for me.
- And if he hadn't?

410
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,770
I'd convince him otherwise.
They're going to Italy.

411
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,971
That imbecile!
- Mr. Galler, please! Who is that then?

412
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,013
His mother.

413
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,131
Where is the ignition here?
- On the middle console.

414
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,851
There must be two wires somewhere.
I can just hot-wire it.

415
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,693
Oh.

416
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,178
Yeah, then we can get going.

417
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,733
And the steering lock?

418
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,485
No problem, Doctor.

419
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:19,423
No. Don't do that.
There's another way. Don't break...

420
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,256
I depend on this car!

421
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,733
He really took me for a ride.

422
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,253
Are you able to tell
when the tics are coming?

423
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,146
Yes.

424
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,973
What does it feel like?

425
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,899
It sort of builds up.
Like when you have to sneeze.

426
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,614
Are you able to stop them?
- Can you stop a sneeze on purpose?

427
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,016
(Music)

428
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,016
(Music)

429
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,693
I'm not going to discuss that now.
I am well aware...

430
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,416
(Music)

431
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,374
I said this earlier.
- You said what?

432
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,449
This wouldn't have happened if I drove.
This is Germany! Is there a sea here?

433
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,492
Every GPS system needs a destination.
Otherwise it won't work.

434
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:24,740
You have to think linearly.

435
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,686
Think linearly?
- Yeah, that's how chips work.

436
00:46:26,686 --> 00:46:29,414
They need clear information.
Not San Vincente or whatever.

437
00:46:29,606 --> 00:46:32,319
Then I'll go buy a map now.
- I'm driving!

438
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,209
Good! You drive! Please!
You're driving me crazy!

439
00:46:37,773 --> 00:46:39,346
Shit!

440
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:42,360
We can't get a map for 3.80 euros.
- Then we'll steal one.

441
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,318
I'll do it.
- You?

442
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,093
Yeah, me.

443
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,616
(Bells)

444
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,295
Good evening.
Disposable gloves are where?

445
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,613
Relax a little bit.

446
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,620
Relax.

447
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:23,332
I have a clown in my head, that's just
standing between synapses fucking shit up.

448
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,402
Who always forces me to do,
that which is most useless to me.

449
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:31,135
Relax is just about the
last thing that I can do.

450
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,720
Fuck!

451
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,573
Why don't you eat?
- What?

452
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,889
My brain is broken, but you
just need to eat something.

453
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,373
It's not that simple.

454
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,413
Why?

455
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,058
Because maybe I don't want to eat anything!

456
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,452
You can't understand.
- Hey!

457
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,252
Start the motor!
Quickly! Quickly! Drive!

458
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,530
How did you manage all that?
- Yeah, come on! Drive! Drive! Shit!

459
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,096
(Classical music by Bach)

460
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,853
Woohoo!

461
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,173
Bravo!

462
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,936
(Classical music by Bach)

463
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,493
Look out!

464
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,088
Might I suggest that
we stop at the next hotel?

465
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,529
Yeah. I think I need that.

466
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,058
Ah! I can't sleep.

467
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,338
You seemed to be
sleeping fine in the car.

468
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,196
Putting me on the defensive.

469
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,060
Good rhetoric. Very nice!

470
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,609
Nobody's perfect.

471
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,612
Uh, this girl...
- Marie?

472
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,420
Yeah, is that her name?

473
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,099
She eats little.
- Very little.

474
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,488
Is that all?

475
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,896
If she wants it so. 30% chance of death.
- Aha.

476
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:25,852
Besides that she has a heart defect
from the years of malnutrition.

477
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,213
And...

478
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,300
Is your therapy helping?

479
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,373
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

480
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,214
Do you have children?

481
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,412
Yeah, I can understand.
You don't want to get involved with that.

482
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,499
One starves themselves to death
and the other... well.

483
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:58,398
You don't get a choice here.
- Nope.    - Unfortunately.

484
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,855
I'm going to bed.

485
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,735
If I said something, that you...
- No. I'm just tired.

486
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,619
It just looks gross when people eat.

487
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:24,656
It's just so disgusting and horrid
when people cram stuff inside themselves.

488
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,938
It's much crazier to not eat anything.

489
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,779
I know that sounds totally insane,
but it's just how it is.

490
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,001
You had to stop in there.

491
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,993
The toilet situation
here is simply fantastic!

492
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,494
Well, that's great for you, Alex!
- Yes. I just wanted to tell you two.

493
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,611
Tell me, are you smoking some weed?
- Pot numbs the pain, Alex.

494
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:55,692
What pain?
- Pain originating from self-harm, says Dr. Rose.

495
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:03,250
She had herself an eating disorder and she knows
that I know that. That's why she hates me.

496
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,456
(Music)

497
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,100
Can you dance?

498
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,893
Yes.

499
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,493
This is a Waltz.
- Yeah and?

500
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,253
"Yeah and" means no.

501
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,613
You could show me.

502
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,133
Hey!

503
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,656
(Music)

504
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,733
Then give me a proper kiss!

505
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,258
Hey, there's a TV in here!

506
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,013
You?

507
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,933
Promise me something?
- Hm?

508
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,378
Eat something today? Just a little bit?

509
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,859
I promise.

510
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,499
Can we drive there?

511
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,053
Yes, definitely.

512
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,138
Be careful.

513
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,609
Pardon?
- I don't think she can love you.

514
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,495
She can't.
- Thanks for the compliment.

515
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,249
What?
- It's impossible to just talk with you.

516
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,416
(whistle)

517
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,931
Do you think the peak is far?
- No idea.

518
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,575
Let's go up!
- Maybe that's a bad idea.

519
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,658
It's magnificent.
- You two are loud.

520
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,649
He has tourettes, and now he wants
to go up this mountain. - Yes!

521
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,853
I'll report it again then.

522
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:32,895
The clinic will turn to the police
if Marie isn't found by 1 pm.

523
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,611
It seems like you have a guilty conscience.
If you ask me.

524
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,171
I threatened to let Marie be force-fed.
Immobilized.

525
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,453
Stomach-tube. Restrained. etc.

526
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,929
That's probably why she ran off.

527
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,575
Would you watch the speed limit please.
- We're in Italy.

528
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:07,138
You just need to hang on the Italians
and nothing will go wrong.

529
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,293
Marie!

530
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,373
Here!

531
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,136
Marie! Come here!

532
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,460
I'm coming!

533
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,176
(Music)

534
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,176
(Music)

535
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,338
I think I can see the sea!

536
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,613
Oh, wow.

537
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,168
That's not the sea.
- Doesn't even matter.

538
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,012
Yeah. You're right.

539
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,296
(Music)

540
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,416
(Music)

541
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,256
(Police siren)

542
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,934
You're planning to give him money?
- A little bit for his wife. We're in Italy!

543
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:59,815
This car has been reported stolen.
- No, that was a misunderstanding.

544
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,132
This is my car. My car.
- Her car.

545
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,096
Your license, please.

546
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:11,019
I don't have it with me.
It's in the clinic. Clinic!

547
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,375
She's a doctor.
- Dottoressa?

548
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,933
Si!
- Yes.

549
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:20,734
Please drive into the parking lot over there.
- Eh... No can do.

550
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,538
No can do?
- Yes.

551
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,816
Drive! Avanti!

552
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,576
(Motor starting)

553
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,409
Uh oh.
You almost lost your mother.

554
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,613
Thanks.

555
01:00:39,356 --> 01:00:41,256
What are we going to do,
if we get to the sea?

556
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:44,813
No idea. I haven't thought about it yet.

557
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,573
I'll drive farther.
- What do you mean, farther?

558
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,738
South. I've never been to Africa.

559
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,649
Yeah, me neither.

560
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,739
Also, I have, in any case, money.
I didn't want to say anything.

561
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,700
What do you mean,
you have money?

562
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,456
My orphan's pension.

563
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,216
17,437 Euros!
- No way.

564
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,019
Are you crazy?
You had money this entire time?

565
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,550
Well excuse me!
I'm obviously the only one here,

566
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:38,417
who wasn't expecting us to succeed.

567
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,775
Yeah. How did you two imagine
this going? Without money.

568
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,539
Bah! Fuck!
- Yes! Thank you!

569
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,776
(Music)

570
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,416
(Music)

571
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:32,369
I have the right to call my lawyer.
Don't touch me!

572
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,296
(Music)

573
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,899
You can't carry me the whole way.
- Why not?

574
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:00,010
Hey! Look at me!
- Leave me be!

575
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,493
Fuck.

576
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,896
(Music)

577
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,176
(Music)

578
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,053
Marie!

579
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,298
What?
- Alex ran off with the car.

580
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,413
Fuck!

581
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,376
(Music)

582
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,340
Your turn.

583
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,816
(Cell phone)

584
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:04,443
Hello. Moni, it's me.
How did it go with the EC-Card?

585
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,772
You can't just unfreeze an
account. It's not that simple.

586
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:10,347
How did it go at the caucus?
Did you hear anything?

587
01:06:10,347 --> 01:06:13,019
What do you mean
you can't just unfreeze an account?

588
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:17,616
They need a new security statement from you.
I mean, is it really worth the cost?

589
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,733
They got a brand new card.
- Moni, that's my son!

590
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,133
Got one for me?

591
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,893
Marie!

592
01:07:05,578 --> 01:07:08,411
There's someone who will take us with.

593
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:12,818
(Music)

594
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:43,538
Alex!

595
01:07:49,258 --> 01:07:50,698
Alex!

596
01:07:57,858 --> 01:08:00,816
Shut up! Fuck you! Bah!

597
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:04,807
What are you staring at? You...
- Come on.

598
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,456
Fuck!

599
01:08:14,378 --> 01:08:16,334
(Music)

600
01:08:16,698 --> 01:08:19,337
Wait a minute. Do you hear that?

601
01:08:21,058 --> 01:08:23,208
The music?
- Bach!

602
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:35,611
Alex!

603
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:41,971
I didn't say "come in".

604
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:47,730
Are you crazy? We looked everywhere for you.
- I didn't ask you to do that.

605
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:51,891
May I? Or what?
- No. You may not.

606
01:08:52,178 --> 01:08:55,067
You left us standing there like idiots.
What are we to you?

607
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:57,548
You're nothing to me.
Nobody is anybody for anyone here!

608
01:08:57,778 --> 01:08:59,028
I have the car keys?
Let's go?

609
01:08:59,028 --> 01:09:03,366
Yeah, right, you crazy fucking bitch! Go!
- Oh, so it's because of her.

610
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:05,395
You think she's here
because she thinks you're so cool?

611
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:10,181
Because she can understand your little ticks?
She just wants to die. To starve to death.

612
01:09:10,181 --> 01:09:13,356
She wants to starve to death,
because she can't do it herself...

613
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:15,338
Are you stupid!?
- ...she needs an idiot like you!

614
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:17,738
Shut up, Alex!
- Go, but watch what happens.

615
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:20,458
You know, nobody cares at all,
about what you have to say!

616
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,416
You little shit! You're a peeping tom!

617
01:09:24,258 --> 01:09:27,216
I want to go. Can we go please?

618
01:09:28,138 --> 01:09:30,698
Come? Please!

619
01:09:33,338 --> 01:09:34,771
No? Ok.

620
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:42,012
Why did you say that?
- Because you couldn't figure it out.

621
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:45,177
You also think that you are doing
something really special for your mother.

622
01:09:45,177 --> 01:09:48,726
Though you are just running away from your father.
- Fuck you!

623
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:52,251
Fuck you, yourself, you fucking retard!

624
01:09:57,738 --> 01:10:01,030
Fuck! Asshole!
Is that all you can do?

625
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,260
And how appropriate to you mother!
I'm sure your mother had something else in mind

626
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,890
for her final journey
besides such a fucking cookie box.

627
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,932
Vincent! Vince!

628
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:18,887
Listen here! I'd rather be how I am
than be like you.

629
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:22,016
Because, you, Alex,
there's absolultely nothing to you.

630
01:10:26,818 --> 01:10:28,251
Alex!

631
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:36,007
It's your blood.
I'll get you something, okay?

632
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,771
Here.

633
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:52,009
Why haven't you ran off yet?
You have the car now.

634
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:57,407
Alex, we didn't come here for the car.

635
01:10:58,738 --> 01:11:01,571
We're here for you.

636
01:11:05,498 --> 01:11:09,457
I was the first in my
circle of friends with a kid.

637
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:14,017
Vincent could play football...
Actually, he was damn good.

638
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:18,652
You could take him anywhere.
A great kid.

639
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:23,453
When did Vincent start acting out?

640
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:26,411
In the 2nd or 3rd grade.

641
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:31,407
The teacher said he was a trouble-maker...
that he was, unruly.

642
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:35,967
You liked that though.
- Yes, naturally.

643
01:11:36,938 --> 01:11:39,222
We also thought that he'd grow out of it.

644
01:11:39,222 --> 01:11:41,507
But it got worse.

645
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,131
Yeah.

646
01:11:44,978 --> 01:11:47,936
How did your wife handle that?

647
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:52,897
She would laugh.
I had the feeling, she was relieved.

648
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:58,337
When he was thrown off the
football team, she was truly happy.

649
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:03,136
Then she isolated herself with him.

650
01:12:04,898 --> 01:12:09,449
What did your wife actually die of,
if I may ask?

651
01:12:10,338 --> 01:12:13,296
Vincent hasn't told you?

652
01:12:14,298 --> 01:12:17,131
We hadn't gotten that far yet.

653
01:12:17,978 --> 01:12:21,527
Liver cirrhosis.
She had water in her lungs.

654
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:25,851
Oh. That's no way to go.
- Yeah. She choked to death.

655
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:31,418
Were you there when it happened?

656
01:12:32,858 --> 01:12:36,407
When I came,
she had been dead for two days already.

657
01:12:37,338 --> 01:12:41,172
Vincent sat near her, holding her hand.

658
01:12:41,378 --> 01:12:43,653
After two days?
- Yes.

659
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:49,527
Didn't call anyone,
hadn't eaten anything.

660
01:12:50,058 --> 01:12:53,016
Just sat there and held her hand.

661
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:57,376
It took two of us to separate him from her.

662
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,891
Oh, god.

663
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:03,974
(Music)

664
01:13:08,338 --> 01:13:10,294
(Music)

665
01:13:35,418 --> 01:13:38,251
"A destra", he said.
- Oh.

666
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:42,417
What are we doing now?
Hotel or... keep going?

667
01:13:43,058 --> 01:13:44,491
Yeah...

668
01:13:48,058 --> 01:13:49,730
What do you think?

669
01:13:51,418 --> 01:13:52,897
Keep going.

670
01:13:53,978 --> 01:13:55,650
Yeah, maybe that's better.

671
01:13:57,738 --> 01:13:59,376
Better how?

672
01:14:00,098 --> 01:14:02,931
We'll catch up to them faster!

673
01:14:05,138 --> 01:14:06,730
But I drive.

674
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:44,491
Nothing. In the hotel: also nothing.

675
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:48,527
Any news?
- Not for you.

676
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:51,733
Over there is the rest of it.

677
01:14:51,858 --> 01:14:53,291
What?

678
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,176
That was here?

679
01:15:00,338 --> 01:15:03,330
I took it.
I should know.

680
01:15:05,378 --> 01:15:06,891
When was that?

681
01:15:07,738 --> 01:15:11,572
'82.
- Beautiful picture. She looks happy.

682
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:16,018
Yes. She was.

683
01:15:16,418 --> 01:15:19,251
And you can see something else.

684
01:15:19,898 --> 01:15:21,934
What's that?

685
01:15:22,058 --> 01:15:25,016
How happy the photographer was.

686
01:15:29,178 --> 01:15:33,251
It was our honeymoon.
The hotel was called "San Vincente".

687
01:15:33,418 --> 01:15:34,851
I understand.

688
01:15:35,018 --> 01:15:40,012
Maybe not the best idea
to name one's son after a hotel.

689
01:15:40,138 --> 01:15:43,494
Good thing that
you weren't at a Holiday Inn.

690
01:15:48,138 --> 01:15:50,094
(Music)

691
01:16:25,058 --> 01:16:28,016
So, the GPS says the sea is over that way.

692
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:31,290
Well then, let's go!

693
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:48,251
Go!

694
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:01,174
(Music)

695
01:17:15,618 --> 01:17:17,538
Marie! Hey!

696
01:17:20,498 --> 01:17:21,938
Hey.

697
01:17:24,498 --> 01:17:26,454
(Music)

698
01:18:01,498 --> 01:18:03,454
(Music)

699
01:18:18,418 --> 01:18:19,851
Hello.

700
01:18:50,178 --> 01:18:53,136
How is this going to go from here?

701
01:18:55,858 --> 01:18:57,450
Because, if...

702
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:00,850
If I...

703
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:07,247
I don't know, if
I can go do it all.

704
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:11,656
You've made it this far.

705
01:19:13,178 --> 01:19:15,738
You're already doing it.

706
01:19:18,098 --> 01:19:20,054
(Music)

707
01:19:31,978 --> 01:19:33,934
(Music)

708
01:19:46,978 --> 01:19:48,934
(Music)

709
01:19:57,498 --> 01:19:59,454
(Music)

710
01:20:10,818 --> 01:20:12,251
Marie?

711
01:20:18,498 --> 01:20:20,056
I'm sorry.

712
01:20:33,978 --> 01:20:35,616
Are you okay?

713
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:43,688
I've messed up everything.
I'm a catastrophic therapist.

714
01:20:44,978 --> 01:20:49,494
I only hope, that she pulls through.
She doesn't understand the everything

715
01:20:49,618 --> 01:20:53,577
but something like this was never
supposed to happen.  - May I say something?

716
01:20:55,298 --> 01:20:57,858
I think...

717
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:01,896
I think, you do a great job.

718
01:21:06,818 --> 01:21:09,207
Thank you.
- Thank you!

719
01:21:13,378 --> 01:21:16,211
I'm going for a smoke now.

720
01:21:23,098 --> 01:21:24,531
Marie.

721
01:21:26,018 --> 01:21:27,451
Hey.

722
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:35,537
Vincent.

723
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:37,571
You...

724
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:41,856
Can you unbind me, please?

725
01:21:47,858 --> 01:21:52,409
You were already dead, did you know that?
They had to bring you back.

726
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:56,215
Please. Only...

727
01:21:56,338 --> 01:21:59,171
Only my hand. It hurts so much.

728
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:02,931
Please.

729
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:10,012
Alex was right, wasn't he?
You didn't want them to bring you back.

730
01:22:11,978 --> 01:22:13,570
Only us two.

731
01:22:14,978 --> 01:22:17,936
Without Alex.
South, we can keep going.

732
01:22:25,018 --> 01:22:26,576
Marie, I...

733
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:32,136
No. I can't rescue you.

734
01:22:33,378 --> 01:22:34,970
I'm going now.

735
01:22:41,578 --> 01:22:43,216
Find me. Ok?

736
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:50,137
Vincent. No! Vincent, please!
Wait. Don't you love me?

737
01:22:50,378 --> 01:22:55,327
Help me. Please! Help me.
Get me out of here. Vincent!

738
01:22:55,698 --> 01:22:58,690
Vincent! Please! Help me!

739
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,891
Vincent!

740
01:23:01,578 --> 01:23:03,011
Vincent!

741
01:23:06,138 --> 01:23:08,094
(Music)

742
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:46,057
How are you doing?
- Me? Excellent.

743
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:51,131
I've never been better.

744
01:23:57,258 --> 01:23:59,214
(Music)

745
01:24:02,898 --> 01:24:04,411
Stop.

746
01:24:06,898 --> 01:24:08,331
Please.

747
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:14,531
What are you planning to do?

748
01:24:38,978 --> 01:24:40,650
I'm going to finish it.

749
01:24:44,818 --> 01:24:46,251
Vincent.

750
01:24:52,938 --> 01:24:54,894
Give her to me?

751
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:59,128
I know where she wants to be.

752
01:25:15,818 --> 01:25:17,251
Thank you.

753
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:24,774
(Music)

754
01:25:28,778 --> 01:25:31,690
Thanks for the suit! Vincent!

755
01:25:34,538 --> 01:25:36,494
(Music)

756
01:26:08,338 --> 01:26:10,169
And?
- What?

757
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:14,773
When are we going to visit her?

758
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,050
I don't know.

759
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:26,889
Come, let's go. Socialize a bit.

760
