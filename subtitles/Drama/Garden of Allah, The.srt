1
00:01:20,230 --> 00:0:22,505
Made By Chebo

2
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,505
Quit eyeballing me, Flavius.

3
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,822
I knew you when you was
a two-bit hustler on Bull Street.

4
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,180
Excuse me!
Where can a fella get a cab?

5
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,419
He just left.

6
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,184
You can call the company, but I's you,
I'd wait on him to come back.

7
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,068
'Less you want to take a ride.

8
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,187
- You going to Jones Street?
- I'll get you there.

9
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,184
Put your stuff in there.

10
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,545
<i>To your right, Pirate's House...</i>

11
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,065
<i>... built in 1794.</i>

12
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,098
<i>All the ne'er-do-wells and scalawags</i>
<i>divided up their booty there.</i>

13
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,025
<i>Sherman stayed</i>
<i>in the Green-Meldrim House...</i>

14
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,068
<i>... to rest up</i>
<i>after his fiery march through Atlanta.</i>

15
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,948
<i>He was going to burn Savannah...</i>

15
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,182
<i>... but the locals drowned him</i>
<i>in Chatham Artillery punch...</i>

16
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,739
<i>... and fancy parties</i>
<i>till he decided...</i>

17
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,821
<i>... to spare our fair city.</i>

18
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,300
<i>Forsyth Park, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

19
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,503
You looking for something?

20
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,345
No.

21
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,265
Mr. Kelso?

22
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,341
Are you Mr. Kelso?

23
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,946
I'm Lorene Baxter.
Welcome to Savannah.

24
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,867
<i>Town & Country</i>
is my favorite magazine.

25
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,144
Oh, my land, where are my manners?
What can I get you to drink?

26
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,828
Anything cold would be great.

27
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,020
Mr. Williams restored this home.

28
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,068
One of the many he saved
from the wrecking ball.

29
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,269
The carriage house is reserved
for Jim's clients...

30
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,944
...and guests, such as yourself.

31
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,424
He's here.

32
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,539
Welcome, Mr. Kelsy.

33
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,623
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kelso?
- John Kelso.

34
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,701
Yes. I'm Betty Harty.

35
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,463
Sonny's been expecting you.

36
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,621
I'm here to see Jim Williams.

37
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,747
Sonny's Jim's attorney.

38
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,304
Well, hell...

39
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,869
...come on in, coach.

40
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,425
John Kelso.

41
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,587
Welcome to the old curiosity shop.
Take a seat.

42
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,861
You let me know.

43
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,985
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Mr. Williams said...

44
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,189
He will be right along. We have
a little business to attend to first.

45
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,900
Confidentiality agreement.
Just boilerplate stuff.

46
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,469
Plus a paragraph...

47
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,628
...outlining Jim's editorial privileges.

48
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,222
<i>Town & Country</i> flew me down to write
a 500-word story on a Christmas party.

49
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,064
It's a literary postcard.
Are you serious about this?

50
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,302
It's not just any party.

51
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,823
Have you asked the magazine?

52
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,903
I'd rather have your word
than some New York lawyer.

53
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,348
Be that as it may...

54
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,868
...I'm not going to sign that.

55
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,708
Damn! How come?

56
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,381
It's just a little old party write-up.

57
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,946
All the more reason
not to compromise my ethics.

58
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,988
As a professional,
I'm sure you understand.

59
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,429
Promise to be fair?

60
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,668
Yes, of course.

61
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,780
Jim...

62
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,988
...this is John Kelso.

63
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,305
Hello.

64
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,060
Let's take a walk,
shall we, sport?

65
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,220
We'll go around Forsyth Park.

66
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,784
Would y'all mind...?

67
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,668
Not at all, Betty.

68
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,665
Come on.

69
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,468
Did you sign Sonny's papers?

70
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,905
Actually, no.

71
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,029
Good for you. Sonny's
overly protective of my interests.

72
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,780
- Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,385
Patrick do love his morning walk.

74
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,982
Would you mind? Could I please have
my picture made with Uga?

75
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,345
Great.

76
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,665
Thanks.

77
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,142
All right. Smile.

78
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,068
Thanks. Dang good dog.

79
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,540
Thank you very much.

80
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,058
Thank you for asking.

81
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,468
No matter what you and I ever do
in our lives, Mr. Kelso...

82
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,866
...neither of us
will be as famous as Uga.

83
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,739
He's the university mascot.

84
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,821
- "The Georgia Bulldog."
- Is that right?

85
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,063
I know I'm going to regret asking,
but that man said he was walking a dog.

86
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,985
What dog?

87
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,420
Mr. Glover was the law firm porter.

88
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,988
Mr. Bouhan said in his will that
Mr. Glover should continue to be paid...

89
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,387
...$ 15 every week for walking Patrick,
his Labrador.

90
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,745
So...

91
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,579
...where's Patrick?

92
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,500
Patrick went on to his great rewards
2 years after Mr. Bouhan, about 1974.

93
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,667
- The dog's dead.
- Quite.

94
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,900
Why doesn't Mr. Glover walk Uga?

95
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,747
Well, then, who'd walk Patrick?

96
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,829
I see.

97
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,306
- There it is.
- This is your house?

98
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,069
Built by General Hugh Mercer in 1860,
but he never lived in this house.

99
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,306
His great-grandson was Johnny Mercer.

100
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,659
The songwriter?

101
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,178
Savannah's own.

102
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,821
What's your favorite of his tunes?

103
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,388
My mother was always partial
to "Fools Rush In."

104
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,939
Your mother.

105
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,626
Indeed.

106
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,820
I'd love to give you the grand tour, but
they're still setting up for the party.

107
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,581
I thought the party was tomorrow night.

108
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,349
There are two parties.

109
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,548
Tonight is for bachelors.
Gentlemen only.

110
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,825
Would you like to come?

111
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,025
I'd like to cover it.

112
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,421
I'm sorry. It's private.
Reporters aren't allowed.

113
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,662
Would you like to see my shop?
It's back here in the carriage house.

114
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,826
This house is one of the largest
in Savannah. It covers an entire block.

115
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,463
It's right in here.

116
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,581
This is where we do all of our...

117
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,309
...restorations.

118
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,701
This landscape, is it a Stubbs?

119
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,539
Very good.

120
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,583
My father was a dealer.

121
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,867
It's called <i>Newmarket Heath</i>
<i>with a Rubbing-Down House.</i>

122
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,783
It's a recent purchase I will unveil
at tomorrow night's event.

123
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,703
It's an odd piece.

124
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,028
The impasto is interesting.

125
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,139
Where's your black light?

126
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,905
It's an overpaint.

127
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,382
Very good, sport.

128
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,701
- You had it x-rayed yet?
- No.

129
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,382
How will you know
what it's obscuring?

130
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,021
I rather enjoy not knowing.

131
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,344
Just a minute.

132
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,828
- Who is it?
- Mandy.

133
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,986
Who?

134
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,019
I don't know a Mandy.

135
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,738
Of course not.
You won't open the damn door.

136
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,307
Hi. Nice to meet you.

137
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,701
You all got some ice?

138
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,309
Sure, help yourself.

139
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,862
Joe Odom's fridge is on the blink.
And plus, at present...

140
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,180
...we don't have electricity.

141
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,384
Thirsty?

142
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,580
Me? No.
No, not really.

143
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,343
If you're thirsty, a drink'll cure it.
If you're not, a drink'll prevent it.

144
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,939
Prevention is better than a cure.

145
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,746
Put on some pants, John Kelso.

146
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,783
Sure, just let me get a pair.

147
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,468
This is our newest addition
to the Odom House.

148
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,100
As you see, Joe's been creative
with our electrical dilemma.

149
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,219
I done this before
and I ain't never been killed yet.

150
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,859
But there's a first time for everything.

151
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,146
There we go!

152
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,584
We got it!

153
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,700
No problem.

154
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,219
Joe Odom?

155
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,698
The one, the only.

156
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,423
Where's my libation?

157
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,540
Hold these.

158
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,465
To Savannah Electric and Power!

159
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,419
And let's not forget our friends...

160
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,900
...the...

161
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,066
...whoever!

162
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,899
Here's to you!
All right, inside.

163
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,267
Honey, that's a tough job,
but you're talking to the lady. Hello!

164
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,143
Have you met Mr. Kelso,
our newest addition to Savannah?

165
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,749
Jerry Spence.

166
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,708
- How are you?
- I'm charmed now.

167
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,106
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good.

168
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,466
- I wonder if he goes to my church?
- I wonder.

169
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,779
Episcopalian.

170
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,224
We'll find out.

171
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,698
<i>Sanitation</i>

172
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,870
<i>I see all night long</i>
<i>Hauling in great big cans</i>

173
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,381
<i>I'm hoping one day soon</i>
<i>She'll let me be a Hefty man</i>

174
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,219
<i>In the Dumpster</i>
<i>We'll be making love</i>

175
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,620
<i>In the Dumpster</i>
<i>Beneath the stars above</i>

176
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,305
<i>In the Dumpster</i>
<i>I smell paradise</i>

177
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,421
<i>Don 't have to ask me twice</i>

178
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,666
<i>It's all I'm thinking of</i>

179
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,470
<i>Just me and that trash girl</i>
<i>Making that Dumpster love</i>

180
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,586
Do you like that?

181
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,979
Strong.

182
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,023
Strong and good.
Chatham Artillery punch.

183
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,265
What's in it?

184
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,228
3 parts fruit, 7 parts liquor.

185
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,466
Whatever's available on both counts.

186
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,428
Great party. Great house.

187
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,827
The fella that owns it is in Europe
for a year. Asked me to look in on it.

188
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,429
Water the plants.

189
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,506
Squatting?

190
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,622
That's a vicious word.

191
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,588
You're not a lawyer, are you?

192
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,342
Good. They're the scum of the earth.
And I should know...

193
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,190
...being an ex-barrister myself.

194
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,545
Ex?

195
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,341
Ceremoniously disbarred
not two years ago.

196
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,507
Had a little accounting snafu.

197
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,338
What do you do now?

198
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,388
Me and Mandy,
we're going to open a piano bar.

199
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,745
You already have one.

200
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,469
Looks that way, doesn't it?

201
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,140
Wait a minute. Hold the music.

202
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,306
Look.

203
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,458
Look at this.

204
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,859
Jerry Spence.

205
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,749
You have outdone yourself again.

206
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,585
That is a coif definitely befitting
your stature as the future ex...

207
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,309
...Mrs. Joe Odom.

208
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,748
Keep dreaming, darling.

209
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,344
You're in love.

210
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,941
She is one beautiful woman.

211
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,709
You two engaged?

212
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,979
Not yet.

213
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,782
It's getting late. I'm going to
hit the road. Nice meeting you.

214
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,383
No, wait a minute.

215
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,908
Joe's rule #2:

216
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,183
If you have to leave a party,
you always take a traveler.

217
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,539
I can live with that one.
Nice to meet you.

218
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,859
Hey, there.

219
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,304
Better to be on the edge of a party,
don't you think?

220
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,824
Thanks for inviting me.

221
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,105
Anytime.

222
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,624
Every time.

223
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,145
Earlier...

224
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,709
...how'd you know my name?

225
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,582
Welcome to Savannah.

226
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,465
Mr. John Kelso?

227
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,505
This is for you.

228
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,820
<i>I'm not in. Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

229
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,508
- Mr. Kelso?
- Yes.

230
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,344
I'm Lucille Wright.
I cater Mr. Williams' parties.

231
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,308
- Nice to meet you.
- He'll be down shortly.

232
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,302
Would you like to see what we'll serve?

233
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,744
Of course.

234
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,059
Come in.

235
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,625
Lots of fresh vegetables...

236
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,428
...hot bread...

237
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,069
...jumbo shrimp.

238
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,264
Let's see.
This is smoked ham and turkey.

239
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,586
Both.

240
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,789
A big fruit platter.
And this is a wonderful crab dish.

241
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,940
A bisque?

242
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,260
Jeff Braswell.

243
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,146
- I shoot Jim's parties.
- Let's get a shot of the whole spread.

244
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,779
<i>Town & Country</i>
loves its pretty pictures.

245
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,226
And pumpkin cornbread.

246
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,139
Mr. Williams insists on
low-country cooking for his parties.

247
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,428
Oh, you're going to have fun tonight.

248
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,422
Indeed he is, Lucille.

249
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,859
Good fit. 44 long.

250
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,745
I have an eye for framing things.

251
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,061
Welcome to Mercer House, Mr. Kelso.

252
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,379
You have outdone yourself again
this year.

253
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,109
Well, thank you.

254
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,063
I'm glad to see you.
Merry Christmas.

255
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,783
Merry Christmas.

256
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,500
There you are. The man with the cigar.
So happy you're back.

257
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,185
Emma.

258
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,344
Did you watch my drink for me?
Merry Christmas.

259
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,945
I thought you'd tried
to steal it from me.

260
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,062
- Senator, how are you?
- Great.

261
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,907
Merry Christmas to you.
So happy to have you here.

262
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,944
Look at you.

263
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,187
Welcome to Mercer House.

264
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,590
I think we have
quite a party going tonight.

265
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,586
Look at that niece of mine.
Come over here.

266
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,787
- How are you?
- John Kelso.

267
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,739
Oh, darling!
You look so pretty tonight.

268
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,742
I have one just like that at home.

269
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,264
I see our emerald bird has arrived.

270
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,299
Good to see you.
Handsome as ever.

271
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,859
- How are you, dear?
- I'm just fine.

272
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,780
Now who is that magnificent creature?

273
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,304
That is Serena Dawes.

274
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,745
Serena, you are
as gorgeous as ever.

275
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,218
I try.

276
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,267
Celebrated beauty in her day.

277
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,025
When her tycoon husband died, she
moved back to Savannah and created...

278
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,068
...sort of a museum to herself
in her boudoir.

279
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,709
I'll introduce you.

280
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,225
- You look very nice.
- Who are these people?

281
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,504
How lovely to see you out of bed.

282
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,340
Why, Jim,
I'd get out of bed for you anytime.

283
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,348
Harry was just about to show us
the latest addition to his arsenal.

284
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,270
You know what that is?
That is a.25.

285
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,667
My late husband blew his brains out
with one of those.

286
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,821
- So did mine.
- What?

287
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,978
I was fixing myself a drink and <i>Gunsmoke</i>
was on TV and I heard a shot.

288
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,826
I thought it was part of the show till
I walked in and Lyman was bleeding...

289
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,538
...sprawled in his favorite chair.

290
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,304
Everyone knew
our marriage was a disaster.

291
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,146
If I'd so much as touched that gun,
they'd have charged me with murder.

292
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,866
Yes, well, one day...

293
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,220
...I will shoot a man.
I may start with you. Or you.

294
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,228
- Is that loaded?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,789
Which conversation shall we join?

296
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,590
The one least likely to involve gunfire.

297
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,748
Excuse me for a moment.

298
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,265
That's from Napoleon's
coronation carriage.

299
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,948
You have an impressive collection.

300
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,505
No, Mr. Kelso. Look around.
It's not a collection, it's my home.

301
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,900
- Fabergé?
- I'm a minor enthusiast.

302
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,220
Minor? Three eggs...

303
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,349
...a jewelry box and, I believe,
a gold-leaf album.

304
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,748
Nicholas himself would be lucky
to have so much Fabergé.

305
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,540
Wouldn't he?

306
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,064
I admit to that.

307
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,744
Would you care
to see something a little more...

308
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,304
...unusual?

309
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,029
That'd be very nice.

310
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,662
Hello, Mother, darling.

311
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,663
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I'm having a wonderful time.

312
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,104
John Kelso.

313
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,308
He's a writer, Mother.

314
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,860
This is what we call the ballroom.

315
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,428
Is this the prized relic?

316
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,099
It's a very rare relic.

317
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,547
This is the dagger
that Prince Yussopov used...

318
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,463
...to murder Rasputin.

319
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,658
He sliced off
his cock and balls with it.

320
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,104
True story...

321
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,944
...and deliciously evil,
don't you think?

322
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,859
Delicious.

323
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,219
German Luger?

324
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,189
Be careful, it's loaded.
We've had burglaries.

325
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,505
Everybody's got loaded guns around here.

326
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,990
So tell me.
Has your family always collected?

327
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,143
That's a very genteel way of asking
if I come from old money.

328
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,383
- Do you?
- No.

329
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,502
I was born in Gordon, Georgia,
a little town outside of Macon.

330
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,980
My father was a barber,
sometime house builder.

331
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,822
My mother was a secretary.

332
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,584
What money I have is about 11 years old.

333
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,066
So, yes, I am...

334
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,868
<i>... nouveau riche.</i>

335
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,465
But then it's the <i>riche</i> that counts.

336
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,822
There's only 2 things
that interest me...

337
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,059
...work...

338
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,700
...and those trappings of aristocracy
that I find worthwhile.

339
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,665
The very things they're forced to sell
when the money runs out.

340
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,548
And it always runs out.

341
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,946
And then all they're left with...

342
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,182
...is their lovely manners.

343
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,342
Fuck you, goddamn bitch!

344
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,861
Wouldn't even let me in the house.

345
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,702
Had to come in the servants' entrance.

346
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,143
Excuse me for a minute?

347
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,581
We agreed you'd stay away tonight.

348
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,582
Don't give me that drag-ass shit.

349
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,027
I got stood up tonight, I'm pissed off.
Give me $20.

350
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,024
You get paid on Friday
like everyone else.

351
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,305
Give me $20.

352
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,145
- I need it to get fucked up, is what.
- You've accomplished that, sport.

353
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,740
Give me the money.

354
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,669
I ain't even close to getting fucked up
the way I want to get.

355
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,708
I'm not going to give you money
for liquor or marijuana...

356
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,463
...or whatever else you've invited...

357
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,465
Fuck you, Jim!

358
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,419
You don't give me warnings! I give them
to you! I can back mine up.

359
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,708
And you, you piece of shit!

360
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,788
You better watch yourself.

361
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,305
Fuck you.

362
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,018
That's Billy Hanson.
He works part-time in the shop...

363
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,269
...and can, on occasion,
be a very colorful character.

364
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,825
I don't know who hates me more,
the Atwells or their dogs.

365
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,063
Lon Atwell's been upset with me since I
had him removed from the museum board.

366
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,985
There's only one way to remedy this.

367
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,663
Thank you, Senator.

368
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,821
It was a hell of a bash, Jim.

369
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,465
- You've outdone yourself.
- Delightful.

370
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,389
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thanks for having us.

371
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,068
This...
You have my book.

372
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,062
You seem surprised.

373
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,703
It didn't exactly
fly off the bookshelves.

374
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,508
What a coincidence,
that I'd be assigned...

375
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,902
...to this story
and you'd have read my only book.

376
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,781
There are no coincidences.

377
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,818
Have you ever written
for <i>Town & Country</i> before?

378
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,020
No.

379
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,383
You requested me?

380
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,628
They've wanted to cover
my Christmas party for years.

381
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,301
My acceptance of their offer this year
was contingent on one thing:

382
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,108
Your participation.

383
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,464
Thank you for that.

384
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,989
No, thank you.

385
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,986
Now sit back, relax, enjoy your brandy
and tell me your life story, John Kelso.

386
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,625
It's getting late
and I have an early flight...

387
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,340
...so maybe I can take
a rain check on that. Next Christmas.

388
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,788
If you make the cut.

389
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,468
We'll hope for the best.

390
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,981
I can't wait to see the article,
and I hope you have enough...

391
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,949
...for your 500-word essay.

392
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,061
Believe me, I could use 10,000.

393
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,221
Thanks for everything.
I'll show myself out.

394
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,983
Oh, and sport...

395
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,108
...I really did like your book.

396
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,545
Thank you.

397
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,868
That's a beautiful jacket.
I believe it's an endangered species.

398
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,386
Look at that 14-karat gold dress
and Tony Manero.

399
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,904
Who's hungry?

400
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,547
Want some punch, baby?

401
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,304
Oh, that's such a good pony.

402
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,304
What are you doing,
getting that horse drunk?

403
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,340
What happened?

404
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,945
That Jim Williams
went and shot somebody.

405
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,225
Canapé?

406
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,826
What?

407
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,420
He sure did. Those lights
ain't part of the christmas display.

408
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,540
For real?

409
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,906
Yes, sir. He shot somebody.

410
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,822
Look at that man go.

411
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,901
I'm starting to like that Yankee.

412
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,779
What's that saying?
Curiosity killed the Yankee? That's it.

413
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,106
He was drunker when he got back,
and I'll tell you...

414
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,062
...when he's been drinking,
he's got another personality altogether.

415
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,424
He'd already smashed things upstairs
earlier.

416
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,787
And he must've gone
to some drive-in B movie...

417
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,981
...with throats being slashed.

418
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,701
No doubt it had an effect,
because I've never seen him that angry.

419
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,545
He and I got into an argument.

420
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,863
He destroyed this beautiful,
priceless antique clock in the hallway.

421
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,344
If you'd like to...

422
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,979
...spike that up...

423
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,629
...the bar's in the living room.

424
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,781
No, thank you.
I'm still on duty.

425
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,979
I know that.

426
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,825
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,101
This is very upsetting.

428
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,220
How much longer
is this going to take?

429
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,543
What are you doing here?

430
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,145
I work for the city, too.
I got the film from that party.

431
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,584
I'll get it to you.

432
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,064
Great, great.

433
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,826
He came into the office
and he stood there and he yelled...

434
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,705
..."I might be leaving tomorrow, but
goddamn it, you're leaving tonight."

435
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,943
Then he fired at me twice and I pulled
the Luger from my desk and fired back.

436
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,267
If it had happened to you,
you would've done exactly what I did.

437
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,707
I have never been so scared in my life.
If I had not shot at Billy...

438
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,147
...I have no doubt it'd be my obituary
you'd be reading tomorrow.

439
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,506
- What're you doing here?
- The thing was open.

440
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,024
Jesus Christ, Frank!

441
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,101
My client has nothing to say.

442
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,228
I can't believe you would do this
without calling me!

443
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,222
How long have we known each other?!

444
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,343
Is this entrapment, Frank?
What the hell is going on?

445
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,904
Sorry, I'm not going to have time
to process this.

446
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,061
Film from the party.

447
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,268
Jim told me
you heard Hanson threaten him.

448
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,542
No-good street hustler.

449
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,020
I told Jim he was dangerous.

450
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,223
<i>Forget about</i> Town & Country.

451
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,304
I know I've been here only 3 days and
it's just a shooting, but give it time.

452
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,707
This place is fantastic. It's like
<i>Gone With the Wind</i> on mescaline.

453
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,899
I know you're my agent.
Listen to me.

454
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,267
They walk imaginary pets here
on a fucking leash, okay?

455
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,819
They're all heavily armed and drunk.
New York is boring.

456
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,264
I'll call you later.

457
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,749
Finley Largent's up for reelection,
so he'll try to get this to trial.

458
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,060
He won't take my damn phone calls...

459
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,346
...so we'll have to use the back door.

460
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,909
I'll be back.

461
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,061
Thanks for coming over, coach.

462
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,142
Jim's in the office.

463
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,105
We talked about something
we'd like to run by you.

464
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,221
You want me to kill the story.

465
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,860
Done.

466
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,349
Great, great.

467
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,060
Why?

468
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,743
Actually, I was...

469
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,424
...considering...

470
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,024
...writing a book.

471
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,899
Sweet Jesus. A book about what?

472
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,902
Self-defense happens all the time.

473
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,187
Then why are you worried about the D. A?
I overheard in the lobby.

474
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,022
We're a small town.

475
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,738
We defend ourselves, our reputations...

476
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,822
...against the outside world.

477
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,267
Word gets around a New Yorker's
trying to make us look bad...

478
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,065
...you'll find Savannahians
can get tight-lipped.

479
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,021
If there's a trial, will I be a witness?

480
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,704
You threatening me?

481
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,945
Absolutely not.

482
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,949
You perjure yourself,
you'll find yourself in jail.

483
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,387
I wouldn't do it. When it comes
to this, I'm at ground zero.

484
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,308
If there's nothing worth writing...

485
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,069
...then you got no worries.

486
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,986
That's what I get paid for.
I will not permit this.

487
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,379
I don't need anyone's permission.

488
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,544
Not really.

489
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,861
Then why are you soliciting it?

490
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,903
You need my permission...

491
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,185
...my help...

492
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,988
...my acquiescence...

493
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,342
...or you don't have a story.

494
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,504
Not really.

495
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,028
We both know that.

496
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,138
So would the river flow both ways?

497
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,025
Meaning?

498
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,864
Would you share whatever information
you garner with me and Sonny?

499
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,463
Yes, but it won't change what I write.

500
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,668
And you don't get to see a word of it
until it's published.

501
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,859
So...

502
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,785
...who'd be the main character
in this book?

503
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,825
Have you written up cases
like this before?

504
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,026
A few of them for <i>Esquire,</i> yeah.

505
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,498
What do you think?

506
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,978
What do I think?

507
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,467
If you're worried about the D.A.
Grand juries read papers.

508
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,985
Proper spin control
could make a big difference.

509
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,061
What the hell are you talking about?

510
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,108
You said Hanson was a street hustler.
Did he have a record?

511
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,147
Take drugs?
Deal drugs? Pimp?

512
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,620
That kind of spin
can influence a grand jury.

513
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,508
Get investigators to hit the streets.

514
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,423
Every P.I. In town's an off-duty cop.

515
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,589
Besides, why would we need a P. I...

516
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,947
...when we got ourselves
a hotshot New York writer...

517
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,942
...filling all the gaps?

518
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,629
Take care, bubba.

519
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,581
- Are you the flower man?
- No, I'm John Kelso.

520
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,060
Good morning, I'm a writer
and wanted to ask you...

521
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,699
If you're not the flower man,
leave me be.

522
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,704
The Lady's in mourning, and
I haven't received a flower or a rose...

523
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,862
...or anything to show for it.
Please leave me be.

524
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,184
I know Billy Hanson used to live here.
I wanted to ask a few questions.

525
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,103
And if it's an inappropriate time,
I'll come back later.

526
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:47,026
I can't believe you're running around
ringing my doorbell. Where you from?

527
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,022
Where are your manners?

528
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,022
Just leave me be.

529
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,866
My condolences.
I'll call...

530
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,860
I'll come back another time, or...

531
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,099
I apologize for the delay.

532
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,580
Why, thank you. They're lovely.
They're absolutely lovely.

533
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,549
I'd love to ask you a few questions,
if you have a minute.

534
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,748
Is this your car?

535
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,268
How about a ride home?

536
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,385
Thank you.

537
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,102
What I want to know is,
what is a white boy like you...

538
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,662
...doing driving a big old brother's
jive-ass heap like this shit here?

539
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,061
I just bought this.
I kind of like it. It's not a bad car.

540
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,904
No, it's not bad.
Did I hurt your feelings?

541
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,744
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

542
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,300
I can't help it.
I just call things out as I see it.

543
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,427
I just can't help it.
I just do that.

544
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,344
- One thing you needn't worry about.
- What's that?

545
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,139
Ain't nobody going to try
to steal this piece of shit.

546
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm just practicing up till I can save
enough money to get my Rolls.

547
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,148
Chablis is a pretty name.
It's unusual.

548
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,463
Thank you. I got it off a wine bottle.
It's a show name.

549
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,419
- You're an actress?
- I'm not an actress. I'm a showgirl.

550
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,104
I work at the Pick-Up on Congress.

551
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,025
I lip-synch, I emcee, I dance.
You know, shit like that.

552
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,024
The person you see now
is just little old simple Chablis.

553
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,589
But in the evenings...

554
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,061
...when I put on my gowns
and my makeup...

555
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,904
...and my jewelry and my perfume...

556
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,300
...I become "The Lady chablis."

557
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,065
You are just so cute.

558
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,585
A cool white wine for a cool black girl.

559
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,867
And you're full of flattery too.

560
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,027
It's getting hot up in here, honey.
My shots are kicking in.

561
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,460
Excuse me?

562
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,224
Yes, honey, my shots.
Never mind that.

563
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,540
What'd you want to talk to me about?

564
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,185
Billy Hanson.

565
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,705
No. Billy's dead.
Case closed.

566
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,709
Was he your boyfriend?

567
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,463
Billy, my boyfriend?

568
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,109
Were you two lovers?

569
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,138
No. Hell, no.

570
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,188
Billy was way too trashy for me, honey.
I'm a lady.

571
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,069
However, he did date
my roommate Corinne for a while.

572
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:49,219
The two of those
had some wild times together.

573
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,580
- Those are beautiful.
- So, tell me more about Corinne.

574
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,585
Corinne's like a lot of girls.

575
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,421
She found herself attracted
to the wrong type of man.

576
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,939
Billy was not the right type of man.
She thought she could change him.

577
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,387
But there was no way of changing
that evil son of a bitch.

578
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,098
- I'd love to speak to corinne.
- I'd like to too.

579
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,423
But she skipped town
owing me two months' rent.

580
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,503
And Billy said he would pay for it,
but now he's...

581
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,668
But you know...

582
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,980
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

583
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,949
But you know,
it's like my mama always said...

584
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,986
..."Two tears in a bucket...

585
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,346
...motherfuck it."

586
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,023
I have to remember that one.

587
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,545
Don't remember that one.
That's off-the-record.

588
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,669
Let me get your door for you.

589
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,223
Thank you, hon.

590
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,778
In the phone book,
you were listed as F. De Veau.

591
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,268
What's the "F" stand for?

592
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,499
The "F" stands for Frank, hon.

593
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,978
That's me.

594
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,821
- She's a he.
- Correct.

595
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,264
You're shitting me.

596
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,229
If this thing heats up,
I think you'll want to talk to her.

597
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,301
Proper folks don't discuss such things.

598
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,581
She paints a rotten picture of Billy.

599
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,981
Let me tell you a story.
There was a judge here years ago.

600
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,700
His oldest boy was messing around
with a gangster's girlfriend.

601
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,547
One morning they found him...

602
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,580
...lying under the porch
with his privates tucked into his lapel.

603
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,941
Dead men tell no tales.

604
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,821
Next day, headline read...

605
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,901
..."Fall From Porch Proves Fatal."

606
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,941
Some fall.
What's your point?

607
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,668
Saving face in the light of unpleasant
circumstances is the Savannah way.

608
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,749
I'll try to track down that real girl.
Corinne, you said?

609
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,068
Well, I got to skedaddle.

610
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,268
Doing Christmas at Tybee Island.
We got all sorts of folks coming.

611
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,829
Have a great Christmas.

612
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,425
- You too, John.
- See you later, Uga.

613
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,306
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

614
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,068
He's got it on a string!

615
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,548
Luther's not eating!

616
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,824
Check, please.

617
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,469
You didn't like it?

618
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,185
No, they were very good.
Excellent.

619
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,029
What was in the vial?

620
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,827
He says it's enough poison
to kill everybody in the county.

621
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,586
If he eats and it's a good day...

622
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:20,740
...fine.

623
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,545
If he doesn't eat...

624
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,068
...let's put it this way: If I were
you, I wouldn't drink the water today.

625
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,983
Where does he put the poison?

626
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,539
In the water supply system.

627
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,343
Is that true?
Do you believe that?

628
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,781
I've lived here a long time, honey.
I believe most anything about anybody.

629
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,544
Where are we going?

630
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,667
Patience, dear boy.

631
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,909
It's time you meet the most important
member of my defense team.

632
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,789
We're going to the cemetery?

633
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,500
Not Bonaventure.
The colored cemetery's down the road.

634
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,427
Looks like we got the garden
all to ourselves tonight.

635
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,469
Meet Minerva.

636
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,425
How do you do?

637
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,828
You trying to work me, boy?

638
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,180
Put that hand back in your pocket.

639
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,626
I feel sorry for you.

640
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,022
Do tell, Minerva.

641
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,421
He think nobody love him.

642
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,668
That's silly.
We've never met.

643
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,949
You got a hole in you.

644
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,748
Too many questions.

645
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:51,108
Don't know whether to be this way
or that without the answers.

646
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,870
There ain't no answers.

647
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,346
You come a long way to find that out,
didn't you?

648
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,108
Now we got to get to work.
You bring the money?

649
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,459
Put it on the grave.

650
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,304
Kiss it first,
so it come back to you.

651
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,820
You bring the shiny dimes?

652
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,985
Bury them.

653
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,102
He's working hard against you, James.

654
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,028
Who? Dr. Buzzard?

655
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,306
The boy. The dead boy.

656
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,821
Oh, Billy.
That doesn't surprise us.

657
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,469
Dr. Buzzard?

658
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,983
Ain't got much dead time left.

659
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,224
Dead time?

660
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,668
Lasts an hour.

661
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,221
Half-hour before midnight
till half past.

662
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,548
Half-hour before midnight
for working good.

663
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:02,940
Half-hour after for evil.

664
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,385
We'll need a little of both tonight.

665
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,262
You got the bottle of water?

666
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,308
Ain't been through no pipe?

667
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,864
Give it to me.

668
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,143
We got to make him...

669
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,302
...Ioosen up on James.

670
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,349
I need Shango...

671
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,100
...and a little <i>hungan.</i>

672
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,025
Come.

673
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:47,545
Come!

674
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,421
Tell me something about him.

675
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,629
He tried to kill me?

676
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,259
No, before then.
Something good.

677
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,185
Your kind words...

678
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,898
...take root, flower,
come back to bless you.

679
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,101
Something that made him happy?

680
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,705
His Camaro.

681
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,069
He loved his Camaro.
He wouldn't let anyone near it.

682
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,460
That car was his pride and joy.

683
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,305
Keep talking. It's working.
It's working!

684
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,788
He spray painted it flat black.

685
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,306
You should've seen him.
He spent hours on that car, fixing it...

686
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,505
...cleaning it.

687
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,945
He painted racing stripes on it...

688
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,908
...and all kinds of other things.

689
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,023
He was very creative.

690
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,860
That's something
most people didn't know.

691
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,509
He was an artist.

692
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,738
Just now,
when you were saying them things...

693
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,981
...I felt him ease off.

694
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,826
He heard you say you love him.

695
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,464
That's preposterous.
He tried to kill me.

696
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,139
He was working against you,
and now I know why.

697
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,826
He wants you to tell the whole world
you hated him.

698
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,139
Maybe they think you hated him
enough to kill him.

699
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,826
If you do that, you go to jail...

700
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,344
...and he know that.

701
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,781
Most important thing:

702
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,829
You got to beg that boy's forgiveness
each and every day.

703
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,421
Time for evil.

704
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,584
Quick, quick.
Tell me his name.

705
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,469
Finley Largent.

706
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:43,661
When you get home, write his name
7 times on a piece of paper.

707
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,901
Connect all the names into one.

708
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,186
Dot no I's, cross no T's.

709
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,745
Fold it twice and put it in your pocket.

710
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,225
Get a picture.

711
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:59,189
Sew up the mouth with dove's blood.

712
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,579
Blacken the eyes.

713
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,866
Now go!
I got works to do.

714
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:07,865
Boy!

715
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,468
Take these words to heart.

716
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,620
To understand the living...

717
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,418
...you got to commune with the dead.

718
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,660
Now go!

719
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,707
And don't you dare look back!

720
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,103
On the grave...

721
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,108
Who is Dr. Buzzard?

722
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,346
Minerva was married to Dr. Buzzard...

723
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,980
...the foremost voodoo practitioner
in Beaufort County.

724
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,028
You may not know it,
but you are deep in voodoo country.

725
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,099
I don't believe
in the hocus-pocus of it...

726
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,739
...but the spiritual force behind it.

727
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,148
The shiny dimes were easy...

728
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,063
...but the virgin water
was a trick or two.

729
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,588
How do you know she wouldn't know
the difference if it was tap water?

730
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,541
Not by looking or taste...

731
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,588
...but she would've known
in an instant by looking at my face.

732
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,904
I think...

733
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,948
...the photo-doctoring
is going to be good therapy.

734
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,538
What about the pleas
for daily forgiveness?

735
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,669
No, I don't think that's
going to be happening. Definitely not.

736
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,983
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

737
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,709
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

738
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,099
- How you doing?
- Good.

739
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,305
You work here?

740
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,462
What you see is what you get.

741
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:04,938
Nothing wrong with that.

742
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,703
Gee, thanks.

743
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:26,698
These are nice.

744
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,141
You want to send some flowers?

745
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,420
I think so.
I don't know, though.

746
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,149
It's kind of complicated.

747
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,024
For whom?

748
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,144
What's she like?

749
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,142
I don't know her that well.

750
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,584
Roses are a favorite.

751
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,741
A bit presumptuous.

752
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,309
How about...

753
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,426
...poinsettias?

754
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,979
Perennials might
give the wrong impression.

755
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,548
- Too long-term?
- Yeah, it's hard to say.

756
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,701
This is complicated.

757
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,943
How about petunias?

758
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,978
They're pretty without
being presumptuous, smell nice...

759
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,061
...and in 3 days you throw them out.

760
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,502
Sound like what you're looking for?

761
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,900
Sorry, we're all out of petunias.

762
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:24,066
Come on, get up, Lewis.
Get up.

763
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,384
Get on up.

764
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,628
Good afternoon, Yankee John.

765
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,903
That sounds like a dead battery.

766
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,384
Woman that owns the tour company
rear-ended me...

767
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,983
...so to speak.

768
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,504
Where we headed?

769
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,581
How about live entertainment?

770
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,058
Get on up, Lewis.

771
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:55,062
That's a good horse.

772
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,538
<i>Hey, bitch!</i>

773
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,109
Hey, bitch!

774
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:02,258
Let the house say it like you mean it.
Let the house say, "Hey, bitch!"

775
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,102
Hey, bitch!

776
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,350
Yes, I am a bitch,
and proud of it, honey.

777
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,629
Your mama is just sweating. I'm putting
a sweating in front of you white folks.

778
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:16,500
But then again, I want you all to know
how hard a girl is working for you.

779
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,820
Excuse me, darling.

780
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,819
Excuse me.

781
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:21,946
Oh, my God!

782
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,819
"Oh, my God," nothing, honey.
"Oh, my empress" is what you should say.

783
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,823
Y'all been necking
since I walked out on stage.

784
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:33,508
Look, our Ivory Soap-using girl.
Love them kind of bitches, baby.

785
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:37,345
Either he got some good old stuff,
girl, or you horny as hell.

786
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,346
Is this your boyfriend?
Your husband?

787
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,898
My husband.

788
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,107
What does Mr. Man do for a living?

789
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,943
He's a doctor.

790
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,179
A doctor?

791
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,821
You better grow you some nails, because
if he's a gynecologist, he's mine.

792
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,029
I am serious, honey.

793
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:01,820
He is mine. A doctor. Grow your nails,
I'm going to take him away from you.

794
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:07,506
Look at him just blushing.
You're so cute.

795
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,581
You want to give me a physical?

796
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,900
I have nothing to hide.

797
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,945
You better have American Express, baby.

798
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,385
But you know what?
That's okay about him.

799
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,349
Because the Doll has already got
some white boy...

800
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,501
...running after her good old stuff.

801
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,981
Spotlight, shine a spotlight over there.
Right over there.

802
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,381
You see that fine white man right there?
That one, there.

803
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:38,942
He has been running the Doll
all around Savannah trying to get some.

804
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,546
First day I met him,
he brought the girl roses.

805
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,223
Then again, as you well know...

806
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,745
...ain't nothing too good for the Doll.

807
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:50,539
Ain't nothing too good for the Lady.
I am serious about that.

808
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:54,305
If I catch any of you bitches
near him, honey...

809
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,225
...I want you to know you'll have
to deal with the Lady Chablis...

810
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,826
...the Doll, the Grand Empress,
and my motherfucking ice pick.

811
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:04,307
So keep your hands off of that one.

812
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,099
Hey, honey love.

813
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,465
How are you, Doll?

814
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:12,305
I'm fine.
Who is that handsome man?

815
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:13,986
Joe Odom.

816
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,179
Pleased to meet you.

817
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,627
My pleasure. We met before.
We slept together one night.

818
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:23,386
Narrow it down for the Doll. There are
certain nights I cannot remember.

819
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,382
That's another tale for another time.

820
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,861
My ice cubes are getting a bit dry.
I'll leave you two alone. Ma'am.

821
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:34,705
Thank you. I'll talk to you later,
you sentimental gentleman.

822
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:35,985
Hurry back.

823
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,224
Don't let him hurry back.
I need to spend time with you.

824
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,346
How are you?

825
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:44,549
I'm fine, honey. Still hiding my candy.
Want me to unwrap it for you?

826
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,462
- You don't have to.
- You sure?

827
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:47,938
Not yet.
I mean, not ever.

828
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,862
- It's a small little wrapper.
- Please.

829
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,259
Like a Tootsie Roll.

830
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:52,989
Some people don't need to see candy.

831
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,387
Okay, that's fine.
But I got something to tell you.

832
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:02,260
I got something to tell you.
I have boyfriend number four.

833
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,659
Really?

834
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,266
A tall, blond hunk of a hunk of man.

835
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,229
He's a mechanic on Abercorn Street.
Know where that is?

836
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,542
- I know where that is.
- Treats me like a queen.

837
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,702
No pun intended.
None whatsoever.

838
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:20,860
You must promise if you
ever meet him, which I doubt you will...

839
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,908
...if you should meet him,
you must never tell him my "T."

840
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,663
- He has no idea.
- Your "T"?

841
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,741
You know, my "T," my truth.

842
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,548
The hide-my-candy thing.

843
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,745
He doesn't know,
so you mustn't say anything.

844
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:37,024
- Promise me you won't.
- Don't you think he'll find out?

845
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,830
When I'm ready for him to find out,
he'll find out.

846
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,828
Like when I was ready for you
to find out.

847
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,822
But I wasn't looking for your candy.

848
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,389
But you was smelling for it.

849
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:48,224
- I did not smell your candy.
- Why are you here?

850
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,664
I want to interview you.

851
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,669
Your show was terrific.

852
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,707
Thank you.
You want to interview me?

853
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,463
Yes, very much so.

854
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,100
What happened?

855
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,341
9 jurors indicted murder one.

856
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:16,945
They're trying to put our friend away
for life.

857
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:23,865
Your Honor...

858
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:27,102
...the community that put us both
in the positions we now hold...

859
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,229
...would be less than pleased with
an order allowing a wealthy defendant...

860
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,904
...in a first-degree murder case bail.

861
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,989
And they'd be right.

862
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,264
All right, gentlemen.

863
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,582
I have listened carefully
to these arguments.

864
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:49,221
Mr. Williams is charged
with a very violent crime...

865
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,428
...and Mr. Seiler, I can't grant bail
under these circumstances.

866
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,624
But I will put this case
on a fast track...

867
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,298
...for a speedy trial.

868
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,739
That's all.

869
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,024
Well, sport, looks like there might be
a book in this after all.

870
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,906
Does he have any idea
how serious this is?

871
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,505
You know it and I know it...

872
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,309
...and after tonight,
damn hell, so will he.

873
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,026
What is it?

874
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,899
You told Sonny I heard Billy
threaten you the night you shot him.

875
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,065
I heard you threaten him too.
If I testify...

876
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,299
I didn't threaten him.

877
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:53,585
I warned him.

878
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:57,268
He had a history of violence.
He was drunk and high.

879
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:00,388
While trespassing,
he profanely demanded money...

880
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,905
...and brandished
a broken bottle in my face.

881
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:05,027
Is that not your recollection as well?

882
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:08,660
- More or less.
- Then your testimony can only help me.

883
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,186
What was it between the two of you?

884
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:18,785
We'll turn this off.

885
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,428
I don't mind that.

886
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,669
Was it just sex?

887
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,539
Tell me about the relationship.

888
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,703
Billy and I had a bond.

889
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,544
That's not something
they're going to understand.

890
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,382
They'll just see the sex...

891
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,382
...and the age difference.

892
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,544
But Billy was going to make something
of himself.

893
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,340
Great things, great people...

894
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,583
...can come from humble beginnings.

895
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,821
He needed what I gave him...

896
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,821
...and I needed what he gave me.

897
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,858
Now, do you wish
to pass judgement on that?

898
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,739
No.

899
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:16,749
I'm innocent, John.

900
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,946
It's important that you believe that.

901
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:22,662
Do you believe that?

902
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,223
Yes, I do.

903
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,909
I'm having trouble
getting anyone to talk to me.

904
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,223
I'll make some arrangements.

905
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:40,065
Tomorrow, can you bring the Sotheby's
and christie's catalogues?

906
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:43,700
They serve dinner here at 7,
so that's when we'll make our calls.

907
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,709
Our calls?

908
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,866
Yes, accept the charges, operator.

909
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,867
Jim. How are you?

910
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:05,343
All right, sport,
let's give this a try, shall we?

911
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,222
Let's see if we can work this.

912
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,909
All right, it's ringing.

913
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:31,183
Hello, Jim Williams calling
for Geza von Habsburg.

914
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,145
Thank you.

915
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,105
Thank you.

916
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:40,106
Geza.

917
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,428
James! How nice of you to call.

918
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,389
Would you be interested
in my Maximilian desk?

919
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,222
Someone, ask him to be quiet.

920
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:58,463
It sounds like your dog
doesn't want to sell. What's his breed?

921
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,705
That's a Russian wolfhound.

922
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,788
Sounds more like a Shar-Pei.

923
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,149
No, no, that's my Yorkie.

924
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,104
Would someone please
put the dogs in the garden?

925
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:21,700
I'll take care of the dog for you.

926
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:27,187
Now, Geza,
you know I'll want top dollar.

927
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,268
As always.

928
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,505
Shut up!

929
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,510
Is this the Married Women's card club?

930
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,304
Yes.

931
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,822
Is anyone going to ring the doorbell?

932
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,742
Oh, heavens, no!

933
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:29,107
We have very strict rules.
The door opens precisely at 4.

934
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:34,823
You all look lovely.

935
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,543
Actually, Jim...

936
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:39,668
...suggested
that I introduce you around.

937
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:42,583
But if we could just keep that
between us...

938
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:45,820
- Why?
- Just a minute.

939
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,308
Everything all right, ladies?

940
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,059
Good.

941
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,665
Jim was a true friend to me
over the years.

942
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,140
But most of these ladies
are still deciding...

943
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:59,427
...how they'll respond
to this current predicament.

944
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,059
You know...

945
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,584
...the incident.

946
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,107
I have work to do in the kitchen.
Would you like to take a seat?

947
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,944
- I don't play bridge.
- Oh, I don't mean play.

948
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,299
Men aren't allowed.

949
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,902
Especially single men.

950
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,187
But you could sit down and wait.
I'll be right back.

951
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:28,143
It was a <i>crime passionnel.</i>
A lover's quarrel.

952
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:31,587
That may be, but I gather
it's going to be rather sticky for Jim.

953
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,425
Really?

954
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:37,266
There's no gunpowder on that boy's hand.
He didn't fire the gun...

955
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,102
...as Jim claims.

956
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,984
And the location
of the bullet wounds...

957
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:47,666
Seems to be at odds with
Mr. Williams' scenario of self-defense.

958
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:48,740
How so?

959
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:52,619
One entered the chest. The second
bullet hit the boy in the back.

960
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:55,225
And the third, well,
the third bullet...

961
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,028
What do you think'll happen to Jim?

962
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,861
It's difficult to say.

963
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:05,541
Those who are happy Billy is no longer
burning rubber through the squares...

964
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,105
...are the exact people who think...

965
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:13,105
...that Jim picked a very unseemly way
to exit the closet...

966
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:14,585
...if you will.

967
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,265
With a bang.

968
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,063
Literally.

969
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,305
And then...

970
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,699
...there are the others.

971
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,669
Tell me about the others.

972
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:29,583
There's bound to be a certain
resentment about Jim killing that boy.

973
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:32,424
That boy in particular, I mean.

974
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,139
Why?

975
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,907
Billy was a very accomplished hustler.

976
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,948
By all accounts,
very good at his trade...

977
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:45,183
...and very much appreciated
by both men and women.

978
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,144
The trouble is...

979
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:51,143
...he hadn't finished
making the rounds, no.

980
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,265
Billy Hanson was known to be...

981
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,023
...a good time...

982
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:57,305
...but...

983
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:00,940
...a good time not yet had by all.

984
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,224
They're saying Jim Williams killed
the best piece of ass in Savannah.

985
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,619
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

986
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,065
You know about ass in Savannah.
What do you think?

987
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:11,187
Great God!

988
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,869
Good gossip's hard currency in this
town. Folks just paying their bills.

989
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:20,422
When the chips are down,
they'll be there for Jim. Trust me.

990
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:23,468
- Rather hear your legal strategies.
- Our game plan's still percolating.

991
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,543
We had a deal.
I've shared every bit of information...

992
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,109
Come along in.

993
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,227
Now, don't mind us.

994
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,825
Trial date.

995
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:38,266
Big game 3 weeks from now.

996
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,625
It's a shootout.

997
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,185
Both teams got one silver bullet.

998
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,503
Gunshot residue test, that's theirs.

999
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:48,862
No gunshot residue on Billy's hands
means he didn't fire.

1000
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,022
Means Jim killed him in cold blood...

1001
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:54,343
...mocked up the scene.

1002
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,228
How you plan to counter that?

1003
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:01,220
Gunshot residue test is unreliable.
It's inadmissable in some jurisdictions.

1004
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:04,906
Finley's got Doc Poe. We will counter
with cutting-edge science...

1005
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,539
...with an expert we got from up north.

1006
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,462
They say the scene was contrived.
What do you say?

1007
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,263
That's our silver bullet.

1008
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,862
Shoddy police work.

1009
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,623
Take a look at this.

1010
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,583
That's me!

1011
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,183
Just like you said.

1012
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,864
Ground zero.
Cops should never have let you in.

1013
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,709
I kind of let myself in
through the back gate.

1014
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:38,106
They shouldn't have let you get in.

1015
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,945
<i>Happy together</i>

1016
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,184
<i>Unhappy together</i>

1017
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,145
<i>And won 't it be fine</i>

1018
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,267
<i>Days may be cloudy or sunny</i>

1019
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:02,939
<i>We're in or we're out of the money</i>

1020
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:08,981
<i>But I'm with you always</i>

1021
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,941
<i>Come rain or</i>

1022
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,821
<i>Shine</i>

1023
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,664
Joe Odom.

1024
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,421
You're good.
I didn't know you sang.

1025
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,023
- You never asked.
- How you doing?

1026
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:37,498
Good, how are you?

1027
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:41,347
- You got another set?
- No, me and Joe's just sitting in.

1028
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:42,864
Want to get a cup of coffee?

1029
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:44,862
Business or pleasure?

1030
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,219
Come on.

1031
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:53,421
Normally, there'd be no problem.
The general rule is rich people get off.

1032
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,581
Problem is, they're usually straight.

1033
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:57,940
See, so it's a volatile issue.

1034
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:00,624
- I'm not crazy?
- No. Neither is Sonny.

1035
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,667
Jim's friends knew he was gay.

1036
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:06,698
Secretly, they congratulated themselves
on being so cosmopolitan.

1037
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:11,660
If they knew he was completely open with
his sexuality, they'd have shunned him.

1038
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,862
Maybe the jury will too.

1039
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:14,986
You think?

1040
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:19,981
Of course, no one'll ever really know
what happened that night.

1041
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,983
But Jim's told the story
a thousand times, never wavered.

1042
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,902
You're quite the advocate.

1043
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:28,779
What happened to
"Stick around and stay objective"?

1044
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:32,625
Objectively, it's looking like
they'll hang him for his sexuality.

1045
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:35,464
Something that would never happen
in New York, right?

1046
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:39,105
Well, you said it, not me.

1047
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,902
You don't seem like you're from here.

1048
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,584
I was born here, didn't like it...

1049
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:46,945
...moved away.

1050
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,260
Figured out the part
I didn't like was me.

1051
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:52,308
So I worked on that,
and I moved back.

1052
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,902
I got my first kiss right here.

1053
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,584
Sammy Jenks.
Gave him a black eye.

1054
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,548
You did? How hard?

1055
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,623
That's what love'll do.

1056
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:09,581
I have trouble picturing what kind of
woman you'd take the trouble to marry.

1057
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:14,628
First love situation.

1058
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:19,343
We got married a week after graduating
college, if you can believe that.

1059
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,818
So what happened?

1060
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,662
You want to hear my sob story?

1061
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:26,141
I think she thought
she was marrying Norman Mailer.

1062
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,662
She thought I'd be famous.

1063
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:33,701
After the book was published, she'd wake
up at the crack of dawn on Sunday...

1064
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,180
...make coffee, cross her fingers...

1065
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:39,581
...and look in that Sunday <i>Times,</i>
sure it was going to be a bestseller.

1066
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:43,989
One Sunday, she didn't wake up early,
didn't make coffee...

1067
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:46,061
...didn't cross her fingers...

1068
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,424
...and I knew.

1069
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:52,143
She left you
because your book wasn't a hit?

1070
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:56,380
I don't know, Kelso.
It seems pretty shallow to me.

1071
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,102
What about you and Joe Odom?

1072
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:02,509
Me and Joe.

1073
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,388
We're just friends.

1074
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,264
We have a real musical relationship.

1075
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:11,027
We're like the Steve and Eydie
of Savannah.

1076
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,262
My God, it's quiet.

1077
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,540
Too quiet.

1078
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:22,304
Joe'll be playing at that bar
until dawn.

1079
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:28,903
I should probably go.

1080
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:39,388
In case you're wondering,
this is the perfect time for a kiss.

1081
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,780
Sammy Jenks warned me about you.

1082
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,379
Good night.

1083
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,299
Ladies and gentlemen,
you constitute our jury for this trial.

1084
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:16,302
It's expected to last several days.

1085
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,222
I'll let you go home for the evening...

1086
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:22,509
...instruct you to be back
in the morning at 9:30 in the jury room.

1087
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,503
If anybody tries to approach you
about this case...

1088
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,218
...report it to me
the first thing in the morning.

1089
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:30,667
You're excused for the evening.

1090
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:36,064
Mr. Driggers, let me speak to you.

1091
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,422
Luther, listen.

1092
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,980
This is a courtroom. Don't bring
those flies in here tomorrow.

1093
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:51,940
And leave that vial of water,
or whatever that stuff is, at home.

1094
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:53,699
Sam...

1095
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:58,023
...you know, when we were in Georgia,
I know how you hated my bugs...

1096
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:59,988
...and you know how I love them.

1097
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,945
We're no longer at the university.
This is a courtroom.

1098
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:06,660
I'm telling you to leave
all that foolishness at home.

1099
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:09,706
I do take umbrage.

1100
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,669
But I'll do it.

1101
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:15,350
What is the story with the guy
with the horsefly epaulets?

1102
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,023
Luther Driggers.

1103
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,464
He's a genius.

1104
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:20,701
Developed the "No-Bug" strip.

1105
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,703
The company he worked for
took the credit and the money.

1106
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:27,101
Now he just wanders around town
with a bottle of poison in his pocket.

1107
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,226
Of course.

1108
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:32,145
Says someday he's going to put it
in the water supply, do us all in.

1109
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,062
Why do you want him on the jury?

1110
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:37,347
We're the defense team.
We need all the nuts we can get.

1111
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:38,989
What about Largent?

1112
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:41,380
Finley's up for reelection.

1113
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,024
If he strikes Luther...

1114
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:44,908
...he might upset him enough to...

1115
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:46,705
...you know...

1116
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,701
I'll be back in on Sunday.

1117
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:54,701
You've got a murder trial
starting in 3 days. Where you going?

1118
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:58,986
Home opener against 'Bama.

1119
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:02,343
Go, Dogs!

1120
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:06,145
Is he really leaving?

1121
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,108
Oh, yeah.
Better say a prayer.

1122
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,584
All right, Mr. Largent...

1123
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:15,266
...the state has the burden of proof,
and you have the opening.

1124
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,419
Your Honor.

1125
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:25,543
Good morning, Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1126
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,820
The state of Georgia is ready
and most anxious to proceed.

1127
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:42,028
If the court pleases.

1128
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:56,225
The philosopher Thomas Hobbes
is quoted as saying...

1129
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:57,869
...that life is...

1130
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:59,941
...nasty, brutish...

1131
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:01,744
...and short.

1132
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,667
And surely it must have seemed so
to Billy Hanson...

1133
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,182
...as he lay wounded...

1134
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,859
...his blood and his life...

1135
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:15,307
...oozing out
onto Jim Williams' Persian rug.

1136
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,269
It's important for you to know
that the defendant...

1137
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,342
By the end of this trial...

1138
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:25,859
...I believe...

1139
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:29,309
...that when faced with the evidence...

1140
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,024
...you will render...

1141
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:34,103
...the verdict that is fair and just:

1142
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,905
Guilty of first-degree murder.

1143
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:45,225
Thank you.

1144
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:58,628
All right, Mr. Seiler,
we've been going for some time now.

1145
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:02,385
Would you prefer to make
your opening statement after recess?

1146
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:08,701
I would prefer to address
the jury now, Your Honor.

1147
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,666
What I have to say won't take long.

1148
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:19,466
I apologize if I look tired...

1149
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,547
...if my eyes are red...

1150
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:25,340
...if my complexion is sallow.

1151
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,180
But I came by it honestly.

1152
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:30,498
Because...

1153
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,945
...I have not had much sleep lately.

1154
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,745
For while my bed is soft...

1155
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:38,785
...my client's is not.

1156
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:42,666
And while I'm surrounded
by my loving family...

1157
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:45,143
...Jim Williams...

1158
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,229
...my friend...

1159
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,058
...my client...

1160
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:51,863
...is locked up in a room...

1161
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,386
...full of thieves,
murderers and rapists.

1162
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,143
You're the ones I want.

1163
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,021
You're the ones I trust.

1164
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:08,542
Because although it is Jim Williams
on trial here today...

1165
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,504
...when I look at the circumstances...

1166
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,502
...I think to myself...

1167
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:14,825
...there...

1168
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,868
...but for the grace of God,
go you...

1169
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,185
...or I.

1170
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:22,623
You know why?
Because I guaran-damn-tee you:

1171
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:25,828
Someone comes into my home
and shoot at me, I will shoot back.

1172
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,265
And I'll shoot back again and again...

1173
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,024
...and again,
until I'm sure that they're dead.

1174
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:35,502
Until I'm sure that my home
and my family are safe.

1175
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,139
And then...

1176
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:43,821
...old Finley here, my friend...

1177
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:46,381
...would be prosecuting me.

1178
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,547
I'd be the one on trial.

1179
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:50,509
And my life...

1180
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,149
...would be in the hands...

1181
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:55,065
...of good folks like you.

1182
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:57,226
He is way out-of-bounds.

1183
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:01,584
He didn't object once during ours.
We'll look like assholes.

1184
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:03,741
Folks not swayed by fancy words.

1185
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,739
Folks who would not be prejudiced...

1186
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:10,105
...who would not judge a man...

1187
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,261
...by the color of his skin...

1188
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:15,020
...or the amount of money that he makes.

1189
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,539
I will say...

1190
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:19,141
...the simple fact of the matter...

1191
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,505
...is...

1192
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:22,982
...Jim Williams...

1193
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,901
...murdered no one.

1194
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:32,624
How did you think it went?
Because I was very pleased.

1195
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:35,828
Sonny has a certain style,
a flair, doesn't he?

1196
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:37,219
From what I've seen...

1197
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,348
...that man could weave horseshit
into Egyptian cotton.

1198
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,706
Pleasantly surprised.

1199
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,945
John Kelso,
I hope you understand.

1200
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:48,181
Might I consider you my friend?

1201
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:50,785
Yes.

1202
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:58,504
The lack of gunshot residue in the hand,
plus the other things I mentioned...

1203
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,503
...led me to the conclusion
that the scene was contrived.

1204
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,548
Thank you, Detective Boone.

1205
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,269
No further questions.

1206
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,269
Detective...

1207
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,867
...I'd like to revisit
some of the things...

1208
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,984
...you said just then in direct.

1209
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:25,984
You testified there was blood
on Hanson's hand, correct?

1210
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:29,540
Yes. There was blood in the palm
of the victim's hand.

1211
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:33,306
And that's important because if Hanson
had been holding the gun...

1212
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:34,869
...there'd be no blood.

1213
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:40,426
But you never saw the blood
on the victim's hand, did you?

1214
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:41,745
No.

1215
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:45,139
The blood was noted
in the autopsy report.

1216
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,745
I didn't turn them over
when I bagged them.

1217
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:50,785
I believe you also testified that...

1218
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:55,706
...you believe the final shot was fired
from above the victim, is that correct?

1219
01:24:56,470 --> 01:25:00,463
I concluded that the shot came
from someone standing over the victim...

1220
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,109
...execution style.

1221
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,103
A <i>coup de grâce.</i>

1222
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,143
A <i>coup de grâce?</i>

1223
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,785
Will you tell the jury, please...

1224
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:22,584
...did you find Jim's prints
on Billy's gun?

1225
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:29,381
The Luger handle has a textured surface.

1226
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:33,026
Is the answer no, Detective?

1227
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,550
Yes, the answer was no.

1228
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:38,667
Yes, the answer is no.

1229
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:42,061
State's 22, Your Honor.

1230
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,981
Who's this handsome fellow?

1231
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,225
That's me.

1232
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,703
Who's this?

1233
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,710
That's that reporter fella
from up north.

1234
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,180
The one that's working with Williams.

1235
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,508
I don't know how he got in.

1236
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,303
And this?

1237
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,463
Young officer...

1238
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,109
...name escapes me.

1239
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:12,901
Understandable. You'd need a program
to keep track of everyone in that room.

1240
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:14,344
Objection!

1241
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,387
Counsel's testifying.

1242
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,109
Strike that.

1243
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,344
I would much rather have
the detective tell us.

1244
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:24,025
How many people was in that room?

1245
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:26,584
Seven.

1246
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:28,459
No, eight.

1247
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:31,782
"Seven, no, eight."
And a pussycat.

1248
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,742
Read the funny papers, Detective?

1249
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,709
Not often.

1250
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:42,268
In the funny papers they sometimes
have this little competition...

1251
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,705
...to find an animal
hidden in an illustration.

1252
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,669
I love to play it with my grandson.
You know that game?

1253
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,745
We're going to play "Where's Shelton?"

1254
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:56,700
I don't know what Mr. Seiler's trying
to prove with all this, but I assume...

1255
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:00,501
Mr. Finley, we can all play.
Shelton Williams...

1256
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,786
...is the defendant's tabby cat.

1257
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:05,708
Now, Detective...

1258
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:08,467
...let's play "Where's Shelton?"

1259
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:12,669
I'll give you a clue.

1260
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,062
Take a look at the rug.

1261
01:27:20,987 --> 01:27:23,217
Is the answer "yes"?

1262
01:27:25,227 --> 01:27:27,183
State's 22, Your Honor.

1263
01:27:28,867 --> 01:27:30,016
Tabby cat.

1264
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:33,022
Is Shelton Williams on your payroll?

1265
01:27:36,787 --> 01:27:39,017
I've heard tell of cat burglars.

1266
01:27:39,267 --> 01:27:40,666
Is this a cat detective?

1267
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,059
Don't be ridiculous.

1268
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:46,104
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.

1269
01:27:46,347 --> 01:27:49,305
You saying that
the scene of the crime was secured.

1270
01:27:49,707 --> 01:27:51,140
That's what's ridiculous.

1271
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:56,584
Seven, no, eight people, and a pussycat,
walking all around that room...

1272
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:00,425
You call that secure?

1273
01:28:09,787 --> 01:28:11,459
We hung around a lot.

1274
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:15,104
Billy had a car
and he'd give me rides sometimes.

1275
01:28:17,027 --> 01:28:19,939
Mr. Tucker, do you,
of your own knowledge...

1276
01:28:20,187 --> 01:28:24,100
...know anything of the relationship
between Billy Hanson and...

1277
01:28:24,347 --> 01:28:25,541
...Jim Williams?

1278
01:28:25,787 --> 01:28:26,902
Objection.

1279
01:28:27,147 --> 01:28:28,421
Objection, Your Honor.

1280
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:34,382
Let me see you gentlemen
over here a minute.

1281
01:28:40,587 --> 01:28:41,986
What's this about?

1282
01:28:42,827 --> 01:28:46,502
Your Honor, if this boy says
what I think he's going to say...

1283
01:28:46,747 --> 01:28:48,499
...you can't ask the jury to ignore it.

1284
01:28:48,747 --> 01:28:52,342
You can't let a skunk go in the box
and then say they didn't smell it.

1285
01:28:52,587 --> 01:28:56,785
Our intention with Mr. Tucker is to show
the victim was afraid of the defendant.

1286
01:28:57,027 --> 01:29:00,656
To do that, he has to describe
the nature of the relationship.

1287
01:29:00,907 --> 01:29:04,422
Your intention
is to paint Jim Williams pink...

1288
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:07,056
...then rely on some prejudice
in the jury.

1289
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:10,219
Besides which, whatever he says
will be secondhand.

1290
01:29:10,467 --> 01:29:11,900
It would be hearsay.

1291
01:29:12,827 --> 01:29:15,819
He asked the witness
if he knew of his own knowledge.

1292
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:18,422
If he knows, it's not hearsay.

1293
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:20,302
I'll allow it...

1294
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:23,465
...but I'll grant you the same latitude
when it's your turn.

1295
01:29:23,707 --> 01:29:25,220
Objection's overruled.

1296
01:29:32,987 --> 01:29:36,866
Mr. Tucker, the question was,
"Do you, of your own knowledge...

1297
01:29:37,107 --> 01:29:41,419
...know anything of the relationship
between Hanson and the defendant?"

1298
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:43,102
Yes, sir.

1299
01:29:44,067 --> 01:29:46,581
Jim would give Billy money
when he needed it.

1300
01:29:46,827 --> 01:29:50,740
He bought him a car and clothes
for going to bed with him.

1301
01:29:52,347 --> 01:29:54,656
To sleep with him?
To...

1302
01:29:55,387 --> 01:29:56,786
...have sex with him?

1303
01:29:57,467 --> 01:29:58,502
Yes, sir.

1304
01:30:02,747 --> 01:30:04,658
Now, did Billy and Jim Williams...

1305
01:30:04,907 --> 01:30:06,181
...have any disagreements...

1306
01:30:06,427 --> 01:30:07,542
...if you know?

1307
01:30:08,747 --> 01:30:10,100
All the time.

1308
01:30:10,507 --> 01:30:13,067
Jim would be pissed off at Billy...

1309
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:15,104
...for one thing or another.

1310
01:30:15,787 --> 01:30:17,459
He was real jealous of Billy.

1311
01:30:19,467 --> 01:30:22,186
And what feelings, if any...

1312
01:30:22,427 --> 01:30:25,385
...did Billy have about the defendant?

1313
01:30:26,827 --> 01:30:29,466
Jim is a rich and powerful man.

1314
01:30:30,307 --> 01:30:32,582
Billy was a little afraid of him,
I guess.

1315
01:30:36,947 --> 01:30:38,016
Thank you.

1316
01:30:55,387 --> 01:30:56,866
Minerva.

1317
01:31:00,067 --> 01:31:01,056
Tell me...

1318
01:31:01,867 --> 01:31:04,381
...how well did you know Billy Hanson?

1319
01:31:05,587 --> 01:31:07,179
What kind of friends were you?

1320
01:31:08,187 --> 01:31:09,506
Yes, sir.

1321
01:31:09,747 --> 01:31:11,738
He was my best friend in the world.

1322
01:31:12,547 --> 01:31:14,378
We saw each other all the time.

1323
01:31:15,147 --> 01:31:16,580
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

1324
01:31:16,827 --> 01:31:19,102
And nothing you wouldn't do for him.

1325
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:22,381
If you're trying to say I'm lying,
I'm not.

1326
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:25,018
Take it easy, young man.

1327
01:31:25,267 --> 01:31:26,985
Everything I say is true.

1328
01:31:27,227 --> 01:31:30,697
Of course. There's no reason for it
not to be. That's all we're after here.

1329
01:31:33,587 --> 01:31:37,899
How well did you know Jim Williams?
You never did meet him, did you?

1330
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,658
Not shaking hands or nothing.

1331
01:31:41,627 --> 01:31:45,461
But I stood next to him in the emergency
room when Billy O.D.'d.

1332
01:31:45,827 --> 01:31:47,055
Billy Hanson...

1333
01:31:47,307 --> 01:31:48,945
...overdosed on drugs?

1334
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:52,622
When?

1335
01:31:55,107 --> 01:31:56,938
About a month before Jim killed him.

1336
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:01,740
So Jim Williams...

1337
01:32:01,987 --> 01:32:05,059
...took Billy Hanson to the hospital.
He saved his life.

1338
01:32:05,307 --> 01:32:06,820
If he wanted him dead...

1339
01:32:07,067 --> 01:32:08,785
...why would he do that?

1340
01:32:09,427 --> 01:32:10,780
I don't know.

1341
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:13,740
I guess...

1342
01:32:14,547 --> 01:32:15,741
Did you...

1343
01:32:16,307 --> 01:32:18,059
...ever have sex with Billy?

1344
01:32:18,787 --> 01:32:20,698
No. No, sir.

1345
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:27,498
Are you yourself a homosexual?

1346
01:32:29,227 --> 01:32:30,342
Objection.

1347
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:33,382
Relevance?

1348
01:32:34,267 --> 01:32:36,258
Mr. Largent, you opened that door.

1349
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:38,783
What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

1350
01:32:39,027 --> 01:32:40,096
I'll let it in.

1351
01:32:41,907 --> 01:32:43,386
Thank you, Your Honor.

1352
01:32:46,147 --> 01:32:48,138
Want me to repeat the question, George?

1353
01:32:48,387 --> 01:32:51,299
I could have the court reporter
read it out.

1354
01:32:51,547 --> 01:32:53,378
No, sir. I ain't no fairy.

1355
01:33:00,827 --> 01:33:03,466
I've had some experiences, but...

1356
01:33:04,347 --> 01:33:05,905
...I'm out of it now.

1357
01:33:06,947 --> 01:33:08,096
Out of it?

1358
01:33:08,347 --> 01:33:09,462
Yes, sir.

1359
01:33:10,467 --> 01:33:13,698
Would you care to explain to the jury
what you mean by that?

1360
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:16,056
It's wrong.

1361
01:33:16,427 --> 01:33:17,621
The Bible says so.

1362
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:21,743
Bible also says
it's wrong to lie.

1363
01:33:23,787 --> 01:33:26,745
How long have you been out of it?

1364
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:31,899
Almost 3 weeks.

1365
01:33:35,427 --> 01:33:37,179
Congratulations, George.

1366
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:39,936
Good for you.

1367
01:33:45,027 --> 01:33:47,018
No further questions, Your Honor.

1368
01:33:55,787 --> 01:33:58,301
- Please.
- Chablis, it's a subpoena!

1369
01:33:58,547 --> 01:34:00,060
They'll hold you in contempt.

1370
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:04,778
I don't care if it's an invitation
from God. They fuck with the Doll...

1371
01:34:05,027 --> 01:34:06,824
- You got that off TV.
- Whatever.

1372
01:34:07,067 --> 01:34:08,580
They'll hold you in contempt.

1373
01:34:08,827 --> 01:34:11,182
I've been held in contempt before.

1374
01:34:11,427 --> 01:34:12,746
A man's life is at stake.

1375
01:34:12,987 --> 01:34:16,741
What do I have to do
with that man's life? Nothing.

1376
01:34:16,987 --> 01:34:18,136
Absolutely nothing.

1377
01:34:18,387 --> 01:34:21,140
Wait. I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

1378
01:34:21,387 --> 01:34:22,979
What kind of deal?

1379
01:34:24,907 --> 01:34:26,135
What kind of deal?

1380
01:34:26,907 --> 01:34:29,023
Wait, John, be patient.

1381
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,100
I'll tell you what.

1382
01:34:32,347 --> 01:34:36,056
You bring me a truckload of
good-Iooking boys to my show tonight...

1383
01:34:36,307 --> 01:34:37,740
...and I'll think about it.

1384
01:34:37,987 --> 01:34:40,865
I'd love to, but I can't.
I got to go to some cotillion.

1385
01:34:41,307 --> 01:34:44,379
How boring.
What cotillion are you going to?

1386
01:34:44,627 --> 01:34:45,821
The Alpha Phi.

1387
01:34:46,507 --> 01:34:48,065
The black people's ball?

1388
01:34:48,307 --> 01:34:50,662
You're going to the black people's ball?

1389
01:34:53,787 --> 01:34:56,176
- Absolutely not.
- Please? Take me.

1390
01:34:56,427 --> 01:34:57,940
I'll be on my best behavior.

1391
01:34:58,187 --> 01:35:01,259
I promise, John.
Please take me.

1392
01:35:01,507 --> 01:35:02,940
- I can't.
- I won't shake my ass or cuss.

1393
01:35:03,187 --> 01:35:04,506
I won't do anything.
Please.

1394
01:35:04,747 --> 01:35:06,100
These girls are debutantes.

1395
01:35:06,347 --> 01:35:10,260
What does that mean? I can't clientele
with uptown black-ass people?

1396
01:35:10,507 --> 01:35:13,419
No, but, you know,
debs are carefully scrutinized.

1397
01:35:14,947 --> 01:35:16,824
Please. And?

1398
01:35:18,147 --> 01:35:19,705
For the most part...

1399
01:35:21,027 --> 01:35:22,983
...not many of them hide their candy...

1400
01:35:23,387 --> 01:35:25,537
...and few have been caught shoplifting.

1401
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:28,100
You know, not many.

1402
01:35:29,107 --> 01:35:33,146
These bitches must do it damn good,
if they haven't gotten caught yet.

1403
01:35:33,387 --> 01:35:35,947
I imagine they do
a lot of volunteer work, Frank.

1404
01:35:36,187 --> 01:35:39,179
Stay out of bars, go to churches.
Those kind of ladies.

1405
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:43,340
First of all,
don't you ever call me Frank again.

1406
01:35:43,627 --> 01:35:46,699
And are these black girls
we're talking about?

1407
01:35:46,947 --> 01:35:50,940
If these are black girls,
they must be some ugly bitches, honey.

1408
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:52,456
Take me.

1409
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:54,140
- Please?
- Come on.

1410
01:35:54,387 --> 01:35:55,217
Take me.

1411
01:35:55,467 --> 01:35:57,264
- Cut it out.
- Please take me.

1412
01:36:28,707 --> 01:36:30,777
It's good to have you here.

1413
01:36:31,027 --> 01:36:32,904
You know, this is our 40th year.

1414
01:36:33,147 --> 01:36:34,136
It's lovely.

1415
01:36:39,867 --> 01:36:43,780
I do believe
we've almost caught the white cotillion.

1416
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:47,426
Congratulations.

1417
01:37:31,907 --> 01:37:32,862
Good evening.

1418
01:37:34,827 --> 01:37:36,624
Sir, is this spot taken?

1419
01:37:36,867 --> 01:37:39,335
- No, ma'am.
- Please don't call me ma'am.

1420
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:41,259
My name's chablis.
What's yours?

1421
01:37:41,507 --> 01:37:43,099
Phillip. I'm an escort.

1422
01:37:44,107 --> 01:37:45,142
An escort.

1423
01:37:45,387 --> 01:37:47,537
Do you work for a service?

1424
01:37:47,787 --> 01:37:49,140
No, I'm escorting my sister.

1425
01:37:49,387 --> 01:37:51,298
Don't tell me you're doing it with her.

1426
01:37:52,907 --> 01:37:56,422
My sister's boyfriend decided
not to come, so I got roped into it.

1427
01:37:58,027 --> 01:37:59,301
Let me ask you something.

1428
01:38:01,227 --> 01:38:02,945
You ever been arrested?

1429
01:38:03,547 --> 01:38:04,662
Oh, come on.

1430
01:38:04,907 --> 01:38:06,135
Once, sort of.

1431
01:38:06,467 --> 01:38:09,618
I had a few drinks.
I got a ticket for disturbing the peace.

1432
01:38:10,307 --> 01:38:12,457
Disturbing the peace.

1433
01:38:13,347 --> 01:38:15,542
I got a piece you can disturb, hon.

1434
01:38:18,467 --> 01:38:20,423
I've been admiring your gown.

1435
01:38:20,707 --> 01:38:23,141
Thank you very much.
This old thing?

1436
01:38:23,387 --> 01:38:25,184
It's very glamorous.

1437
01:38:25,427 --> 01:38:27,145
Thank you very much.

1438
01:38:27,387 --> 01:38:28,979
Of whom are you a guest?

1439
01:38:29,427 --> 01:38:30,826
I'm here with my cousin.

1440
01:38:35,347 --> 01:38:36,257
My cousin...

1441
01:38:37,347 --> 01:38:38,621
...LaVella.

1442
01:38:39,107 --> 01:38:40,222
LaVella.

1443
01:38:40,787 --> 01:38:42,584
She's a lovely girl.

1444
01:38:42,827 --> 01:38:46,456
Oh, I think so too.
She's always wanted this...

1445
01:38:46,707 --> 01:38:50,177
...since we were kids.
She never thought she'd get it.

1446
01:38:50,427 --> 01:38:53,225
She had nothing to worry about.

1447
01:38:53,747 --> 01:38:56,500
You know what, hon?
I told her the same thing.

1448
01:38:56,747 --> 01:38:59,898
If Vanessa Williams can pull one off
on the Miss America committee...

1449
01:39:00,147 --> 01:39:03,219
...then her little whoring around
in Atlanta, Georgia...

1450
01:39:03,467 --> 01:39:08,177
...was not going to mean anything to
a little steering committee in Savannah.

1451
01:39:08,707 --> 01:39:10,538
And she got it.
I'm so happy for her.

1452
01:39:12,387 --> 01:39:13,820
Would you watch my purse?

1453
01:39:15,467 --> 01:39:17,583
Phillip and I are going to go
disturb the peace.

1454
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:19,101
What do you think?

1455
01:39:19,347 --> 01:39:21,736
Let's go disturb some peace.
Come on.

1456
01:40:19,867 --> 01:40:21,095
Oh, Jesus!

1457
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:29,064
Would you excuse me for one moment?

1458
01:40:51,747 --> 01:40:54,307
You have a lot of nerve busting in
on me like this.

1459
01:40:54,547 --> 01:40:56,742
I got plenty of nerve
to do anything I want to do.

1460
01:40:56,987 --> 01:40:59,217
- How far are you going to take this?
- I'm just starting.

1461
01:40:59,467 --> 01:41:00,866
Then I'm going to leave.

1462
01:41:01,107 --> 01:41:04,304
I don't intend on insulting these people
any more than I have to.

1463
01:41:07,867 --> 01:41:09,425
Behave yourself.

1464
01:41:20,787 --> 01:41:22,300
Come on. Let's go.

1465
01:41:29,347 --> 01:41:31,622
Stop pushing me. I'm going.

1466
01:41:37,867 --> 01:41:40,142
Bartender, could I please have
two apple schnapps?

1467
01:41:40,387 --> 01:41:42,218
I think you better make those doubles.

1468
01:41:43,827 --> 01:41:46,295
So, John, tell me,
you mad at me, honey?

1469
01:41:46,547 --> 01:41:47,821
Are you mad?

1470
01:41:48,187 --> 01:41:49,063
Are you?

1471
01:41:49,307 --> 01:41:51,821
- We're still friends.
- I hope so. I must tell you something.

1472
01:41:52,067 --> 01:41:54,581
You are so sexy when you're mad.

1473
01:41:54,827 --> 01:41:57,022
- Behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.

1474
01:41:57,667 --> 01:41:59,623
I want to propose a toast.

1475
01:42:00,107 --> 01:42:02,177
From my top...

1476
01:42:02,427 --> 01:42:04,065
...to your bottom...

1477
01:42:04,307 --> 01:42:06,946
...from your bottom to my top...

1478
01:42:07,307 --> 01:42:09,980
...from my middle to your middle...

1479
01:42:10,827 --> 01:42:13,182
...be good, John,
I just might give you a little.

1480
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:16,385
- Just behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.

1481
01:42:16,627 --> 01:42:19,983
Besides,
your star witness is testifying.

1482
01:42:22,667 --> 01:42:23,577
Since when?

1483
01:42:23,827 --> 01:42:25,419
Since I thought about it.

1484
01:42:25,667 --> 01:42:28,386
And I realized how nice
you've been to me.

1485
01:42:28,627 --> 01:42:29,662
You know what?

1486
01:42:29,907 --> 01:42:32,182
You've treated me like a perfect lady.

1487
01:42:32,427 --> 01:42:34,987
You've even made me feel
so very special.

1488
01:42:35,267 --> 01:42:38,304
You know,
people can be so mean sometimes.

1489
01:42:38,547 --> 01:42:40,060
But not you.

1490
01:42:41,267 --> 01:42:42,985
I want to ask you something.

1491
01:42:43,587 --> 01:42:45,703
John, do you think I'm beautiful?

1492
01:42:48,267 --> 01:42:50,462
Yes, I think you're very pretty.

1493
01:42:51,107 --> 01:42:53,541
Pretty? I'm just not your type?

1494
01:42:54,987 --> 01:42:56,659
Are you testifying for me?

1495
01:42:56,907 --> 01:42:59,785
Of course I am. You think I give a shit
about Miss Jim Williams?

1496
01:43:00,027 --> 01:43:02,746
I don't even know that bitch.
Never even met her.

1497
01:43:02,987 --> 01:43:04,102
Listen...

1498
01:43:04,347 --> 01:43:08,704
...on cross-examination they'll be
pretty rough on you and your background.

1499
01:43:08,947 --> 01:43:13,498
I have nothing to hide and I'm
not ashamed of anything I've ever done.

1500
01:43:13,747 --> 01:43:18,104
You should know that you taking the
stand is a blanket indictment of Hanson.

1501
01:43:18,347 --> 01:43:20,463
Let me get this right, now.

1502
01:43:20,707 --> 01:43:24,939
You're saying because Billy hung out
with drag queens, he deserved to die?

1503
01:43:25,187 --> 01:43:27,143
- It's fucked up, but, yeah.
- That's fucked up.

1504
01:43:29,267 --> 01:43:31,178
Maybe you shouldn't testify.

1505
01:43:32,227 --> 01:43:34,900
John, how sweet. You really care.

1506
01:43:35,747 --> 01:43:38,466
Good. Because, guess what?
I'm testifying.

1507
01:43:38,707 --> 01:43:40,220
I am testifying.

1508
01:43:40,467 --> 01:43:43,425
You see, those folks think
they're using the Doll...

1509
01:43:43,667 --> 01:43:45,578
...but the Doll's using them right back.

1510
01:43:45,827 --> 01:43:50,537
I'm going to use that courtroom
as my coming-out party.

1511
01:43:50,787 --> 01:43:52,220
You see, you know who I am.

1512
01:43:52,467 --> 01:43:54,697
I'm the Lady chablis.

1513
01:43:54,947 --> 01:43:56,266
Hear me roar.

1514
01:43:56,507 --> 01:43:57,417
Look out!

1515
01:43:59,027 --> 01:44:01,302
Besides,
I've already bought a new ensemble.

1516
01:44:01,547 --> 01:44:03,981
- Really? Is it nice?
- You'll see, hon.

1517
01:44:04,467 --> 01:44:05,741
Listen to me.

1518
01:44:06,067 --> 01:44:07,659
We must get out of here.

1519
01:44:07,907 --> 01:44:10,865
It's rude of you to bust in on me.
I'd never do that to you.

1520
01:44:11,187 --> 01:44:13,382
Lav ella's mother
is about to have a seizure.

1521
01:44:13,627 --> 01:44:16,346
Somebody put a spoon in her mouth, then,
because I'm not leaving.

1522
01:44:16,587 --> 01:44:17,736
You're leaving now.

1523
01:44:17,987 --> 01:44:19,659
- I am not.
- I'll buy you a drink.

1524
01:44:19,907 --> 01:44:21,056
- Buy me a drink.
- Outside of here.

1525
01:44:21,307 --> 01:44:22,979
- Buy me a diamond.
- I'll buy you a diamond.

1526
01:44:23,227 --> 01:44:25,138
- Give me some.
- I'm not giving you shit.

1527
01:44:25,387 --> 01:44:26,900
Oh, come on!

1528
01:44:27,147 --> 01:44:28,580
You know I'm straight.

1529
01:44:28,827 --> 01:44:29,896
So am I.

1530
01:44:30,147 --> 01:44:32,138
Straight to my house. Let's go.

1531
01:44:38,467 --> 01:44:39,582
Raise your right hand.

1532
01:44:39,827 --> 01:44:44,218
Do you swear the evidence you're about
to give is the truth, so help you God?

1533
01:44:44,467 --> 01:44:45,343
I do.

1534
01:44:47,467 --> 01:44:49,025
Now, Miss De Veau...

1535
01:44:49,547 --> 01:44:53,176
...I'll ask you a question and
I want you to answer to the jury...

1536
01:44:53,427 --> 01:44:56,499
...so that they can understand.

1537
01:44:58,227 --> 01:45:01,139
Yes, and what is that?
You'd like me to explain my "T"?

1538
01:45:01,707 --> 01:45:03,425
Your "T"?

1539
01:45:05,387 --> 01:45:06,706
My "T."

1540
01:45:06,947 --> 01:45:08,778
Yeah, explain your "T"...

1541
01:45:09,027 --> 01:45:13,066
...in as plain a language
as you possibly can for our friends.

1542
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:16,424
I will try my best to explain
to you jurors.

1543
01:45:16,667 --> 01:45:19,784
I could throw words and labels
at all of you...

1544
01:45:20,027 --> 01:45:21,699
...but you seem like nice people.

1545
01:45:22,227 --> 01:45:24,457
So I'm going to be open and honest.

1546
01:45:25,747 --> 01:45:28,545
I have a man's toolbox...

1547
01:45:29,307 --> 01:45:31,423
...but everything else about me
is pure lady.

1548
01:45:32,947 --> 01:45:34,426
I love to dress in women's clothes.

1549
01:45:35,387 --> 01:45:37,343
I love to go shopping.

1550
01:45:37,587 --> 01:45:39,498
I love to have my nails done...

1551
01:45:39,747 --> 01:45:42,181
...and I love men.

1552
01:45:45,507 --> 01:45:47,179
Any questions?

1553
01:45:49,587 --> 01:45:52,101
And, ma'am,
I hope you don't mind my saying...

1554
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:55,379
...blue is definitely not your color.

1555
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:57,419
Okay, gals, you're both pretty, now.

1556
01:45:58,067 --> 01:46:01,457
What I want to know
and want you to tell the jury is...

1557
01:46:01,707 --> 01:46:04,221
...how you and Billy Hanson first met.

1558
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:08,218
Billy hit on me one night at the...
Strike that, Your Honor.

1559
01:46:08,747 --> 01:46:09,975
Billy and I clienteled.

1560
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:11,336
"Clienteled."

1561
01:46:11,587 --> 01:46:13,384
Will you explain what that means?

1562
01:46:13,627 --> 01:46:18,143
We socialized together for a little
while, until he met my roommate Corinne.

1563
01:46:18,387 --> 01:46:20,617
Corinne.
Now, you telling me that...

1564
01:46:20,867 --> 01:46:24,382
...Corinne and Billy Hanson
were intimate?

1565
01:46:25,787 --> 01:46:27,857
Hot and intimate.

1566
01:46:30,147 --> 01:46:31,978
Will you tell the jury...

1567
01:46:32,427 --> 01:46:34,179
...did Billy Hanson use drugs?

1568
01:46:37,907 --> 01:46:41,616
Yes. Billy did pills, smoked pot...

1569
01:46:41,867 --> 01:46:43,141
...little coke.

1570
01:46:43,387 --> 01:46:45,617
He sold drugs.

1571
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:50,583
He'd stay with us sometimes, so
sometimes we had stash around the house.

1572
01:46:52,867 --> 01:46:54,937
- Mrs. Chablis...
- Miss.

1573
01:46:55,347 --> 01:46:57,338
Course, Miss Chablis.

1574
01:46:58,587 --> 01:47:00,339
Do you yourself take drugs?

1575
01:47:02,147 --> 01:47:04,138
I smoke a little pot.

1576
01:47:04,387 --> 01:47:06,298
I'm a mellow kind of girl.

1577
01:47:07,067 --> 01:47:08,136
I understand.

1578
01:47:08,507 --> 01:47:12,500
Well, tell me
if you know what effect, if any...

1579
01:47:12,747 --> 01:47:15,136
...these drugs
had on the relationship...

1580
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:17,742
...between your friend Corinne
and Billy.

1581
01:47:17,987 --> 01:47:22,219
Well, now, when Billy got high,
he could be very, very hostile.

1582
01:47:22,947 --> 01:47:24,346
Hostile, when he was high.

1583
01:47:24,587 --> 01:47:27,385
Would you explain to the jury
what you mean by hostile?

1584
01:47:27,627 --> 01:47:30,858
I can do more than that, hon.
Let me show you something.

1585
01:47:31,107 --> 01:47:33,143
Look at my driver's license.

1586
01:47:33,387 --> 01:47:35,662
- Just a minute.
- Objection.

1587
01:47:35,987 --> 01:47:36,942
This isn't proper.

1588
01:47:37,187 --> 01:47:38,256
Be quiet.

1589
01:47:38,507 --> 01:47:39,542
I'll handle this.

1590
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:40,663
Just a minute.

1591
01:47:40,907 --> 01:47:42,579
That's not proper procedure.

1592
01:47:44,427 --> 01:47:45,985
Pick up this item, please.

1593
01:47:46,947 --> 01:47:50,906
My eye. He hit me. I looked like
that dog from <i>The Little Rascals.</i>

1594
01:47:51,147 --> 01:47:54,822
Members of the jury, I'm instructing you
to disregard this outburst.

1595
01:47:55,067 --> 01:47:57,137
Pay no attention to that picture.

1596
01:47:58,427 --> 01:48:00,702
Your Honor? It's the truth.
I'm not lying.

1597
01:48:00,947 --> 01:48:02,858
Your Honor, the people...

1598
01:48:03,187 --> 01:48:04,222
Be quiet.

1599
01:48:04,467 --> 01:48:07,220
Now we got to get this thing
under control.

1600
01:48:07,467 --> 01:48:09,025
You sit down, Mr. De Veau.

1601
01:48:09,267 --> 01:48:11,417
Miss De v eau. I'm a single girl.

1602
01:48:11,787 --> 01:48:13,459
Miss De Veau, whatever.

1603
01:48:13,707 --> 01:48:14,662
Have a seat.

1604
01:48:15,427 --> 01:48:18,021
Okay, but please don't get too huffy.

1605
01:48:18,427 --> 01:48:20,019
You listen to me.

1606
01:48:21,227 --> 01:48:23,661
I'm in charge of this courtroom,
not you.

1607
01:48:23,907 --> 01:48:25,226
Here's the way it works:

1608
01:48:25,467 --> 01:48:28,345
These lawyers
are going to ask you questions...

1609
01:48:28,587 --> 01:48:29,986
...and you answer them.

1610
01:48:30,427 --> 01:48:32,338
If I tell you to stop, you stop.

1611
01:48:33,267 --> 01:48:35,258
If I tell you to sit, you sit.

1612
01:48:35,507 --> 01:48:38,863
And I don't want you to communicate
directly with that jury.

1613
01:48:39,107 --> 01:48:40,506
Don't produce any more items.

1614
01:48:41,027 --> 01:48:44,144
Don't show any photographs.
Do you understand that?

1615
01:48:45,707 --> 01:48:47,902
Yes, Your Honor.
I understand.

1616
01:48:52,427 --> 01:48:54,861
Mrs. Wright threw in some gumbo.

1617
01:48:55,987 --> 01:48:57,306
I got you cigarettes.

1618
01:48:58,667 --> 01:49:02,785
Thank you. How are we coming
with our character witnesses?

1619
01:49:03,027 --> 01:49:07,703
I thought we would limit it to 3 because
we don't need too much fawning and...

1620
01:49:08,347 --> 01:49:09,541
Why not?

1621
01:49:09,787 --> 01:49:12,221
Tell him how many friends
are lining up to defend me.

1622
01:49:12,467 --> 01:49:15,539
I suggest Wanda Javitz.
She has a commanding vocal presence.

1623
01:49:15,787 --> 01:49:17,937
She declined, Jim...

1624
01:49:18,187 --> 01:49:19,461
...along with some others.

1625
01:49:20,827 --> 01:49:21,976
Declined?

1626
01:49:27,267 --> 01:49:29,178
They clamored for my friendship.

1627
01:49:29,427 --> 01:49:32,624
Hoping and praying
for invitations to my parties.

1628
01:49:33,587 --> 01:49:35,498
Where were their judgments then?

1629
01:49:37,147 --> 01:49:40,742
I hope Wanda knows this puts her
in the out box for my Christmas party.

1630
01:49:42,067 --> 01:49:45,139
I don't think we have to worry
about character witnesses.

1631
01:49:45,387 --> 01:49:46,661
They got theirs, we got ours.

1632
01:49:47,627 --> 01:49:49,060
When do I take the stand?

1633
01:49:49,747 --> 01:49:50,702
Last.

1634
01:49:51,107 --> 01:49:52,096
Good.

1635
01:49:52,347 --> 01:49:55,737
They'll have heard all the theories.
We'll finish with the truth.

1636
01:49:55,987 --> 01:49:57,136
I look forward to this.

1637
01:49:57,387 --> 01:50:01,824
It's important, not that I'm acquitted,
but that everyone knows I'm innocent.

1638
01:50:03,547 --> 01:50:06,220
I refuse to live in a world
where whispers become fact.

1639
01:50:06,467 --> 01:50:09,345
Guilty men murmur.
The innocent shout to the rafters.

1640
01:50:09,587 --> 01:50:10,861
Hear, hear.

1641
01:50:11,907 --> 01:50:16,378
We may need you to come clean
about the relationship with Billy.

1642
01:50:18,267 --> 01:50:19,700
Your sexuality, Jim.

1643
01:50:20,467 --> 01:50:23,777
Finley's taken this thing in a direction
we didn't count on.

1644
01:50:24,027 --> 01:50:26,222
His own private witch-hunt.

1645
01:50:28,227 --> 01:50:30,104
It's going to destroy Mother.

1646
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:33,386
Jim, she was in court.

1647
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:34,980
She heard George Tucker.

1648
01:50:35,467 --> 01:50:37,503
Face it, she already knows.

1649
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:40,178
Not from me she doesn't.

1650
01:50:47,027 --> 01:50:48,938
What if she wasn't in court?

1651
01:50:59,627 --> 01:51:01,618
What's the matter?
Gunpowder?

1652
01:51:04,387 --> 01:51:06,423
Damn gunshot residue test.

1653
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:10,057
Your expert witness covered it.
He said the tests are unreliable.

1654
01:51:10,307 --> 01:51:12,104
Jury thinks that's a cop-out.

1655
01:51:12,587 --> 01:51:14,862
Every one of them knows Doc Poe.

1656
01:51:15,787 --> 01:51:18,859
Why listen to some egghead
from up north? No offense.

1657
01:51:19,107 --> 01:51:20,222
No, none taken.

1658
01:51:21,067 --> 01:51:24,662
He said gunpowder wipes off.
Maybe when they handled the body...

1659
01:51:24,907 --> 01:51:26,863
Boone says he bagged them.

1660
01:51:27,627 --> 01:51:31,302
Doc Poe says they were bagged
when he performed the autopsy.

1661
01:51:31,947 --> 01:51:34,142
When are they going to get wiped off?

1662
01:51:35,547 --> 01:51:36,741
I don't know.

1663
01:51:40,747 --> 01:51:44,501
Do you remember when you told me
that dead men tell no tales?

1664
01:51:46,187 --> 01:51:47,302
See, I think...

1665
01:51:47,547 --> 01:51:51,301
...that may be true,
but it does not apply here.

1666
01:51:51,907 --> 01:51:53,545
I mean, look around.

1667
01:51:54,867 --> 01:51:58,064
Every picture on every wall in this town
is of someone who's gone.

1668
01:51:58,307 --> 01:52:01,458
Every story you hear begins
with someone who's dead.

1669
01:52:02,347 --> 01:52:06,659
The only living national treasure
you have is your own slavering mutt.

1670
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:11,460
You writing your book?
What the hell are you talking about?

1671
01:52:11,707 --> 01:52:14,460
Billy Hanson may not be talking,
but his hands are.

1672
01:52:14,947 --> 01:52:16,824
Billy Hanson's hands?

1673
01:52:19,947 --> 01:52:21,221
I got to go.

1674
01:52:23,507 --> 01:52:24,781
Where you going?

1675
01:52:28,067 --> 01:52:29,898
"To understand the living...

1676
01:52:30,347 --> 01:52:32,781
...you got to commune with the dead.

1677
01:52:33,387 --> 01:52:34,661
I need Shango.

1678
01:52:37,387 --> 01:52:38,536
Now go.

1679
01:52:38,787 --> 01:52:40,937
And don't you dare look back."

1680
01:52:42,427 --> 01:52:45,305
I hope you can communicate
with someone.

1681
01:52:51,147 --> 01:52:53,138
Feel like going for a walk?

1682
01:52:54,947 --> 01:52:56,300
Where you headed?

1683
01:52:57,307 --> 01:53:00,538
I don't know, I was thinking about
maybe stopping by the morgue.

1684
01:53:01,347 --> 01:53:03,065
Are you a necrophiliac or something?

1685
01:53:03,307 --> 01:53:05,423
We agreed you wouldn't talk
about my ex-wife.

1686
01:53:05,707 --> 01:53:08,540
- How long you been at the bar?
- Long enough. It'll be fun.

1687
01:53:08,787 --> 01:53:10,186
Why do you want to go?

1688
01:53:10,427 --> 01:53:13,260
If I could answer that question,
I wouldn't have to go.

1689
01:53:13,507 --> 01:53:17,341
The morgue's closed, and by tomorrow
this won't seem like such a good idea.

1690
01:53:17,587 --> 01:53:22,297
Precisely. I'll break in if I have to.
I don't care. I'll pretend I'm dead.

1691
01:53:23,067 --> 01:53:25,581
- You sure you want to do this?
- I think so.

1692
01:53:26,507 --> 01:53:28,816
There is a back way...

1693
01:53:29,067 --> 01:53:31,786
...a hallway off the emergency room.
It's off-limits.

1694
01:53:32,027 --> 01:53:34,302
- How do you know that?
- I candy-striped one summer.

1695
01:53:34,547 --> 01:53:35,946
At the morgue?

1696
01:53:36,307 --> 01:53:38,502
- We'll create a distraction...
- We?

1697
01:53:38,747 --> 01:53:42,706
You create the distraction
and I'll just slip in and check it out.

1698
01:53:44,347 --> 01:53:46,019
No, you'll get lost.

1699
01:53:46,627 --> 01:53:49,187
All right, it's a 3-man job.
Where's Joe?

1700
01:53:49,427 --> 01:53:52,544
Perfect casting, but he's out of town
till tomorrow.

1701
01:53:54,187 --> 01:53:56,337
Who do we know
who can cause a commotion?

1702
01:54:03,947 --> 01:54:05,221
Hello! Nurse!

1703
01:54:09,307 --> 01:54:10,786
- What's wrong with her?
- Her stomach.

1704
01:54:11,027 --> 01:54:12,619
Appendicitis.
My water broke.

1705
01:54:12,867 --> 01:54:15,825
Get the doctor to exam 4.
Water broke? She's pregnant.

1706
01:54:16,067 --> 01:54:18,058
I don't know what's up. Just help.

1707
01:54:18,307 --> 01:54:20,423
- What's wrong?
- A stomach problem.

1708
01:54:20,667 --> 01:54:22,339
Let's get her up on the table.

1709
01:54:29,147 --> 01:54:30,421
Okay, here we are.

1710
01:54:30,667 --> 01:54:32,225
Commune away.

1711
01:54:32,467 --> 01:54:33,661
Is this where it hurts?

1712
01:54:33,907 --> 01:54:35,386
Just...
Oh, doctor, wait.

1713
01:54:36,187 --> 01:54:37,063
Here?

1714
01:54:37,307 --> 01:54:40,026
You know, I think you need to go
just a little bit lower.

1715
01:54:40,867 --> 01:54:41,936
Never been in a morgue.

1716
01:54:42,187 --> 01:54:43,620
What are we looking for?

1717
01:54:45,627 --> 01:54:48,983
I don't know. Something about
the bagging of the hands.

1718
01:54:49,467 --> 01:54:51,537
Oh, look. Teddy Lipscomb.

1719
01:54:52,347 --> 01:54:53,462
Excuse me?

1720
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:57,104
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, he was my dad's dentist.

1721
01:54:57,827 --> 01:54:59,465
Oh, man!

1722
01:55:01,107 --> 01:55:01,983
Cardiac arrest.

1723
01:55:02,227 --> 01:55:06,618
Right. Medical term for dying in the
arms of a 25-year-old cocktail waitress.

1724
01:55:06,867 --> 01:55:07,617
Poor guy.

1725
01:55:09,707 --> 01:55:12,938
See, now, remind me
never to get sick in Savannah.

1726
01:55:13,187 --> 01:55:15,098
He's wearing a hospital I.D. Bracelet.

1727
01:55:15,347 --> 01:55:18,145
You're supposed to get well
in hospitals, but not in this city.

1728
01:55:18,467 --> 01:55:22,745
The morgue doesn't have its own ramp,
so all DOA's come through emergency.

1729
01:55:22,987 --> 01:55:25,217
Technically, they'd have to be admitted.

1730
01:55:27,827 --> 01:55:29,146
They're all wearing bracelets.

1731
01:55:29,387 --> 01:55:32,345
It's bureaucratic red tape.
I told you, I candy-striped.

1732
01:55:32,587 --> 01:55:34,498
You did.
That's like volunteer work?

1733
01:55:34,747 --> 01:55:37,022
Yeah, cute little striped outfit,
short skirt.

1734
01:55:37,267 --> 01:55:38,336
Girl Scouts.

1735
01:55:39,067 --> 01:55:40,739
- Is this where it hurts?
- Almost.

1736
01:55:40,987 --> 01:55:43,103
Just a tad bit...

1737
01:55:43,347 --> 01:55:45,907
That's the spot.
I love you.

1738
01:55:46,187 --> 01:55:49,384
I love you.
Oh, Dr. Feelgood, that's the spot.

1739
01:55:49,627 --> 01:55:50,821
You got it.

1740
01:55:56,147 --> 01:56:00,186
You wouldn't take a bag off
to put an I.D. Bracelet on, would you?

1741
01:56:01,027 --> 01:56:02,346
Yeah, probably.

1742
01:56:02,587 --> 01:56:03,542
Maybe.

1743
01:56:07,987 --> 01:56:10,740
Pleasure's been all mine, Doctor.

1744
01:56:11,227 --> 01:56:12,262
How you doing, Mom?

1745
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:14,782
Nurse, I have a question for you.

1746
01:56:15,027 --> 01:56:17,780
Were you on duty the night
Billy Hanson's body came in?

1747
01:56:18,027 --> 01:56:19,699
I was.
How'd you get back there?

1748
01:56:19,947 --> 01:56:22,507
Back door.
I was here with the sick lady?

1749
01:56:22,747 --> 01:56:25,659
I have a question.
Hanson's hands were bagged.

1750
01:56:25,907 --> 01:56:27,545
Someone had to put the I.D. Bracelet on.

1751
01:56:27,787 --> 01:56:30,585
Would you take the bag off
to slide the bracelet on?

1752
01:56:30,827 --> 01:56:32,658
No, they snap on.

1753
01:56:33,627 --> 01:56:34,946
They snap on?

1754
01:56:36,747 --> 01:56:37,657
Thank you.

1755
01:56:37,907 --> 01:56:40,660
It was easier with him
because I bagged him after.

1756
01:56:43,707 --> 01:56:44,822
Excuse me?

1757
01:56:45,387 --> 01:56:49,858
Doc Poe called from the crime scene and
said to bag the hands when he came in.

1758
01:56:51,907 --> 01:56:53,260
You bagged the hands?

1759
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:56,221
Yes, I wrote it up
on the admission sheet.

1760
01:56:56,467 --> 01:56:57,616
May I see that?

1761
01:57:00,427 --> 01:57:02,577
We'll let Sonny tell you.
He'll be here any minute.

1762
01:57:02,827 --> 01:57:06,342
Before Sonny gets here,
I'd like to run something by you.

1763
01:57:06,587 --> 01:57:08,737
- Fire away.
- About that night.

1764
01:57:16,227 --> 01:57:17,580
What do you got?

1765
01:57:19,347 --> 01:57:21,907
The evening started out
as I've always said.

1766
01:57:23,027 --> 01:57:24,096
<i>The argument...</i>

1767
01:57:24,507 --> 01:57:25,622
<i>... the shouting...</i>

1768
01:57:29,227 --> 01:57:31,218
You let me down, like everyone else.

1769
01:57:32,067 --> 01:57:35,662
My mama let me down. She hates me
because I look like my daddy.

1770
01:57:35,907 --> 01:57:38,341
- What are you yelling about?
- I'm yelling about you!

1771
01:57:38,587 --> 01:57:42,705
It's fine for you to talk to me
about living in this grandeur and all.

1772
01:57:42,947 --> 01:57:44,938
You could do it
if you took responsibility.

1773
01:57:45,187 --> 01:57:46,700
Bullshit, Jim!

1774
01:57:46,947 --> 01:57:49,984
If you don't like it,
why don't you just get the hell out?!

1775
01:57:50,267 --> 01:57:51,620
Get the hell out.

1776
01:57:51,867 --> 01:57:54,586
This candle is about ready
to go through that painting!

1777
01:57:54,827 --> 01:57:58,615
I'll stop paying the insurance
on your Camaro.

1778
01:57:58,867 --> 01:58:02,542
You want to leave,
you can do it tomorrow morning.

1779
01:58:05,387 --> 01:58:06,820
<i>The damaged clock...</i>

1780
01:58:17,867 --> 01:58:19,016
Goddamn it.

1781
01:58:19,267 --> 01:58:22,418
Walk into my house
and ruin my furniture. I've had it.

1782
01:58:22,667 --> 01:58:25,261
You're going to jail, young man.
That's it.

1783
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:28,419
<i>Billy pointing the Luger...</i>

1784
01:58:28,667 --> 01:58:30,146
I may be leaving tomorrow...

1785
01:58:31,027 --> 01:58:32,142
...but goddamn it...

1786
01:58:32,507 --> 01:58:35,305
<i>But here's the difference:</i>
<i>When he pulled the trigger...</i>

1787
01:58:35,547 --> 01:58:36,423
...you're leaving tonight.

1788
01:58:37,387 --> 01:58:38,422
<i>... nothing happened.</i>

1789
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:40,783
<i>The gun was on safety.</i>

1790
01:58:41,027 --> 01:58:44,178
<i>As he fumbled to take the safety off,</i>
<i>I grabbed my own gun...</i>

1791
01:58:49,987 --> 01:58:51,215
<i>... and I shot him.</i>

1792
01:59:07,147 --> 01:59:08,421
He fell dead.

1793
01:59:13,707 --> 01:59:15,538
He never fired?

1794
01:59:17,187 --> 01:59:18,142
No.

1795
01:59:19,307 --> 01:59:21,775
<i>I thought, "What have you done?!"</i>

1796
01:59:51,627 --> 01:59:53,265
It explains...

1797
01:59:53,507 --> 01:59:56,544
...why there's no powder
on Billy's hands.

1798
01:59:56,787 --> 02:00:00,223
When I sit on that stand
and I tell this to the jury...

1799
02:00:00,467 --> 02:00:01,946
...Largent's case...

1800
02:00:02,187 --> 02:00:03,905
...will crumble.

1801
02:00:11,027 --> 02:00:12,904
I don't see how you figure that.

1802
02:00:14,827 --> 02:00:16,579
If you tell that story...

1803
02:00:17,107 --> 02:00:18,426
...you're admitting...

1804
02:00:18,667 --> 02:00:19,895
...that you lied.

1805
02:00:22,227 --> 02:00:23,376
Lied to everyone.

1806
02:00:23,627 --> 02:00:24,946
The police...

1807
02:00:25,307 --> 02:00:26,660
...the press...

1808
02:00:28,347 --> 02:00:29,621
...everyone.

1809
02:00:32,587 --> 02:00:33,656
Yes.

1810
02:00:35,307 --> 02:00:36,660
Of course.

1811
02:00:38,827 --> 02:00:43,218
I'd rather be convicted of lying
than of murder.

1812
02:00:45,227 --> 02:00:46,182
So...

1813
02:00:47,187 --> 02:00:48,256
Hey, coach.

1814
02:00:48,507 --> 02:00:49,656
We got it.

1815
02:00:51,107 --> 02:00:52,096
Keep your seat.

1816
02:00:52,827 --> 02:00:54,818
Sonny, I need to tell you something.

1817
02:00:55,307 --> 02:00:58,583
Now, me first.
You know that gunshot residue test?

1818
02:00:58,827 --> 02:01:01,580
What I have to say has direct bearing
on the gunshot residue...

1819
02:01:01,827 --> 02:01:03,101
Can I get this out?

1820
02:01:06,747 --> 02:01:08,465
We got them by the gonads.

1821
02:01:08,707 --> 02:01:10,584
Detective Boone lied.

1822
02:01:11,627 --> 02:01:15,984
Doc Poe called the admitting nurse
and told her to bag the hands...

1823
02:01:16,227 --> 02:01:17,979
...if they were not already.

1824
02:01:18,227 --> 02:01:19,785
Which she did.

1825
02:01:20,067 --> 02:01:21,466
Right here in this document.

1826
02:01:27,147 --> 02:01:31,504
Many could have handled the body
between the crime scene and the hospital.

1827
02:01:32,227 --> 02:01:34,536
Which explains how the powder
got rubbed off.

1828
02:01:35,267 --> 02:01:36,416
There it is.

1829
02:01:37,307 --> 02:01:41,983
The death knell to Finley Largent's
precious gunshot residue test.

1830
02:01:45,467 --> 02:01:46,502
Your turn.

1831
02:01:47,387 --> 02:01:48,422
What was it?

1832
02:01:52,667 --> 02:01:54,259
Oh, it's not important.

1833
02:02:01,067 --> 02:02:02,341
Take a look here.

1834
02:02:03,387 --> 02:02:05,298
We got them, Jimbo.

1835
02:02:13,747 --> 02:02:15,339
Going somewhere, coach?

1836
02:02:23,667 --> 02:02:25,146
What's his story?

1837
02:02:45,427 --> 02:02:47,224
You're still under oath.

1838
02:02:47,947 --> 02:02:48,857
Frank...

1839
02:02:50,027 --> 02:02:52,302
...are you absolutely sure...

1840
02:02:52,547 --> 02:02:55,857
...that you bagged Billy Hanson's hands
at Mercer House?

1841
02:02:56,107 --> 02:02:57,222
Yes.

1842
02:03:00,787 --> 02:03:02,857
I have no further questions.

1843
02:03:03,427 --> 02:03:05,338
Redirect, Mr. Largent?

1844
02:03:09,667 --> 02:03:10,702
No, Your Honor.

1845
02:03:11,507 --> 02:03:16,058
Detective, you're excused. You're still
under subpoena. Thank you very much.

1846
02:03:16,547 --> 02:03:19,107
Defense calls Sara Warren...

1847
02:03:19,347 --> 02:03:20,462
...R.N.

1848
02:03:25,547 --> 02:03:27,299
You won't find her in your notes.

1849
02:03:27,547 --> 02:03:29,378
She's not on your list, Finley.

1850
02:03:29,627 --> 02:03:33,745
Sara Warren is a direct rebuttal
to the testimony of Detective Boone.

1851
02:03:34,667 --> 02:03:36,862
She is, in fact, an admitting nurse...

1852
02:03:37,107 --> 02:03:38,699
...at Chandler Emergency Room.

1853
02:03:59,267 --> 02:04:03,738
<i>Mr. Williams, will you describe</i>
<i>your relationship with the deceased?</i>

1854
02:04:05,987 --> 02:04:10,139
I met Billy Hanson when he came around
to the house wanting a job.

1855
02:04:11,067 --> 02:04:11,977
So...

1856
02:04:12,227 --> 02:04:14,695
...I hired him in the workshop
to refinish furniture.

1857
02:04:14,947 --> 02:04:17,461
He had some talent,
and I wanted to encourage him.

1858
02:04:17,987 --> 02:04:19,261
During this time...

1859
02:04:19,507 --> 02:04:23,295
...I developed hypoglycemia. I
blacked-out at times. I don't eat well.

1860
02:04:23,547 --> 02:04:25,219
The doctor told me...

1861
02:04:25,467 --> 02:04:28,857
...it was not good for me to be alone
when this condition occurs.

1862
02:04:29,107 --> 02:04:30,904
So Billy would stay over...

1863
02:04:31,147 --> 02:04:32,899
...and take care of me
when I wasn't well.

1864
02:04:33,147 --> 02:04:36,344
He did not live at Mercer House,
as has been stated.

1865
02:04:39,387 --> 02:04:44,177
Is that the full extent of your
relationship with Billy Hanson?

1866
02:04:46,147 --> 02:04:50,425
No. Over time, it evolved
into something less formal.

1867
02:04:51,347 --> 02:04:52,496
We became intimate.

1868
02:04:53,187 --> 02:04:55,018
Billy could be very charming.

1869
02:04:55,267 --> 02:04:57,622
He had his girlfriends and I had mine.

1870
02:04:58,107 --> 02:04:59,096
But to me...

1871
02:04:59,347 --> 02:05:01,702
...sex is a perfectly natural thing.

1872
02:05:02,027 --> 02:05:03,983
It didn't bother me.
It didn't bother him.

1873
02:05:04,547 --> 02:05:09,063
It was just an occasional natural
occurrence between consenting adults.

1874
02:05:14,747 --> 02:05:16,658
Would you describe to the jury...

1875
02:05:16,907 --> 02:05:19,660
...the events
that occurred in your house...

1876
02:05:19,907 --> 02:05:21,181
...after the party?

1877
02:05:23,387 --> 02:05:26,265
By the time Billy got back to the house
he was quite high...

1878
02:05:26,507 --> 02:05:29,340
...and we got into an argument
about a planned trip to London.

1879
02:05:29,747 --> 02:05:33,501
I was going to an auction, and Billy was
to accompany me because of my condition.

1880
02:05:34,987 --> 02:05:37,342
But he insisted on taking
marijuana cigarettes.

1881
02:05:37,587 --> 02:05:41,057
I do not approve of drugs
and I told him he could not go.

1882
02:05:41,307 --> 02:05:44,185
He became verbally abusive
and I ordered Billy out of the house.

1883
02:05:44,427 --> 02:05:45,780
He went into the hallway.

1884
02:05:46,027 --> 02:05:49,861
The argument continued there.
Then he knocked over a clock.

1885
02:05:51,027 --> 02:05:54,383
I went to call the police.
He followed me with a gun.

1886
02:05:54,627 --> 02:05:55,742
<i>He said...</i>

1887
02:05:57,267 --> 02:05:59,178
...and I'll never forget this:

1888
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:00,826
<i>"I might leave tomorrow...</i>

1889
02:06:01,067 --> 02:06:03,535
...but goddamn it,
you're leaving tonight."

1890
02:06:05,987 --> 02:06:07,056
I saw that Luger...

1891
02:06:07,307 --> 02:06:08,103
<i>... and moved.</i>

1892
02:06:08,347 --> 02:06:10,463
I reached in a drawer
for my own weapon.

1893
02:06:10,707 --> 02:06:12,459
As I came up,
the first shot...

1894
02:06:13,027 --> 02:06:14,585
<i>... I felt breeze by my shoulder.</i>

1895
02:06:19,027 --> 02:06:20,016
And I fired.

1896
02:06:23,507 --> 02:06:25,020
I don't remember how many times.

1897
02:06:27,707 --> 02:06:29,186
<i>It was horrible.</i>

1898
02:06:53,787 --> 02:06:55,664
<i>We're all Savannahians.</i>

1899
02:06:55,907 --> 02:06:59,058
<i>Our paths cross from time to time.</i>

1900
02:06:59,547 --> 02:07:00,980
<i>We greet each other.</i>

1901
02:07:01,427 --> 02:07:03,497
<i>Smile here, nod there.</i>

1902
02:07:04,467 --> 02:07:06,423
<i>But even if we don 't know each other...</i>

1903
02:07:07,187 --> 02:07:08,939
<i>... we have one thing in common.</i>

1904
02:07:10,147 --> 02:07:12,980
<i>This beautiful place where we all live.</i>

1905
02:07:14,067 --> 02:07:15,739
<i>And as one Savannahian...</i>

1906
02:07:15,987 --> 02:07:17,136
<i>... to 12...</i>

1907
02:07:17,987 --> 02:07:21,423
<i>... I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>for your civic pride...</i>

1908
02:07:21,787 --> 02:07:23,220
<i>... for your diligence...</i>

1909
02:07:23,667 --> 02:07:25,464
<i>... and here in this courtroom...</i>

1910
02:07:25,947 --> 02:07:27,505
<i>... for your rapt attention.</i>

1911
02:07:27,747 --> 02:07:29,783
I've watched you taking notes.

1912
02:07:30,947 --> 02:07:33,905
The prosecution
started this whole thing...

1913
02:07:34,147 --> 02:07:36,615
...quoting someone
by the name of Hobbes.

1914
02:07:36,867 --> 02:07:38,300
I don't know who that is...

1915
02:07:39,547 --> 02:07:40,343
...but...

1916
02:07:40,627 --> 02:07:43,221
...I do know who Perry Mason is.

1917
02:07:43,907 --> 02:07:44,976
You watch <i>Perry Mason?</i>

1918
02:07:46,267 --> 02:07:47,256
I do.

1919
02:07:48,187 --> 02:07:49,540
And I got to thinking...

1920
02:07:49,787 --> 02:07:51,698
...if some TV writer...

1921
02:07:52,227 --> 02:07:54,218
...was to come to Perry Mason
and say...

1922
02:07:54,467 --> 02:07:58,301
..."Here you are, Mr. Raymond Burr,
here's a story like this."

1923
02:07:58,547 --> 02:08:00,219
You know what I think he'd say?

1924
02:08:00,467 --> 02:08:02,219
I think old Raymond would say...

1925
02:08:02,387 --> 02:08:04,855
"That's not a very good story.

1926
02:08:05,107 --> 02:08:07,621
I wouldn't have to be
a very good lawyer...

1927
02:08:07,867 --> 02:08:10,062
...to get that man off,
now would I?"

1928
02:08:10,907 --> 02:08:12,056
He'd be right!

1929
02:08:14,067 --> 02:08:15,056
Because...

1930
02:08:15,347 --> 02:08:19,181
...by all the evidence,
Jim Williams is an innocent man.

1931
02:08:20,947 --> 02:08:22,539
But I'm not Perry Mason.

1932
02:08:23,987 --> 02:08:25,943
I'm not some Tv lawyer.

1933
02:08:27,147 --> 02:08:31,857
So I got to scratch and tear
at the prosecution's case...

1934
02:08:32,627 --> 02:08:35,460
...trying to whittle it down to nothing.

1935
02:08:36,107 --> 02:08:38,257
And darned if I don't think I have!

1936
02:08:40,107 --> 02:08:44,737
Because the fabrication
of the prosecution's case is in pieces.

1937
02:08:45,027 --> 02:08:47,700
When you consider
how Detective Boone...

1938
02:08:47,947 --> 02:08:52,179
...has consistently lied
about bagging the hands.

1939
02:08:55,747 --> 02:08:57,305
Does that surprise you...

1940
02:08:58,307 --> 02:09:00,059
...that a detective would lie?

1941
02:09:01,507 --> 02:09:03,145
Of course he will.

1942
02:09:03,747 --> 02:09:05,260
He's not a bad man.

1943
02:09:05,507 --> 02:09:07,782
But how else will he play the cards...

1944
02:09:08,067 --> 02:09:10,706
...that have been dealt to him
from a pack of lies?

1945
02:09:13,227 --> 02:09:14,501
If Jim Williams...

1946
02:09:15,187 --> 02:09:16,905
...is guilty of anything...

1947
02:09:17,947 --> 02:09:20,142
...he's guilty of bad association.

1948
02:09:21,547 --> 02:09:23,936
But that's not why he's on trial for.

1949
02:09:24,947 --> 02:09:26,619
If you don't like...

1950
02:09:26,867 --> 02:09:30,337
...or if you don't cotton
to his lifestyle...

1951
02:09:30,867 --> 02:09:32,459
...just think about this:

1952
02:09:33,067 --> 02:09:35,058
We deal with these people all the time.

1953
02:09:35,387 --> 02:09:36,422
Some good...

1954
02:09:36,667 --> 02:09:37,941
...some bad.

1955
02:09:39,467 --> 02:09:41,105
They're a part of our community.

1956
02:09:42,867 --> 02:09:44,983
You can't judge a man for that.

1957
02:09:45,907 --> 02:09:47,306
This is God's world.

1958
02:09:48,267 --> 02:09:50,178
Let God be the judge of that.

1959
02:09:51,827 --> 02:09:53,306
And let you good folks...

1960
02:09:54,347 --> 02:09:55,939
...be the judge of this.

1961
02:09:58,547 --> 02:09:59,821
Come on, now.

1962
02:10:02,907 --> 02:10:04,625
You let this man go home.

1963
02:10:08,827 --> 02:10:10,055
He's had enough.

1964
02:10:16,587 --> 02:10:17,702
Thank you.

1965
02:10:54,427 --> 02:10:57,737
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

1966
02:10:58,507 --> 02:11:00,020
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1967
02:11:00,747 --> 02:11:01,975
Is it unanimous?

1968
02:11:03,067 --> 02:11:04,136
Yes!

1969
02:11:08,547 --> 02:11:10,185
Hand it to the sheriff, please.

1970
02:11:22,827 --> 02:11:24,306
Pick that up.

1971
02:11:28,627 --> 02:11:29,980
Hand it to me.

1972
02:11:38,187 --> 02:11:39,745
Give it back to him.

1973
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:53,227
Defendant and attorneys,
rise, please.

1974
02:11:56,667 --> 02:11:58,259
Publish the verdict.

1975
02:12:00,747 --> 02:12:03,386
"We, the jury,
find the defendant...

1976
02:12:04,747 --> 02:12:05,782
...not guilty."

1977
02:12:14,947 --> 02:12:17,780
Members of the jury,
this concludes your work.

1978
02:12:18,027 --> 02:12:21,986
You've rendered great service
to Savannah and Chatham County.

1979
02:12:22,267 --> 02:12:25,100
I'm going to dismiss you now
with the thanks of the court.

1980
02:12:38,747 --> 02:12:39,975
Congratulations, Jim.

1981
02:12:40,227 --> 02:12:41,376
Thank you, John.

1982
02:13:12,387 --> 02:13:13,706
Hey, boy!

1983
02:13:18,667 --> 02:13:20,066
What do you got?

1984
02:13:21,027 --> 02:13:22,426
Come on down.

1985
02:13:23,467 --> 02:13:25,537
We gots to go visit the boy.

1986
02:13:28,987 --> 02:13:31,547
We got to make him
quit working James.

1987
02:13:32,267 --> 02:13:34,144
Trial's over, Minerva.

1988
02:13:34,827 --> 02:13:37,022
Billy can't do anything to James now.

1989
02:13:38,067 --> 02:13:39,659
Why I come to you?

1990
02:13:40,467 --> 02:13:42,025
Because you...

1991
02:13:42,267 --> 02:13:44,781
...out of everybody,
know it ain't over yet.

1992
02:13:46,427 --> 02:13:51,455
I know, the boy know, and you know
justice ain't been done yet.

1993
02:13:57,507 --> 02:13:59,145
I'll come down for a minute.

1994
02:14:02,187 --> 02:14:03,700
I don't know about this.

1995
02:14:03,947 --> 02:14:06,780
That's exactly why you come this far.

1996
02:14:33,267 --> 02:14:36,100
Billy always loved Wild Turkey.

1997
02:14:36,947 --> 02:14:38,619
He ain't happy here.

1998
02:14:41,587 --> 02:14:43,418
Ain't what he thought it would be.

1999
02:14:46,107 --> 02:14:49,417
If you ain't in heaven yet, you want
to get there, don't you, boy?

2000
02:14:52,107 --> 02:14:55,179
The only way you're going to get up...

2001
02:14:55,427 --> 02:14:57,895
...is if you quit playing with James.

2002
02:15:10,467 --> 02:15:12,901
I has influence with the dead.

2003
02:15:13,147 --> 02:15:14,978
They can lift you up.

2004
02:15:15,227 --> 02:15:18,344
Nobody else can do that for you.
Nobody!

2005
02:15:26,787 --> 02:15:28,539
Don't you laugh at me!

2006
02:15:29,227 --> 02:15:31,502
You think you had a harsh life?

2007
02:15:31,747 --> 02:15:33,817
You got no idea.

2008
02:15:37,827 --> 02:15:40,387
Never had no bills to pay...

2009
02:15:40,707 --> 02:15:43,744
...no children to feed,
no house to clean.

2010
02:15:45,147 --> 02:15:47,138
You had it easy.

2011
02:15:49,467 --> 02:15:51,822
You can just lay there.

2012
02:16:24,307 --> 02:16:25,456
Where's Jim?

2013
02:16:42,227 --> 02:16:43,979
Thanks for dropping by.

2014
02:16:47,347 --> 02:16:51,022
I've finished my christmas party list...

2015
02:16:53,387 --> 02:16:54,297
...and you made the cut.

2016
02:16:54,547 --> 02:16:56,936
I'm honored,
but I won't be here.

2017
02:16:57,387 --> 02:16:59,457
Many will be disappointed.

2018
02:17:00,587 --> 02:17:03,021
So, obviously,
you've decided to stay in town.

2019
02:17:04,747 --> 02:17:07,625
Living here pisses off
all the right people.

2020
02:17:09,387 --> 02:17:12,504
- What can I do for you?
- I have something for you.

2021
02:17:12,747 --> 02:17:15,580
Yussopov's dagger may have seemed...

2022
02:17:15,827 --> 02:17:17,977
...more useful,
given your profession...

2023
02:17:18,227 --> 02:17:20,787
...but the painting
somehow seemed appropriate.

2024
02:17:21,027 --> 02:17:23,063
I hope you will accept it...

2025
02:17:23,307 --> 02:17:25,218
...as an expression of my gratitude.

2026
02:17:25,467 --> 02:17:27,105
<i>Newmarket Heath,</i> the overpaint.

2027
02:17:28,347 --> 02:17:29,223
Thank you.

2028
02:17:29,467 --> 02:17:31,822
I'll have it sent along.

2029
02:17:33,307 --> 02:17:35,616
I don't want to keep you
from your party.

2030
02:17:39,227 --> 02:17:42,060
But one more question, for the book.

2031
02:17:44,747 --> 02:17:46,658
Do you want to tell me
what really happened?

2032
02:17:53,107 --> 02:17:54,176
Sport...

2033
02:17:55,707 --> 02:17:57,982
...truth, like art...

2034
02:17:58,227 --> 02:18:00,138
...is in the eye of the beholder.

2035
02:18:03,227 --> 02:18:04,979
You believe what you choose...

2036
02:18:06,067 --> 02:18:07,978
...and I'll believe what I know.

2037
02:18:09,387 --> 02:18:10,661
Good luck, Jim.

2038
02:20:39,187 --> 02:20:40,540
Why didn't you come in?

2039
02:20:41,827 --> 02:20:44,341
I never enter the office on Sunday.

2040
02:20:44,587 --> 02:20:45,656
Bad juju.

2041
02:20:47,347 --> 02:20:49,065
I still got a lot of questions.

2042
02:20:51,027 --> 02:20:52,745
You know all you need to know.

2043
02:20:53,507 --> 02:20:54,781
One thing...

2044
02:20:55,187 --> 02:20:58,020
...don't commune so long with the dead
you forget the living.

2045
02:21:02,667 --> 02:21:03,941
What's this?

2046
02:21:14,987 --> 02:21:16,420
I love you, boy.

2047
02:21:17,187 --> 02:21:20,384
But I ain't the only one.
You know that, don't you?

2048
02:21:39,627 --> 02:21:41,345
How long's your lease?

2049
02:21:43,467 --> 02:21:44,866
Six months.

2050
02:21:47,267 --> 02:21:48,939
Welcome to Savannah.

2051
02:21:49,667 --> 02:21:50,543
You hungry?

2052
02:21:50,787 --> 02:21:52,698
- Come on.
- Let's go, girl.

2053
02:22:01,387 --> 02:22:04,697
You two know you're not going anywhere
without a chaperone.

2054
02:22:04,947 --> 02:22:09,225
I cooked my chablis' famous chicken.
Let's go have a picnic.

2055
02:22:10,307 --> 02:22:11,535
And guess what?

2056
02:22:11,787 --> 02:22:14,540
You get your choice of breast or thigh.

2057
02:22:15,147 --> 02:22:16,944
What's it called, the chicken?

2058
02:22:17,347 --> 02:22:19,463
Chablis' Kicking chicken.

2059
02:22:25,707 --> 02:22:27,265
Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?

2060
02:22:27,507 --> 02:22:30,067
Yes, sir.
Patrick do like his morning walk.

2061
02:22:31,747 --> 02:22:34,978
Patrick is walking kind of fancy
this morning, isn't he?
