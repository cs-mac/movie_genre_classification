00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,240
A mother died and she was buried

12
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,840
Small orphans left behind her.

13
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,880
Each morning
to her grave they hurried

14
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,280
And tried and tried to find her.

15
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,240
Her pity for them at that hour

16
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,000
Brought her soul from the ground

17
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,880
For she became
a small-leafed flower

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,280
Which covered her grave mound.

19
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,360
W I L D F L O W E R S

20
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Shine, Moon, shine!

21
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,360
And let me knit my line.

22
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
Green robes and shoes of red.

23
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Tomorrow I am wed.

24
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Shine, Moon, shine!

25
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,880
My clothes, O mother,
I will take

26
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,200
To wash down at the lake.

27
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,080
Och no, go not down to the lake.

28
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
Stay this once for my sake.

29
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,640
Black dreams I had last night,
my daughter.

30
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,720
Go not down to the water.

31
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,640
For you I chose
these pearls so bright

32
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
And dressed you all in white,

33
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,960
In skirts as light as foam,
my daughter.

34
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,440
Go not down to the water.

35
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,840
White robes hide grief
in their light furls

36
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
And tears are lost in pearls,

37
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,840
And Friday is ill-omened,
daughter.

38
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,080
Go not down to the water.

39
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,080
Hoop-la, hoop-la, my sweet son,
My boy, my bright surprise.

40
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,840
You smile at me,
and with her grief

41
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,960
Your mother slowly dies.

42
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,280
Hoop-la, hoop-la, my sweet child
My little Waterman,

43
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,400
Remember sadly my own mother
ls all that I now can.

44
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,280
The spring shoot
of my blooming youth,

45
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,320
You broke in pieces two.

46
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,440
And ever after that
there's naught

47
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,480
That I want pleases you.

48
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,240
Your word, O wife,
I wish to trust

49
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
So deep is my devotion.

50
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,400
But who will catch
the fish let free

51
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,000
Again back to the ocean?

52
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,200
So many times
I've sweetly begged

53
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,560
This one thing and no other,

54
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,600
That for a brief while
you'd let me

55
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,280
Return to see my mother.

56
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
Oh I would quickly step aside
And leave your pathway clear

57
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
If woman's erring sense were not
The thing I greatly fear.

58
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,760
From first light
to the fall of dusk

59
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,640
ls all I will agree,

60
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,440
And to be sure
that you'll return

61
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,640
The child you leave with me.

62
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,040
Farewell, my dearest mother.

63
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,040
Oh how I fear the night.

64
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,760
Oh never fear, my own sweet one,
That murderer is gone.

65
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,520
I'd never leave you in the power
Of that dire water wight.

66
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Come home, O wife of mine,
come home!

67
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,560
I have not eaten yet.

68
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
Be gone,
get you off from our door,

69
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,360
Be off, you scheming killer,

70
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,680
And what it was you ate before
Eat that again. Now get!

71
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,920
Come home, O wife of mine,
come home,

72
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,040
Come home and make my bed.

73
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,200
Be gone,
get you off from our door,

74
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,480
Be off, you scheming killer,

75
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,640
And who it was made it before

76
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,080
Will make again your bed.

77
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,280
Come home, O wife of mine,
come home,

78
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,640
Our child cries, let him drink.

79
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,360
O mother, this is torture wild,

80
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
My heart bursts for my child.

81
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
O mother mine, O mother dear,

82
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Let go and let me sink.

83
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,680
Go nowhere, daughter,
from your home,

84
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,600
Betrayal is in store.

85
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,760
However much you love your child
I fear for you much more.

86
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,000
Be off, you killer, to your lake

87
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,440
My daughter you'll not take,

88
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,440
And if your little child
does cry

89
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,560
At our door leave him lie.

90
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,360
O mother, mother, woe is mine,

91
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
His cries make my heart pine,

92
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,200
O mother mine, O mother dear,

93
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
The Waterman I fear.

94
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,080
A dear man once had I,

95
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
For him I'd gladly die.

96
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,560
He left for foreign lands
Ere we put up the banns.

97
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,040
O Mary, full of power,

98
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,480
Och, help me at this hour.

99
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,480
Bring my beloved home,

100
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,920
Lord knows where he does roam.

101
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,480
Bring him, I reck not how,

102
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,000
Or finish my life now.

103
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,920
Ho, do you wake or sleep?

104
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,280
I'm here, my maid. Don't weep.

105
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,600
My sweet, so it came true.
So long I've thought of you.

106
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,240
Your image did not fade.
Just now for you I prayed.

107
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,640
Leave off those prayers and see!

108
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
O leap and run with me!

109
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,840
This moon will be our guide,

110
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,920
I've come to take my bride.

111
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,440
Oh what is that you say?

112
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,920
This late where would we stray?

113
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,040
The wind howls, darkest night,

114
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,640
Shall we not wait till light?

115
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,760
For me the night is day,
And daylight dreaming play.

116
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,320
Before the cock's alarms,
You must be in my arms.

117
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,640
On nights like this I've found

118
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,320
The dead rise from the ground.

119
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,280
So swiftly they come near.

120
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Are you afraid, my dear?

121
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,680
Why fear when you're with me,

122
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,080
And God's eye over me?

123
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,840
My sweet, O tell me rather

124
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,640
What news of your good father?

125
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,240
And your dear mother? Show me.

126
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,800
Will she have joy to know me?

127
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,200
You ask too much, my dear,
Quick run, all will come clear.

128
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,800
Quick run, we have no time,
The road hard and the climb.

129
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,800
What do you carry there?

130
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,920
It is my book of prayer.

131
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,360
O drop it! That alone
ls heavier than stone.

132
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,720
O drop it and you'll fly
As fast as me and high!

133
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,880
O tell me, by my vows,
About your little house.

134
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,480
The kitchen clean and bright?
ls there a church in sight?

135
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,200
You ask too much, my dear.
Quick run, all will come clear.

136
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,200
Your waist. What do I see?

137
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,440
It is my rosary.

138
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,200
That rosary you take

139
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,120
lt grips you like a snake.

140
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,360
lt strangles you. Now hush

141
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,560
And drop it! We must rush!

142
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,880
What is that ribbon there,
Around your neck just there?

143
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,840
My mother's cross I bear.

144
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,520
That gold, upon my life,
Has corners like a knife.

145
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,360
lt stabs us both. Oh fling
lt off and you'll take wing.

146
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,160
O maid of mine, we're here.

147
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,200
Has it not all come clear?

148
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,360
The house of our good Lord?

149
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,960
Not his, that is my fort.

150
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,880
Those graves, I ask your pardon?

151
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,920
Not graves, that is my garden.

152
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,440
My maid, now look at me,

153
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,360
And vault this wall with glee!

154
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,760
Let me go from your hold.

155
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,120
Your eyes are strange and cold.

156
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,640
There's poison in your sighs,

157
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,200
Your heart is hard like ice.

158
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,960
Oh do not fear, my love.
And we'lI have mirth enough,

159
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,800
Much meat if little blood.
This first will make all good.

160
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,960
-What's that, beloved one?
-The robes that I have sown.

161
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,880
There's only need of two,
One for me and for you.

162
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,960
Fear not and hurry after,
And long will be our laughter.

163
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,000
But always you went first

164
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,560
Along the road accursed.

165
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,720
Go then like just before,

166
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,360
Show me the way once more.

167
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,720
Arise, though dead you are,

168
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,000
And push back this door's bar.

169
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,680
O Holy God, abet me,
Let not the devil get me.

170
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,920
Lie down, dead man, and rest,
By Our Lord you'll be blessed.

171
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,120
Arise, though you have died,
And open this door wide.

172
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,800
O Christ, I supplicate,
Save my soul in this strait.

173
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,960
You dead man, lie and rest,

174
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,720
By God we'll both be blessed.

175
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,960
Arise, though dead and strive on

176
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,480
And hand me out the live one.

177
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,880
O Mary, in my need,

178
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,680
With your son intercede.

179
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,840
Unworthy, my cries heard,

180
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,920
Forgive me that I erred.

181
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Run off, you noon-day witch!

182
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,640
If only you would hush,
you little gypsy.

183
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,440
At noon, your father
comes back from the fields.

184
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,720
The fire's going out,
bad boy, for both your meals.

185
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Hush up.

186
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,560
A hussar and a coach.

187
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,840
Go play, here is a cock.

188
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,040
Oh would a hornet sting you!

189
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,520
You horror! To the noon-day
witch I'll bring you!

190
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,560
Come for him, noon-day witch!

191
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,400
Come take this little terror!

192
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,040
Give me the child.

193
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,240
Christ Lord,
forgive this sinner's sins.

194
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,640
For Christ's dear wounds.

195
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,920
About the woods'
and fields' expanse

196
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,160
A lord comes riding
through his lands.

197
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,240
His stallion black

198
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,000
and boisterous wings,

199
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,360
And gaily each spur sings.

200
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,560
I greet you warmly,
honoured guest,

201
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,560
Who might you be, is my request,

202
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,960
And how did you come here?

203
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,560
Lord of these lands,
my royal estate,

204
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,040
I am, and called it
seems by fate.

205
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,640
I'll give you silver
and gold too,

206
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,880
For which I'll take
your girl from you.

207
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,560
Stranger than strange,
my liege & king,

208
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,360
Whoever heard of such a thing?

209
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,240
We are not worthy,
king and saviour,

210
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,680
If only we deserved your favour.

211
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,880
Take counsel
from this ancient crone,

212
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,240
For my ward I will give my own.

213
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,040
I cannot tell
one from the other,

214
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,680
& neither could
the other mother.

215
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,960
Bad counsel you give me,
old shrew.

216
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,400
So carry out what I tell you.
Tomorrow at the break of day

217
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,600
Lead your step daughter
on the way

218
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,040
Which leads to my royal castle.

219
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,800
Arise, my daughter,
come make haste.

220
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,160
All's stirring
and the king awaits.

221
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,120
Get dressed, O sister mine,
get dressed,

222
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,320
The royal board is laden best.

223
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,920
O mother dear, O tell me do,

224
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,440
Why do you take
that knife with you?

225
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,080
The knife is good
in some cold brake

226
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,520
To pluck the eyes out of a snake

227
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,760
Now hurry up and come.

228
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,320
O sister dear, O tell me do,

229
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,160
Why do you take
the axe with you?

230
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,920
The axe is good
when you think least

231
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,640
To hack the limbs
off some wild beast.

232
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,160
Now hurry up and come.

233
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,600
O you are that snake
and that beast.

234
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,280
Now from this life
be you released.

235
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,680
O mother, tell me your advice,

236
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,600
Where should I put
the limbs and eyes?

237
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,160
Leave them not
by the corpse or then

238
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,680
Someone might
put them back again.

239
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,200
You'd better take them with you.

240
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,680
Now run, my lad,
show me your zeal,

241
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,360
And take this golden
spinning-wheel,

242
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,080
And sell it in the royal castle,
And this the only price you beg:

243
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,760
Two arms, two eyes, two legs.

244
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,840
Come buy, O maid,
what could compare?

245
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,800
The price my father asks is fair
Two legs are what I ask.

246
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,080
-Two legs?
-The strangest thing.

247
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,960
But I must have it!
Bring it, bring.

248
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,000
Go to the chamber, mother mine,

249
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,800
Where Little Dora's
legs are lying.

250
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,960
And give him them for it.

251
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,320
Come buy, O maid,
what could compare,

252
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,840
The price my father asks is fair
Two arms are what I ask.

253
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,080
If only I that spindle had
For this distaff.

254
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,840
Two eyes, O matron,
nothing else.

255
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,400
For these alone my father sells.

256
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,200
Two eyes are what I ask.

257
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,840
Two eyes? Unheard of.
Tell me rather

258
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,760
Who, my young lad,
might be your father?

259
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,960
You need not know,
you need not mind him.

260
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,960
Who seeks for him
will never find him.

261
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,360
O mother, mother, hear his call!

262
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,160
What will we do? I want it all.

263
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,320
Go to the chamber, mother mine,

264
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,120
Where Little Dora's
eyes are lying,

265
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,720
And let him take them.

266
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,120
You fill my heart
and waking thought,

267
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,760
And look at this wheel
I have bought.

268
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,200
Of spinning-wheels
a make untold,

269
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,320
The spindle,
distaff all of gold.

270
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,840
Oh come and sit, my little dove,

271
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,600
And spin the golden
thread of love.

272
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,400
Vrrr -
that evil thread you weave.

273
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,400
The king you wanted to deceive.

274
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,160
Your step sister
you cruelly slew,

275
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,320
Plucked out her eyes,
hacked her limbs through.

276
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,040
Vrrr - the evil weave.

277
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,280
What kind
of spinning wheel is this?

278
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,360
You play it strangely -
roar and hiss.

279
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,240
Spin, my lady, spin.

280
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,120
The true bride
of the king you slew,

281
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,720
Hacked her limbs through.
Vrrr - the evil weave.

282
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,560
How terribly my lady plays,
You be not how you meet my gaze.

283
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,000
My lady, play it this third time
So I might hear the final rhyme.

284
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,320
Spin, my lady, spin.

285
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,880
Vrrr, vrrr -
that evil thread you weave.

286
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,680
The king you wanted to deceive.

287
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,480
Your sister
to the wolves is bride,

288
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,040
Alone in dark woods
does she bide.

289
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,800
Vrrr - the evil weave...

290
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,320
The evil weave...

291
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,360
The evil weave...

292
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,480
My little Dora, where are you?

293
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,280
Oh where?

294
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,600
I've searched these wide woods.
Don't despair.

295
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,080
Oh where are you, my sweet?
Oh where are you my sweet?

296
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,760
Oh where oh where?

297
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,080
Oh where?

298
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,960
Ho, there go four wolves
through the trees,

299
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,240
Each carries one leg as it flees

300
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,120
From bodies of two women.

301
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,400
What they did
to the maiden first

302
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,960
Was how they
finally were cursed

303
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,320
In woods so dark and deep.

304
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,960
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with thee,

305
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,360
Blessed art thou amongst women,

306
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,520
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus.

307
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,360
Holy Mary, mother of God,
Prayer for us sinners

308
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,200
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen.

309
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,680
Why are you sad and grey,
my daughter?

310
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,280
Why are you sad and grey?

311
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,080
In past times you were gay,

312
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,080
No laughter now but woe.

313
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,720
I killed a little dove,
O mother.

314
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,160
I killed a little dove,

315
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,240
Alone, bereft of love,

316
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,520
And white as is the snow.

317
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,280
lt was no dove you killed,
my daughter,

318
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,840
lt was no dove you killed.

319
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,080
Your face with sorrow filled,

320
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,080
And troubled is your gaze.

321
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,920
I killed my little child,
O mother.

322
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,720
I killed my little child.

323
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,960
So helpless, meek and mild.

324
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,200
This grief will end my days.

325
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,360
Oh such a deed benighted,

326
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,560
How will you ever right it?

327
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,200
And quell the wrath of God?

328
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,320
I go to find that flower,

329
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,800
I go to find that flower,
To cleanse guiIt is its power,

330
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,320
And cool the raging blood.

331
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,920
And where might be that flower?

332
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,920
In what grove or what bower?

333
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,000
Where in the world so wide?

334
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,640
Beyond the gate up there,
O mother.

335
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,880
Beyond the gate up there.

336
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,120
The nail on that stake bare,

337
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,760
The noose's hempen slide.

338
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,040
What word for that lad
who would come

339
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,200
So much to visit us at home

340
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,720
And used to lie with you?

341
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,720
Of this my blessing him apprise,

342
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,600
Let worms eat his soul
till he dies,

343
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,640
That he was so untrue.

344
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,080
And for your mother what,
my daughter,

345
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,680
And for your mother what?

346
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,880
Who loved you from the cot,

347
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,560
Who loved you, life and limb?

348
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,200
This curse for you I save,
O mother,

349
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,000
This curse for you I save,

350
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,720
That you'll not rest a-grave,

351
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,640
For you gave me to him.

352
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,320
Hum and whirl my spinning wheel,

353
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,640
The end of Advent
soon shall peal,

354
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,080
And closer,
closer Christmas Day.

355
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,920
All hail to Christmas Eve,
You holiday of myth,

356
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,160
What do you bring us all
To recollect you with?

357
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,400
To the master, Christmas bread,
Fodder to his cattle,

358
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,760
To the rooster, cloves of garlic
Peas to hens who prattle.

359
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,680
I am a youthful maid
With heart as yet untaken,

360
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,360
And in my restless mind
Other thoughts awaken.

361
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,360
Yonder, where the forest ends,

362
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,080
And the sluice-gate forms a gap.

363
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,280
Venerable willows stand
Each with a snowy cap.

364
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,800
And there a gnarled old tree
ls nodding and abiding,

365
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,080
And down beneath the ice
The cold blue lake is hiding.

366
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,560
They say when midnight comes
And the moon shines bright above

367
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,520
Within the waters' depth appears
A maiden's future love.

368
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,160
Oh midnight does not frighten me
I scoff at superstition,

369
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,400
And with an axe
I'll chop the ice

370
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,200
And so fulfil my mission.

371
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,080
Deep in the icy waves
I'll gaze with hopeful eyes,

372
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,000
My destined lover to behold
Where his face mirrored lies.

373
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,040
He wears a coat
of dark green cloth,

374
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,160
His hat aslant... O see!

375
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,200
Those flowers to him I brought
It's Václav, Lord! 'Tis he!

376
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,880
I see it through a haze,
A flickering ray that streams

377
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,080
Out of the mist...
Red lights ablaze...

378
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,160
I'm in a church, it seems.

379
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,560
Some black amidst the white,
I see it now... 'Tis clear!

380
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,560
They're maids
and through their light,

381
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,680
My God! A cross and bier.
