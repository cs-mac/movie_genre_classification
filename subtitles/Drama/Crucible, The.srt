00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,140
-=This movie is an adaptation of a novel
about an actual case that happened at
a school for the deaf in 2005.=-

2
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,770
=Today's weather is cloudy to overcast.=

3
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,770
=There will be rainfall and snow
in the central areas.=

4
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,150
=In the early morning, there will be
thick fog in areas near the mountains.=

5
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,280
=Thick fog will also be seen on the
west coast and the mountainous region.=

6
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,650
=Today's temperature will be similar to yesterday's.=

7
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,910
=Seoul is at -2 degrees Celsius.
Dae Jeon is at -2 degrees Celsius.
Gwang Ju is at -1 degree  Celsius.=

8
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,410
=Mu Jin is at -1 degree Celsius.=

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,050
=You haven't arrived yet?=

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,670
The fog is too heavy.
I don't even know where I am right now.

11
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,800
=You will be reaching soon.=

12
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,470
=Mu Jin is naturally a place with thick fog.=

13
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,940
=What's Song In doing now?=
- Sleeping.

14
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,570
=She has been crying aloud for you
and only fell asleep a while ago.=

15
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,940
Did she cry a lot?

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,440
=It happens to all kids who are
separated from their parents.=

17
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,200
=Don't worry too much.
Just focus on your job.=

18
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,830
=It wasn't easy to get this job, so
make sure you hold on to it. Understand?=

19
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:45,230
-=Crucible=-

20
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,390
How long will I need to wait?

21
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,400
Because of thick fog in the early morning,

22
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,030
you still have to wait a while more.

23
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,870
Excuse me. May I know if there are any
public buses to Ja Ae School from here?

24
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,340
Ja Ae School?

25
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,590
Are you referring to that school for the deaf?

26
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,960
That place is a bit remote,
so there is no direct public bus.

27
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,930
A taxi will cost you at least 50 000 Won.

28
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,180
You are leaving just like this?

29
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm running against time now.
Let's talk tomorrow.

30
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,930
If you can, leave your car here for repair.

31
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,450
Ajussi, what's the matter with you?
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)

32
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,700
How could you just suddenly reverse
without checking your mirrors?

33
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,450
What are you talking about?
I did not even move my car.

34
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,710
Ajussi, are you bullying me because I'm a woman?
You have picked the wrong person this time.

35
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,210
Boss, may I borrow your spray?

36
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,340
I'm speechless. Exactly which car get bumped into?

37
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,720
Miss, I haven't even started my car.

38
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,100
Hey you this person, I predict that
you will get into trouble one of these days.

39
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,350
Boss, come and take a look.

40
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,730
This person is pretty drunk.

41
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,980
What should I do?

42
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,230
Why?

43
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,990
Are you having a drink too many again last night?

44
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm really sorry.

45
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,620
I will help you to get insurance compensation.

46
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,760
Looks like you are afraid of cold.

47
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,510
Yesterday I went out for a drink with my colleagues.
When I came out, the windows were all smashed.

48
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,890
You look like that fellow that ran away
after smashing the windows.
But it seems that I have made a mistake.

49
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,890
That...How much longer?

50
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,400
People in my profession tends to
make a few enemies.

51
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,650
Our job is quite similar to the policemen's.

52
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,650
We target those people who cause
troubles after drinking and use violence
on their wives and children.

53
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,650
I'm asking you when we are reaching.

54
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,160
You are already an adult
but why are you so impatient?

55
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,410
Anyway, why are you going to Ja Ae School?

56
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,540
I will be teaching the children.

57
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,920
Really? Are you a teacher?

58
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,920
So you know sign language, right?

59
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,300
What's the meaning?

60
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,050
I think I know why you have so many enemies.

61
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,990
Contact me after you have estimated
the compensation amount.
Don't try to do something different.

62
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
I am in extremely good terms
with the policemen of this city.

63
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,180
Hello.

64
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,920
This is the Headmaster Office.

65
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,630
<i>Ask the Admin Head to
come over for a while.</i>

66
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,880
So you are a student of Prof. Gim?

67
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,260
Yes. He's my professor in the university.

68
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,260
Prof. Gim painted this portrait for me.

69
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,640
I see.

70
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm fully confident of the
calibre of Prof. Gim's students.

71
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,190
I was in the same class with Prof. Gim
till third year of high school.

72
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,450
If he didn't choose to specialize in fine arts,
most likely we would be studying in the same university.

73
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,320
You don't have to be so polite.

74
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,070
I have to.

75
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,080
You are going to be our teacher soon.
Of course, I need to be polite to you.

76
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,580
Admin Head.

77
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,960
This is our new art teacher from Seoul,
recommended by Prof. Gim.

78
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm Gang In Ho. Looking forward to working with you.

79
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,090
Is this the first time you see an identical twin?

80
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,350
I'm sorry.

81
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,100
It's all right. I believe most people
who see us for the first time will
have the same reaction as you.

82
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,850
You must be very tired after
traveling such long distance.

83
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,860
Take a good rest this weekend
and start work next week.

84
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,480
The admin head will make arrangements
for you for the other matters.

85
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,740
Hyeong, how should we handle that matter?

86
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,370
Admin Head, this is a school.

87
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,750
Headmaster, how should we proceed with it?

88
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,250
Didn't I mention that
he's recommended by Prof. Gim?

89
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,560
Are you playing with me?

90
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,060
You are from Seoul,
but why are you so dumb?

91
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,490
Originally, you need to give a big note.
But since you are recommended by
Prof. Gim, 5 small notes will do.

92
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,490
- Are you asking money from me?
- Then, do you think this teacher's position comes free?

93
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,870
You are really...Remember, no cheque.

94
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,170
School Development Fund.

95
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,290
I heard everyone must contribute to it.

96
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
=So, how much do they need?=

97
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,180
50 million Won.

98
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,770
=Not 5 million Won but 50 million Won!=

99
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,270
I heard it was already a discount since
I was recommended by my professor.

100
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,990
=Oh my god! How could I get so much money?=

101
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,900
Nice drawing.

102
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,900
You have an aptitude for drawing.

103
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,010
The lesson has started for some time.
Why are you only here now?

104
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,890
I'm talking to you.

105
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,390
Are you saying Min Su?

106
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,650
That child's younger brother lost his life
in a train accident a few days ago.

107
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,400
That child definitely is not
in the right state of mind now.

108
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,950
His only brother died.
How can he not be depressed?

109
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,580
Not only Min Su. I feel that the
rest of the children are a bit strange too.

110
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,460
What is so strange about?

111
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,830
It's not easy to explain clearly in a few words.

112
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,460
Mr. Gang, this is your first time
teaching in such a school, right?

113
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,470
You cannot treat the children here
like any normal children.

114
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,720
When one has a disability,
one will feel incomplete.

115
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,570
I have been in contact with these
children for more than 10 years.

116
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,190
But until now, they are still
not opening their minds to me.

117
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,740
Jeon Min Su.

118
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,540
<i>His father is mentally retarded.
His mother's whereabouts is unknown.</i>

119
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,460
<i>Jin Yu Ri.</i>

120
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,970
<i>With an intellectual disability grade 3
and a mental age of 8 years old.</i>

121
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,470
<i>Have to watch her as she has a huge appetite.</i>

122
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,440
Gim Yeon Do.

123
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,320
<i>She's is an orphan...</i>

124
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,870
I just knock off from work.

125
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,000
=Have you taken your dinner?=

126
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,250
I have eaten a little.

127
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,880
Song In? Have you feed her?

128
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,260
=I just feed her a few spoons.=

129
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,880
Why did you feed her so little?

130
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,890
=She said she doesn't like to eat rice
and has been asking for pizza.=

131
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,640
If she wants to eat, just buy it for her.
How much can that cost?

132
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,270
=Don't worry. I won't starve your daughter.
When you reach home, remember
to check your bank account.=

133
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,900
You got the money?

134
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,650
=When you withdraw the money,
you must get the new coins from them.=

135
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,730
Anyone inside?

136
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,320
By any chance, did something happen?

137
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,370
What are you doing here?

138
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,670
Just now, there were some
strange sounds coming from inside.

139
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,540
But that doesn't mean you
can go into a ladies' toilet.

140
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,720
What if a child passes by and saw it?

141
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,890
Looks like you are new and don't know
the situation here well. The children often made
strange sounds when they are bored.

142
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,430
Furthermore, because they are deaf,
they yell even louder.

143
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,770
I'm going to lock up the main gate.
You better get going.

144
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,650
Recently, the investigation has given me headaches.
That bunch of kids always cause troubles for me as well.

145
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,400
Our kids have been a pain
in the neck to Officer Jang, right?

146
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,150
Can't really say it's a pain in the neck.

147
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,780
Teaching good morals to the children
is also part of policeman's duty.

148
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,160
The key is that the kids should listen.

149
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,290
I told them many times not to
leave their rooms at night.

150
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,670
No use saying to them.
They can't hear it.

151
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,920
You are right.

152
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,060
It's all right. Come in.

153
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,310
Development fund is not against any law.

154
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,560
Isn't it, Officer Jang?

155
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,110
Of course. If I earn enough,
I will also contribute to the
school development fund.

156
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:22,250
I heard you are from Seoul.
Are you adapting well?

157
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,500
This Mu Jin City, except for year in year out fog,
there isn't really many things here.

158
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,250
It's okay. I'm good.

159
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,840
That, how about a drink with me
when you have the time?

160
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,840
Although this city looks pretty dilapidated,
there are still enjoyment places for men.

161
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,470
The little fishes here are not bad.

162
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,350
Min Su, it's impolite to look at teacher
using that eye expression.

163
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,360
Stand up!

164
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,610
Stand straight. Didn't I teach you before
that you should still show courtesy
when you are being beaten?

165
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,250
Get up, Min Su.

166
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,370
Hello.

167
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,880
Mr. Pak, what happened?

168
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,380
Please wait a moment.

169
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,770
This kid secretly left the dormitory at night.

170
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,520
And even brought along two other girls with him.

171
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,650
I was so worried that I didn't sleep at all last night.

172
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,530
This kid's younger brother also
died because of this reason.

173
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,780
Mr. Pak, the Headmaster is looking for you.

174
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,790
Min Su, can't you understand my feelings?

175
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,050
Open your mind to me and enjoy
each other company.
Isn't it better that way?

176
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,500
What are you doing? Quick, get in.

177
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,640
Get in! Hey, you!

178
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,020
Come down quickly.
Come down quickly.

179
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,150
What do you plan to do?

180
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,400
What if you fell out of the window?
What's the matter?

181
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,660
Sorry. I have frightened you.

182
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,540
I did this because I was worried.

183
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,780
What are you doing?

184
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,030
I am educating the children.

185
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,030
Hey auntie, who are you?
Who allows you to educate them in this way?

186
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,410
I am the dormitory superintendent, Yun Ja Ae.

187
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,790
I am in charge of after-school education.

188
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,790
This is not something you should interfere with.

189
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,670
You are dunking the child's head into
the washing machine and you asked
me to ignore it? Are you crazy?

190
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,050
I heard there's a new teacher from Seoul.
So it's a fellow who cannot differentiate
between urine and shit.

191
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,170
Are you looking down on me because
you think I come from backwater?

192
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,430
In Seoul, I have a number of friends
who are prosecutors and lawyers.

193
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,930
If you dare to do it again,
I will make sure you are thrown into jail.
Heed my advice.

194
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,810
Yeon Do.

195
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,410
Hello.

196
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,040
Which ajussi?

197
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,920
Oh, that ajussi.

198
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,670
What's the matter? I thought the
repairing fees had long been settled.

199
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:39,900
Are you saying beating up disabled children?

200
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,280
This is not a discrimination,
it's completely an atrocity.

201
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,450
The child is in such a bad state.
Ajussi, what have you being doing?

202
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,610
Please call her parents first.

203
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,960
This child is an orphan.

204
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,630
I have heard it from the Admin Head.

205
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,890
Miss Yun Ja Ae's teaching method is bad.

206
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,650
Mr. Gang, it is understandable for you
to be angry when your students
are met with such encounters.

207
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,990
I had already issued a
harsh warning to Miss Yun Ja Ae.

208
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,440
So could you be magnanimous
and forgive her this time?

209
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,070
Miss Yun Ja Ae had already reflected on it.

210
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,450
She also want to personally
apologize to student Yeon Do.

211
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,240
But it seems that Yeon Do didn't go back
to her bedroom last night.

212
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,620
Nothing happens to the child, right?
We are worried over her.

213
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,420
Actually, her condition is quite bad.
So I admitted her into hospital.

214
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,300
Is that so? Is it very serious?

215
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,550
No, it's not. They said she
can be discharged tomorrow.

216
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,720
You don't have to be too worried.

217
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,470
We will handle the discharge procedure.

218
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,940
But which hospital is she in?

219
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,170
-=As Yeon Do is not feeling well,
she is unable to come today.=-

220
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,300
How about...

221
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,690
-=You draw me and I draw you.=-

222
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,980
-=Why? You are unwilling?=-

223
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,110
-=I have bruises and wounds.=-

224
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,240
-=Don't worry. I will draw you beautifully.=-

225
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,190
Ajussi, where are you now?

226
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,640
Can you come over right now?

227
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,520
=I am getting off from work now.
I will rush over to the hospital.=

228
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,400
It may be inconvenient to discuss it in hospital.
Let's meet outside.

229
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,660
- Okay, I know.
- Okay.

230
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,380
What's the matter?

231
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,180
Yeon Do, she...

232
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,930
was almost violated.

233
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,980
Furthermore, the Headmaster was the perpetrator.

234
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:59,940
He forced himself on her but
I think he wasn't successful.

235
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,740
Because the child was too young.

236
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,660
It's too ridiculous!

237
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,790
Who said that?

238
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:17,920
Did you have a drink too many?
How many glasses did you drink?

239
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,510
Yeon Do wrote this for me last night.

240
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,570
- Was it really the Headmaster?
- Yes.

241
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,580
Yeon Do wasn't the only one
who was violated.

242
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,040
There were a few perpetrators.

243
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,210
A teacher by the name Pak Bo Hyeon
had even sexually abused boys.

244
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,090
<i>Can't you understand my feelings?</i>

245
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,600
- Was the Headmaster the only person who did those acts?
- Headmaster, and also Admin Head as well as Mr. Pak Bo Hyeon.

246
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,810
Then,

247
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,070
we have to made a police report.

248
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,820
The Police was the one who sent the children
who reported the case back to the school.

249
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,580
They took revenge on those children
by violently beating them up.

250
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,090
That dormitory superintendent, Yun Ja Ae,
who beat up Yeon Do,

251
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,460
is found to be the adopted daughter
of the founder of Ja Ae School.

252
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,340
In other words, she is the
Headmaster's younger sister.

253
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,090
Is there a girl named Gim Yeon Do in the patient list?

254
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,720
And even more ridiculous is

255
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,600
that Yun Ja Ae and the Headmaster are lovers.

256
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,110
When she snipped off Yeon Do's hair, she told her this.

257
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,240
If she dared to seduce the Headmaster,
she will be killed.

258
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,990
Ajussi.

259
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,630
Wait a moment.

260
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,780
-=Mu Jin Human Rights Center.=-

261
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,170
We understand that you were violated by
the Headmaster of Ja Ae School last Thursday.

262
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,670
Could you give an account of what happened?

263
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,320
<i>That day, after school,</i>

264
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,690
<i>I went to my bedroom to change my clothes.</i>

265
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,570
<i>Then, I went to play on the field.</i>

266
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,200
<i>My playmate Yu Ri said that
she needs to go to toilet.</i>

267
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,210
<i>As she was not back after a long time,</i>

268
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,630
<i>I decided to go back to school to look for her.</i>

269
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:45,260
<i>Then, I saw the Headmaster and he
seems to asking me to come over.</i>

270
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:54,400
<i>He brought me to the Headmaster Office.</i>

271
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,270
<i>The TV was on.</i>

272
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:08,280
<i>I saw pictures of naked man and woman.</i>

273
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,960
<i>After the Headmaster came in,</i>

274
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,890
<i>he removed my pants.</i>

275
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,910
<i>Anyone inside?</i>

276
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,790
<i>Anyone calling?</i>

277
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,090
<i>It's drizzling outside the windows now.</i>

278
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,760
<i>The sound of raindrops that fall on the leaves,</i>

279
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,890
<i>is like whispering to us that
the cold winter has ended.</i>

280
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,270
<i>My listener friends, why not open the
windows and listen to the sound of raindrops?</i>

281
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,150
<i>The first song that I'm playing is one that is
suitable to be heard in a raining day.</i>

282
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,270
<i>Let's listen to "A Thornbush" by Jo Sung Mo.</i>

283
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,560
Everything is fine now.

284
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,070
Yeon Do said she had seen it too.

285
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,630
<i>If you dare to tell this to others,</i>

286
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,430
<i>I will kill you.</i>

287
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,990
<i>Looks like you are new and don't know
the situation here well. </i>

288
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>The children often made
strange sounds when they are bored.</i>

289
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,330
- Father!
- You're here, mom.

290
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,090
Why did you take so long to open the door?
What are you doing?

291
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,210
Don't tell me because you are
teaching the deaf children,
so you become deaf as well.

292
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,840
Why didn't you tell me before coming over?

293
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,340
I'm coming to my son's house.
Do I still need to make an appointment?

294
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,350
This place is not a hotel.

295
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,220
But how can you bring a sick child over here?

296
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,980
You...Have you forgotten?

297
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,360
Today is Song In's mother's death memorial day.

298
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,110
How's the school?

299
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,120
Just like that.

300
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,620
What's wrong? Are you being disregarded?

301
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,000
You just have to tolerate a bit.

302
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,380
In the first place, country folks are a bit xenophobic.

303
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,380
What's that?

304
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:04,060
I heard that your school's
headmaster loves cymbidium.

305
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,600
Prof. Gim has mentioned before
that your school's headmaster is a
person with wide connections.

306
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:15,230
I heard that a few teachers that were before you

307
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,450
were transferred to Seoul after
getting into the headmaster's good books.

308
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,410
Mom, do you know what those people really are?

309
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,530
- Mom, let me tell you. Those people...
- Do you think I would think

310
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,540
people who sell teaching positions are good people?

311
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,910
Do you know where I got those money?
Those money came from the
deposit money for the house.

312
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,080
Did you return the house?
Is that how the remittance came about?

313
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,340
Then what was your initial thinking?
I can't possibly go and steal money, right?

314
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,590
You never remit any money to us.
How on the earth can I get
that large sum of money?

315
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,090
I understand but why did you return the house?

316
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,350
You really...You are still acting like
you are the head of this family.

317
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,850
During the times you were wondering
aimlessly for the sake of drawing.

318
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,270
Have you forgotten it was Song In's mother
and I who raised Song In and provided for
your living expenses?

319
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,780
Before Song In's mother died,
she was still worrying over Song In and you!

320
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,700
Father, are you quarreling with grandmother?

321
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,450
Don't say anymore.

322
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:25,580
You just focus on teaching the students,
don't be a busybody, and do a good job
in your own area of work.

323
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,830
Song In, are you all right?

324
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,090
Mom. Quickly.

325
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,840
Here's the medicine.

326
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,720
- Song In.
- Come, breathe in.

327
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,850
- One more time. Good.
- Good.

328
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,200
I have found a house near to where we lived previously.

329
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,950
Although it's a bit small,

330
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,000
it's good enough for Song In and me to live in.

331
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,420
In Ho, don't bother about other things.
Just think of Song In, please?

332
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,260
We are putting up a formal application
to dismiss Chairman of Ja Ae School,

333
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,260
and to punish the people who
sexually abused the children.

334
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,520
I'm very sorry. May I interrupt for a while?

335
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,770
Those sexual abuses...

336
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,270
were they done during lesson times?
In other words, was it something
that happened during class?

337
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,900
Looking at this video clip, it's clear that

338
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,780
- the children were abused after school.
- So, it was after school.

339
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,160
If it's after school, then it's not under our administration.

340
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,530
What?

341
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,410
Since Mr. Gim committed those acts after school,
why should it be under our administration?

342
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,910
Such things should come under City Hall.

343
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,920
The Headmaster, the Admin Head and also a teacher

344
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,050
sexually abused students in the school.
Don't tell me this is not under
the Education Department?

345
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,550
Let me put in another way.

346
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,180
Ja Ae School is indeed come under our control.
But Ja Ae Hostel...

347
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,800
is a school dormitory and should come under
the City Hall Social Welfare Department.

348
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,680
After school, the children are
managed by the school dormitory.

349
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,930
Therefore, you should go to the City Hall.

350
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,440
I already went to the City Hall.

351
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,690
The people over at the City Hall said since the
sexual abuses happened in the school compound,
we should seek advice from the Education Department...

352
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,070
I have told you that after school incidents
are not under our administration.

353
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,070
Ajumma.
(ajumma - addressing a middle aged woman)

354
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,830
The children encountered such things in the school
and all of you kept saying that it's not under you.
Tell me exactly who is in charge?

355
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,330
Don't tell me it's under the Blue House?
Or how about the White House?

356
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,580
Of course is City Hall.

357
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,580
Why aren't you investigating?

358
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:08,590
The children was sexually abused in school.
Furthermore, these acts were done by
the Headmaster. Shouldn't that be investigated?

359
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,090
Of course we should investigate.

360
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,760
Then why aren't you investigating?

361
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,270
Miss Seo, that Headmaster is an elder of Mu Jin Church.

362
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,020
He's a devoted Christian and
also a reputable person in this region.

363
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,780
That's why I brought you the DVD and
written records of the children's statements.

364
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,150
Here are all these evidences.
Why are you not taking any action?

365
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,830
How can we just based on what were said
by the deaf children and arrest that person?

366
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,200
Moreover, that person just received
a certification of commendation from
the Governor a few days ago.

367
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,330
Furthermore, as there are problems
concerning human rights recently,
we also cannot anyhow arrest people.

368
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,210
Miss Seo, you should know better
than me regarding the last point.

369
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,710
They had done such things to the children.
Why are you bullshitting on human rights?

370
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,720
If all of you going to continue like this,
I will take the issue straight to the Prosecutor Office.

371
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,470
If you really do that, I'm really grateful to you.

372
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,350
Don't jump into conclusions thinking
we don't want to investigate.

373
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,970
Without orders from the Prosecutor,
we also cannot take any actions.

374
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:15,600
I'm also not happy. I think I should consider
grooming my son to be a prosecutor.

375
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,750
Hello.

376
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,130
=Miss Seo, I'm Yeong Hun. Seoul Television Station
has contacted us, saying they are interested
to do a coverage on this case.=

377
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,500
- Really?
-= Yes. They are on their way here.
You come back quickly.=

378
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,250
I understand. I'll be there right away.

379
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,770
Come here. Come here.

380
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,770
Brat.

381
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,610
Min Su, get up.
Why are lying there? Quickly get up.

382
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,990
Where are Yeon Do and Yu Ri?

383
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,870
Aren't you friends with them?

384
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,120
Don't mumble. Speak up. Quickly speak up.

385
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:33,170
This is so frustrating.
I'm asking you to speak up! You dumb!

386
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:39,770
You are always mumbling.
How will I understand them?

387
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,510
This kid is really...

388
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,140
Mr. Pak, you are getting old.

389
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,520
Looks like the children are
no longer afraid of you.

390
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,020
Mr. Pak.

391
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,650
This is the Headmaster Office.

392
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,280
Find a quieter place.

393
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:46,780
-=They will really receive punishment?=-

394
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,580
-=Yes, I promise you.=-

395
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,260
Why did your younger brother go to
the railway track early in the morning?

396
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,260
Can you tell us what happened to
your younger brother before he died?

397
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:28,990
<i>When Mr. Pak Bo Hyeon knocked off from work,
he asked us to follow him home.</i>

398
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:37,210
<i>Although I don't wish to,
I can't reject because he will beat me up.</i>

399
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:01,810
<i>Why? You want to go first?</i>

400
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,620
<i>You're too noisy.</i>

401
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,630
<i>I already said not to make noise.</i>

402
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,130
<i>I cannot concentrate.</i>

403
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,380
<i>Didn't I say to you before that
making noise is not a courtesy act?</i>

404
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,510
<i>I did not allow you to make noise.</i>

405
00:52:54,650 --> 00:53:00,270
<i>I asked you to wait quietly for your turn.
You didn't hear that?</i>

406
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,150
<i>Come over! You this brat!</i>

407
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:17,910
<i>I'm not sure how long it was.</i>

408
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,620
Min Su!

409
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:47,560
<i>He took off my undergarment.</i>

410
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:54,950
<i>And then came on top of me...</i>

411
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,450
Can't you resist or escape?

412
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,700
<i>If I resist, I will be beaten the whole night.</i>

413
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,330
Did that sort of thing happened before?

414
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:19,220
<i>In the teacher's house and
also the dormitory's bathroom.</i>

415
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:27,850
=My younger brother was weak.
After undergoing that sort of thing,=

416
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,600
=he was under great pain and cannot really walk.=

417
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,860
Officer Jang, what are you doing?

418
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,860
You have the right to engage a lawyer
and also the right to remain silent
with evidences against you.

419
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,120
Did you arrest me because of
what you saw on TV?
They fabricated it.

420
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,740
That wasn't me.
Do you believe I'm that type of person?

421
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,370
I'm an elder with Mu Jin Church
and a devoted Christian.

422
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,370
Officer Jang, you also knew this thing.

423
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:04,630
Let me go. Do you know who you are arresting?
I'm a friend of your superintendent.
What's your name?

424
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,380
- I'm not done with you.
- Hyeong, you don't have to worry.

425
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,130
Nothing will happen to you.
God will bless you.

426
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:15,760
Don't worry. I will definitely let off the
people who tarnish my brother's reputation.

427
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,890
- What bad luck today.
- Officer Jang.

428
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,640
Hyeong.

429
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,270
Let go of me.

430
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,270
Officer Jang, you really don't believe in me?

431
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:35,150
How could you treat us like this?
We have given you so many gifts.

432
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,660
This has caused a big commotion at the
Mu Jin Prosecutor Office today.

433
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,790
If we don't handle this properly,
not only I will be finished,
but also my superiors.

434
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:57,550
I'm not going to repeat. Please stop grumbling.
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

435
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:01,800
Make use of all your connections.
Search for a lawyer who started
his career as a judge.

436
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,800
He must be at least a judge of ministerial grade.
It's even better if his birth place is Mu Jin.

437
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,680
Don't keep doing useless things such as
screaming aloud that you are maligned.
You can do that during your prayers.

438
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:17,440
Before such a lawyer is found, you should act
ignorant and be well-behaved just like those
children who were sexually abused by you.

439
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,150
Understand?

440
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:32,330
Dear residents of Mu Jin, Elder Lee Gang Bok
and Elder Lee Gang Seok have over
the last 10 over years,

441
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:37,580
<i>worked hard day and night, and contributed
selflessly to our Mu Jin Church and Mu Jin City.</i>

442
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,210
<i>They believe and serve Jesus,
and care for those pitiful disabled children.</i>

443
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:47,590
They devoted their whole life to charity.

444
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:53,090
<i>Yet these dishonest people maligned our elders.
We absolutely cannot forgive them.</i>

445
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,970
It's a blessing in disguise.

446
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,470
<i>I'm begging all residents.</i>

447
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,220
The children cannot hear all these.

448
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:07,230
<i>Both Elders spent all their time and
effort on our church and Mu Jin City.</i>

449
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:18,620
Yeong Hun sunbae. Have you checked out
the background of their lawyer?

450
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:22,370
That lawyer is called Hwang U Sik.
He's a famous and talented lawyer in Mu Jin.

451
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,750
<i>He graduated from Mu Jin High School
and was the best law graduate from Seoul University.</i>

452
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,250
<i>He was once a ministerial grade judge.
He opened a law firm just recently.</i>

453
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,750
It seems that this is his first law case.

454
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,880
- "Jeon Gwan Ye U".
- What is "Jeon Gwan Ye U"?
(Jeon Gwan Ye U - privileges of former post)

455
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:41,760
There's an informal arrangement for a retired
judge with this ministerial grade to receive
special treatment for their first case in private practice.

456
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,820
Why are these two people so identical,
both in appearance and character?

457
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,820
I lived in disgrace over the last few days.

458
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:15,210
I reflected on why God is making me
go through this type of suffering.

459
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:21,630
My father, Mr. Lee Jun Beon.

460
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,380
Because he pitied those deaf and mute,

461
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:29,220
he used all his savings to build this Ja Ae School.

462
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,810
It's already more than 50 years. Since childhood,

463
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:41,980
my brother and I never forgotten
a saying from our father.
"Treat these pitiful lambs well."

464
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:48,730
We cannot hear.
Please find us an interpreter.

465
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,860
Silence.

466
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,990
Silence.

467
00:59:58,790 --> 00:59:59,660
Your Honor.

468
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,410
They cannot hear you asking them to be silent.

469
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,660
In court, if you speak without permission,

470
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,660
you will be ordered to leave the courtroom.

471
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,800
I am Seo Yak Jin who works at Mu Jin Human Rights Center.

472
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,670
This is a court case involving the hearing-impaired.

473
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,930
To assist these disabled people,
please arrange for a sign language interpreter.

474
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:29,100
Seo Yak Jin, please retire from the courtroom.

475
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,220
Objection.

476
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,600
Police guards, what are you doing there?

477
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,230
Quick, take her away.

478
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,600
Objection. I object to it.

479
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,110
Your Honor, objection.

480
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,360
Did I say the wrong thing?

481
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,360
Starting from now, even if it's a whisper,

482
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,910
I will also follow the law strictly
and take action on you.

483
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,870
Defendant, please continue.

484
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,240
Jesus will protect you.

485
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:56,620
Amen.

486
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,390
What? Rape.

487
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,140
You, this despicable person. In your eyes,
you can only see those dirty things?

488
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,770
Ajumma, what are you doing?

489
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,270
Where did this wretch girl pop up from?

490
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,640
Who are you exactly?

491
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,900
I'm Lee Gang Seok's wife.
What are you trying to do?

492
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,770
- You this wretch!
- Don't be like this.

493
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,280
How dare you sue my husband?

494
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:36,030
You thought that we can be easily bullied?

495
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,160
- Ajumma.
- I won't let you have your way, you wretch!

496
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,280
- Let go of me.
- You this devil.

497
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,790
Let go of me!

498
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,410
If your husband has done those things,

499
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,170
even if you kneel and beg for forgiveness
for a long time, he will still not be forgiven.
She still dare to behave so crazily towards me.

500
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,170
Ajussi, you are really different.

501
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,670
She spitted on your face and you just
calmly asked her why she did that.

502
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,050
Can I stay in your office this period of time?

503
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,430
-=Why?=-

504
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,430
Don't tell me you ran away from home.

505
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,560
Fired?

506
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,860
These people think that they could
just dismiss people as they wish.

507
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,030
Ajussi, you don't have to worry.

508
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,030
I will make sure they are punished by the law
and you can get back your job.

509
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:26,780
I really envy you.

510
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,830
You live such a simple life.

511
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,200
They really look down upon people.

512
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,580
My life is also not as smooth sailing as you thought.

513
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,080
I was only concerned with the latest fashion
and never go for a proper date.

514
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,210
Always getting zeros in school.
Cannot find any job.

515
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,260
And with this meagre salary from my current job...

516
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,890
Ajussi.

517
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,520
Have you regretted...

518
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,690
participating in such a thing?

519
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,250
Mom, you are really amazing.
You know that I receive my salary today.

520
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:27,250
I have remitted to you in the morning.
Visit the bank to check it out.

521
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,800
Yes, everything is well.

522
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,510
No. You come over. I'm very busy.

523
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,970
A lot of work in school.

524
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,390
After this busy period,
I will find time to come home.

525
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:00,940
I swear

526
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:04,570
by Almighty God that the evidence I
shall give will be the truth,

527
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,950
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

528
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,450
If I withhold any truths,

529
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,200
I will be punished by the law.

530
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,950
Witness O Jae Sik.

531
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,580
Defendant lawyer, you can start examination.

532
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,840
Mr. O Jae Sik.

533
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,720
What is your area of work in Ja Ae School?

534
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,720
I'm the security guard and also do night-duty.

535
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,720
How long have you been working in this area?

536
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,220
About 5 years.

537
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,970
So in the last 5 years,

538
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,230
you are by the side of the
Headmaster and Admin Head.

539
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,190
What is your opinion of them?

540
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:50,940
They are both good people.

541
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,690
- And they also take good care of me.
- Your Honor, objection.

542
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,450
These questions are unrelated to the case.

543
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,570
Objection sustained.

544
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,570
Please only raise questions related to this case.

545
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,960
Do you patrol around the school every night?

546
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,090
Yes. I patrol every 3 hours at night.

547
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,460
Right. So over the last 5 years,

548
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:20,720
did you see any instances where the Headmaster
and the Admin Head called the children individually

549
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,970
into the Headmaster Office and Admin Head Office
respectively after school?

550
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,390
I didn't see any such instances.

551
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,140
Sign language interpreter,
please let them know clearly

552
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,150
that if they continue to noisy,
I will ask them to leave the courtroom.

553
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,150
You mentioned before that on the day when
Gim Yeon Do was nearly violated,

554
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,150
you met Gang In Ho

555
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,400
in front of the toilet, right?

556
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,830
Yes.

557
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,820
What did he say to you?

558
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,170
He said he heard a child's voice
coming from inside the toilet.

559
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:56,550
So what did you do?

560
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,160
He asked me to check it out.

561
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:01,630
So I pushed open the toilet's door,

562
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,590
and stepped in to check.

563
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,460
Was there anyone inside?

564
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,340
No one.

565
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,800
Okay. I'm done with my questioning.

566
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,310
Prosecutor, it's your turn to cross examine.

567
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,690
Witness, where did you work
before this current job?

568
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:33,820
I previously worked as a security guard
at Mu Jin Primary School.

569
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,570
Why did you decide to transfer to this special school?

570
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:39,200
From what I know, you earn a lower salary at this
special school compared with the previous one.

571
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,460
That was because...

572
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,070
Because when you're in Mu Jin Primary School,

573
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,200
you were caught stealing school's properties.

574
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,330
It is still on police records. Is it true?

575
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:52,000
You were dismissed by the school
and was unemployed for 3 years.

576
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:55,880
- Your Honor. The Prosecutor is asking
questions not related to this case.
- No, it's related.

577
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,500
Because there exists some kind of promise

578
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:01,130
between the school and its staff.

579
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,020
That's why such immoral thing is connived.

580
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,390
People are kept completely in the dark
and it was not uncovered till now.

581
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:11,140
It's even possible that this is the
key to solving this whole case.

582
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,520
Objection overruled. Please continue.

583
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,940
How did you get the job in this school?

584
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,940
It definitely not easy getting in
relying on your curriculum vitae.

585
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,820
I was introduced by an associate.

586
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,820
That's right. Because you were
introduced by an associate.

587
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,700
Also you gave money in the name of the school
development fund. Finally you got this post and
started work in the school.

588
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,320
But what if this case causes the school to close down.

589
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,570
You will lose everything and become homeless.

590
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,200
Was that the truth?

591
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,830
I'm done with my questions.

592
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:43,210
Witness, are you the doctor that came
with the staff of Human Rights Center?

593
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,220
Yes.

594
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,460
What's the outcome of the examination?

595
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,210
There are symptoms of
inflammation in her genitalia.

596
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,760
Her hymen was already torn.

597
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:57,260
Is sexual abuse the only way in
which a young girl's hymen is torn?

598
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,020
No. Cycling or

599
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,810
masturbation may tore it too.

600
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,690
As a gynecologist,

601
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:09,310
- you must have examined
many patients who are sexually abused.
- Yes.

602
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,110
Normally, what's the condition of such patients?

603
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,780
The genitalia tear will be more serious.

604
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:20,910
Furthermore, they will feel humiliated
and almost out of their mind.

605
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,660
So when you were examining Jin Yu Ri,
what was her condition?

606
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,240
She was munching biscuits.

607
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,660
She was extremely calm even to an extent

608
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,670
that I thought she wasn't violated.

609
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,260
She also didn't have any bruises or wounds.

610
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:43,800
In other words, you don't think
she had been violated, right?

611
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,550
Yes.

612
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,180
I'm done with my questions.

613
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,930
This doctor is the general secretary
of Mu Jin Girls' High School Alumni.

614
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,780
That woman is the Chairman.

615
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,190
Your Honor.

616
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,200
What is this?

617
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,820
This is the preliminary analysis report
for Jin Yu Ri written by the witness.

618
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:10,950
Am I holding the actual
preliminary analysis report?

619
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:16,950
In other words, you had
written 2 analysis reports, right?

620
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,080
That was because...

621
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,460
You just have to answer Yes or No.

622
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,220
Then let us take a look at the first analysis report.

623
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:29,090
The patient's genital injury and
the tearing of her hymen

624
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,230
were not caused by recent

625
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,090
sexual intercourse.

626
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,360
But in the subsequent analysis report,
you said that

627
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:40,220
sexual intercourse was highly unlikely the cause.
Instead, you wrote that it was

628
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,610
caused by other reasons.

629
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:43,850
This is different from the first report.

630
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,600
What's the reason for judging that
it wasn't due to sexual intercourse
in the second report?

631
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,610
- What's the reason for changing the analysis report?
- At that time, I...

632
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,740
didn't know that it will have
implications on such a serious matter.

633
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,990
Don't tell me that a doctor's analysis report
will differ according to how serious the matter is.

634
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,120
In the first analysis report,

635
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,910
you wrote that it wasn't due to
recent sexual intercourse.

636
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,710
Then, it means that you believe she
had sexual intercourse in the past. Am I right?

637
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,830
Witness, why did you change your testimony?

638
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,500
Is it really because of the seriousness of this case?

639
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,140
No, it is not.

640
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:21,270
I felt that the damage to her hymen

641
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:22,930
was not something that happened recently.

642
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:28,230
Instead, it had happened at least 5 years ago.

643
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,850
If it's 5 years ago,
the victim was only 9 years old.

644
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,230
It's really too young for her to have intercourse.
Therefore...

645
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,480
I like to ask

646
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:40,230
Is it really possibly for her to be involved in
intercourse with an adult man?

647
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,110
Even if it's possible,

648
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,490
without the consent and coordination by the female,
this sort of thing couldn't happen, isn't it?

649
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,120
Silence.

650
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,380
Silence.

651
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:14,390
-=Min Su, you have no appetite?
Do you want me to order other food for you?=-

652
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:22,390
-=Yeon Do, you are not hungry?=-

653
01:11:54,850 --> 01:12:01,470
-=When I was young, I came to the beach
before with my father and mother.=-

654
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:06,350
-=That was before I was deaf...=-

655
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:14,980
-=At that time, I heard the sound of
wave crashing into the shore.=-

656
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,860
-=But now it's very quiet.=-

657
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:31,120
-=The best and most beautiful things in the world=-

658
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:36,000
-=cannot be seen or even touched.=-

659
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:44,130
-=They must be felt with the heart.=-

660
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:52,510
-=This is a quote by Helen Keller,=-

661
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:56,010
-=and it's my favorite quote.=-

662
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,030
What did she say?

663
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,160
She said it would be good if I were her father.

664
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,170
She said it would be good if you were her mother.

665
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,920
Hey, she's already talking like an adult.

666
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:42,550
Until now, I don't even had a proper love relationship.

667
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,930
How can she match us together?

668
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,550
Ajussi, don't dream. There's not a hope for you.

669
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:51,680
Why?

670
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,810
Why don't you answer me?

671
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,440
Quickly answer me.

672
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,810
I am the one who has been
taken advantage of, not you.

673
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,310
Who said you had been taken advantage of?

674
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,320
You said it yourself.

675
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,960
First, the examination of the defendants.

676
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:22,000
Looking at the child who is sitting here.
What's your feelings?

677
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:24,840
With things being in this state.

678
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,930
In any case, she was victimized by you all.

679
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,140
I am always curious

680
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,640
who was the one who spread these absurd rumors?

681
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:42,390
- But it looks like I could vaguely
remember the child's face...
- Defendant.

682
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:46,020
You mean you cannot remember clearly

683
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,690
that child that sued you for sexually abuse?

684
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:52,940
Although I saw her a few times...

685
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:56,070
The Headmaster is not wrong.

686
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,570
That child is also intellectually disabled.

687
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,580
So I also remembered caressing her head a few times.

688
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,240
Defendant Pak Bo Hyeon, how about you?

689
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:12,120
She belongs to my class.
I have no reason not to know her.

690
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:17,470
I have always love and treasure these children.

691
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:20,730
Among them,

692
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,600
Who was the one who removed
your clothes and made you painful?

693
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,810
All 3 of them.

694
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,320
How many times?

695
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,580
Many times. Many, many times.

696
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,580
Do you still remember when it first started?

697
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,710
It started when I was in Primary 3.

698
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,100
Admin Head would always give me money
every time he did that thing to me.

699
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,350
Every time he would give me 1000 Won to buy biscuits.

700
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,600
Admin Head removed my pants.

701
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:29,730
It's too painful. I said no and pushed him away.

702
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:32,480
Because I was too scared, I tried to escape.

703
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:36,610
However, Admin Head grabbed hold of me

704
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,860
and pinned me on the table.

705
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:47,000
He also tied up my hands and legs.

706
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,520
<i>They were all lies.</i>

707
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:19,770
Your Honor, she's a lunatic!

708
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,650
Don't believe in her words.

709
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,230
<i>They were all lies.</i>

710
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:27,240
<i>- How dare you say such lies!
- Silence.</i>

711
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,240
<i>Did someone incite you to say all these?</i>

712
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:33,620
<i>- Exactly who incited you to say such lies?
- Silence!</i>

713
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,250
Settlement? The children were sexually abused.
Why should there be a settlement?

714
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,500
Yes, according to the Prosecutor.

715
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,880
Children who are 13 years old and above
and suffered from sexually abuse.

716
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,630
If they agree to a settlement,
their testimony will all become invalid.

717
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,510
If one really met with such a thing,
will one agrees to settle outside court?

718
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,010
Yeon Do's parents are gone.
Nothing much can be done.

719
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:02,640
But Min Su and Yu Ri's parents
are mentally retarded.

720
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,270
They are really a pack of beasts.

721
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:09,270
Bullying those children with no parents.

722
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,400
Once Yu Ri and Min Su agree to the settlement,

723
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,780
then what's left will only be

724
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,660
the Headmaster's sexually abuse case on Yeon Do.

725
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:02,820
Professor.

726
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:17,120
I'm really very sorry to ask
to see you so abruptly.

727
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:23,880
No, it's okay. I should have visited you.

728
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,630
<i>I roughly heard about the case from Lawyer Hwang.</i>

729
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:33,130
I was the one who recommended you to that school.

730
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,800
So I am sandwiched in the middle
and my position is a bit awkward.

731
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,730
I am sorry.

732
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,520
You don't have to feel apologetic to me.

733
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,270
But if this case continues to drag,

734
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,360
you also won't get any benefits out of it.

735
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,990
This is the money that you
donated to the school previously.

736
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:05,120
And we added a bit more to it.

737
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,620
I hope to settle the case with Yeon Do.

738
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:14,380
Appreciate if Mr. Gang could help out.

739
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:17,840
If you are willing to help us,

740
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,220
we will be responsible for the expenses
to send Yeon Do to university.

741
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,510
We will also send her abroad to further study.

742
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,100
Of course, you should continue to draw.

743
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,850
I feel it's a pity if you have to
give up your future in this area.

744
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,410
I have already made arrangements
for you to join a school in Seoul.

745
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:44,030
You just have to work hard for
another 1 to 2 terms over there.

746
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,780
I have already settled it with the school.

747
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,530
They would convert you to permanent staff.

748
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,370
I'm sorry, Professor.

749
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,500
I have some other things on.
I'm leaving first.

750
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,050
Mr. Gang.

751
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,810
You should give a thought to
your daughter who's still young.

752
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,720
I heard your daughter is quite sick.

753
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:13,480
The negotiation for settlement
had been completed.

754
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:17,600
It seems that Yu Ri's father
was convinced by his relatives.

755
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,860
You know it very well.

756
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,490
Yu Ri's father is mentally retarded. So...

757
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:47,380
-=Yeon Do, are you confident to
articulate your statement clearly?=-

758
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,890
What are you doing here?

759
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:04,020
You said that you were very busy at school
and so you couldn't return home.

760
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,770
Is this place your school?

761
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:12,020
Are you thinking that people
might not believe in your words,

762
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,650
that's why you chose not to tell me?

763
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,400
Think of yourself first.

764
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,410
Take good care of your family.

765
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,910
It's no use saying the right things.

766
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,790
I have to go in.

767
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,040
To you,

768
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,420
is this child more important than

769
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,920
your daughter Song In?

770
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:55,190
I was present when the child
met with that sort of thing.

771
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:03,490
But I was helpless.

772
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,160
If I were to give up now,

773
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:13,250
I'm not confident to be a good father to Song In.

774
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:17,870
Gim Yeon Do.

775
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:22,920
You said that the Headmaster violated you.

776
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,880
Was that the truth?

777
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,380
Yes.

778
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,880
Are you usually in good terms
with the Headmaster?

779
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:36,930
No.

780
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,100
Then how would you know that

781
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,480
the person who violated you was the Headmaster?

782
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:47,100
Because I met him a few times in school.

783
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:50,480
Furthermore, that person dragged me
into the Headmaster Office that night.

784
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,610
In that case, between the 2 persons over there,

785
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:58,370
which one is the Headmaster?

786
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,830
Objection.

787
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,080
He cannot request the victim

788
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:13,460
to confirm the identity of a suspect
whom had already been confirmed.

789
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,960
This is a very important question.

790
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,210
She said that she was violated by the Headmaster.

791
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,720
To the victim, it's just an encounter.

792
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:24,090
However, if we look from the perspective of
the Headmaster and his younger twin brother.

793
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,520
It's possible that the real culprit wasn't
the Headmaster but his younger brother.

794
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,520
Then Headmaster Lee Gang Seok

795
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,770
would no longer be a suspect.

796
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:37,850
Objection overruled. Please continue.

797
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,230
Between the two, who's the one who harm you?

798
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,620
Your Honor, Yeon Do requests to
take a closer look at them.

799
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,750
Agree.

800
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:38,820
Prisoner with serial number 4022

801
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,580
is indeed the defendant, Headmaster Lee Gang Seok.

802
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,410
But,

803
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,160
How did you recognize him?

804
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:50,040
Does Lee Gang Seok have any special features?

805
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,670
Headmaster and Admin Head

806
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:54,430
both do not know sign language.

807
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:57,670
But on the night when Headmaster
did that to me in the toilet,

808
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:02,300
and every time when he did bad things on Yu Ri,
he would always made one hand sign.

809
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:04,140
What's the hand sign?

810
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,010
If you dare to tell others, I will kill you.

811
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,310
I performed this hand sign to both of them.

812
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:14,310
Only one of them understood this
and his facial expression changed.

813
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,530
Hence, this person must be the Headmaster.

814
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:36,120
Yeon Do, according to your testimony,

815
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,370
after dinner,

816
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:43,750
on your way home after buying a bowl of noodles,
you noticed that Yu Ri had disappeared, right?

817
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:47,380
After that, you saw the Headmaster

818
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:49,630
sexually abusing Yu Ri in the Headmaster Office.

819
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,760
Was that the truth?

820
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,350
Yes.

821
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,100
In this hearing,

822
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,220
on your way to the dormitory,
you heard faint music coming
from the Headmaster Office.

823
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:07,110
So you changed your direction and
walked towards it to find out more, right?

824
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,020
Yes.

825
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,740
Your Honor.

826
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,360
This is it.

827
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,410
Faint music.

828
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:24,410
Everyone knows that Yeon Do is deaf.

829
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,540
But yet she could hear music.

830
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:30,040
This deaf child, upon hearing music, walked towards it.

831
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,420
When she reached the source of the music,

832
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:35,210
she saw the Headmaster raping her friend.

833
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:38,130
Your Honor.

834
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,600
This testimony is so absurd!

835
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,720
- To come up with such absurd testimony...
- She said she didn't lie.

836
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,970
She really heard very faint music.

837
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:53,220
It's a song from Jo Sung Mo.

838
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,520
Witness, you have impaired hearing,

839
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:02,070
but you can still hear music, right?

840
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:06,950
Yes.

841
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,860
Yeon Do.

842
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,370
From now onwards, we are running a test
to check whether you can hear music.

843
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,670
If you hear music, please raise your hand.

844
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:24,830
Begin.

845
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,040
I recognized the witness's account.

846
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:47,040
Forensic Branch, please submit a report to the court

847
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:48,910
as regards to Yeon Do's suspect identification.

848
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,040
The next hearing is this Friday.

849
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,920
Prosecutor and Defendant Lawyer,

850
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:56,290
if you have new witnesses,
please reapply to court.

851
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:42,210
What did all those adults do to these little children?

852
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,210
When you are done with it,
return home quickly.

853
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:21,200
Miss Seo.

854
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,450
Why are you here?

855
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,960
Looks like you have guessed correctly.

856
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,580
Correct. That is the...

857
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:38,840
contract.

858
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:42,640
When Min Su's grandmother saw the money,

859
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,260
she immediately signed the contract.

860
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:49,010
Really funny.

861
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:52,640
No matter how poor or how illiterate you are,

862
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:56,270
it's your own grandchildren
who met with such a thing.

863
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,400
Just because of money,
they agreed to settle outside court.

864
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,650
Well, of course.

865
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,900
It's not something that I cannot comprehend.

866
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:09,160
She has a son but he lies on
the hospital bed all day long.

867
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:12,910
Her daughter-in-law eloped.

868
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:16,160
Moreover, her grandchildren

869
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,790
are deaf and mute.

870
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,920
Even I feel that

871
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:27,920
God is a bit too much.

872
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:06,080
-=Teacher, when I'm giving my testimony,
can I have this in front of me?=-

873
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:14,090
-=I also want to give a good
performance just like Yeon Do.
But I'm not confident of myself.=-

874
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,340
-=So I have written them down here.=-

875
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:23,220
-=When Mr. Pak Bo Hyeon did that sort of thing
to my younger brother and me.=-

876
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:26,470
Min Su!

877
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:31,600
-=Originally, you need to give a testimony.=-

878
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:37,820
-=But you cannot do it anymore.=-

879
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:41,190
-=Why?=-

880
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:48,450
-=Your grandmother=-

881
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,950
-=has forgiven Mr. Pak Bo Hyeon.=-

882
01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:05,050
-=Those people begged your
grandmother to forgive them.=-

883
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:09,420
-=Your grandmother is a kind person, so...=-

884
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:30,940
-=He killed my younger brother! He killed him!=-

885
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:34,440
-=When he saw my brother and me,
he would beat us and remove our pants.=-

886
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,080
Min Su!

887
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:43,450
-=Who said to forgive him?
I have not forgiven him!=-

888
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:47,000
-=He didn't apologize to my brother and me.=-

889
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:49,370
-=How could he be forgiven?=-

890
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:55,250
-=You promised that you would make sure
those people are punished.=-

891
01:36:55,260 --> 01:37:00,760
-=Teacher, didn't you make that promise?=-

892
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,760
I am sorry, Min Su.

893
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,770
I am sorry.

894
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:49,630
Yeon Do.

895
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:58,640
Why?

896
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:02,390
-=I have something to tell you.=-

897
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,020
-=What is it?=-

898
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:10,150
-=That time, I forgot to say=-

899
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:21,660
-=that when I was dragged into the Headmaster Office,
the picture that was showing on the television...=-

900
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:31,670
-=That movie with nude man and woman.=-

901
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:37,220
-=Although I'm not certain, that man...=-

902
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,550
Will there really be that type of thing?

903
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:45,930
Even if there is,

904
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,650
it will not be left here.

905
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,520
The Headmaster was arrested suddenly that day.

906
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:53,770
He didn't have the time to destroy it.

907
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:56,060
He could ask someone else to do it.

908
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:59,190
Who could he find? His wife?

909
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:03,320
His wife trusts him so much.
Could he let her know that he's a pervert?

910
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:05,690
Could he get his lover Yun Ja Ae to do it?

911
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:10,570
That's right. If Yun Ja Ae knew about it,
she would throw him into the washing machine.

912
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,300
It's so nauseating.

913
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,580
The date on the video cassette tape

914
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:59,710
is consistent with the one in Yeon Do's testimony.

915
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,210
You mentioned previously that

916
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:04,710
for child above 13 years old,
the case is closed after
settlement with the family.

917
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,590
The date was 14 March.

918
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,010
It means that Yu Ri hasn't reached
the age of 13 yet. In other words...

919
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,050
In other words,

920
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:14,180
if he sexually abused a child less than 13 years old,

921
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:17,050
he could still be sentenced
even if there exists settlement.

922
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:21,180
Moreover, with such clear-cut evidence,

923
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:23,430
Even if the defendant has "Jeon Gwan Ye U",

924
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,680
it would also be useless.

925
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,940
The final trial is just a few days away.

926
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:28,690
Will there still be a retrial?

927
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,690
Even if there is a retrial,

928
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:33,440
we cannot show this evidence in court.

929
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:35,570
Then what should we do?

930
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,070
Do not worry.

931
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,820
I will go and find the judge personally,

932
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,200
and present this evidence.

933
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:13,640
The 3 defendants.

934
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:16,900
Despite being teachers of the deaf school,

935
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,650
they sexually abused the young students.

936
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:23,270
It's an unpardonable criminal behavior.

937
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:26,870
And violated the social responsibility

938
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:29,740
of protecting disabled children.

939
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,740
Making these victims the targets
of their sexual pleasure,

940
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,490
sexually harassed them,

941
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,410
or violated them.

942
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:39,080
They should be punished severely.

943
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,790
But,

944
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,290
the defendants have made great contributions
to the development of the city,

945
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,550
and have no previous criminal records.

946
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,140
Furthermore, the families of victim Jun Yu Ri

947
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:54,050
and victim Jeon Min Su

948
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,680
had already reached a settlement
with the defendants.

949
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:00,560
For the sake that the defendants
had taken care of their children before,

950
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,560
they had written a plea for the defendants.
With consideration of all the above,

951
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,310
the following sentences are meted out.

952
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:11,480
Defendant Pak Bo Hyeon.

953
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:14,610
Sentenced to 8 months of imprisonment
and 2 years on probation.

954
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:20,280
Defendant Lee Gang Bok.

955
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:23,450
Sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment
and 1 year on probation.

956
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:26,500
Defendant Lee Gang Seok.

957
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,790
Sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment
and 1 year on probation.

958
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:32,420
Prosector.

959
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:34,290
After the end of this trial,

960
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:38,090
carry out the procedures on
the release of the defendants.

961
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:32,610
You have really worked hard.

962
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:34,860
It's not really hard work.

963
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:36,860
I'm only doing justice to you.

964
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:39,110
Doing justice.

965
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,740
Justice always triumph.

966
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:44,620
This is so well said.

967
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:52,370
I am sorry.

968
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:55,380
I didn't fulfill my promise.

969
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:01,010
Take a look at the children before going.

970
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:11,930
That judge.

971
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,680
I should go and express my gratitude to him.

972
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:16,060
You don't have to go personally.

973
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:18,560
Jeon Gwan Ye U. This is expected.

974
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:22,190
When I met him in classmate
gathering in the future,

975
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,440
I will treat him to drinks.

976
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:28,570
By the way,

977
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:31,820
how did you manage to bribe the Prosecutor?

978
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:35,080
That person has no promotion opportunities,

979
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:37,330
or any other options.
He's always roaming on the fringe.

980
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:38,830
In other words,

981
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:41,710
he can no longer carry on in this circle.

982
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,960
I told him that I will give him a job in my law firm.

983
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:48,840
He was exuberant hearing it.

984
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:04,480
What's wrong? Are you hungry?

985
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:29,000
Min Su has gone to look for Pak Bo Hyeon.

986
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:30,870
He said he wanted revenge.

987
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,130
I'm going over there now.
Please hurry over.

988
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:37,880
Ajussi, are you still on the phone?

989
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,530
Oh it's you, Min Su.

990
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,410
Are you thinking of me?

991
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,790
You are even drenched.

992
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,590
Let's go for a bath together.

993
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:41,350
Min Su! Min Su! Min Su!

994
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:43,470
Anyone inside?

995
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:47,230
Min Su! Min Su!

996
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,870
Go to hell!

997
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:09,620
Min Su!

998
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:14,000
I treated you so well in the past.

999
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:17,380
How can you do this to me?
You this brat.

1000
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,630
How dare you try to stab me!

1001
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:23,140
I'm going to beat you to death!

1002
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,780
Min Su!

1003
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:49,910
Min Su!

1004
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,410
Min Su!

1005
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:07,300
You brat, how can you do this to me?

1006
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:23,770
<i>We are from Mu Jin Police Station.</i>

1007
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:26,570
<i>Listen up, everyone.</i>

1008
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:29,070
<i>By gathering here,</i>

1009
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:33,070
<i>you have violated Demonstration
Act, Article 6, Item 1 on illegal gathering.</i>

1010
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,830
All of you are

1011
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,330
illegally occupying the roads.

1012
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:41,830
And jeopardizing the lives of the kind residents.

1013
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:45,080
I hope you will disperse immediately.

1014
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:53,220
Your demonstration now

1015
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:55,590
is not allowed and is an illegal demonstration.

1016
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:57,850
Please disperse immediately.

1017
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,350
I going to make the announcement again.

1018
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:03,100
Now, everyone of you

1019
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:05,730
is illegally occupying the roads.

1020
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,100
If you don't disperse immediately,

1021
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:11,610
we will charge you under the
Demonstration Act and Traffic Regulation.

1022
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,490
That's right.

1023
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:20,240
They cannot hear me.

1024
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:55,060
What is going on? Hurry to open fire.

1025
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:02,610
Let go of me!

1026
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,740
This child...

1027

Neither can he hear nor can he speak.

is called Min Su.

1030

He's a child who cannot hear

01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:26,510
and cannot speak.

1044
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:37,540
<i>It seems like I haven't contacted you for a long time.</i>

1045
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,040
<i>Many things happened during this period.</i>

1046
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,670
<i>There are good ones</i>

1047
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,420
<i>and bad ones.</i>

1048

<i>Let me tell you the bad thing first.</i>

1049
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:52,340
<i>We are still unsuccessful with the appeal.</i>

1050
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:56,600
<i>The main problem is still because of
the settlements that the families entered in.</i>

1051
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,970
<i>The good thing is that many people
have come forward to help the children.</i>

1052
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:05,850
<i>Because of them, the children who quitted
from Ja Ae School have a place to live in.</i>

1053
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:09,730
<i>There are also people who provided free food.</i>

1054
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:13,230
<i>Yu Ri is undergoing psychological treatment.</i>

1055
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,480
<i>She is healthier now.</i>

1056
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,990
<i>She is also more jovial these days.</i>

1057
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,360
<i>And she will even teach me sign language.</i>

1058
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,620
<i>Yeon Do said that she wants to be
an art teacher when she grows up.</i>

1059
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,500
<i>She said she wanted to me like you</i>

1060
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:31,370
<i>helping sick children.</i>

1061
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:36,250
<i>Once during dinner time,
I asked Yeon Do and Yu Ri,</i>

1062
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:39,380
<i>what's the greatest difference before</i>

1063
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:43,630
<i>and after this incident?</i>

1064
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:47,140
<i>The children said,</i>

1065
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:50,510
<i>"We now know that we are no difference from others."</i>

1066
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:53,640
<i>"We are treasured by people too."</i>

1067
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:57,900
<i>Watching these children growing up gradually,</i>

1068
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:01,270
<i>it comes to my mind that</i>

1069
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,520
<i>the reason why we are fighting so hard,</i>

1070
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:06,530
<i>is not to change the world</i>

1071
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:11,410
<i>but instead not to let the world change us.</i>

1072
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:15,910
<i>The weather has become colder.</i>

1073
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,790
<i>Winter is cold</i>

1074
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,160
<i>because it wants us to appreciate</i>

1075
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:24,290
<i>the warmth from our surrounding people.
It's so precious!</i>

<i>Although we are not by your side,</i>

1077

<i>I hope you can feel</i>

<i>the warmth given out by the children and me.</i>
