It's good.

(LOWERING VOLUME)

162
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,255
Let me know
if you need me.

163
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,263
I don't see why
we can't just
watch TV like usual.

164
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,431
ALIKE: Shut up.

165
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,600
You shut up!
AUDREY: Girls!

166
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,685
(PHONE RINGING)

167
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,563
I was expecting a call.

168
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,611
ARTHUR: Hello?

169
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,447
Yeah.

170
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,949
It's your father's
night off.

171
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,618
Straighten up.

172
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,792
(SIGHS)

173
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,710
SHARONDA: So,
Homecoming got
moved up this year.

174
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,338
It's actually going to
be in September
instead of October.

175
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,215
AUDREY: Really?
Yeah, which means
that I can actually

176
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,217
go to the Autumn Ball
and the Homecoming Dance.

177
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,385
Who're you going
to go with?

178
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,720
I don't know, uh,
maybe Derek,
if he asks me.

179
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,888
Or maybe Parrish.

180
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,140
But I know for Homecoming
that I definitely want to
go with Craig.

181
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,977
And who are you going
to go with, Lee?

182
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,562
I'm not going.

183
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,065
AUDREY: What do you mean,
you're not going?

184
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,233
It's your junior year!

185
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,401
Leave her alone,
Audrey.

186
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,403
If she doesn't want to go,
she doesn't have to go.

187
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,072
But she's a junior.
She's not going to
have any memories!

188
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,198
I don't like
all those boys

189
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,325
buzzing around
my daughters anyway.
Nobody's buzzing around Alike.

190
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,077
ARTHUR: That's right,
and it better
stay that way.

191
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,662
Matter of fact,
I'm not sure if
I'm gonna let you go.

192
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,288
SHARONDA: Dad!

193
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,124
Shut up!
(LAUGHING)

194
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,460
So what are
your memories, Mother?

195
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,254
I got plenty
of memories.

196
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,755
Like?

197
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,508
I'm just saying,
share with us.

198
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,759
SHARONDA:
Did you go to prom?

199
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,094
Yes, I went to prom.

200
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,887
Who'd you go with?

201
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,598
Are you comfortable
with this?

202
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,976
I'm fine.
She asked you.

203
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,519
Did you have sex
at prom?

204
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,895
ARTHUR: Hey, hey, hey!

205
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,814
(ALIKE LAUGHS)
ARTHUR: Relax.

206
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,108
SHARONDA: I'm definitely
having sex at prom.

207
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,568
ALIKE: Oh, my God!

208
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,278
ARTHUR: No,
you're definitely
not going to prom.

209
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,655
You're not having sex
for 10 more years, so...

210
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,407
SHARONDA: Ten years?

211
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,783
At least.

212
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,577
That's like 25!

213
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,619
Exactly.
That's early for me.

214
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,871
That's an
inappropriate
question.

215
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,582
SHARONDA: Is that
how old you were
when you first had sex?

216
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,791
That's how old you'll be
when you find out.

217
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,710
AUDREY: This isn't
dinner conversation.
(ALIKE LAUGHING)

218
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,503
Okay.
AUDREY: Guys...

219
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,557
Oh. Oh, my God.
(LAUGHING)

220
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,935
That's just
embarrassing, girl.

221
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,145
ALIKE: You ain't got
no range either!

222
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,022
Well, at least I hit
the backboard, damn.

what's the score?

226
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,908
One up.

227
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,075
One?
Yup.

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,745
Girl, I got at least three.
Definitely three, come on.

cheat me, too?

Sure, go ahead.

Oh, thank you.

236
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,260
What you got there?
You been shopping?

237
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,345
Mmm-mmm.
Just some yogurt.

238
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,639
Some vanilla yogurt.

239
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,599
No, I mean in the bag.

240
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,519
What do you got
in the bag?
That big red thing?

241
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,812
Oh...

where my mind is.

That's really nice.

00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,658
Isn't that cute?

249
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,618
Yeah! Is that
for your daughter?

250
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,579
Yeah, yeah.
It's for Alike.

251
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Oh, the youngest one.

252
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,374
No, the oldest one.

Oh. Okay. Yeah.

Why, you think
it's too young?

Oh, no!
For some reason
the youngest one

just popped
into my head first,
that's all.

it'll be fine.

it'll compliment
her figure.

You see,
that's what I thought.
Yeah.

263
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,105
For some reason,
Lee just doesn't like

anything I pick out
for her anymore.

from buying her
any more clothes.

gift cards now.

she done got!

475
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,474
That's okay.
Oh, it tastes
so much better.

476
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,642
Just leave it.
ALIKE: Dad...

477
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,477
Lee!
Leave me out of it.

478
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,645
Now go get changed.

479
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,230
Dad, what's wrong
with this outfit?

480
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,398
Nothing.
ALIKE: See.

481
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,649
I'm not going to
argue with you.

482
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,234
Do what she says.
Dad!

483
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,402
(SPEAKING SWAHILl)

484
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,362
And put on a skirt!

485
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,159
Give me a beer, please.

486
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,493
It's Sunday morning.

487
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,829
It goes with
the spaghetti.

488
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,591
Too much lip gloss.

489
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,761
Did you talk to her?

490
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,263
Sharonda's fine.

491
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,265
I'm talking
about Lee.
Alike.

492
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,683
And I don't see that
there's a problem.

493
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,103
I'm tired of
this whole tomboy thing
she's been doing.

494
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,271
And Laura.

495
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,523
You said that
you were going
to handle it.

496
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:26,691
Mmm-hmm.

497
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,776
She needs
a male point of view!

498
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,904
I said okay, damn it.

499
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,451
Do you have
to work tonight?

500
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,913
To put food on the table
and clothes on our backs, no.

501
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:43,583
To go out to restaurants
and keep designer sneakers
in the closet, yes.

502
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,251
Are you forever
gonna be mad?

503
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,004
Are you forever
gonna be happy?

504
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,090
You made that decision
a long time ago.

505
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,135
We both made sacrifices.

506
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,974
You look beautiful, baby.
(CHUCKLING)

507
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,392
Tuck your blouse in.

508
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,311
This isn't me.
AUDREY: Tuck it in.

509
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,938
Leave it out.

510
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,440
I think it's fine out.

511
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,487
Are you coming with us?

512
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,113
Nope. Sleep.

513
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,157
We could do
a later service.
Maybe the one o'clock.

514
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,117
I said no!
SHARONDA: I'm ready!

515
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,495
Sharonda, Alike,
you look beautiful.

516
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,956
Everybody looks
beautiful, okay?

517
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,510
Well, fine then.

518
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,387
Stop hitting me.
Put this one in then.

519
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,972
"God's love"?
I don't think so.
Put it in.

520
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,139
Stop!
Put in that one.

521
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,225
Audrey, hey!
Hi!

522
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,060
How're you
doing, girl?
All right.

523
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,563
I'm not touching you.
Stop!

524
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,899
I'm not touching you!
Sharonda, stop!

525
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,067
Ouch!

526
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,319
Lee, there's somebody
I want you to meet.
That's just mean.

527
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,697
Huh?
Here's somebody
I want you to meet.

528
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,282
Oh, hi.

529
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,618
Get down out of the car
and come speak!

530
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,707
What's wrong
with you?
All right, Mom.

531
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,375
You'll have to
excuse my daughter,

532
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,835
she's been
feeling rude lately.

533
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,378
Oh, don't worry
about it.

534
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,088
I understand
how it is.

535
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,799
Hormones, you know.
It's just a phase.

536
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,594
Alike, this is
Mrs. Singletary,
one of my coworkers,

537
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,054
and her daughter Bina.

538
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,306
Hi.

539
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,642
And that's my youngest
daughter Sharonda.

540
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,894
BINA: Hey.
MRS. SINGLETARY: Hi, there.
Nice to meet you.

541
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,104
(CHUCKLES)

542
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,982
Lee, Bina goes
to your school.

543
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,233
ALIKE: Cool.

544
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,820
Yeah, I think
I've seen you around,
um, Mrs. Alvarado's class?

545
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,322
AP English?

546
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,573
Yup.

547
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,659
Well, now that
we're all acquainted
with one another,

548
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,827
let's not be strangers.

549
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,330
Oh, no, no, we won't.
Right, honey?

550
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,623
Bina, you know,
I think you two

551
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,833
even go to school
the same way.

552
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,209
MRS. SINGLETARY: Oh! Well,
you know,

553
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,378
there's something
to be said about
safety in numbers, right?

554
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,755
AUDREY: Yup.
Yeah.

555
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,675
MRS. SINGLETARY: Well,
you know, we need
to be pushing off.

556
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,719
I'll call you about
the VBS workbooks.

557
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,387
All righty. All righty.
Take care.
All right?

558
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,930
Great.
Come on, honey.
Bye!

559
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,223
MRS. SINGLETARY: So,
where you wanna go?

560
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,641
Um, I want to
get those pancakes.

561
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,687
(SIGHS)

562
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,856
Oops.

563
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,399
You're funny.

564
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,526
I don't know
what your problem is.

565
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,736
SHARONDA: Mom, can you
put this in please?

566
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,905
I don't know
what you think this
is going to change.

567
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,616
I know God doesn't
make mistakes.

568
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,702
I know that.

569
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,622
Now, you may not
like Bina,

570
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,457
but you're going
to be spending
a whole lot less time

571
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,666
with that Laura
person.

572
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,293
Mom, can you
just put this in?
I can guarantee you that.

573
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,087
No, shh, be quiet,
I'm not putting
anything in.

574
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,547
I'm going to listen
to what I want to
listen to for a change.

575
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,174
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

576
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,304
Look, I just
don't like lying
to my mother, that's all.

577
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,181
So then don't,
she doesn't
have to know.

578
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,308
Yes, she does,
she asks me every day!

579
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,893
So, then,
tell her yeah.

580
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,104
No! I don't want
to lie just to
cover for you.

581
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,438
So don't!

582
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:56,651
Look, Alike, or Lee
or whatever it is
you want to be called,

583
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,861
I'm really not
trying to hang out
with you either, okay,

584
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,571
but I'm not about
to take an L for it.

585
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,739
So just stop
dodging me!

586
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,241
Let's just go
to school together
and then...

587
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,160
Then it's over with,
we don't have to hang out
with each other after that.

588
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,412
You know what,
whatever!

589
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,996
She asks me again
I'm gonna tell her,

590
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,164
and then she's gonna
tell your mother,

591
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,291
and then it's
whatever for you.

592
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,920
Hey!
Hey, look, I'm sorry!

593
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,133
Look, I'm sorry!

594
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,429
Hello,
I said I'm sorry!

595
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,848
Yeah, you sorry
your mother's about
to bug out.

596
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,183
No, for real,
I'm sorry.

597
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,145
I didn't mean
to be that way,
it's just...

598
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,606
Okay, look,
I am concerned
my mom will find out,

599
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,400
but it's...
But...

600
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,777
It's not like that,
it's just that she's...

601
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,029
Look, if you
knew my mother,
you'd understand.

602
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,614
She's...
Overprotective?

603
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,784
Yeah.
Yeah, I know,
I've seen her.

604
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,872
I see what she's like,
but lots of people's
parents are like that.

605
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,415
Yeah?
Yeah.

606
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,501
Yeah, but
not like mine.

607
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,962
Anyway...
Anyway, like I said,
let's just walk.

608
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,968
Thank you so much
for bringing that.

609
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,428
No problem.

610
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,221
You done studying yet?

611
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,681
No.

612
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,224
Did you start
studying yet?

613
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,895
I'm on chapter nine.
Now, stop.

614
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,149
Get them fucking cards
out of here.

615
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,859
No, we gonna
study these words.

616
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,152
I ain't studying.
We can play
'em like Tonk.

617
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,154
We can play Spades with
these vocabulary cards.

618
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,864
Get outta here, yo.
I'm about to
deal you in.

619
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,073
I'm gonna deal you in.

620
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,700
So, listen, I'm gonna
work some more hours
so we could...

621

"Listless, apathetic,
having no interest
in anything." That's yours.

622
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,412
Listen!
I have a job.

623
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,247
I'll work
some more hours.
I don't need school.

624
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,417
"Clandestine, secret,
hidden, undercover."
Not you.

625

Annoying,
you annoying me.
Like, really.

"...agitated, unruly."
That's yours.

628
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,761
Anyway, how much
we paid him last time?

629
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,389
Six twenty-five.

630
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,809
So, that's
another 275 for
the rest of the month.

631
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,937
Electric?

632
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,146
Half.

633
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,106
Phone?

634
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,025
Let it ride.

635
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,193
Gas?

636
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,736
How much is it?

637
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,238
Eighty-five.

638
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:06,906
Half.

639
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,783
No, mmm-mmm.

640
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,160
Let it ride.

641
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:13,788
I could get
some more hours.

642
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:14,997
No.

643
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,125
You know
what you need to do.

644
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,795
Nah, Candy,
I can't just dip out
on you like that, man.

645
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,131
Please, I was
doing just fine before
you moved in, remember?

646
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,592
You working was
only supposed to
be temporary.

647
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:27,802
Remember that?

648
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,471
I'm only gonna work
for a little bit.

649
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,140
Ma would've wanted you
to be done with...
Who?

650
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,350
Who?

651
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,978
Yo, don't even...
Just... Just stop.

652
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,354
Mom would have
wanted you to be
done by now.

653
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,981
Look, I'll get
the money orders
in the morning.

654
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,943
I'll look into it.

655
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,116
The next test is
coming up soon.

656
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,159
I said
I'll look into it.

657
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,663
Without them and
their courageous efforts,

658
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,331
we wouldn't
have been able
to pull this off.

659
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,541
(CONTINUES SPEAKING ON TV)

660
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,335
Look, it's on again.
Check it out, Free.

661
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,838
Channel Five
and Channel Two.

662

(MACK LAUGHING)

663
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,008
Look who's big time.

664
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,011
Oh, yeah,
but my brother
looked clean though.

665
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,514
Yeah, you look like,
you look like, uh,
that guy on TV.

666
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,099
(ALL LAUGHING)

667
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,104
MACK: Oh, yeah...

668
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,480
There's been
more of that

669
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,025
since they opened up
that new club
'cross the way.

670
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,693
Excuse me, Miss?

671
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,445
Miss?

672
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,822
On certain Fridays
they got this,
you know...

673
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,949
Special party
going on.
Miss?

674
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,036
Or should I say, "Sir"?

675
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,371
Sir?
Sir?

676
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,207
Hello?
Chill out, Sock.

677
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,126
Hey, my man,
you hear me
talking to you?

678
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,544
Hey.

679
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,963
ARTHUR:
Mind your business.
Hey!

680
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,633
And a pack of Kool.

681
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,260
Say, I've been trying
to get your attention.

682
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,928
Do you go by
sir or miss?

683
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,848
Will that be all, ma'am?
Yeah.

684
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,101
Look, I just had
a simple question
I wanted to ask.

685
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,561
MACK: $67.05.

686
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,814
See, I just wanna know,
how does pussy taste?

687
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,735
You know, I just
want to know if
you go with women

688
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,320
for the taste,

689
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,157
or is it because
you too dry,
crusty, and ugly,

690
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,493
so don't no
man want you?

691
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,119
(LAUGHING)

692
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,917
I can't lie.
The pussy do
taste good.

693
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,002
Oh, yeah?

694
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,004
Maybe you should
try it sometime.

695
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,508
Or better yet,
ask your wife
how much she like me.

696
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,010
Fuckin' bulldagger!

697
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,096
He-she dyke!
Yeah.

00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,557
Hey, ask yo' wife!

700
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,809
She told you.

701
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,769
She ain't
tell me shit!

702
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,355
What the fuck y'all
niggas are laughing for!

703
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,648
Oh, shut up, man,

704
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,025
your big mouth
got you in trouble
as usual.

705
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,443
Thought you was
my friend, Mack.

706
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,778
Oh, man!

707
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,031
But I guess I didn't
expect you to
defend me, Free.

708
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,325
Way your daughter's running
around here bull-dyke.
Say what?

709
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,786
Say what?
Hey! Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

710
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,413
Come on,
he don't mean nothin'.

711
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,124
What?
He don't know
what he talking about, man.

712
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,334
He ain't moved
outside of a
two mile radius

713
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,670
of where
he crawled out
his mama's pussy.

714
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,422
He don't know shit!
I been to Poughkeepsie!

715
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,590
Yeah, well, get your
Poughkeepsie ass

716
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,592
Fuck y'all!
I should arrest
your ass.

717
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,302
Man, fuck y'all!

718
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,223
Come, come on, Free.

719
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,227
Don't pay him no mind,
he just talking trash.

720
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,692
...had you all mad.
ALIKE: I wasn't mad.

721
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,236
Yes, you was.
Yo, Candy,
I'm home yo.

722
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,655
Getting all crazy.

723
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,578
Damn, this
your color, man.

724
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,122
So what's the deal,
incog-negro?

725
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,458
Ma has me
hemmed up.

726
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,836
Your phone ain't broke.
You coulda
called a nigga.

727
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,045
My bad.
She's got me
hanging out

728
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,547
with this
chick from church.
It's crazy.

729
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,715
Well, is she
making you?

730
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,134
I mean, you a
grown-ass
woman, bruh!

731
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,512
Here,
put these on.

732
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,061
So I guess
the piers is out
for this Saturday, huh?

733
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,857
Uh... I don't know
if that's me anymore.

734
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,651
That's hot, yo,
you should rock that.

735
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,614
I was thinking
maybe we could do
something different.

736
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:18,908
Different like what?

737
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,452
I don't know.
Like, maybe

738
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,204
check out
an open mic
or something.

739
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,207
Open mic? Nah, man,
there's plenty of
chicks at the piers.

740
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,626
You just gotta be
more confident.

741
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,463
I mean I haven't
even wore this,
you could rock that.

742
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,298
If you want.

743
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,760
But I understand
if you got
better things to do.

744
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,470
No. I'm down.

745
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,723
I don't want you
getting all hemmed up.
No, seriously...

746
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,183
I'm down for
whatever.

747
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,977
Real?

748
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,312
Promise.

749
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,815
A'ight.

750
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,818
I'ma take Saturday

00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,861

752
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,738
It's gonna be

00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,075
We goin' get

754
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,204
ALIKE: They look fake.
AUDREY: No, I think
they're happy.

755
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,415
Now, that looks fake.

756
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,547
You should wear
your hair down
more often.

757
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:15,923
Your father
likes it up.

758
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,885
It looks
nice down.

759
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,763
Maybe.

760
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,598
Give this back
to Bina's mom

761
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,392
when you go over there
tomorrow night.

762
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,602
Saturday night?

763
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,021
We talked about this.
No, we didn't!

764
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,774
Lee.
I had plans
this weekend!

765
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,776
Well, you don't have
to go to Bina's.

766
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,279
You can stay here
with me on
Saturday night.

767
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,114
God!

768
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,410
Come on.

769
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,789
So you like Destiny's Kids?

770
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,082
Mmm-mmm.

771
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:51,750
JP?

772
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,210
Nope.

773
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,420
What about Fiddy?

774
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,965
No, I don't like
any of that
commercial bullshit.

775
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,675
Okay, so who
do you like?

776
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,428
Just some underground stuff.

777
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,513
None of that crap
they play on the radio.

778
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,349
Okay, like who?

779
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,604
You know,
people you probably
never heard of.

780
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,771
Conscious stuff.

781
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,440
Okay, like who?

782
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:18,527
Like Trees,
Black Circle,
Far Front.

783
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,030
Far Front?

00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,678
It's... It's mostly
old stuff, though.

940
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,807
Oh, this is the one
that you did earlier.

941
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,142
Yeah.
Yeah.

942
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,020
It's nice.

943
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,319
Here you go.

944
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,074
Take it.
You play too much!

945
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,451
Just take it.
Thank you.

946
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,370
You're welcome.

947
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,874
So, what's so private?

948
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,335
Nothing.
It's just
my writings.

949
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,069
Why'd you
do that for?

950
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:27,904
I'm sorry.

951
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,407
I thought...
No, I'm sorry,

952
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,076
I just gotta go.

953
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,079
But I thought that...

954
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,581
I'm sorry.

955
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,250
We gonna get y'all
on the board,
God damn it!

956
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:41,668
Okay.

957
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,670
Let's play, keep it rolling,
keep it rolling!

958
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,005
GIRL 1: Ain't giving you
no stupid-ass hand.

959
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,673
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
You gonna get that?

960
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,508
Yeah, I got it.
There you go.
Cut that!

961
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,178
Come on,
bring it out,
bring it out.

962
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,513
GIRL 2: Ooh!

963
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,724
We went in
the hole one time.

964
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,434
GIRL 1:
Y'all went in the hole twice!
Yo, wassup.

965
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,437
LAURA:
Yo, whaddup, Lee!
Yo, what you got, Ty?

966
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,188
Pick 'em up! Nasty!

967
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:05,358
(ALL CLAMORING)

968
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,194
Oh! We goin' to eight!
We goin' to eight!

969
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,905
Uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

970
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,158
Yo, I'm busy right now,
I'm doing something.

971
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,120
Holdup, holdup!
That was my jack!
I cut! I cut!

972
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,624
Laura, I really need
to talk to you.

973
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,626
Laura, I really need...
Yo, man.

974
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,836
I told you
I'm fucking busy!
Shit!

975
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,715
Nah. Nah, nah.
I'm busy.

976
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,556
GIRL 1: Goodnight.
GIRL 2: Get home safe!

977
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,808
Yo...
I thought that
was your girl.

978
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,518
Mind yo business!
I'm her girl!

979
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,187
Exactly. Exactly.
This will...

980
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:45,523
You go ahead.
That's what
I'm talking about.

981
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:46,733
Y'all niggas don't know.

982
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:50,070
You know, boo.
Get the fuck
outta here, yo!

983
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,460
Dad!

984
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,259
Come on, now,
you know that's
not what I want.

985
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,096
That's not what
I'm saying!

986
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,849
Lis... Listen to me.
Are you going
to listen to me?

987
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,184
ALIKE: Dad?

988
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,562
Listen, I gotta go.

989
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,440
I gotta go,
my daughter's...
My daughter's up!

990
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,275
Dad?
Talk to you later, bye.

991
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,112
Who was that?
What you doing up?

992
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,948
Just wanted to talk.

993
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,330
Dad, the plate!

994
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,958
Don't trash the plate.

995
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,877
Aren't you hungry?
No.

996
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,505
Ate already.
You ate at work?

997
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,882
Grabbed some takeout.
Oh, where?

998
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,593
Why you asking me so many
goddamn questions, girl?

999
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,721
What's wrong with you?
You don't question me.

1000
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,682
Sorry.

1001
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,643
Hold up, Alike.

1002
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,021
Come on back. Look.

1003
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,356
I got patties.

1004
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,819
Beef?
And chicken.
Come on.

1005
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,203
Listen, um...

1006
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,457
Your mom was worried
that uh...

1007
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,465
She's been wanting me
to ask you,

1008
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,425
that, uh...

1009
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,263
How's school?

1010
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,931
Straight As?

1011
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,642
Probably.

1012
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,437
That's right.
Wanna sip?

1013
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,109
I said a sip! A sip!

1014
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,075
What's on your mind?

1015
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,120
Nothin'.

1016
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,460
What if...

1017
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,256
What if say...
Somebody liked you?

1018
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,926
They like you?
Or they "like you"
like you?

1019
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,719
They "like you"
like you.

1020
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,137
Uh-huh.

1021
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,724
They haven't said
anything yet but...

1022
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,644
But what if...
All right, what if the person

1023
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,896
is kind of
like a friend,

1024
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,856
but you know
they like you
more than that?

1025
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,984
Well, I think
that's the best way,
to start as friends.

1026
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,324
What if...
What if the person is...

1027
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,994
What if the person...
What's his name?

1028
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,622
What grade is he in?
I'm gonna look
his ass up in the system.

1029
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,375
Wait till I tell
your mama.

1030
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,001
She'll be
so goddamn happy.

1031
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,089
Yeah.

1032
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,471
Say, uh...

1033
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,141
There's this new, uh,
women's club

1034
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,228
up there
by the liquor store.

1035
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,814
Do you...

1036
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:17,193
Have you...
You haven't heard
anything about it, right?

1037
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:21,364
Called the Kitty Litter,
Cat Box,
something like that?

1038
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,201
Nah, never even
heard of it.

1039
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:27,036
Good.

1040
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,746
'Cause it's a...

1041
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,332
That's a
rough neighborhood.

1042
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,626
You know that, right?
I had a case
over there.

1043
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,212
You wanna be careful.

1044
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,172
Stay away
from that element.

1045
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,300
In case it ever
comes up.

1046
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,302
I'll be careful.

1047
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,469
Good.

1048
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,471
I know you will.

1049
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,477
Dad, when you were
on the phone earlier...

1050
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,062
Uh-huh.
It sounded like...

1051
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,024
I mean...

1052
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,068
I guess you're headed
back to work, huh?

1053
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,320
Yup.

1054
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,073
Your mama still up?
Probably.

1055
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:06,910
Tell her I had to work.

1056
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,623
Love you.

1057
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,028
Hey.
Hey.

1058
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,616
I'm real sorry about
the other day.

1059
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,454
It's cool.
Things have been crazy.

1060
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,457
But look,
I'm really sorry
I bugged out.

1061
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,877
It's just, I didn't know
that you...
I wasn't expecting that.

1062
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,506
First kiss? (CHUCKLES)

1063
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:03,841
It's cool.

1064
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,470
You still comin'
to the party?

1065
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,015
Um... I don't know.
I need to try to
catch up with Laura.

1066
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,393
Oh, okay.

1067
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,230
No, but I do wanna hang,
but I mean,
maybe we could do both.

1068
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:18,564
Cool.

1069
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,069
Uh, do you want to
spend the night?

1070
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,073
You know, maybe avoid
that whole curfew thing?

1071
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,701
Oh, you're home?

1072
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:14,120
Hey.

1073
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,540
I must have
dozed off.

1074
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,293
How long you been in?
Hour.

1075
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,796
Did you see the plate
over there?

1076
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,965
This is fine.

1077
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,303
Why don't you come
sit over here?
There's room.

1078
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,139
You could see
the TV better.
This is fine.

1079
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,224
Thank you.

1080
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,061
Just alike.

1081
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,479
Say what?

1082
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,774
You and your daughter.
Did you talk to Lee yet?

1083
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,110
I told you she's still...
I talked to Alike.

1084
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,154
You did?

1085
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,656
Everything's fine,
like I told you.

1086
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,242
Matter of fact,
she's got a boyfriend.

1087
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:56,662
A boyfriend?
Just give her some space.

1088
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,247
Space?

1089
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,085
She's never around as it is.
And you're just like her!

1090
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,170
Creeping in all hours
of the night.

1091
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,005
Running around
like you got
something to hide.

1092
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,173
Both of you!

1093
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,759
And acting like
I'm the big bad witch!

1094
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,927
What about me, huh?

1095
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,262
I'm here alone
by myself

I don't have
anything to hide.

Look, I told you,
I talked to Alike.

1099
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,272
Everything's fine.
Did you ask her?

1100
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,441
No, because
I don't have to.

1101
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,694
Besides,
I would know, okay?

1102
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,738
I know my daughter
better than anyone else.
"Your daughter."

00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,449
So all of a sudden
now she's your daughter?
And I'm telling you,
she's fine.

1104
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,535
Well, I guess then
I just shouldn't say
anything else about this!

1105
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,703
That's your damn problem.
You're too much of
a damn worrywart.

1106

you're right, detective.

1107
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,332

shut the fuck up?

it doesn't matter
to me.

Good.

She's cool, right?

She's hot, right?
I told you!

I was thinking
next weekend,

we could,
you know, go out.

I mean, I should have...
No.

You know.
What I'm saying is,

1141
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,717
I probably overreacted.
I mean...

out the room!

AUDREY:
I'm not paranoid!

1248
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,554
You are paranoid!
All you do is break!

1249
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,681

When do I see you?

I just need to
get outta here!

face the facts!

You don't wanna
face the facts!
No dammit, that's not true!

1253
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,938
It is true!
Look, would you
stop saying that?

1254
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,607

turning into a damn man

No, you take that back!

1258
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,740
Shut the fuck up

Mom, Dad, stop! Please!

01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:45,991

Tell him where
you hang out!

Tell him about your
butch-ass girlfriend!

No! No! No!

that's not true!

You tell your mother
that's not true.

1271

You already know.
No, I don't know.

1272
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:17,105
You tell your mama
it's just a phase.
It's not a phase!

have done something!

You should have
done something!
What's wrong with you?

1275
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,693
There's nothing
wrong with me!
This is your fault!

we thank you

This food should

I got the recipe
from a magazine.

1296
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:54,114
And I made
your green beans
that you like so much.

1297
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,700
Sharonda, could you
pass me the green beans?

She...

Your mother
couldn't make it.

1306
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,072
You remember
our old place?

1307
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,823
Way out in Queens?

1308
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,454
It was our first apartment.
We were so proud.

1309
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:27,582
It had all those trees
around it.

1310
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,585
In October,
the whole block would
be covered with leaves.

1311
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,087
You remember?

1312
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,676
Couldn't have been
more than two years old.

1313
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,011
When that wind would blow,

1314
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,097
those leaves would
come rushing
down the street at us.

1315
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,349
You thought
they were alive.

1316
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,978
You'd get so scared.

1317
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,690
You'd cry and scream
and beg for us
to pick you up.

1318
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,612
I would try and tell you,
"They're only leaves, baby,"

1319
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,197
and make you stay
on the ground,

1320
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,493
but your mother
would always pick you up.

1321
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,498
She always
picked you up.

1322
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,299
Remember how we used
to race to the phone
when it rang?

1323
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,635
I've been accepted
into an early
college program.

1324
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,388
It starts in the spring.
It's in Berkeley.

1325
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:27,058
It's a 10-week
writing workshop.

1326
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:31,521
Boot camp,
then I could start
summer semester.

1327
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,400
We can talk
about that, okay?

1328
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,485
I need you to meet
with my guidance counselor,

1329
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,530
so you could
sign the paperwork,
so I can graduate early.

1330
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:43,575
I'm sorry, all right?

1331
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,161
I'm sorry
I let her hurt you.

1332
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,246
I just need to know if
you'll sign the paperwork.
Yes or no?

1333
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,206
Can you forgive me?
Yes or no?

1334
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,252
You can always
come back home.

1335

be different,

she was right.
