1
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,272
"The day went by, just as days go by."

2
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,159
"l killed it in accordance with my
primitive and withdrawn way of life."

3
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,114
"l worked for an hour
or two, I had pains..."

4
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,069
"took some opium, and Iay
in a hot bath for two hours."

5
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,278
"Was glad when the pains
consented to disappear."

6
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,152
"All in all, it wasn't
exactly a day of rapture."

7
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,274
"Perhaps the time has come to follow
the example of Adalbert Stifter."

8
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,197
"A fatal accident while shaving."

9
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,309
"The pain stops."

10
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,151
"l am content."

11
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,310
"Contentment that
fills me with loathing."

12
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,238
"ln desperation I escape
into other regions..."

13
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,317
"if possible, on the
road to pleasure..."

14
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,153
"or if that cannot be,
on the road to pain."

15
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,156
"A wild Ionging seethes
in me to smash and burn..."

16
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,078
"to destroy..."

17
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,270
"pull down idols,
seduce little girls..."

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,152
"dynamite the established
order, who cares what."

19
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,112
"Herr" Haller.

20
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,309
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, yes.

21
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,117
I'm sorry if I startled you.

22
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,237
I didn't hear you coming up.

23
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,231
My thoughts "were..."

24
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,076
wool gathering.

25
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,315
Are you sure you're all right?

26
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,192
- May I help you upstairs?
- No, no, no, there's no need.

27
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,118
Sit down a moment, if
you can spare the time.

28
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,232
It is not my custom to sit on the
stairs at other people's doors.

29
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,157
Yes, quite so.

30
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,151
Now you've embarrassed me.

31
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,117
Let me explain.

32
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,198
I've taken quite a fancy to
this little "vestibule..."

33
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,154
polished, scoured, "glittering..."

34
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,191
like your aunt's below.

35
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,318
I always have to take a
deep breath when I go by.

36
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,111
It reeks of "peace..."

37
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,275
and tranquility.

38
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,118
I've always sought
places like this to live.

39
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,158
You see, I need it, don't you see?

40
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,229
But you are ill.

41
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,270
Nonsense.

42
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,272
Only a shabby old "Steppenwolf..."

43
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,118
creeping up the stairs
of other people's houses.

44
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,269
Pains I have "sometimes..."

45
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,275
as elderly people do.

46
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,270
"Elderly" is a little bit exaggerated.

47
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,155
You can't be 50 yet.

48
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,232
No, you're right, more's the pity.

49
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,151
But not long to wait, either.

50
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,231
Wait, you, hey.

51
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,269
Let me see your sign.

52
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,199
What is this evening
entertainment? Where is it?

53
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,309
Not for everybody.

54
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,113
Now, what do you have here? I
want to buy something from you.

55
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,199
"There once was a man called
Harry, who went on two legs..."

56
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,198
"wore clothes, and was a human being."

57
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,118
"Nevertheless he really
was a wolf of the steppes."

58
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,237
"ln his childhood he was
wild and disobedient..."

59
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,157
"and disorderly."

60
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,080
"And those that brought him up declared a
war of extinction against the beast in him."

61
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,277
"And precisely this had given him
the idea he really was a beast..."

62
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,271
"with only a thin veneer of the human."

63
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,198
"lf Harry had a beautiful thought
or felt a fine and noble emotion..."

64
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,277
"the wolf laughed with bitter scorn."

65
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,311
"He knew well enough what suited him."

66
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,076
"But when Harry behaved as a wolf,
the human part of him lay in ambush..."

67
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,158
"called him "brute" and "beast,"
and spoiled all pleasure..."

68
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,272
"in his simple and healthy
and wild Wolf's being."

69
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,193
"lt cannot be denied that he
was generally very unhappy."

70
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,157
"And he could make others unhappy, too."

71
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,079
"For he always brought his
own dual and divided nature..."

72
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,235
"into the destinies of others."

73
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,079
"Nevertheless he was
secretly and persistently..."

74
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,077
"attracted to the bourgeois world..."

75
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,238
"dressed respectably,
had money in the bank..."

76
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,237
"and supported poor relations."

77
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,231
"He was capable of loving
the political criminal..."

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,271
"or intellectual seducer."

79
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,077
"But as for theft, murder, or rape..."

80
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,191
"he would not have known
how to deplore them..."

81
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,153
"otherwise than in a
thoroughly bourgeois manner."

82
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,154
"Now, what we call the bourgeois as
a principle of human existence..."

83
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,191
"is nothing less than
a search for balance."

84
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,194
"lt is in the middle of the road
that the bourgeois seeks to walk."

85
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,199
"Always ready to compromise between
right and wrong, good and evil."

86
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,238
"He will never surrender either
to the martyrdom of the spirit..."

87
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,317
"orto the martyrdom of the flesh."

88
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,074
"The vital force of the bourgeoisie
resides in its outsiders."

89
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,079
"Artists and intellectuals
like Harry..."

90
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,238
"who develop far beyond the level
possible to the bourgeois..."

91
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,195
"Knowing the bliss of meditation no less than
the gloomy joys of hatred and self-loathing."

92
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,153
"He is nevertheless captive
to the bourgeoisie..."

93
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,077
"and cannot escape it."

94
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,239
"Unless, if suffering has made his
spirit tough and elastic enough..."

95
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,279
"he finds a way of reconciliation
and an escape into humor."

96
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,118
"The outsider has two
souls, two beings..."

97
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,151
"God and the devil, in him..."

98
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,230
"and these men for whom
life has no repose..."

99
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,237
"live in their rare
moments of happiness..."

100
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,238
"with such strength and
indescribable beauty..."

101
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,159
"the spray of their
momentary ecstasy..."

102
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,238
"is flung so high over the
wide sea of suffering..."

103
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,318
"that the light of it touches
others with its enchantment."

104
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,151
"But only the strongest of them..."

105
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,238
"force their way through the
atmosphere of the bourgeois world..."

106
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,231
"to reach the cosmic."

107
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,234
"There never was a man with a deeper and
more passionate craving for independence..."

108
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,315
"than Harry."

109
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,310
"He never sold himself for money
or an easy Iife, orto women..."

110
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,150
"orto those in power..."

111
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,158
"and had thrown away a hundred
times his advantage in happiness..."

112
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,191
"in order to safeguard his liberty."

113
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,272
"But in the midst of his freedom,
Harry suddenly realized..."

114
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,073
"that his freedom was a death..."

115
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,077
"and that he stood alone."

116
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,075
"Finally, at the age
of 47 or thereabouts..."

117
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,316
"a happy but not harmless
idea came to him..."

118
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,079
"from which he often
derived some amusement."

119
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,318
"He appointed his 50th
birthday as the day..."

120
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,078
"on which he might take
leave of this world."

121
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,197
"Let happen to him what might."

122
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,151
"He could bear any suffering..."

123
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,111
"saying to his pain..."

124
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,117
""Only wait two years..."

125
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,197
""and I am your master.""

126
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,238
"And with this, he cherished
the thought of the morning..."

127
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,117
"of his 50th birthday."

128
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,197
"Suicide, unhappy Steppenwolf..."

129
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,231
"will not serve your purpose."

130
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,191
"All this is well known to you."

131
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,153
"You are aware of the
wisdom of the immortals."

132
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,119
"You are aware of the
Magie Theater of the self."

133
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,232
"That mirror in which you have
such a bitter need to look..."

134
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,318
"but from which you shrink
in such deathly fear."

135
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,157
No show tonight?

136
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,191
Well, I only meant, at the theater.

137
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,231
Try the Black Eagle, friend.

138
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,191
If it's a show you "want..."

139
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,275
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,269
I'm afraid I mistook you "for..."

141
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,118
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,197
My dear "Herr" Haller.

143
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,278
You've been here all this time
without once coming to see us.

144
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,269
Not at all, "l..."

145
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,230
arrived only a few days ago.

146
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,271
I'm sorry to hear that.

147
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,233
And "I..." I've "been..."

148
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,191
Ah, here you are, "mon cher."

149
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,154
I've just been reading about this
despicable namesake of "yours..."

150
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,235
this Haller.

151
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,113
- Who's that? A writer?
- A writer?

152
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,158
Dear me, no, a "scribbler..."

153
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,111
- a wretched
scribbler. - Uh-huh.

154
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,039
A publicist, a rotten "patriot..."

155
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,150
and a sneak.

156
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,191
Here, just look for yourself.

157
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,191
It's even spelled the
same way, isn't it?

158
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,235
Rather.

159
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,272
He seems to feel that we were
responsible for the war. Imagine.

160
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,110
Oh.

161
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,275
Shall we go in, please?

162
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,072
Yes.

163
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,270
A funny thing happened to me today.

164
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,235
Really?

165
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,270
Yes.

166
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,073
Just after we parted at
the Iibrary, by the way.

167
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,238
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about it.

168
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,194
Well, I was climbing
the last steps "up..."

169
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,118
towards Martinsgasse.

170
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,195
When suddenly a "little..."

171
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,199
procession came rattling by. 
A funeral procession.

172
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,311
Oh, my dear.

173
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,271
Come, come, come! "Seigneur."

174
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,150
No.

175
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,309
I only "mean..."

176
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,112
I'm sorry.

177
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm praying for a hero
to be born among us.

178
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,113
Miraculous births not excluded.

179
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,159
To filter the minutest "detail..."

180
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,200
the contours of the very
archetype within "us..."

181
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,238
apocalypse is our only hope.

182
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,118
I see.

183
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,079
I hope that Goethe didn't
really look Iike this.

184
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,077
This conceited air of "nobility..."

185
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,236
the great man ogling the
distinguished company.

186
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,270
His venerable pomposity
is bad "enough..."

187
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,118
but to portray him like this...

188
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,231
Oh, no! My God.

189
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,157
My dear, you're not ill?

190
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,113
You'll have to take your
coffee alone, gentleman.

191
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,309
I have to retire.

192
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,191
She was hurt, you know.

193
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,151
Goethe is her dearest possession.

194
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,194
Nobody takes our cultural heritage
more seriously than my Hildegard.

195
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,277
- I'm sorry.
- Even if you were "right..."

196
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,073
you needn't have been <i>so</i> outspoken.

197
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,111
Well, it's a vice of
mine to speak my mind.

198
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,232
As friend Goethe did, too. At
Ieast, in his better moments.

199
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,276
I sincerely beg your
wife's pardon and your own.

200
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,229
Please tell her I'm a schizophrenic.

201
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,237
If you will permit me,
I will take my Ieave.

202
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,193
"But..." But your coffee, and our talk.

203
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,238
I am so looking forward to
our discussion of "Mithras..."

204
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,237
and Krishna and the others.

205
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,193
Unfortunately, my interest
in Krishna has "vanished..."

206
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,277
along with my passion
for learned discussions.

207
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,190
Further, I have been lying.

208
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,153
I have not been in town for a
few days only, but for months.

209
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,277
However, I am no longer
fit for decent society.

210
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,231
I am nearly always in bad "temper..."

211
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,160
afflicted with gout,
and usually quite drunk.

212
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,118
Lastly, you grievously
insulted me earlier.

213
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,070
That rotten patriot named, oddly enough,
Haller, stands before you unregenerate.

214
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,077
In fact, it would be
better for the "world..."

215
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,236
if the few of us who are still capable
of thought stood for "reason..."

216
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,237
- and the love of "peace..."
- Hold it, "mon cher..."

217
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,159
... instead of driving
obsessively toward a new war.

218
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,190
"Good night."

219
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,071
"I can't go on."

220
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,271
"The wolf howling at my heel."

221
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,272
"l know what he wants,
an end to our suffering."

222
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,113
"So let this evil day be our last."

223
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,278
"But I want to live. Run, Harry, run."

224
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,155
"But where?"

225
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,229
"Away, anywhere."

226
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,079
"lt's all the same in the end."

227
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,071
Go ahead and pick one, sir.

228
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,078
It all comes to the same
thing in the "end..."

229
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,156
don't it?

230
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,316
That's what I always say.

231
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,073
It's all the same in the end.

232
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,112
"Must go home."

233
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,191
"Try to remain still..."

234
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,112
"before despair."

235
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,230
"Go home."

236
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,315
"Take up the razor..."

237
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,269
"Lay it down again."

238
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,158
"Let cowardice once again
triumph over despair."

239
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,275
"For another hour..."

240
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,155
"another day."

241
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,112
"No matter how many times
I Iay the razor clown..."

242
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,275
"l shall take it up again..."

243
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,319
"and again..."

244
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,270
"until..."

245
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,110
"finally..."

246
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,190
Hello.

247
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,157
Don't tell me my nose is shiny again.

248
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,077
That's better.

249
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,230
Hard night?

250
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,072
Where am I?

251
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,191
Where else could you be at this hour?

252
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,072
I've no idea.

253
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,270
The Black Eagle.

254
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,111
"If it's a show you want..."

255
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,072
Don't panic.

256
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,071
I'll look after you.

257
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,160
What's the matter with you,
anyway? Lost your way home?

258
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,196
"No..." Yes.

259
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,072
I can't go home.

260
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,152
Stay here if you Iike.

261
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,150
What's this?

262
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,077
You could do it here, if you Iiked.

263
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,310
Oh, for heaven's sake, it's only a joke.

264
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,111
Get cleaned up a Iittle is all I meant.

265
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,155
Look at yourself.

266
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,230
You're enough to give
a poor girl the willies.

267
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,236
At least wipe your glasses.

268
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,117
You can't see a thing.

269
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,191
Now, what shall we drink?

270
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,315
Bourgogne?

271
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,232
Where did you get "that..." That razor?

272
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,270
Do you always fetch a razor
along in your bag Iike that?

273
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,276
Usually.

274
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,310
Why?

275
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,114
Oh, look, it's a long,
complicated, very twisted story.

276
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,310
I'll tell you some day.

277
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,315
A friend left it at my place.

278
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,312
- You've got Iots of friends, I suppose.
- Yes. Don't you?

279
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,072
No.

280
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,191
Oh my, you are a sad case.

281
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,118
I'll bet it's a long time
since you had to obey anyone.

282
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,072
Is that what I need?

283
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,313
Obedience is like sex. Nothing like it
if you have been without it too long.

284
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,269
You'll follow my orders.

285
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,110
I will?

286
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,072
Do you have any choice?

287
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,156
No.

288
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,198
Good. We're off to a swell start.

289
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,118
We've wiped your glasses,
had a bite to eat.

290
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,191
Let's clean your boots
and go dance a shimmy.

291
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,117
Oh, I don't know how to dance.

292
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,197
- Oh, how "triste."
- I never learned.

293
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,278
Well, you see, I really am hopeless.

294
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,192
Perhaps you'd better go home
and hang yourself after all.

295
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,275
Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,231
Doesn't anyone look after you?

297
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,237
A wife, a sweetheart?

298
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,152
I'm divorced.

299
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,113
A sweetheart, yes, but
she doesn't live here.

300
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,198
And we don't get along very well anyway.

301
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,119
Well, you are difficult.

302
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,039
- Nobody can stand you.
- Just don't scold me.

303
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,072
I know I am impossible,
I'm hopeless, I'm helpless.

304
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,270
What's this?

305
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,199
The world's saddest song, played
on the world's smallest violin.

306
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,158
You've got a nerve saying you've
tasted life to the "bottom..."

307
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,157
and found nothing in it.

308
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,075
You haven't even tried
the easy, fun part yet.

309
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,114
All I can say is I'm certainly
glad I'm not your "maman."

310
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,157
Gee, Harry, I'm "sorry..."

311
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,039
I've got to flee. I have a date.

312
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,071
- With whom?
- Never you mind.

313
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,111
- A friend.
- Listen, I "thought..."

314
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,151
I thought you were going
to stay here with me.

315
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,151
Oh, then you should have asked me to.

316
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,315
But I am asking you now.

317
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,230
Too late.

318
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,119
All right, tomorrow, then.

319
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,112
Uh-huh. Maybe.

320
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,159
But wait. Listen.

321
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,071
Well, tell me your name at least.

322
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,238
Oh, now you ask. What
a dreadful man you are.

323
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,157
You'll have to guess it.

324
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,195
Margaret.

325
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,118
Molly.

326
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,072
Madeleine.

327
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,310
That's for next time.

328
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,158
Tuesday for dinner
at the Old Franciscan.

329
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,272
I know, it's probably not
elegant enough for "you..."

330
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,229
but I am fond of it.

331
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,237
It makes me dream of St. Francis.

332
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,118
- You're religious?
- No. Not really anymore.

333
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,279
But you know, when I see one
of those stupid, "lying..."

334
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,033
silly pictures of St.
Francis people "have..."

335
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,150
I really get peeved.

336
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,278
But then I think how disappointed
St. Francis must "be..."

337
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,272
when he looks into my heart and
sees the image I have of him.

338
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,272
I'm only human, anyway,
and I try to be merciful.

339
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,198
Since you can't go
home, sleep here tonight.

340
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,309
And take this, too.

341
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,159
You don't have to use it, you know.

342
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,190
"Tu comprends?"

343
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,197
So long, then.

344
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,310
And enjoy your dreams.

345
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,239
His Excellency will see you now.

346
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,194
Would you mind just telling "Herr" Goethe that
I'm only a journalist come for an interview?

347
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,117
Never mind about the other stuff.

348
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,077
What other stuff?

349
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,272
You young people-

350
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,199
Oh, "Herr" Goethe. I mean,
of course, Your Excellency.

351
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,153
Don't care a fig for
us old folks, do you?

352
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,191
But we do, Your Excellency.

353
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,194
We just think you're a
little bit too "vain..."

354
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,152
or pompous, or not
forthright enough, that's it.

355
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,069
Will you be so kind as to explain?

356
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,269
Well, for "example..."

357
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,199
well, you clearly "recognized..."

358
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,311
the utter hopelessness
of the human condition.

359
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,155
- I did?
- "Yes..."

360
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,272
Faith, "optimism..."

361
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,235
the illusion that our spiritual strivings
mean something, that they endure.

362
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,229
I imagine you don't much care
for Mozarfs "Magie Flute?"

363
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,191
How dare you, sir.

364
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,312
It preaches optimism and faith.

365
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,236
Yes, but Mozart didn't live to be 82.

366
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,193
He sang his divine melodies and died.

367
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,112
With no pretensions to the
enduring and the "orderly..."

368
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,071
and to exalted dignity Iike yours.

369
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,191
What a stuffy view of Mozart.

370
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,073
You should have been a
schoolmaster, my dear.

371
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,110
That's not fair.

372
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,231
You see his perfected "being..."

373
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,238
as a supreme and special "gift..."

374
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,309
that cost him nothing.

375
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,230
Aren't you forgetting his "patience..."

376
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,159
under the last extremes
of "loneliness..."

377
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,192
his surrender, his suffering?

378
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,159
Now who's thinking bourgeois, honey?

379
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,073
Do you know the black bottom?

380
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,316
Certainly not. I never had time.

381
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,111
Oh, no wonder you're so grouchy.

382
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,152
If you're going to take time seriously.

383
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,317
There is no time in "eternity..."

384
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,117
Only a "moment..."

385
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,111
just time for a joke.

386
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,155
Orchids.

387
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,191
Oh, Harry, you are an idiot.

388
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,231
I'm sorry if you don't like them.

389
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,078
It's not that.

390
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,238
I suppose orchids were the
only flowers expensive enough.

391
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,234
Well, anyway, thank you ever
so much, but never again, okay?

392
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,157
I won't take gifts from you.

393
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,159
- I'm sorry. I only meant...
- I know what you meant.

394
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,155
"Listen..."

395
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,318
I Iive on men, true,
but I won't Iive on you.

396
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,155
Ever.

397
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,157
Don't you look swell today.

398
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,272
Now that we've managed to
get you down from the gallows.

399
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,076
Do you like it?

400
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,271
Well, it needs a bit of "style..."

401
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,151
a bit of flash, you "know..."

402
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,191
but I like it. It's a start.

403
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,153
- Have you carried out my orders yet?
- What orders?

404
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,309
You mean you haven't
learned the foxtrot yet?

405
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,077
Oh, I've only had two days.

406
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,235
You could learn it in an hour.

407
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,072
The black bottom in two.

408
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,197
The tango takes longer,
but you don't need it.

409
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,278
"It's as easy as thinking
and a lot easier to learn."

410
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,195
We'll take this one.

411
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,153
We could have bought it three
hours ago and fours shops "back..."

412
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,191
since it was the first one we looked at.

413
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,119
Then we wouldn't have had
the fun of shopping for it.

414
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

415
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,310
Bye-bye.

416
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,278
Now you know the entire
scandalous truth about "me..."

417
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,269
and I don't even know your name.

418
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,119
But you do. Look.

419
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,194
No. Yes, you do remind me of someone.

420
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,272
Someone a long time ago. Is "it..."

421
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,117
No, not Rosa Kreisler.

422
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,235
She had dark hair.

423
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,190
Who was Rosa Kreisler?

424
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,275
My first love.

425
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,155
We were 14.

426
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,230
Mind you, she didn't even know about it.

427
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,311
I never had the courage to speak to her.

428
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,151
- Nota word?
- No.

429
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,276
Oh, Harry, how sad.

430
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,151
She was probably crazy about you.

431
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,190
Anyway, not Rosa.

432
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,315
- Now tell me.
- Guess.

433
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,111
- I can't.
- You can.

434
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,155
Hermann.

435
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,230
Hermann.

436
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,275
Hermine.

437
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,238
There, you see, that
wasn't so hard, was it?

438
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,151
But how did "you..."

439
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,190
do that to me?

440
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,117
- Don't forget what you promised.
- What?

441
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,275
You'll obey all my orders.

442
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,230
Yes.

443
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,152
Most of them will be fun.

444
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,157
And easy enough.

445
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,197
But in the end, as you call "it..."

446
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,078
you will have to fulfill
my last wish as well.

447
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,073
Yes. What will that be?

448
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,117
Cross your heart and hope to die?

449
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,155
Do it.

450
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,271
Cross my heart and hope to die.

451
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,312
Yes, I need you right now,
because I am desperate.

452
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,272
You will have to throw me
into the water before I swim.

453
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,311
The water will bring
me back to life again.

454
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,115
But I need you, too.

455
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,191
Not now, "later..."

456
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,231
when you have fallen in love with me.

457
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,194
I need you for something very
important and very beautiful.

458
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,151
It will be my Iast command.

459
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,155
What must I do then?

460
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,270
Kill me.

461
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,309
Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.

462
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,197
I'm sorry.

463
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,190
Who's this?

464
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,276
Erica.

465
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,197
- Isn't she pretty.
- Yes.

466
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,230
My poor, angry love.

467
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,155
And this one?

468
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,275
Now it's your turn to guess.

469
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,231
Well, it's Hermann, of course.

470
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,230
Who was he, anyway?

471
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,199
My only friend at the
seminary, which we both hated.

472
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,153
He only lasted six months there.

473
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,238
That was all he could take of
maths, New Testament "Greek..."

474
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,112
and ice in the washbowls.

475
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,314
We both agreed that they didn't
really want to educate anyone there.

476
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,237
All they wanted, in fact, "was..."

477
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,160
a Iot of obedient corporals
and sergeants for the state.

478
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,114
Then one day he went over the
wall, and I didn't see him since.

479
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,150
 And?

480
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,318
Oh, he worked as an apprentice
in a clock "factory..."

481
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,311
and as an assistant in
a Tùbingen bookstore.

482
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,232
He published a promising
book of "poems..."

483
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,275
and shot himself in the head.

484
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,195
I suppose you admire that.

485
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,232
At Ieast he saved himself the
pains and horrors of the Great War.

486
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,199
Not to mention quite a few others.

487
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,278
Yes, I admired him. I adored him.

488
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,159
I don't suppose a day has
gone by since "then..."

489
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,117
that I didn't somehow think of him.

490
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,193
- You're not going, are you?
- I must.

491
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,191
We'll go dancing at the
Balances Hotel tomorrow.

492
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,151
Oh, listen, I cannot dance.

493
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,235
Oh, cabbage.

494
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,318
No, one needs talents to "dance..."

495
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,310
Iike gaiety, "innocence..."

496
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,114
frivolity, elasticity, talents
I've never had and never will.

497
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,275
Don't be so cocksure.

498
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,230
"Remember..."

499
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,275
you're under orders.

500
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,199
What makes you so cocksure
I'll obey your orders?

501
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,069
Well, don't just sit
there, go and dance.

502
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,193
- But I don't know anyone.
- Ask anybody.

503
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,157
Nobody here pretty enough for you?

504
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,152
Of course.

505
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,118
How "about..."

506
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,079
I can't. she'll think
I'm a dirty old man.

507
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,233
- You are a big baby.
- Why, she'll laugh.

508
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,232
Poor Harry, nasty girl
might laugh at him.

509
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,117
Come on, take a chance for once.

510
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,195
I can't.

511
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,310
Go.

512
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,198
May I have a dance?

513
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,111
As a matter of fact,
I'm engaged for this one.

514
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,275
Oh, I'm sorry.

515
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,312
But my beau seems to have
got stranded at the bar.

516
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,076
So let's go.

517
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,309
I'm just Iearning.

518
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,113
Doesn't matter, just relax a Iittle.

519
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,190
Hello there.

520
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,157
Pablo, my friend Harry.

521
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,157
"- Enchanté.
- Enchanté."

522
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,157
Cigarette? No?

523
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,112
You'll be sorry.

524
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,275
- He is rich?
- No.

525
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,270
- But he's very beautiful.
- Yes. Very beautiful.

526
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,078
Jimmy was around
yesterday Iooking for you.

527
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,079
Hello, Harry. Do you like music?

528
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,111
Yes. Well, yes and no.

529
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,232
I mean, I never thought I would be
able to enjoy this kind of music.

530
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,112
What kind of music?

531
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,113
Well, jazz, I suppose.
It is jazz, isn't it?

532
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,309
If you want to call it names.

533
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,279
Well, I mean, it is very different
from our symphonic tradition, isn't it?

534
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,109
I guess, I guess. AII right.

535
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,073
How do you know I'm not
in love with you already?

536
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,230
Oh, you Iike me, I can see that.

537
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,111
Because I broke through your isolation.

538
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,275
You're grateful to me.

539
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,231
But you're not in love with me yet.

540
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,275
Maybe that's the same thing.

541
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,276
Which shows how little
you know about it.

542
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,158
No, I mean to make you
fall in love with me.

543
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,190
Why?

544
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,272
Because it's my calling
and my "nature..."

545
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,151
to make men fall in love with me.

546
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,071
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

547
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,191
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

548
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,231
Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,270
Very well.

550
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,195
She is lovely, isn't she?

551
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,269
Why don't you make love to her?

552
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,236
Do what?

553
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,112
Don't be such a prude.

554
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,311
No one's asking you to marry her.

555
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,310
You don't have to take
all love that seriously.

556
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,311
I say it's high "time..."

557
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,118
you slept with a pretty dolly
again, "Herr" Steppenwolf.

558
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,152
Believe me, I've no such aspiration.

559
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,277
"- Ciao," Alfredo.
Bye. - Thank you.

560
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,191
Let's grab a bite to eat somewhere.

561
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,119
After, we're playing
at the City Bar again.

562
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,230
All night?

563
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,072
Why not?

564
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,236
Well, I'm a Iittle tired.

565
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,072
I can fix that.

566
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,112
Oh, pardon me, sir.

567
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,232
I wonder if you'd be so
kind, just for a moment.

568
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,272
- Pablo can fix you anything.
- Anything?

569
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,152
Anything you Iike.

570
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,190
It's good.

571
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,119
You can't always get what you want,
but you can always get what you need.

572
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,275
Well, what are we waiting for?

573
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,190
Let's go.

574
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,117
Now we're off to the "Kunsthalle," then.

575
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,230
Hey!

576
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,199
"Home at Iast, weighed down
by sadness and despair."

577
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,152
"When I think of tomorrow's
appointment at the Cecil Bar..."

578
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,194
"l think with bitterness not only
of myself, but of Hermine, too."

579
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,078
"For all her kind intentions,
she should have Iet me perish..."

580
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,270
"instead of sweeping me
into this frivolity..."

581
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,233
"where I shall never be
anything but an alien..."

582
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,069
"and where the best in me
is demoralized and lowered."

583
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,112
Hello, you.

584
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,275
Shh.

585
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,157
- How the hell did you get...
- Shh.

586
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,113
Tell me, is "Pablo..."

587
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,237
Is he one of your lovers, too?

588
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,315
- Jealous?
- No.

589
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,071
He always seems <i>so</i> sleepy.

590
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,151
He can be waked up.

591
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,195
Uh-huh.

592
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,238
So, what are you doing
with an old man like me?

593
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,151
You're not in competition, you know.

594
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,190
Oh.

595
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,072
I love "you..."

596
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,318
because you're shy and "tender..."

597
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,079
and because I can see in your "eyes..."

598
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,191
that you are pleased
that I am <so pretty.

599
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,079
With another, it might
be exactly the opposite.

600
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,158
I'd be thrilled if he used me
and didn't care a fig for me.

601
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,239
But a life without
love, I couldn't bear it.

602
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,111
Maria, I love you.

603
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,114
You know, Pablo said I
must treat you "nicely..."

604
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,197
because you are <i>so</i> very unhappy.

605
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,119
How did he come to this
extraordinary conclusion?

606
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,319
He said, "Look at his eyes.
He doesn't know how to laugh."

607
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,272
"Herr" Harry, come for
a spin in my motorcar.

608
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,235
Pablo, hello.

609
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,070
What I want to ask you for,
champ, is a Ioan of 20 "francs..."

610
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,270
and you can have Maria
again tonight, if you want.

611
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,074
Barter for a woman is counted among us
as the last degradation, "Herr" Pablo.

612
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,269
I have not heard your proposal.

613
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,311
Where on earth did you get this car?

614
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,114
Look, don't sleep with Maria if
you want to invent "troubles..."

615
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,191
but loan me the money anyway, okay?

616
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,199
It's for Iittle Augustino with
the violin, you know. He's sick.

617
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,270
You should have said so.

618
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,119
But you still didn't
answer about the car.

619
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,275
Oh, I borrowed it, you know.

620
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,119
- Who from?
- I don't know.

621
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,200
Good Lord, why did you have to
borrow such a highly visible car?

622
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,074
Listen, this car has "deux
cent soixante chevaux."

623
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,315
They may see you, but
they'll never catch me.

624
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,117
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Hello.

625
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,271
Harry, quick. Quick, quick, quick.

626
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,310
Hey.

627
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,072
Halt!

628
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,155
Tell me, "Pablo..."

629
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,273
why is it that you don't
care to discuss music with me?

630
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,152
Oh, you know, you know
more about it than me.

631
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,235
I just play.

632
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,157
It's all the same to me.

633
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,078
But it isn't all the same, is it?

634
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,278
You can't put Mozart on
the same level "with..."

635
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,120
the latest foxtrot,
or whatever, can you?

636
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,317
I don't put nothing on any level at all.

637
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,151
I just play whatever comes to me.

638
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,118
Pablo.

639
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:42,114
Tell me, Pablo. What is it
you want out of life, hmm?

640
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,230
Out of music?

641
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,157
"Je ne sais pas, moi."

642
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,158
A laugh, a "giggle..."

643
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,199
kick the gong around now and "then..."

644
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,195
"beaucoup de poule."

645
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,151
I see. A hedonist.

646
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,238
Sticks and stones will break my bones.

647
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,118
Your turn now.

648
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,152
What is it you want?

649
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,270
Light.

650
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,152
There is a light within.

651
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,154
You need only step out of
your own shadows to see it.

652
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,153
We could all go to bed
together, if you want.

653
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,150
No.

654
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,230
No, thanks.

655
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,195
We're all friends.

656
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,117
If he doesn't want "to..."

657
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,151
Pity. He's so moral.

658
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,310
Nothing to be done.

659
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,315
All the "same..."

660
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,120
it would have been so
beautiful, so very beautiful.

661
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,237
I think I have to Iie down.

662
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,073
Why is it that you aren't
already the wife of a "king..."

663
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,236
or a revolutionary,
or some sort of genius?

664
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,118
I have been a courtesan
of fairly good taste.

665
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,151
That's what Iife has allowed me.

666
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,153
- Did you ever demand more?
- Always.

667
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,237
- What?
- Eternity.

668
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,275
Where did you hope to find that?

669
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,270
In a special "kingdom..."

670
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,117
on the other side of appearances.

671
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,313
The kingdom of God, if you're
pious, but it doesn't matter.

672
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,279
Whatever you call it, it's
where we belong, our home.

673
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,072
Oh, "Harry..."

674
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,119
so much dirt and humbug we
have to slog "through..."

675
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,117
in order to get "home..."

676
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,238
and no guide but our homesickness.

677
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,315
And now, me, I am off.

678
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,118
So, friends and lovers,
have a divine "evening..."

679
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,111
and I'll see you at the ball.

680
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,155
Please.

681
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,153
- Please.
- Sorry.

682
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,190
Harry.

683
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,195
Have you seen Hermine?

684
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,277
I've been searching all
night. It's hopeless.

685
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,073
Can you at Ieast tell me
what her costume is like?

686
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,191
Just look for yourself. You'll find her.

687
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,277
So what the devil is
that supposed to mean?

688
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,110
Now, now, now. Don't Iose your
sense of humor, not tonight.

689
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,191
Lost your number? Take mine.

690
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,230
Hey, dance with me.

691
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,270
I can't.

692
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,119
- I'm on my way to hell.
- Come on.

693
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,315
Maria.

694
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,117
Hermine is waiting for me in hell.

695
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,231
I know, my darling. Run along.

696
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,279
And farewell, Harry. I
won't forget you. Ever.

697
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,315
Farewell.

698
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,235
Hermine.

699
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,310
So, you've found me at last.

700
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,113
Is this the way you mean to
make me fall in love with you?

701
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,314
You are even ready to go
through hell to find me?

702
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,195
Is there any other way?

703
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,151
"You dreamed of escape."

704
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,079
"You have a longing to
forsake this world..."

705
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,270
"to penetrate to a world beyond time."

706
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,276
"You know this other world exists."

707
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:39,029
"l can give you nothing that
isn't already within you."

708
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,196
"All I can give you is the chance."

709
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,156
Brother Harry, I invite you
to a Iittle entertainment.

710
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,112
For madmen only, and one price only.

711
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,073
Your mind. Are you ready?

712
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:10,154
And now I'll show you
our Iittle Magie Theater.

713
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,311
As many doors as you Iike.

714
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:30,119
And behind each <i>door,</i> exactly
what you are Iooking for.

715
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,073
But the price of "admission..."

716
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,198
will be a trifling Iittle suicide.

717
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,077
You don't mind, do you?

718
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,113
To conquer time and "reality..."

719
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,114
you must extinguish these
superfluous "reflections..."

720
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,191
you call your personality.

721
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,238
All it takes is a hearty laugh.

722
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,235
Excellent, Harry.

723
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,111
"Excellent, Harry."

724
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,197
"You'll Iaugh Iike the immortals yet."

725
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,153
"Penetrate to a world beyond time."

726
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:44,030
"lt's all an illusion, the
Magie Theater, not reality."

727
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,230
"... nothing that isn't
already within you."

728
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,315
Pablo!

729
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,155
Hermine!

730
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,113
"You have a Ionging
to forsake this world."

731
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,277
"l can give you nothing that
isn't already within you."

732
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,317
"...chance. The impulse."

733
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,113
"l help you make your movie..."

734
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,151
"As many doors as you like."

735
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,235
"And behind..."

736
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,233
"Mutant transformation into
any animal or plant you please."

737
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,197
The Great Automobile Hunt.

738
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,278
"Transformation from time into space."

739
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,235
"Compendium of art."

740
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,230
Oh.

741
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,275
Gustav! Good Lord!

742
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,157
Fancy meeting you here.
What are you doing?

743
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,119
I'm a professor of theology, Harry.

744
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,231
Got that son of a bitch that time.

745
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,153
- What's going on?
- It's war.

746
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,270
At long last, the war
against the machine.

747
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,275
Come on.

748
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,077
So it's just what you have
been waiting for, Harry.

749
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,191
- What?
- War against the machine.

750
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,072
Don't listen to him.

751
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,192
You are obliged to stem the
rising tide of "anarchy..."

752
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,073
fomented by effete "intellectuals..."

753
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,077
who cynically reject the "blessings..."

754
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,158
of order, work and private property.

755
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,157
What's that got to do
with machines, then?

756
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,273
Technology is the most sublime
creation of the human "mind..."

757
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,277
that will eventually set man free.

758
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,118
What do you think?

759
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,071
Six off one, a half
a dozen off the other.

760
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,317
Villains. Traitors. After
all we've done for you.

761
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,151
Come on. Get out. Come on.

762
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,315
Out. Go!

763
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,077
I think you ought to "know..."

764
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,158
I don't consider this very
patriotic of you fellows.

765
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,230
Look.

766
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,119
Here, help me with this stuff.

767
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,158
We want to be ready
for them when they come.

768
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,073
To think that I used to be a pacifist.

769
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,074
Where does this bloodlust come
from? I'm sure it's not rational.

770
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,114
Of course it isn't.
It's pure childishness.

771
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,120
That's war, childishness
on a gigantic scale.

772
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,150
Yes.

773
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,153
We must not always reduce the
irrational to the "rational..."

774
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,271
as do the Americans,
and the Bolsheviks, too.

775
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,311
They are both
extraordinarily "rational..."

776
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,153
and they both produce a frightful
oppression and impoverishment of Iife.

777
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,154
You are a Iulu, Harry.
You talkjust Iike a book.

778
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,119
But we'll bag no cars with philosophy.

779
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,197
All hands to battle stations.

780
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,112
Bravo! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

781
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,197
I am Attorney-General Loering.

782
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,237
Why did you fire upon us?

783
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,235
For exceeding the speed Iimit.

784
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,271
We were only doing the normal speed.

785
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,154
What was normal yesterday
is no Ionger normal today.

786
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,192
Any speed a motorcar
travels is too great.

787
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:43,110
And now, will you be so kind as to get
out, as your motorcar will be destroyed.

788
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,069
I prefer to be destroyed with it.

789
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,190
As you Iike.

790
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,031
God knows as public "prosecutor..."

791
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,198
you've murdered your share
of poor devils in your day.

792
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,195
It was my duty.

793
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,199
A conception obviously unknown to you.

794
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,310
What duty?

795
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,272
I belonged to the state,
I served as a "soldier..."

796
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,279
I killed on orders and paid
taxes to buy more "armaments..."

797
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,078
until I couldn't get up in the
morning without throwing up.

798
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,190
You bore me.

799
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,113
Be so kind as to get on with your job.

800
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,151
My dear, are you skilled with firearms?

801
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,151
You could teach me.

802
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,271
I imagine you'll be wanting lunch soon.

803
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,158
Have you gota court
plaster for my finger?

804
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,073
It's bleeding Iike anything.

805
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,199
- Whatever is to become of us?
- Don't know.

806
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,198
But my friend Harry knows.
He's fond of pretty girls.

807
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,117
He'll look after you. Come on.

808
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,035
If you had some cucumbers, I could
make some smashing sandwiches.

809
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:00,319
Ah.

810
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,191
"...Wherever you like..."

811
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,191
"and behind each door..."

812
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,234
"You have a Ionging to forsake this world,
to penetrate to a world beyond time."

813
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,318
"Downfall of the west, moderate
prices, never surpassed."

814
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,239
"Delightful suicide,
laugh yourself to bits."

815
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,079
"..."Great Automobile "Hunt..."

816
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,238
"These Kamasutra... lnstructions..."

817
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,191
"As many doors as you like."

818
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,315
Pablo?

819
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,193
- Who are you?
- I'm not anybody.

820
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,078
I'm a chess player. 
Do you want "instruction..."

821
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,073
in building up your personality?

822
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,316
- Yes, please.
- May I see your pieces, please?

823
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,235
Pieces?

824
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:22,233
Of your personality. I can't
play without the pieces.

825
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,231
Which one is you?

826
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,155
Wrong.

827
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,277
You are the whole game.

828
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,278
But all these personalities in
one man, that's schizophrenia.

829
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,077
It don't matter, honey.

830
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,230
Watch.

831
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,079
What is it called, this game?

832
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,311
Life. Your Iife.

833
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,193
Complicate it or
enrich it as you please.

834
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,152
Your soul has fallen to bits and pieces.

835
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:06,200
Good. Rearrange them to suit yourself.

836
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,235
Harry!

837
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,276
What on earth are you doing in there?

838
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:40,114
My goodness, you've
gone and hurt yourself.

839
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,190
Yes.

840
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,275
Poor, dear Harry.

841
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,114
I've always wondered what
became of you. AII these years.

842
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,153
You haven't changed a bit, Rosa.

843
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,114
The last time I saw you here,
that spring "afternoon..."

844
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,230
you wouldn't even speak.

845
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,231
I meant to. I wanted to.

846
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,316
But I was afraid. I was only 15.

847
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,071
My heart trembled so.

848
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,111
Did it? Really?

849
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,316
I cried myself to sleep that night.

850
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,157
And then I began to forget.

851
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,191
Never quite, though, you know.

852
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,152
But you never knew me.

853
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,111
Listen, Rosa, I could
have destroyed you.

854
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,197
You see, sometimes "l'm..."

855
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:26,312
There are terrible compulsions,
urges that come over me.

856
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,158
You might have Iet me
take the risk myself.

857
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,198
"I used to dream that I
was having your child."

858
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:51,198
"You never asked. You never listened."

859
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,154
"l hoped you would be
different from the others."

860
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,310
Hermine!

861
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,270
Hermine!

862
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,310
"So Iong, then, and enjoy your dreams."

863
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,231
"Doesn't matter. Just relax a bit."

864
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,118
Hermine!

865
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,319
Hermine.

866
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,197
"But I need you, too."

867
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,119
"Don't forget what you promised."

868
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,270
"...For something very
important and very beautiful."

869
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,231
"But in the end, as you call it..."

870
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,153
"you will have to fulfill
my last wish as well."

871
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,195
"Kill me."

872
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,190
Mozart.

873
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,272
You see? It goes all right
without the saxophone.

874
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,153
Though, to be sure, I shouldn't
want to tread on the "toes..."

875
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,077
of that famous instrument.

876
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,077
- Where are we?
- In the last act.

877
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,191
Liberello is on his knees.

878
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,278
There's a lot in it that's
very human, "certainly..."

879
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:59,078
but you can hear the
other world in it, "too..."

880
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,270
- the laughter, hmm?
- Plentitude. Power.

881
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,315
It's the Iast great music ever written.

882
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,275
Don't strain yourself.

883
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,111
You are a musician?

884
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:13,279
I've retired myself, but I do Iike
to drop in from time to "time..."

885
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,199
to see how the business is getting on.

886
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:44,192
Look, there is Brahms,
striving for redemption.

887
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,197
He'll be at it for quite a time yet.

888
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,276
And Wagner. What are they in for?

889
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:57,154
Thick orchestration. No
personal failing, you understand.

890
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,118
- It was a fault of the time.
- But they can't help it.

891
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,237
They couldn't help Adam
eating the apple, "either..."

892
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,078
but they have to pay for it.

893
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,155
But it's frightful.

894
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,111
Oh, life always is.

895
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,278
We can't help it, but we
are responsible anyway.

896
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,232
One is born, and at once, one is guilty.

897
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,112
Where is your fine
religious education, anyway?

898
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,318
So you mean I'll be called to
account for all those books I wrote?

899
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,072
"- Herr" Mozart? 
- Shh.

900
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:55,193
Munich's coming through. 
It's a symphony by Friedemann Bach.

901
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:00,118
What are you doing? Listen to it.

902
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:05,194
This infernal machine murders music.

903
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,232
Belt up and listen, my friend.

904
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,236
Listen past the wireless to the music.

905
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,151
It's just like life.

906
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,238
You must see through the
appearance to the reality beneath.

907
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:22,194
Anyway, it little becomes you
to be a critic of "radio..."

908
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:24,157
or of life, either.

909
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,191
Learn to listen first.

910
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:30,199
Learn what is to be taken
seriously and to laugh at the rest.

911
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:38,199
I think I'm beginning to understand.

912
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,153
You are a great joker, Harry, huh?

913
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,197
What's this mess, now?

914
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:49,079
You couldn't think of
anything better to "do..."

915
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:53,159
with this enchanting
young lady than this?

916
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,151
I expect you are now
looking for a "way..."

917
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,079
to evade the consequences
of this dreary butchery.

918
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,155
You don't understand, "Herr" Mozart.

919
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,237
I want to pay. I want to pay
and pay again for what I've done.

920
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,271
I want to lay my head under the axe.

921
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,230
What a pathetic cringe you are, Harry.

922
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,237
But you'll learn humor yet.

923
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,197
Gallows humor.

924
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,191
All humor is gallows humor.

925
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:26,153
- Ready, my friend?
- I'm ready.

926
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,152
"Gentlemen..."

927
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:33,153
there stands before
you Harry "Haller..."

928
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:38,115
accused and found guilty of the
willful misuse of our Magie Theater.

929
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,310
Haller has not alone insulted
the majesty of "art..."

930
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,150
in that he "confounded..."

931
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,272
our beautiful picture gallery
with so called "reality..."

932
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:51,156
and stabbed to death the reflection of
a girl with the reflection of a knife.

933
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:55,239
He has, in addition, displayed the
intention to use our "theater..."

934
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,191
as a mechanism of "suicide..."

935
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,196
and shown himself devoid of humor.

936
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,276
Therefore, we condemn "Haller..."

937
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,155
to eternal "life..."

938
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,238
and suspend for 12 hours his
permission to enter our theater.

939
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,197
You really botched it, Harry.

940
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:29,073
You Iost your sense of humor.

941
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:33,239
AII that messy business with
the knife, and your ugly reality.

942
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:37,152
"Je pensais que vous auriez
mieux joué le jeux que ca."

943
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:41,234
Pablo, I'm beginning to understand.
I understand you. And Goethe.

944
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,079
I've still got all the
pieces in my pocket.

945
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,315
If I only had another chance.

946
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,195
As many as you Iike.

947
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,199
This is not the end, you
know. Only a beginning.

948
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,152
Where do I have to go from here?

949
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:56,114
The way of innocence Ieads on, not back.

950
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,151
Not back to the world of the "child..."

951
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:02,078
