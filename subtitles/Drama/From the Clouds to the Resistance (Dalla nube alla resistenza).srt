1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,126
Hey.

2
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,495
Hey.

3
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:32,436
How did you know?

4
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:34,139
Boomer told me.

5
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,575
What's it like
in there, anyway?

6
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:38,939
It's pretty rough?

7
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,344
Yeah, they had some
skin job all over me

8
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,508
about the temple massacre,
the weapons.

9
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,542
Who, what, where. You know, the
usual stuff. Just like you'd expect.

10
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,917
And?

11
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,195
I told him to
go frak himself.

12
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,731
Good.

13
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:08,540
I would have liked to have
seen the look on his face.

14
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,077
Yeah. He was one
pissed-off toaster.

15
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,806
Bet he was.
