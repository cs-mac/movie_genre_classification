1
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:21,310
<i>There's two kinds of people in this world</i>
<i>when you boil it all down.</i>

2
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,855
<i>You've got your talkers</i>
<i>and you've got your doers.</i>

3
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,791
<i>Most people are just talkers.</i>
<i>All they got is talk.</i>

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:34,323
<i>But when all is said and done,</i>
<i>it's the doers who change this world.</i>

5
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,961
<i>And when they do that, they change us.</i>
<i>And that's why we never forget them.</i>

6
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,264
<i>So, which one are you?</i>

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,967
<i>Do you just talk about it</i>

8
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,671
<i>or do you stand up</i>
<i>and do something about it?</i>

9
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:52,649
<i>Because believe you me,</i>
<i>all the rest of it is just coffeehouse bullshit.</i>

10
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,766
<i>Peace, they say, is the enemy of memory.</i>

11
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,239
<i>So it had been for my boys.</i>

12
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,543
<i>For some time now,</i>
<i>the past had felt like a dream to them,</i>

13
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,342
<i>faded and worn.</i>

14
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:03,018
<i>And then suddenly,</i>
<i>as if not a day had passed,</i>

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,752
<i>it was back.</i>

16
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,093
<i>L could see it in their eyes.</i>

17
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,126
<i>L could feel it, heavy in their presence.</i>

18
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,273
<i>Something calling them back.</i>

19
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,658
Something's happened.

20
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,014
No! Stop! Stop, stop!

21
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,316
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please! Please!

22
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,986
God, no, stop...

23
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,436
A priest?

24
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,336
Did they release his name?

25
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:37,549
No, but I made a few calls.
L still have friends in the diocese there.

26
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,112
McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

27
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:49,150
-You knew him?
-Knew of him. Everybody did.

28
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,658
He's a good man.
Youth hostels, soup kitchens.

29
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,495
He even made it to the papers sometimes.

30
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,366
Look, boys,
l think it's best if you just stay put

31
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,235
until we try to figure out
what the hell is going on.

32
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,311
Aren't you at least gonna try
and talk them out of this?

33
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,906
For all we know, it could be somebody
just trying to get away with murder here.

34
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,143
Aye.

35
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,548
Only there's a thousand easier ways
to do that.

36
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,755
Trust me.

37
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,051
Someone's trying to call them out.

38
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:29,328
You kill a priest, in a church,
and make it look like it was them.

39
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,031
Bring them back with a vengeance.

40
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,932
Someone thinks it's really clever.

41
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,376
-Only one problem with this little plan.
-What's that?

42
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,846
It worked.

43
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,814
Exactly what do you intend to do?

44
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,856
Every last motherfucker
that had anything to do with it.

45
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,606
<i>There is no new information</i>
<i>on the victim found slain</i>

46
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,443
<i>this morning inside</i>
<i>the Church of the Holy Saints.</i>

47
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,315
As you can see, the size of the crowd here
has increased substantially

48
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,880
as we have confirmed that the body
was ritualized with pennies in the eyes.

49
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,458
Many remember this
as the grisly calling card

50
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,723
of the prolific vigilante killers
known as the Saints,

51
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,230
<i>who went on a murder spree here in Boston.</i>

52
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,803
<i>A rampage that ended eight years ago when</i>
<i>the Saints brazenly walked into open court</i>

53
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,634
<i>and executed Mafia don</i>
<i>Poppa Joe Yakavetta</i>

54
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,640
<i>before a courtroom of terrified witnesses</i>

55
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,542
and then simply disappeared without a trace.

56
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,546
<i>As police have yet to confirm</i>
<i>the Saints' possible involvement,</i>

57
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,378
<i>the ominous question</i>
<i>hangs heavy in the air.</i>

58
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,543
<i>"Are they back?"</i>

59
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,383
We need to keep our heads here.

60
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,223
It's probably not even them.

61
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,764
Course it ain't them.
Lt doesn't really matter, does it?

62
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,368
All our skeletons just came screaming
out of the closet.

63
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,404
-We're fucked!
-We're not fucked!

64
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,407
We are totally fucked! And not just fucked.

65
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,603
Like elephant-dick-pounded-in-the-ass,
no-reach-around,

66
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,374
-jungle-fucked!
-Now's not the time to panic, green beans!

67
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,746
I disagree! Now is a perfect time to panic.
We are all accessories...

68
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,547
-Don't fucking say it!
-I'm gonna say it, all right.

69
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,453
-You've got a mouth on you, Greenly.
-Both of you calm down. Just calm down.

70
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,252
Shut the fuck up!

71
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,061
Her ETA's 10 minutes.

72
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,222
Thanks, Seamus.

73
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,734
It's game time. How we playing this?

74
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,310
Feds love to pull
the divide-and-conquer routine.

75
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,779
We hardline her. Stick together on this.

76
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,146
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

77
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,382
We're a brick wall.

78
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,723
Let's rock this bitch.

79
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,687
Eunice Bloom. It's a pleasure.

80
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,591
Now, you have got to be Greenly.

81
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,595
Smecker always said
you were the funny one.

82
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,257
Well, funny as in "ha-ha, " though,

83
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,029
not like funny as in "gay,"
'cause I'm totally not.

84
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,832
What we're trying to figure out is,
with all due respect, Agent Bloom...

85
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,033
-"Special.' '
-Excuse me?

86
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,168
You see, there's a "special"
before my "agent.' '

87
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,340
if we're gonna address each other formally,
I'd appreciate if you popped it in there,

88
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,110
because it makes me feel special.

89
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,981
Of course, I was hoping
we could be a bit more personable.

90
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,987
In fact, I'd welcome you to call me Eunice,
and maybe l...

91
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,852
Okay, Eunice.

92
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,024
I don't see why the fuck the Fed
is even involved.

93
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,356
"Fuck"? This isn't a "fuck" situation, is it?

94
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,230
I mean, I can understand a "goddamn"
or two, but why skip all the way...

95
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,964
What is the Fed's interest in this?

96
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:40,205
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing the men responsible

97
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,577
for the murders
of 22 of Boston's finest criminals.

98
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,015
They could have sent anyone. They sent me.
Now, why do you think that is?

99
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,987
Well, since we've already broken
the "fuck" barrier, allow me to be blunt.

100
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,354
It is because I am so fucking smart

101
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,917
that I make smart people feel
that they are retarded.

102
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,052
-Motherfuckers! Which one do you want?
-Me first, man, me first!

103
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,083
Bust his head!

104
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,055
That son of a bitch over there!

105
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,435
All right! House is closed, motherfuckers!

106
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,429
Why are his hands chained?

107
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,741
Romeo is very fast, man.

108
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,878
He says the Frenchman can't lay
a hand on him.

109
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,937
But he can't hit him back.

110
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,240
That's the bet, <i>ese.</i>

111
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,078
He's got to last five minutes.

112
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,392
-Fifty on the Mexican.
-Fifty on the Mexican.

113
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,724
Never fight a Mexican, Pierre.

114
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,100
Pound for pound,
toughest motherfuckers on Earth!

115
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,502
Attaboy!

116
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,305
You know why? We like pain, Pierre.

117
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,573
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

118
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,515
Think about it, man. Tabasco sauce?

119
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,417
What kind of fucked-up people
would even invent that shit?

120
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,620
Get the fuck out of the way!

121
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,022
Whore.

122
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,695
Don't be scared, now.
Remember, I can't hit you.

123
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,601
I ain't gonna hit you!

124
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,973
Found a loophole, bitch!
L ought to be a lawyer.

125
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,060
Thank you!

126
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,530
Shit, man!

127
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,519
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please!

128
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,358
Please! Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!

129
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,935
It wasn't them,
but I'm sure you boys already knew that.

130
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,006
All their vics were criminals.
Clearly not the case here.

131
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,172
So, it wasn't them,

132
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,342
which makes this a local matter
and falls under our jurisdiction.

133
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,684
So, with all due respect,
we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom.

134
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,686
"With all due respect.' '
Man, I hate it when people say that,"

135
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,197
because it is inevitably followed
by a disrespectful remark.

136
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,563
Here, let me give you an example.

137
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,762
With all due respect, Detective,

138
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,433
this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction

139
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,137
l fucking say it does.

140
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,476
-You fucking...
-Let's just...

141
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,250
What can you tell us about the shooters?

142
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,981
"Shooter.' ' Singular."

143
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,222
And I can tell you...

144
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,228
How shall I put this delicately?
He's a short little fucker.

145
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,427
One guy. Dwarf. Got it.

146
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,235
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

147
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,772
Detective Greenly,

148
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,912
you're the victim.

149
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,006
David. You can call me David.

150
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,449
Very well, David.

151
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,519
The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel eight years ago.

152
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,019
Two men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees

153
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,256
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.

154
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,368
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand.

155
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,631
Eyes front, David.

156
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,177
The position of the victim and the angles
produced by the killers' stance

157
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,176
created a unique scenario.

158
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,043
The bullets crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.

159
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,347
Here, this did not occur.
The rounds moved on a straight trajectory

160
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,718
through the back of the victim's head
and out the front,

161
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,950
which happens when...

162
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,495
One guy's holding two guns
to the back of your head.

163
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,656
One guy.

164
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,809
But you said he was wicked short.

165
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,249
The Saints were later determined
to be 5'11" tall.

166
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,184
The rounds exit Petrova's eyeballs.

167
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:29,917
Here, they came out the lower cheek,
three, four inches below the eyes.

168
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:35,158
That puts him at 5'7"-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.

169
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,735
The killer posed as a late-night confessor.

170
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,535
Once the victim entered the booth,
the killer had him isolated. No escape.

171
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,543
Short stuff comes out of the confessional,
kicks in the door of the priest's chambers,

172
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,080
leaving a crescent-shaped indentation,

173
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,946
<i>which tells us that this cowboy</i>
<i>was wearing a boot with a pronounced heel.</i>

174
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,951
<i>Gave him a couple inches.</i>

175
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,851
<i>We're looking about 5'5", gentlemen.</i>

176
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,115
-That's wicked short.
-Wicked.

177
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,425
<i>Speculation on the Saints'</i>
<i>possible involvement</i>

178
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,293
<i>in the murder of Father Douglas McKinney</i>
<i>continues to boil over.</i>

179
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,027
<i>Ln fact, it has split the public</i>
<i>right down the middle.</i>

180
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,897
<i>My cousin was there. He saw the body.</i>
<i>His hands were crossed over his chest.</i>

181
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,064
<i>Lt was them.</i>

182
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,143
<i>-it wasn't them.</i>
<i>-You know, maybe the priest did something.</i>

183
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,075
<i>There were pennies in his eyes, they did it.</i>

184
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,074
<i>-They didn't do it.</i>
<i>-Lt wasn't them.</i>

185
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,983
<i>-You're on the air, caller.</i>
<i>-Well, finally, man, yeah.</i>

186
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,253
<i>This guy was indicted last year</i>
<i>for ordering the murders of 22 people.</i>

187
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,728
<i>And it slid right off his back. Piece of shit!</i>

188
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:43,063
<i>Indeed, Boston has been under</i>
<i>the terrible reign of this thug for years now.</i>

189
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,567
<i>Where's the DA's office?</i>

190
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,401
<i>Why can't they make anything stick</i>
<i>to Concezio Yakavetta?</i>

191
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,939
I can't believe
that none of us were consulted on this!

192
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,073
The disrespect!

193
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:03,151
We never would have okayed such a thing.
A priest! It's <i>infamità!</i>

194
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,486
Are we not Catholics?
For Christ's fucking sakes!

195
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:12,529
And for what? Revenge?
There's no business in it, Concezio.

196
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,256
The cops. They can be all over us.

197
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,301
Forget the cops.
What about these Saints fuckers?

198
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,200
These guys were long gone,

199
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,863
and now you're trying to bring the devil
right back to our doorstep?

200
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,032
Eight years ago,

201
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,874
these vigilante fucks
put my father on his knees

202
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,713
<i>and executed him</i>

203
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,452
in public.

204
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,131
<i>Mi padrino,</i> a blood relative
and benedictator to all of you.

205
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:57,041
You think that I don't know
that each one of you

206
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:02,377
has been waking up with the night sweats
over this for eight years?

207
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:08,485
These sons of bitches prison-fucked us!

208
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,082
In the ass!

209
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,818
And then they wiped their dicks
on our grandma's drapes!

210
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:22,400
And we have been living in silent fear
ever since.

211
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,337
We don't talk about it.

212
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,233
Rape victims seldom do.

213
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:37,771
Concezio is right.
Pretending you don't got a problem

214
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,879
don't solve nothing.

215
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,117
Let's take a moment

216
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,419
and look at the serendiculous...

217
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,223
Seren.. . Seren.. . Seren...

218
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,855
Serendipitous.

219
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,131
...type situation we find ourselves in.

220
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,534
There's a wicked good chance
that these Saints are gonna show.

221
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:11,142
And this time,
they don't catch us with our pants down.

222
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:18,947
This time, we deal with them
proactiviously, huh?

223
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,950
And don't forget Boston's finest.

224
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,229
With their second bite at the apple

225
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,131
they've got every reason in the world
to crank up the heat.

226
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,928
And as for the Saints' doting fans,

227
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,128
fuck them!

228
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,177
Bad luck.

229
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,289
How would he even recognize us?

230
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,484
You don't remember the fucking sketches
on the news channel?

231
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,355
-Shit, that's right.
-Fuck's sake.

232
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,087
You know,
every time you see those composites on TV

233
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,291
and they catch the guy,
it looks nothing like him.

234
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,158
-But ours...
-Just our luck, right?

235
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,128
We draw Leonardo fucking da Vinci
as a sketch artist.

236
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,342
And two days ago,
we looked like Jesus Christ.

237
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,775
-What the fuck we cut our hair for?
-Yeah, that's right.

238
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:19,716
I don't know, it seemed like the thing to do
at the time, though, didn't it?

239
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,684
-Maybe we should dye it.
-What?

240
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,987
Well, they're always dying their hair
in the movies, like <i>The Fugitive.</i>

241
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,060
It's covert and shit.

242
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,125
What color would you dye it?

243
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,461
Lighter, I guess.

244
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,528
-Do you mean blonde?
-L didn't fucking say that.

245
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,504
Like California surfer boy.

246
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,169
-It's not what I'm saying.
-Like gay, gay, gay,

247
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,711
-faggoty blonde.
-I'm fucking warning you!

248
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,643
-"Stay gold, Ponyboy!"
-I'm fucking warning you!

249
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,545
-"Stay gold.. .' '
-Fuck you!

250
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,173
You fucking cunt!

251
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,912
Jesus fucking Christ!

252
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,315
-Well, I was fucking mad!
-Shit!

253
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,548
What kind of fucking crazy...

254
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,094
-l know who you are. You guys are...
-Shut it!

255
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,721
This is so fucking cool, man!

256
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,699
I'm from Boston and I love you guys.
Shit, everybody loves you guys.

257
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,828
Maybe I can get on this thing.
You know, bring some <i>raza</i> into this.

258
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,535
Hey, is it true that you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?

259
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,087
And an awesome wailing
was heard throughout heaven.

260
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,523
And the terrible hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.

261
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,529
And as Almighty God created you,

262
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,766
now he calleth you home!

263
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,106
Busy signal. Will have to call us back.

264
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,644
Let's have a shot while we're waiting.

265
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,989
-l think he took a little piss.
-That shit was not funny!

266
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,390
It just came out me fucking nose.

267
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,261
Thank you, Jesus.
Thought I greased my drawers.

268
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,332
No.

269
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,239
I've got connects all over Beantown, man.

270
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,643
Romeo will hook you up like a tow truck.

271
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,010
-No.
-Why not?

272
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,585
We don't have to give you fucking reasons.
Forget it.

273
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,085
It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it?

274
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,122
How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing?

275
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:43,456
The fact that you're a greasy spic,
it's got nothing to do with it.

276
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,520
Okay, I'm gonna let you have that one,
but, look, I can do this.

277
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,257
This isn't rocket surgery.

278
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,360
You guys find the bad guys
doing bad stuff and you kill them, right?

279
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,472
Well, it's not that simple, actually.

280
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,133
-Yes, it is.
-Suppose you're right.

281
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:02,310
I was just hoping that we was
a bit more artistic about it, I think.

282
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,314
Yeah? Well, you ain't.

283
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,881
Now, what do you plan on doing
when you get to US soil?

284
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:16,385
We don't really have, you know,
a succinct plan yet, you know, per se.

285
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,656
Haven't really worked it all out, as it were.

286
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:24,202
As it were. Not fully developed, per se.

287
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,066
You two leprechaun dicks need to chill
in the greenroom

288
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:31,471
sipping on some Pellegrino
and let your manager handle the details.

289
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,238
And you'd better have
my Cub Scout badge ready.

290
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,370
Because if you wanna kick Yakavetta
in the nuts,

291
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,746
have him wake up
with a horse head in his bed,

292
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,752
Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you.

293
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,487
And that's all she wrote.
Everything points in the same direction.

294
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,730
Get out.

295
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,440
Look, I have been stonewalling
the media on this thing.

296
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,445
I've got half of New England
thinking the Saints whacked the priest

297
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,017
and the other half thinking they're innocent.

298
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,018
It's a powder keg.

299
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,578
And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.

300
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:24,351
Now, I can clear them of this murder
and take the piss right out of this thing.

301
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,462
Now, give me one reason
why I shouldn't take this public right now.

302
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,297
Walk with me, Chief. Let's talk.

303
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,876
This is not good.

304
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,480
She's gunning for the boys hard.

305
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,057
This broad trying to put a feather in her cap
is gonna get us all locked up.

306
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,558
-l mean, this couldn't be going any worse.
-Just calm down.

307
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,152
Calm down? Calm down? You know
they're gonna throw us in the Hoag.

308
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,492
We put half those deranged sex freaks
in there.

309
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,498
I hope you guys like cock sandwiches,

310
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,399
because we'll be eating them for breakfast,
lunch and dinner!

311
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,832
Now, I understand
you've got a job to do, Chief.

312
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,840
But this pint-sized killer is the only thing

313
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,070
that puts Yakavetta
right in the middle of this.

314
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,012
And if Concezio even sniffs
that we on to him,

315
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,116
he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head,

316
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,345
plants him at the bottom of the ocean
and walks.

317
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,856
Now it is imperative
that we find this little man.

318
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:03,293
You have said some dumb shit in your days,
but that.. . l.. . You know, that.. . That...

319
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,296
What? We're all "assuming"
Smecker didn't tell her.

320
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,231
"Oh, yeah, by the way,
me and three Boston detectives

321
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,335
"are accessories to murder.
Pass the malt vinegar.' '"

322
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,064
Smecker may have been a lot of things,
but he was a stand-up guy.

323
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,641
-And we took an oath. The four of us!
-Yeah!

324
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,973
-Okay! I was just thinking.
-Well, don't do that.

325
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,341
-You're no good at it.
-Fuck you!

326
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,573
You're as dumb as a fucking heel,

327
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,649
-you know that, you blowjob?
-Fucking, cocksucking, hard-on...

328
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,481
Jesus Christ! Look!
We need to figure out what we're gonna do

329
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,557
when the boys show
and start doing what they do best.

330
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,750
Because that's when the shit's
really gonna hit the fan!

331
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,361
But everyone is assuming
that the boys are gonna turn up.

332
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,226
We got no way of knowing that for sure.

333
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,664
Yeah, that could totally happen.

334
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,663
They could not come back.

335
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,604
What dream world did you two
just slip into?

336
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,440
We know the boys.

337
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,040
Is there any part of you
that thinks they're just gonna let this slide?

338
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,343
Believe this.

339
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,446
They're either on their way
or they're already here.

340
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,258
I thought you said your car
was inconspicuous.

341
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:22,396
Yeah, well, I don't like words
with "spic" right in the middle.

342
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,135
Besides, it is where I live.

343
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,645
Yeah? Where's that? Margaritaville?

344
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,442
Hey, I hail from a colorful people.

345
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,751
Besides, you wouldn't know style
if it pitched a tent in your ass.

346
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,621
Ace in the hole time.

347
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,593
Been a lot of chatter about Yakavetta
being in bed with the Chinese.

348
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,631
This here is little Yaka's <i>yeyo.</i>

349
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,898
All right, here's the plan.

350
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,833
Then we skin out,
we go to Doc's for a shot of lrish,

351
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,236
we're at home in time for tacos.

352
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,034
That's what we do.

353
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,868
-What?
-Well, it's just this plan...

354
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,378
-What the fuck's wrong with the plan?
-It’s...

355
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,848
It's genius. I can even drive an f-lift, man.

356
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,820
-Got my Class D license and everything.
-That's the fucking spirit!

357
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,753
I'm gonna need a gun.

358
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,650
-Forget it.
-Forget it.

359
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,526
What the fuck, man? I'm in on this shit.
I'm working here!

360
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,660
-Okay.
-For fuck's sake!

361
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,766
Here's what you're gonna do.

362
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:36,670
You're gonna consider yourself
a fucking pledge until we tell you different.

363
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,907
Can I consider myself your girlfriend, too?

364
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,244
That's what you get.
Ls there a fucking problem?

365
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,385
It's fine.

366
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,079
I'm fucking watching you.

367
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,090
You understand me?
Now, you stow that shit.

368
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,857
Don't you worry, Rome.
Shit like this, it builds character.

369
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,693
Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

370
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,367
Now, that's just unprofessional.

371
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,137
So, what do you think?

372
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,034
I think Yakavetta killed a good man
just to send us a message.

373
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,307
Well, let's send him one right back.

374
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,556
<i>Motoring</i>

375
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,603
<i>...night</i>

376
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,770
<i>...right</i>

377
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:50,080
<i>And something that rhymes with "light"</i>

378
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,643
-Why?
-L don't know.

379
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,816
It's not them.

380
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,626
It's them.

381
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,530
A wise man once told me,

382
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:14,195
"Where a man's actions are firmly bound
to an unshakable faith,

383
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:19,106
"one's worst nightmares become sudden,
terrifying reality.' '"

384
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,706
You didn't have to bash me in the skull!

385
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,543
Sorry, man, we got a plan going here.

386
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,708
Technically, I was supposed
to knock you out.

387
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,720
But they gave me this faggoty little gun,
see, and the weight's just not...

388
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,551
Christ, that's a gun?

389
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:37,183
Why didn't you just point it at me
and say "scram"?

390
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,559
-Scram! Get the fuck out of here! Now!
-You got it!

391
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,894
Hey, guys, let's not let this one little incident
get in the way of...

392
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,560
Shut up
and get back behind the fucking wheel!

393
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,365
-Jeez!
-Well,

394
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,176
-at least your plan's off to a winning start.
-Go fuck yourself.

395
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,010
Oh, fuck.

396
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,388
That's heroin.

397
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,031
-How the fuck would you know?
-Fuck you. I know shit.

398
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,434
What's the symbolism here?

399
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:31,280
-Symbolism?
-Yeah. What does this symbolize?

400
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,216
Well, it symbolizes a huge fuck-up.

401
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,685
This is a plan that fell to pieces.

402
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,956
A lot of it don't make sense,
which is why it all makes perfect sense.

403
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,899
-Christ, what the fuck's he doing?
-L don't know. Hang on!

404
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,467
Fuck's sake.

405
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,603
All right, all right.

406
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,140
Christ, he can't fucking see
where he's going!

407
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,205
Shit! Turn to the left now! Tell him!

408
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,805
-Go left! Go left!
-What?

409
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,147
-That way! Go that way!
-Left? Fuck!

410
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,286
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Fucking stupid plan.

411
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,953
It's all in the execution.
And your negative attitude ain't helping any!

412
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,588
-What? What the fuck?
-Negative attitude?

413
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,963
-My fucking negative attitude?
-Yeah, your negative attitude!

414
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:29,130
You've got to visualize the end result!
You've got to force it into reality! Believe!

415
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,467
You've got to fucking believe!

416
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,076
I'm about to believe my fist
right up your fucking ass!

417
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,735
You'll do what?

418
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,074
-Not a believer!
-That's another thing,

419
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,514
don't be down at me,
'cause I'm right fucking there, man!

420
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,848
You've got to believe!

421
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,980
This bitch is fast-a-rooney.

422
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,417
Wait.

423
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,128
-Wait. Wait, wait, hold on.
-Uppey-downey!

424
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,162
Shit!

425
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,646
Boys, I believe things in our fair, little city

426
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,713
<i>just got downright biblical.</i>

427
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,482
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

428
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,825
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

429
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,233
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,

430
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,497
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

431
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,770
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

432
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,760
<i>While the wicked stand confounded,</i>

433
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,727
<i>call me with Thy Saints surrounded.</i>

434
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,034
Ballistics just dug it out.

435
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:49,308
A.22? You've got to be kidding me.
That's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

436
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:55,244
Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun
to a gunfight.

437
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,417
I don't know.

438
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,890
Ballistics is reading three shooters,
and this is one of them.

439
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,156
I find it hard to believe that one of the three
most lethal individuals on the planet

440
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,093
just switched over to birdshot.

441
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:11,635
Maybe we're reading this wrong.
Priest was a frame job, right?

442
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,227
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying
to eliminate some competition here?

443
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,499
Yeah.

444
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,279
No, sir, it's them.

445
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,142
Here he comes.

446
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,280
-Doc!
-Doc!

447
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,982
Boys!

448
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:38,323
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Come on in here with that. Get in quick.

449
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,025
Get in out of the cold. Come on.

450
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:46,630
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
L saw the news channel.

451
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,934
-Are you boys all right?
-Sound as an lrish pound, Doc.

452
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,204
-ls it too late for a shot?
-The Lord told me you'd be coming.

453
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:57,974
"Doc, " he said. "They'd be coming.' '
And I was to have everything ready.

454
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,313
And I have. I have everything...

455
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,319
It's all set.

456
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,819
This is our Mexican.

457
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,684
Nice to meet you, lad. They call me...
Fuck! Ass!

458
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,857
How you doing, Fuck Ass? I'm Romeo.

459
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:23,731
This used to be a speakeasy in the '40s.
L only use it for storage now.

460
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,576
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.

461
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:35,349
-This is so fucking cool!
-Nobody knows it's up here. You'll be safe.

462
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,821
You can get in and out the fire escape.

463
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,655
Know what this is? This is our hideout.
We got a fucking hideout, man!

464
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,422
What, are you fucking five years old?

465
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:54,527
You know, Rome,
we got sticks and blankets.

466
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,732
You can make yourself a fort.

467
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,671
Fuck the both of you, man.
This is fucking sweet.

468
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,607
We even got pinball machines, man.

469
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:27,602
Lobster dick! Look at me! Lobster dick!

470
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,618
Not this time, you little shit.

471
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,121
We'll see about that, old man.

472
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,627
Would somebody
please come over here and...

473
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,255
-Fuck!
-Me up the...

474
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,392
-Ass!
-Yes! That's what he done!

475
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:03,166
That's what he's done every time!
L took you down, old man, I took you down!

476
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,370
Are you hungry, lad?
L sent Louie out for some sandwiches.

477
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,007
I could eat.

478
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,041
Decent work.

479
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,444
Do you know what I'm thinking
would be a nice match for the back?

480
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,038
That chocolate hide with the heavy marbling

481
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,617
we've been trying to get rid of
for the last six months.

482
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,187
We'll make a leather man
out of you yet, son.

483
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,548
Go to it, lad.

484
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,495
I can't help you with that, lads.

485
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:09,801
But if you need something, anything,
made out of leather,

486
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,200
we'd be happy to do the job.

487
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,741
How many times have I been nice to you?

488
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,479
How many times do my people come here
and talk to you?

489
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,045
This song and dance is over.
It’s over, motherfucker!

490
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,993
You didn't see anything!

491
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,665
Noah!

492
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,244
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

493
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,212
We got to call the <i>polizia,</i> Noah!
We got to call somebody.

494
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,213
Noah! No.

495
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,968
You young guys worry too much.

496
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,939
We always bounce back.

497
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,744
Besides, better the chinks than us, right?

498
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,053
This is some serious shit here!

499
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,487
Something amusing you, queer bait?

500
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:40,427
-No, I was just...
-You should be focused on the next step!

501
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:47,263
That shipment of H was gonna
square our books for the next six months!

502
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,598
-Any thoughts on that?
-Yeah, I got some thoughts on that.

503
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,479
I was just thinking,
not too serendipitous for us.

504
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,843
You...

505
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:04,284
It's like the Roman Empire in here.
You even got concubines and shit.

506
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:11,189
-George. What gives here?
-A little cannoli, shrimp cocktail, huh?

507
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,487
I need to see the boss, right away.

508
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,759
Jimmy the Gofer, <i>la cortina.</i>

509
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,496
<i>Get over here.</i>

510
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,637
Hey, boss, I just came by to tell you...

511
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,476
<i>Push the talk button, numb nuts!</i>

512
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,610
Hello, can you hear me? Over.

513
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,516
<i>L can hear you fine.</i>
<i>Now what the fuck are you doing here?</i>

514
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,021
Copy that. Everything's in motion.

515
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,489
All our guys
are gunning for these Jesus freaks.

516
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,357
I figure there's no need for me to be
on the streets no more.

517
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,521
So, which one of these rooms
do you want me to take, huh?

518
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:52,568
<i>Are your ears fucking painted on?</i>
<i>Did I not make it perfectly clear</i>

519
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,864
<i>that you're to stay on the streets</i>
<i>until this is over?</i>

520
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,530
-l was...
<i>-Now get the fuck out of here!</i>

521
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,336
<i>Douche bag!</i>

522
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:03,675
<i>And don't come back till I say you can</i>
<i>or you're going back to Brooklyn,</i>

523
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,647
<i>you fat fucking waste of space!</i>

524
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,646
<i>You wanna find something in Boston</i>
<i>that don't wanna be found,</i>

525

526

<i>Out the game, but still got his name.</i>

527
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,920
Yakavetta's gunning for you <i>muchachos,</i>
and hard.

528
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:24,831
Even posted a reward,
like Jesse James-style shit.

529
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:31,174
Anyway, any of his guys that take you out
gets his palm crossed.

530
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,110
Two hundred and fifty big ones.

531
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,544
Quarter mil for us?

532
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,517
"Us"? What are you talking about, "us"?

533
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:47,385
Uncle, why do you disrespect me
in front of my friends?

534
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,759
I'm disrespecting you?

535
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,928
A year ago
you were washing my pots and pans.

536
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,926
Well, I don't wash
fucking pots and pans anymore.

537
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,469
I'm a part of this Uncle.

538
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,363
Nephew, this is not my first barbeque.

539
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,069
He's with us.

540
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,942
Ls he?

541
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,555
And is my nephew here
pulling his own weight?

542
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,258
A lot of heart.

543
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,567
<i>Ahora,</i> Gorgeous George is running
the show right now for little Yaka.

544
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:40,110
And if anyone knows where he is,
it's that fat, fucking ugly <i>perico.</i>

545
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,671
I'll get it out on the wire.

546
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,199
Anybody hungry?

547
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,098
-Maybe we should stop at an lHOP or...
-Shut up!

548
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,762
Romeo's crying.

549
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,505
Fucking assholes!

550
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,337
Shut up!

551
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,858
Oh, yeah.

552
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,726
Yeah, that feels good.

553
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,877
Somebody had their Wheaties this morning.

554
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,248
Yeah, get after it, girl.

555
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,720
Oh, that's good.

556
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,791
Hey, let's keep this professional, baby.

557
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,624
No offense,
but I don't need you calling me all the time.

558
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,236
What the fuck!
I'll kill you, you fucking bitch!

559
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,610
What the fuck did you just say to me?

560
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,079
I'm sorry I called you that.

561
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,312
How courteous of you to apologize.
Courtesy is so important, don't you agree?

562
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,419
Yeah. Yeah, I'm down with that.

563
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,427
Good. Now sit your fat ass down.

564
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,312
Where is Concezio Yakavetta?

565
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,918
-l don't know.
-Yeah, there's a lot you don't know, hoss.

566
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,422
For instance,
you're the only New York guy, George.

567
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,823
Your blood just ain't quite as blue
as the rest of them, is it?

568
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,623
Explains why you ain't safely tucked away
in some ivory tower

569
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,860
with the rest of them bigwigs sucking on
cannoli and cocktail shrimp right now.

570
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,459
That's why you're the one
he left on the streets, George.

571
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,439
Like you know shit all of a sudden.

572
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,873
Somebody's got to run
our legitimate businesses.

573
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,777
-Somebody's got to be out there making...
-Someone's got to chum the waters.

574
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,218
Bullshit! And I ain't saying
another fucking word to you!

575
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,549
Good. You can just listen.

576
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,523
We know Concezio had that priest killed.

577
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,497
That's another thing you don't know,
l reckon.

578
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,394
But then why would he tell you
that, George?

579
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,230
You and your boys on the street,

580
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,997
y'all is bait.

581
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,737
Gorgeous George, huh?

582
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,733
Expendable George is more like it.

583
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:08,381
By the by, you've got a pretty nice ass
for a fat man.

584
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,084
A priest. Sick fuck, huh?

585
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,716
So, until the Saints get popped,
we're all lambs to the slaughter.

586
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,923
And he don't care how many of us
they wipe out in the meantime.

587
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,431
What do you need me to do, Skip?

588
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,034
-Down the <i>brugliones.</i>
-What, everyone?

589
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,163
North and South?
That could get a little dicey.

590
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,300
-Fuck their old grudges! They're all in this!
-Grudges have nothing to do with it.

591
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,707
-You know I don't take sides.
-L don't care, Jo Jo!

592
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:35,835
-You know I don't.
-You don't take sides?

593
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,038
-Never me! Never me!
-You don't take sides?

594
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,012
You're gonna take my fucking side
on this, Jo Jo!

595
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,913
-You talk to that mick Jimmy Green.
-Here we go again.

596
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,884
-Jimmy'll tell you that!
-Jimmy Green! Jimmy Green!

597
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:47,684
I don't care if Jimmy Green hollowed out
your sister like a Chippewa lndian!

598
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,258
You're gonna get in there, Jo Jo,

599
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,793
and you're gonna middle-of-the-road
this fucking thing for me,

600
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,863
and you're not gonna fuck it up!

601
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,558
You tell them everything that we discussed!

602
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,760
Even the panic room thing?

603
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,961
Sure.

604
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,937
Good. Because that's a nice icebreaker.
They'll like that.

605
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,541
You know,
l didn't even know those things were real.

606
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,076
I thought they made that up for that movie.

607
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,612
Remember the one
with the broad and the kid?

608
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,578
The guys in the house?

609
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,277
<i>Panic... Panic Room?</i>

610
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,047
-No, the other one.
-Stop fucking around!

611
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,784
This is serious shit here, Jo Jo!
You tell them we meet tomorrow night.

612
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,449
-All right.
-I'll call you with the fucking location.

613
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,084
-Okay.
-Fucking thing.

614
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,490
Come on, kid. It was a fucking...

615
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,459
It was a fucking accident.

616
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,825
We can work this out.

617
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,834
He ain't gonna do shit.

618
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,037
You're ltalian Kid.

619
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,997
Help us out here.

620
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,368
Think it over.

621
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,942
I am his friend.

622
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,379
Fuck him and fuck his friend.
Deal the cards! He ain't got the balls.

623
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,227
What did we do?

624
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,558
Connor.

625
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,043
God! No!

626
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,462
Why did they use his mug shot?

627
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,290
What? No.

628
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,102
Yeah, you remember
when he said he was all embarrassed

629
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,040
because that fellow had to hold up
all his long hair behind his head?

630
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,236
Aye.

631
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,646
That's an arm.

632
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,818
Hey, Rocco!

633
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,047
<i>L got the info you wanted,</i> mijo.

634
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,791
The place is called
Tando's Tanning Salon on Bunker Hill.

635
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,727
That's where the fucking <i>güero</i>
gets his fake bake at.

636
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:25,240
European cut. Far superior.

637
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,108
<i>Yeah! You've just been paid</i>
<i>So split now</i>

638
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:38,150
Lovely singing voice there, Georgie.
We'd like you to sing for us.

639
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,513
Can you do that for me?

640
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,023
Can you do that for me?

641
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,659
It's getting hard to be a gentleman
of fucking leisure around here!

642
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,806
I want the name of the shooter
you motherfuckers used on that priest!

643
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,431
What priest?

644
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,702
His fucking name!

645
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,277
-l don't know who it is!
-That's fucking bullshit!

646
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,847
It's the truth! Concezio didn't tell nobody
what he was doing

647
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,448
'cause he knew
nobody would have okayed it!

648
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:10,816
The shooter's an independent contractor!
That's all I fucking know!

649
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,651
Where the fuck is Yakavetta hiding?

650
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:17,158
Prudential Building, 40th floor.

651
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,118
Jesus Christ!

652
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,464
You meeting someone tonight?

653
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,564
Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street guys.

654
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:34,509
Your kind of guys.
You could take a real bite out of crime here.

655
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,875
-And I can help you.
-What the fuck is that?

656
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,880
Nobody forgot
what you guys did to us last time.

657
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,315
Everybody's hiding indoors.
They give out the location an hour before.

658
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,548
My uncle's place is closed tonight.
L got the key.

659
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,058
How does Mexican work for you, George?
Do you like that?

660
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:55,187
Doesn't matter to me.
L think I just shit my European-cut Speedos.

661
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,500
-What's this?
-Rosary bead.

662
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,696
Found it pushed under the carpet
near the victim.

663
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:06,572
Father McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary,
so it's probably been there a while.

664
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,842
The results on all 864 prints
found at the scene.

665
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,181
All matched churchgoers and clergy but one.

666
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,354
Partial on the priest's watch
is still unidentified.

667
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:27,089
No. No, that's horseshit.
Everybody gets printed nowadays.

668
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,291
They even are inking up these snot gobblers
in kindergarten now.

669
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,800
It's a brick wall anyway.

670
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,465
We know Napoleon was wearing gloves.
The lab got zilch on the lock and chain.

671
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,076
Even the pennies came up clean.

672
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,407
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

673
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:49,785
Man. Daddy would knock that out
like Mike fucking Tyson.

674
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,589
-Hey!
-What? I didn't say nothing.

675
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,392
McKinney wore his watch on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?

676
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,963
Right here, off his left elbow.

677
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,657
Just occurred to me that priests
wear the rosary while taking confession.

678
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,290
-She's right.
-Dolly, get on the phone

679
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,300
and find out which wrist
he wore his rosary on.

680
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,496
Duffy, push that partial through the DMV.

681
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,766
David, you put it through Interpol
just to get an ID now.

682
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,775
Come on, vamoose!

683
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,148
You took your gloves off,
didn't you, cowboy?

684
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,818
Now why would you go
and do a damn fool thing like that?

685
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,032
Just two more to go.

686
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,338
You guys are gonna let me go, right?

687
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,841
I guess we'll just have to wait and see,
won't we?

688
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,539
Jesus Christ, this is some embarrassing shit.

689
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:29,217
Don't worry. We worked on a sheep farm.
Smelled way worse.

690
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,478
Although that is right up there.

691
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:40,392
Yo, spicaroo.
More nachos and <i>más salsa, capisci?</i>

692
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,389
Hey, and I need a refill here, pepe.

693
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,065
Easy! Jesus!

694
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,700
-How do, David?
-Hey!

695
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,843
<i>We just dumped a text message</i>
<i>from George's cell. Just two words.</i>

696
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:04,551
"Silver Peso.' '
it's a Mexican joint down by the docks."

697
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,016
Sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama.

698
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,786
Guess gangsters got to eat, too, huh?

699
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:15,453
I think I'll drop in on their little supper,
see if I can shake things up a bit.

700
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,195
Need a bodyguard?

701
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,559
No, thank you, Mike Tyson. Bye, now.

702
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,432
Bye.

703
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:36,108
These dagos are getting antsy, man.
I'm getting spicarooed and pepe'd.

704
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,777
All right, calm the fuck down.

705
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,984
You got to stick it out.
Just wait on one more.

706
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,227
He is not with them.

707
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,630
It is only the sons.

708
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,765
They have a Spaniard with them.

709
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,836
They will slaughter everyone.

710
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,608
Let them.

711
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,937
If you kill the sons...

712
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,939
...the father will come.

713
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,451
Gentlemen.

714
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,619
All right. The gang's all here.

715
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,419
Give me my fucking BB gun.

716
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,858
No, Rome. You've earned your stripes.

717
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,363
Hey, tighten it up.

718
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,202
So?

719
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,878
Where's Gorgeous?

720
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,816
Ls that George?

721
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,299
What the fuck is that?

722
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,027
It's lrish for, "You're fucked.' '

723
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,967
<i>Que viva México,</i> bitches!

724
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,369
I've seen the light!

725
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:45,504
You guys have really turned me around
on this. I'm, like, born again and shit!

726
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,446
Should we let him go?

727
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,382
You know what I think we should do?

728
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,788
I think we should let God decide
if he gets a second chance.

729
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,757
What the fuck you doing?

730
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,295
What the.. . No, man, come on.

731
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,399
Hey, what the fuck you gonna do?

732
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:11,038
You had best be right with your Jesus, boy.

733
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:25,215
Well! Praise be to Jesus!

734
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,792
-Georgie.
-Yeah?

735
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,489
You know all good boys go to heaven.

736
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,932
You know, that was perhaps one of
the finest examples of spiritual guidance

737
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,303
-I've ever had the good fortune to witness.
-Lt was wonderful, wasn't it?

738
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,807
Mysterious ways, I tell you, mysterious ways.

739
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,935
You know, it's about time
one of your fucking plans...

740
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:02,850
-Put it down!
-Drop the gun!

741
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,619
Put the goddamn gun down
right fucking now!

742
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,957
Easy, fellas. And I'm alone.

743
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,662
-He's gone.
-Who the fuck are you?

744
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:17,933
My name is Eunice Bloom.
And I'm your new guardian angel.

745
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,703
The torch was passed to me
by a mutual friend.

746
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,812
A mutual friend?
By the name of fucking who?

747
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,515
<i>Paul Maximillian fucking Smecker.</i>

748
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,358
We heard. He was a good man.

749
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,826
-Aye. You have our condolences.
-And you mine.

750
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,728
Well, I'm glad everybody...
Who the fuck was that guy?

751
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,324
That, I suspect, was the shooter
you boys have been looking for.

752
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:51,897
Who the fuck is this broad?
What the fuck is going on here?

753
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,737
Let's speed this up before your new
sidekick's gotta dig any deeper

754
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,504
into his impressive vocabulary.

755
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:59,240
-Oh, no, you didn't!
-Oh, yes I did.

756
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,318
I am an FBl agent
controlling this investigation from within

757
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:08,584
in order to ensure that you gentlemen
never see the inside of a prison cell.

758
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,523
Now, I am conspiring to do this
with three like-minded individuals

759
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,390
who have aided you in the past.

760
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:17,590
Though I have yet to inform them
of my agenda because,

761
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,703
well, a girl's gotta have her fun.

762
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,738
-Dolly, Duffy and Greenly?
-The very same.

763
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,397
How are the lads doing?

764
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,375
Two of them are scared. One's just horny.

765
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:33,279
-Bet you I can tell you which one.
-Bet you can't. Let's save it for group.

766
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,408
-Right now we've got a big problem.
-What's that, then?

767
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,383
This simply won't do.

768
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,879
Here's how it all went down.

769
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,987
A secret gathering of the <i>brugliones.</i>
Topic of discussion...

770
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:52,525
Yakavetta's lost control of the streets.
They're fighting over his throne.

771
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,187
This was not the work of the Saints.

772
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,164
Interpol came through.

773
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,135
You were right. 5'5". Gotta be the shooter.

774
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:08,336
That ain't all. Short stuff's work visa
was signed by a sponsor that doesn't exist.

775
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:11,878
Look at the date. Two months after 9<i>l</i>11.

776
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,480
What? I don't get it.

777
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:24,324
Someone maneuvered it through the system
using false information

778
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,691
during the highest alert in US history.

779
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:30,856
Yakavetta's just a gangster.
He ain't got the juice to do that.

780
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,331
You're darn tooting, he don't.

781
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:38,237
Irregardless, INS red-flagged it
like a motherfucker. It's a shit storm.

782
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:42,135
Something stinks
like a pig's ass in summertime.

783
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,076
Come on. We've got someplace to be.

784
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,182
It’s, like, 2:00 am. There's nothing open now.

785
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,744
It's after hours. I mean, if you want a drink...

786
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,584
Thirty-seven bodies later,
and we're finally back where it all began.

787
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,351
You boys ever heard
of the Southern expression,

788
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:01,487
"We have an elephant in the living room?"
Hope you fellows brought some peanuts.

789
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,733
What is this? What is this?

790
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,031
Who the fuck are you? You're either vice
or IAD. You're IAD, aren't you?

791
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:13,268
Okay, come on, fucking arrest us! Arrest us!
I'm ready! Come on out!

792
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,276
Hands above your head!

793
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,008
Stop it! God damn it!

794
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,876
You don't write! You don't fucking call!

795
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:28,923
-You should be ashamed of yourselves!
-Get the fuck out of here!

796
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:32,027
You knew all along?

797
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,255
-Not keeping in touch with your old friends!
-Fucking bitch!

798
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,865
-Shame on you!
-You're beautiful, babe!

799
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,434
Thank you! Thank you!

800
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,136
-This is the fellow?
-That's the fellow.

801
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,536
He's a Sicilian immigrant,
name of Ottilio Panza.

802
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,806
He'll be front-page news in the morning,

803
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,243
but we have to assume that Yakavetta
already knows we've ID'd his guy.

804
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,781
Can't give him time to plan-B us.

805
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,283
We're hitting him in 48 hours.
That fast enough for you?

806
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:01,117
-Should be. Where is it gonna happen?
-The Pr...

807
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,452
The Prudential? What are you, cracked?

808
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,254
Why don't you just do it on center ice
at a fucking Bruins game?

809
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,388
That's where the man is,
so that's where we're going.

810
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:13,832
-No guts, no glory, green beans.
-Ln fact, we could use a few extra hands.

811
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,097
That is, if you boys
can still get your lrish on.

812
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:21,768
Hey, I got balls for days, pally.
I'm a fucking sack-o-matic.

813
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:24,573
Yeah. He's a sack-o-matic.

814
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,977
-We're in.
-We're in.

815
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,950
All right, you boys have fun.
Connor, Murphy, escort a lady to the door.

816
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:38,154
You sure you don't want to hear the plan?
I'm not one to sit here and brag, but...

817
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,854
-Jesus.
-.. .This one's really Picasso. Shut your hole.

818
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,292
No, I want to critique your masterpiece
with fresh eyes.

819
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,992
Besides, school night.

820
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,262
-Got some homework to do.
-What's the matter?

821
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,205
Panza knew you guys were in there tonight
and he just let it happen.

822
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,775
I mean, if he's working for Yakavetta,

823
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:58,140
why would he just stand by
and watch all his men get taken out?

824
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:01,375
What, you think maybe we've got
another fox in the henhouse, then?

825
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,317
It's starting to look that way.
Somebody pushed that visa through.

826
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:09,380
We could have ourselves a genuine
<i>Ghost and the Darkness</i> here.

827
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,694
They still live.

828
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,367
What if he does not come? What if...

829
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,401
He will come.

830
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:41,651
Either that wily old man
is not as clever as we thought

831
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,159
or he played me from the git.

832
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,301
You think he played me?

833
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,774
We got a mutiny on our hands.

834
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:06,780
Every 10-cent wannabe with a gun
is moving on us all over town!

835
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:11,148
And our fearless leader
hasn't even come out of his pussy room yet!

836
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,249
<i>Capo</i> fucking <i>regime!</i>

837
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:21,428
I want each one of you
to call your top button man,

838
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,498
the best that you have.

839
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:29,596
'Cause we are going to rip this city
a new asshole.

840
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,772
Starting tonight,

841
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,840
we reconnoiter our strength on the streets.

842
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,614
Starting now,

843
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,350
we seize the day.

844
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,512
<i>Law enforcement has classified</i>
<i>the ltalian immigrant Ottilio Panza</i>

845
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:52,320
<i>as its prime suspect</i>
<i>in the murder of the beloved local cleric.</i>

846
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:56,261
<i>An all-points bulletin has been issued,</i>
<i>and it appears, at least for the time being,</i>

847
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,766
<i>the Saints have been cleared</i>
<i>as suspects in the priest's killing.</i>

848
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:25,018
Foolish, arrogant boy!

849
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,699
Expanded my operations
since I saw you last.

850
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,671
Word got out who may or may not
have outfitted you.

851
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:42,175
Turns out
you got quite the underground following.

852
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:49,249
Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers
select from my private reserve.

853
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,512
If I may make a suggestion.

854
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,679
I feel like that kid who found
the golden ticket in that candy bar

855
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,215
in <i>Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.</i>

856
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,675
-Charlie.
-Yeah, Charlie.

857
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:28,220
And I want an Oompa Loompa now,
Daddy, now.

858
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,425
I'll take these.

859
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:43,895
-Have you been crying again?
-Yeah! Tears of joy.

860
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,738
Those are queer. How much?

861
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,743
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You boys are on the house.

862
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,871
-Obliged.
-Well, let's see.

863
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:01,956
-What?
-Nothing.

864
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,822
-What, are you saying I look gay?
-No, you just hail from a colorful...

865
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:09,260
Hey, you don't know me.
Do these make me look gay?

866
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,068
You look like you might have seen one
up close.

867
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:31,675
On a sultry Saturday in September,
the Saints saved 1 7 souls.

868
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,791
Try saying that five times fast.

869
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:43,828
Nothing to be afraid of. It's all over.

870
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,760
Fucking pussy. He won't come out.

871
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,605
Special Agent Bloom!

872
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,666
You are hereby relieved of all obligation
to this investigation.

873
01:11:55,811 --> 01:12:02,546
And as of now, you will all report to me.
Special Agent John Kuntsler.

874
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,951
So, how you doing, Bloomy?

875
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,385
Just fine, Kunty.

876
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:18,525
-You are suspended.
-Fine. But I'm gonna take a crack at it first.

877
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:34,375
<i>They gained access somehow</i>
<i>through one of the service entrances.</i>

878
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,885
-What?
-Nothing.

879
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,287
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing!

880
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:20,623
This is just some heavy shit, that's all.
I'm just...

881
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,063
I'm just having a period of adjustment.

882
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,134
You're about to have a period
of getting your ass beat!

883
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,294
This is you. Fucking be on time.

884
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,581
You ready for this shit, my dear brother?

885
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,546
Let's do some gratuitous violence.

886
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,954
Meet! Front and center!

887
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,729
Make way.

888
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,596
Each one of you

889
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:09,972
is to stick to the guy who called you
like stink on quim.

890
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,843
Pick your own crews.

891
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,115
You arm yourself to the teeth.

892
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:22,249
And when these Bible-banging psychos
make their attempt,

893
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:27,317
it is your job to blow their soulless hearts
right out of their bodies.

894
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,831
Okay, here's the situation, Lloyd.

895
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:44,002
Me and a couple of friends of mine
are fitting to do some killing here tonight.

896
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,808
I'm talking bullets, blood,
custom wholesale slaughter.

897
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,179
You follow me, Lloyd-o?

898
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:56,190
Good. Now, I've run into a little snag.
You see, I'm trying to figure out a tag line.

899
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,849
You know, something cool to say
when it's all over,

900
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,394
like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat.' '

901
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:05,125
Or, "I'll be back.' ' But mine, you know?
I've gotta own this thing.

902
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,962
It's creative!
Lt happened to be a creative plan!

903
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,700
Fucking ridiculous! Probably based
on some stupid shit you saw in a movie!

904
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:16,333
And here I am again,
all tying myself up with fucking rope!

905
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,174
What's the deal with you
and the fucking rope? Honestly!

906
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,181
It happened to be a very useful thing,
so shut it!

907
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,218
You didn't get this from a movie, did you?

908
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,050
<i>-The Eiger Sanction</i> with Clint Eastwood.
-Fuck!

909
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,887
-And it worked like a charm for him!
-L fucking knew!

910
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:36,390
Now I'm gonna take the gag off,
nice and slow so it doesn't hurt.

911
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,427
I know, I know. I know, I know.

912
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,868
This fucking hurts this way.

913
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,371
Fuck! Fuck...

914
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,237
Fuck!

915
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,677
-l know, I know, I know!
-L can't believe you, man! I'm a janitor.

916
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,612
What do I know about guns and bullets
and shit, man?

917
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,775
-Well, then, just...
-No! I don't care what you're doing here

918
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,682
with your fucking friends.
It’s none of my business.

919
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,415
-I'm just...
-L have a wife and a family and kids.

920
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,924
Actually, they're not even my kids, right?
I'm taking care of some other asshole's kids

921
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,858
-on a fucking janitor's salary!
-I'm not riffing, Lloyd!

922
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:11,126
Now, I need an <i>hasta la vista</i> line,
<i>toute</i> fucking <i>suite</i>

923
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:12,893
and you're gonna help me think of one.

924
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,297
-What the fuck did you do?
-L don't know, it just stopped.

925
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:22,433
-Well, fucking get it going again!
-Lt won't turn back on! It just died!

926
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,206
-Shit!
-Fucking thing! Come on!

927
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,305
Come on! Come on, you piece of shit!

928
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:33,820
Starting tonight, each one of you limp-dick
fucking slobs is back out on the street

929
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,423
earning your daily bread.

930
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,391
-Come on, come on! No!
-Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

931
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:44,297
-Okay, what about, "Take that, you suckers"?
-No, that's not cool enough, man.

932
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,459
-How much time? How much fucking time?
-Sixty seconds!

933
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,332
-No, we gotta go right now! Right now!
-No fucking way!

934
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,460
What are you talking about?

935
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,335
If we're even a few seconds late,
Romeo's dead.

936
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:57,502
You'd better all dust off your ball bats!
You'd better find your inner gangster!

937
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:02,079
-"Merry Christmas, motherfuckers!"
-That's too sacrilegious.

938
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:05,976
-All right, we've got about 13 floors.
-Eleven more, ball park it!

939
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,783
It's about 15 per floor, we need.. . 165!

940
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,323
-Dude, wait!
-Count it up in fives!

941
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,622
-Five, 10, 15, 20...
-This is retarded!

942
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,493
-Fucking <i>Eiger Sanction!</i>
-Shut it and concentrate! 25...

943
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:20,033
'Cause you got to break bones!
You've got to crush skulls!

944
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,500
You gotta do what you gotta do!

945
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,339
You're gonna need those.

946
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,945
You shoot everybody in there,

947
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:36,484
and then you're like, "Yo, eat it! Eat it!"

948
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:40,351
-What, are we at a fucking buffet now?
-Fuck.

949
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:43,217
You guys can't do this!
Are you fucking crazy?

950
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,452
-Time!
-Jesus Christ. Seven seconds!

951
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:47,994
-Holy shit!
-Six,

952
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,030
<i>-five, four...</i>
-It’s time.

953
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,655
<i>...three, two...</i>

954
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:57,470
One thing has always amazed me.
How quiet it gets. You ever noticed that?

955
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,242
<i>It’s hard to imagine</i>
<i>that just a few hours ago</i>

956
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,513
<i>it was the goddamn O.K . Corral in here.</i>

957
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:35,703
We're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned shoot-'em-up!

958
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,862
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

959
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,801
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,

960
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,101
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

961
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:17,338
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

962
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,988
Who ordered the whup-ass fajitas?

963
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,457
-That's fucking stupid!
-It’s completely retarded!

964
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,893
Was that the best you could do?

965
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,563
I just...

966
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,735
I couldn't...

967
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,537
Broke down the door, didn't you?

968
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:59,411
Ding-dong, motherfucker, ding-dong!

969
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,254
-Fucking A.
-You said it.

970
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:11,430
And that, gentlemen,
is the sound of the fat lady singing.

971
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,569
-Should we clap or something?
-Shut up.

972
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,696
-Hey, hey!
-Hey!

973
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:21,933
You hurt her, you piece of shit, I'll kill you!

974
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,238
She's not on there! There's nothing on there!

975
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:27,212
Get a hostage negotiator down here,
you fucking wad!

976
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:29,783
Get off me! What is your fucking problem?

977
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:33,285
He could be in there
all touching her and shit.

978
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,787
Fuck! Come on!

979
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:41,755
Look, I was listening to you out there.
And that's, like, exactly what happened.

980
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:45,799
And that's what made me think
you were the person to talk to.

981
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,567
So, Yakavetta had a partner?

982
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:59,645
Everybody gave Concezio props
for building the family back up.

983
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:04,445
"He's such a genius.' '
What bullshit. It was the Old Man all along."

984
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,578
-Old Man?
-Yeah, that's what he called him.

985
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:12,820
<i>For the last three years,</i>
<i>every play we made came straight from him.</i>

986
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,895
<i>Teaming up with the Chinese,</i>

987
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:18,090
<i>keeping the feud going between</i>
<i>Southie and the North End, everything.</i>

988
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:23,159
<i>Concezio worshipped the Old Man</i>
<i>like some kind of fucking Mafia oracle.</i>

989
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,934
I have no idea what his real name is, though.
Concezio always called him the Old Man.

990
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:32,776
Think. I mean, did he ever use a surname
or a nickname or something?

991
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,475
-One time.
-Well, what was it?

992
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:40,980
He called him the Roman.

993
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,155
That's just weird. The Roman?

994
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,189
What do you think it means?

995
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:54,028
-Feels like our ghost to me.
-Well, what's the plan?

996
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:58,265
'Cause the brothers ain't going nowhere
until we get Panza or they do.

997
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,786
Sack-o-matic, I said!

998
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,057
-I've got nothing.
-One in the hole.

999
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,467
Fuck you! One, two, three!

1000
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:35,532
-Boys! Boys!
-Put them down! Throw them over.

1001
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,711
I'll kill the old man! Throw them over!

1002
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:48,419
Brothers, huh?
We gonna have us some fun.

1003
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:53,391
So, which one first?
Which one do you love more?

1004
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,052
This one?

1005
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:11,879
Doc! Call a fucking ambulance right now!

1006
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:16,441
You.

1007
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,851
Where's the Old Man?

1008
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,950
Never.

1009
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:41,097
-Just hold on, man.
-Help's on the way, hang in there!

1010
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,077
Boys, it's over.

1011
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:52,142
It's okay. Proudest day of my life.

1012
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,404
-Da!
-Easy, boys.

1013
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:25,079
Jesus fucking Christ!

1014
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,950
I'm gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out right now!

1015
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,751
Connor!

1016
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:33,794
Son, Daddy's working.

1017
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:36,295
What the fuck you talking about?

1018
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,427
Where is he?

1019
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:47,531
No matter how this turns out,
you fucking die today!

1020
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,700
Believe it, motherfucker.

1021
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,611
Where is the Old Man?

1022
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,211
No!

1023
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,289
Make me famous.

1024
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,568
Where?

1025
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,849
Where is he?

1026
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:13,556
-You look good, Roc.
-You two don't.

1027
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:18,263
-Yeah, we had a friend...
-L know.

1028
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:21,564
He was a big boy.

1029
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,398
If it weren't for us,
maybe the two of you would...

1030
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,473
Would what?
Would never have stood for anything?

1031
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:27,973
What are you talking about, Roc?

1032
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:32,068
I made my decision and stood next to you.
And it was an honor.

1033
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:37,441
And I wouldn't change that
for the whole world. Not one minute of it.

1034
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,280
Now, <i>sláinte.</i>

1035
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:53,255
You know, he was sort of a bad-ass, though,
wasn't he?

1036
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,300
Shades of Eastwood.

1037
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,936
Charlie Bronson.

1038
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,133
Duke fucking Wayne!

1039
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,574
-Duke fucking Wayne!
-Duke fucking Wayne!

1040
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:06,909
Men build things. Then we die.

1041
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:12,578
It's in our fucking DNA! That's what we do!

1042
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:16,919
-And when it all falls down...
-We build it right back up again.

1043
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:21,325
-But this time bigger. Better!
-Look! Look what we can do.

1044
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,158
Look how fucking beautiful we are.

1045
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,767
You think the men that built all this
had it easy?

1046
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,961
-Hard men!
-Doing hard shit!

1047
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,630
And that gives me a hard-on!

1048
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,264
-But not in a gay way or anything.
-No, no, course not.

1049
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,036
Yeah, goes without saying.

1050
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:41,046
I am so sick of this self-help, 1 2-step,

1051
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:44,481
leftover hippie generation bullshit!

1052
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,782
Now they don't want you to do anything,
right? Just sit there! Don't drink...

1053
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,221
Don't smoke! Don't drive fast!

1054
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,189
Kiss my ass!

1055
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,818
Fuck it, do it all, I say!

1056
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,658
You think Duke Wayne spent all his time

1057
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:59,665
talking about his feelings
with a fucking therapist?

1058
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,894
There's no fucking way he did!

1059
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:07,338
John Wayne died with five pounds
of undigested red meat in his ass!

1060
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:11,674
Now that's a man!
Real men hide their feelings. Why?

1061
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,044
Because it's none of your fucking business!

1062
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:22,146
Men do not cry, men do not pout,
men jack you in the fucking jaw and say...

1063
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:26,860
Thanks for coming out.

1064
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:43,673
I am so sorry, boys. This was all my fault.

1065
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:48,775
There's a few things
your dad needs to tell youse.

1066
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:53,178
Come on, kid, it's good for you,
it's good for us.

1067
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:55,619
We'll take you right out the back
of this place.

1068
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:58,419
-Easy, Noah.
-They'll never touch you.

1069
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,068
What, are you stupid or something?

1070
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:35,591
Noah, <i>mio amico.</i> No more of this!

1071
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:45,005
I can't stop.

1072
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:53,980
Okay, we think of something, eh?

1073
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:55,975
We think of something.

1074
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,476
Noah, look.

1075
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,316
We got something for you.

1076
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:08,120
My friend...

1077
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:39,158
Bonnavese is always with two men.
Both of them, <i>La Cosa Nostra,</i> many years.

1078
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,563
<i>That's how it went for years.</i>

1079
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:29,874
Louie would do all the planning
and I would do the other.

1080
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:31,703
Jesus.

1081
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,143
How'd you end up inside, Da?

1082
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:38,418
Back in '75 I did a piece of work.

1083
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:42,980
I come out
and the police was waiting for me.

1084
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:48,284
He set me up. Twenty-five to life.

1085
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:54,065
-Why did he set you up?
-L can't wait to ask him.

1086
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:57,569
Why didn't you flip on him, Da?
The guy fucked you.

1087
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,670
<i>He had learned of the birth of my sons.</i>

1088
01:33:22,196 --> 01:33:24,426
Hello, my old friend.

1089
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:27,262
Many years.

1090
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,695
Are you in need?

1091
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:34,601
I am making marinara and alas...

1092
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:37,209
...I have run out of tomatoes.

1093
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,607
To help an old friend...

1094
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:42,472
...how many can you spare?

1095
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:45,447
Don't worry.

1096
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:49,187
You are in luck.

1097
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:53,385
I am in good supply of tomatoes.

1098
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,802
Agent Kuntsler, you gotta see this.
We just found...

1099
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:07,205
It's Bloom. She just back-doored this info
from Fed archives.

1100
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:11,471
Jesus Christ, she's gone rogue!

1101
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:12,637
-Get an APB on her!
-John!

1102
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:15,648
-l want that crazy bitch grabbed up now!
-John, think about this!

1103
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,047
Jimmy!

1104
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:19,319
What the fuck are you doing?

1105
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:22,821
Who the fuck is this?

1106
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:31,263
He's in York, Maine. About an hour
from here. But he's off the grid.

1107
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:34,590
<i>Logged on to an FBl database</i>
<i>to get the info.</i>

1108
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:37,704
<i>Only a matter of time before they flag it.</i>

1109
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:41,099
Better get a move on
or they'll get there before you do.

1110
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:43,233
Will they know it's you?

1111
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:45,945
Yeah.

1112
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,110
Will you be all right, dear?

1113
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:54,948
I hear Costa Rica's nice.

1114
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:07,428
I never thought I'd ask this of another
human being, but please, kill this man.

1115
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:10,929
<i>Kill this man.</i>

1116
01:37:40,588 --> 01:37:42,055
Hello, Louie.

1117
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,550
Noah.

1118
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:47,357
We haven't much time.

1119
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:54,928
My garden is...

1120
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:59,101
She's beautiful, no?

1121
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:05,611
But I forget, your eyes are blind to beauty.

1122
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:08,910
You are...

1123
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:12,783
You are a destroyer, Noah.

1124
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:16,986
You know my reasons.

1125
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:20,227
But do you?

1126
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:24,627
You think it's...
You think it's for your father.

1127
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:31,632
No. You were born a killer.

1128
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:37,266
Death, <i>la morte,</i> it is in the blood.

1129
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:41,907
-No.
-No.

1130
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:49,247
This is bullshit. We should go now.

1131
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:52,450
It's only one fucking guy.

1132
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:58,020
Explain these.

1133
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:13,034
You were not there to raise them.

1134
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:16,706
Not one single day.

1135
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:22,678
But how closely
they followed their father's footsteps.

1136
01:39:23,657 --> 01:39:28,788
They got your blood, Noah, <i>tua rabbia.</i>

1137
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:30,890
Your anger.

1138
01:39:59,626 --> 01:40:02,891
And you? What are you?

1139
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:07,364
I am a creator.

1140
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:10,033
You see,

1141
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,668
we were opposed.

1142
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:20,710
As old as <i>la storia di</i> frog and...

1143
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:25,715
Scorpion.

1144
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:29,416
Scorpion.

1145
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:35,060
Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man.

1146
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:39,628
Copy that. Waiting for the signal.

1147
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,896
What the fuck is this place?
Lt gives me the creeps.

1148
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:47,471
Why did you sell me out, Louie?

1149
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:50,568
You can never understand.

1150
01:40:53,514 --> 01:40:56,142
Twenty-five years.

1151
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:02,644
-Try me.
-They were building something.

1152
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:08,618
-They?
-They were creating something. An empire.

1153
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:11,788
-They?
-L was helping them!

1154
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,761
I used you, Noah,

1155
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:20,902
<i>to destroy their competition,</i>
<i>to cut out their cancers.</i>

1156
01:41:23,877 --> 01:41:26,505
I earned my place among them.

1157
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:35,088
Ls this your place amongst them?
Because all I see

1158
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:39,187
is an old man in a broke-down palace,

1159
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,322
sitting in a garden.

1160
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:48,797
The scorpion and the frog

1161
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:52,263
both lose everything.

1162
01:41:53,173 --> 01:42:00,045
See, without you,
l was no longer useful to them.

1163
01:42:02,883 --> 01:42:04,646
They cast me out!

1164
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:10,948
My old man used to tell me
about a place like this.

1165
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,219
Back in the woods,
he said that there's this guy...

1166
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:16,362
Why the priest, Louie?

1167
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:20,797
Why all this? Why now?

1168
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:26,471
Because I knew it would bring you
and your sons.

1169
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:32,475
You will destroy the Yakavettas for me.
Clear my way.

1170
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:39,648
And this time, I will take what is mine. Just...

1171
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:44,682
Just a little <i>piccolo pezzo.</i>

1172
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,558
For my old age.

1173
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:56,830
After all, I have never been a greedy man.

1174
01:45:23,283 --> 01:45:26,810
Beyond the River, <i>done by</i>
<i>Anthony and Harrison, Edison Records.</i>

1175
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,319
Connor!

1176
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:32,585
Murph!

1177
01:45:35,729 --> 01:45:38,493
Take me to him! Take me to him now!

1178
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:58,445
I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

1179
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:12,426
No, Da! No, please!

1180
01:46:13,567 --> 01:46:14,795
God, no!

1181
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:18,902
Look! Look, boys.

1182
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:26,807
It's so beautiful.

1183
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:31,580
-It's a beautiful day.
-No.

1184
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:38,285
It is, Da. It is.

1185
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:47,927
It is beautiful, Da.

1186
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:54,266
Aye, it is, Da.

1187
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:53,032
<i>And they that holdest my name</i>

1188
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:59,069
<i>shall come with the shaking of the earth</i>

1189
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,805
<i>and the roiling of the oceans.</i>

1190
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,694
It's a non-extradition country.
Passport under your name.

1191
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:32,238
Money, contacts
and a map to your final destination.

1192
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:35,203
-Which is?
-The monastery at Saint Escazú.

1193
01:48:35,308 --> 01:48:37,003
A monastery?

1194
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:39,340
Monasteries enjoy the protection
of the Holy See.

1195
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:43,883
They're not even subject to local laws,
searches, et cetera.

1196
01:48:43,984 --> 01:48:46,282
A sanctuary within a sanctuary.

1197
01:48:46,419 --> 01:48:49,388
He's going to take you by boat
to a private airstrip down the shore,

1198
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:53,858
where we have arranged for your travel.
Off the books, of course.

1199
01:48:54,594 --> 01:48:56,721
Father, I ain't one to look a gift horse,

1200
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:59,628
but you still haven't told me
how you're involved in all this.

1201
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:01,028
And second, I need to disappear,

1202
01:49:01,134 --> 01:49:04,570
you show up with plans and paperwork
in hand.

1203
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:07,071
It's like you knew before I did.

1204
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:11,404
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
my dear.

1205
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:15,210
We wanted you to know
that you're not alone.

1206
01:49:15,315 --> 01:49:20,753
-We have many resources.
-You keep saying "we.' ' Now, who's "we"?

1207
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:23,317
You ready to go?

1208
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,431
I hear they party pretty hard
at that monastery.

1209
01:49:57,691 --> 01:50:01,991
I'm not sure I'm in love
with that new look there, Betty Boop.

1210
01:50:03,697 --> 01:50:09,533
-l attended your funeral, you son of a bitch!
-L know. Loved your shoes.

1211
01:50:10,403 --> 01:50:13,702
The skirt was a little risqué for a funeral,
but, hey,

1212
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:19,839
who am I to begrudge someone
their sense of individuality?

1213
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:22,175
-What is this?
-Keep it down.

1214
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:26,309
You don't wanna scare away
my little fishies.

1215
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:32,317
Fuck your fish!
What the hell is going on here?

1216
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:34,723
You are exposed, young lady!

1217
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:40,625
You're a very clever little girl, Eunice.
That's why I chose you.

1218
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:46,463
Now it's time for you
to put your thinking cap on.

1219
01:50:49,376 --> 01:50:51,742
We got all the financial backing
and protection

1220
01:50:51,878 --> 01:50:54,346
of the biggest corporation in the world.

1221
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:58,406
And two CEOs worthy of the public trust.

1222
01:51:00,387 --> 01:51:03,823
Now, what do you think is going on here?

1223
01:51:06,192 --> 01:51:07,989
You wanna get them out.

1224
01:51:08,094 --> 01:51:09,891
I want to get them out,
get them back to work,

1225
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:12,760
take this thing to a whole new level.

1226
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:14,196
Where're they being held?

1227
01:51:18,538 --> 01:51:23,669
Set them free! Set them free!
Set them free! Set them free!

1228
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:38,618
Set them free! Set them free! Set them free!

1229
01:51:45,598 --> 01:51:48,123
The Hoag ain't just any prison.

1230
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:52,102
Wrong. That's exactly what it is,
just a prison.

1231
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:57,107
Run by men.
Men, as we both know, are fallible.

1232
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:06,141
<i>Well, whatever we do, we gotta do it quick.</i>
<i>Those boys aren't safe in there.</i>

1233
01:52:07,087 --> 01:52:08,577
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

1234
01:52:08,688 --> 01:52:13,921
<i>A little birdie tells me</i>
<i>they're gonna be just fine.</i>
