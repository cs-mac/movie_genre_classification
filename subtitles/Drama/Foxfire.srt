1
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,543
<i>By senior year, I had it covered,</i>
<i>or so I thought.</i>

2
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:48,344
<i>I had a great guy,</i>
<i>sights on college, art school...</i>

3
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,509
<i>and a dream of life beyond.</i>

4
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,484
- Good morning, Arthur.
- It's a decoy, Arthur.

5
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,682
The AK-47's in her backpack.

6
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:58,692
Yeah, right.

7
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:08,899
<i>You tell yourself to count the days</i>
<i>and put up with the shit.</i>

8
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,997
<i>You tell yourself these people</i>
<i>are illusions, passing scenery.</i>

9
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,906
Hey, snap these, babe!

10
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:29,116
<i>They were nothing to me.</i>
<i>I just use them for my art.</i>

11
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,456
No blading in the hall.
I don't want to have to tell you again!

12
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:38,561
- Okay,jockstrap sniffers, say cheese.
- Action.

13
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,117
Look out! Coming through!

14
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:22,101
<i>Most of all, I avoided the snares,</i>
<i>skating past the obstacles...</i>

15
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:25,145
<i>the way everybody</i>
<i>who can manage it does.</i>

16
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:30,781
<i>Guh-ding went</i>
<i>the little green frog</i>

17
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:36,256
<i>Guh-ding went the little</i>
<i>green frog one day</i>

18
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:40,021
<i>And his eyes</i>
<i>went aggh-aggh-gung</i>

19
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:45,561
Okay, hold these suckers
down on their backs.

20
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,658
Ready for surgery.

21
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:50,135
Nail 'em good.

22
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:53,264
Last year we had one
of these ribbits jump off...

23
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:56,208
during the incision
of a pulmonary vein.

24
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,211
It weren't pretty.

25
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:03,416
- What is it, Rita?
- I can't do it.

26
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,452
- Flake.
- Get off her shit already.

27
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,716
Hello, Rita.

28
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,681
Take the scalpel.

29
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,784
Earth to Rita.

30
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,955
It's so defenseless.

31
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:13,143
Frogs, they don't have feelings
like we do, Rita.

32
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:16,588
But their cardiovascular system
is an excellent model for ours.

33
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:20,650
In other words, their little hearts
work a lot like ours do.

34
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,490
Young man. Young man,
stop when I'm talking to you!

35
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:34,505
What class should you be in?

36
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:39,042
<i>But then something happened,</i>
<i>unexpected.</i>

37
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:43,075
<i>I felt it before I knew it.</i>

38
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,522
Excuse me.

39
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,427
If you're new,
please take a seat.

40
00:05:57,498 --> 00:06:00,331
I'll get the paperwork later.

41
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,030
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have ordered you a frog.

42
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,002
Where were we?

43
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,674
Class, let's concentrate on the frogs.

44
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,242
On the frogs.

45
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:18,444
Let's start slicing,
and this ain't pizza. Watch it.

46
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,287
Let's all show Rita
we can do this.

47
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:26,656
Okay?
Rita, are you with us?

48
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:36,897
Take the scalpel now. We've been
working on this for three weeks.

49
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:41,305
We're holding things up.
Let's not waste any more time.

50
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,311
I'm gonna count to three and
you'll take the scalpel, okay?

51
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,903
One.

52
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,108
Two.

53
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,081
Three.
Hey, let's do it!

54
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:59,024
- No, I can't do it.
- Come on, let's go.

55
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,287
I can't!

56
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:02,761
- We're gonna talk in detention then.
- No!

57
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,095
- Class, anyone else having a problem?
- What's the deal with detention?

58
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,965
He's always giving her shit.
He's such an asshole.

59
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:11,061
So make him stop.

60
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,434
- Okay, I'll do it.
- What?

61
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,841
I'm gonna do it, all right?

62
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,475
All right, class, you hear that?
Rita's gonna do it.

63
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:30,055
That a girl.
Way to go.

64
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:33,616
She's now aiming it
at the point of incision.

65
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,493
What are you doing?

66
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,833
What the hell
are you doing, young lady?

67
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,274
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

68
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,139
- I'll see you in detention also.
- I don't even go here.

69
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,152
<i>It wasn't over.</i>

70
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,387
<i>I could feel it...</i>

71
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,625
<i>like a charge in the air</i>
<i>before a storm.</i>

72
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,167
What else does he do?

73
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:18,637
He...

74
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,368
he gets really close...

75
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:24,240
and he touches my chest.

76
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:34,210
- What's going on?
- Rita's making up shit about Buttinger.

77
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:38,088
I'm not!
Okay? I'm not!

78
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:44,756
He gets behind me...

79
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:48,495
and he rubs himself
on my ass.

80
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,663
- You should be glad someone does.
- Shut up, Cindy.

81
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,368
- She's crazy. Everyone knows that.
- She's telling the truth.

82
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,472
He does it to me too.

83
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:05,178
You don't count, Violet.
You do it with everyone.

84
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:07,117
Well, at least I know
what I'm doing.

85
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:10,624
- If half the stories are true--
- Give it a rest, Cindy.

86
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:15,287
Look. You're the assholes
for letting him get away with it.

87
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:18,957
No. You're the asshole for
letting him get away with it !

88
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,059
Excuse me.
Who the fuck are you?

89
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,138
You're all assholes.

90
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,579
Because when that son of a bitch
puts his hands on her...

91
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:36,616
you should tell yourselves
he's putting his hands all over you.

92
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:40,047
Or you, or you, or you!

93
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:44,215
Because he sure as hell would
if he could.

94
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,486
So what are we supposed to do?

95
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,552
- Make sure he never does it again.
- How?

96
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,397
- We stick together.
- Gimme a break.

97
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,470
So, are we together?

98
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,850
Good.

99
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:46,046
We're just gonna sit here until we learn
something about the heart.

100
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,328
You know, Rita...

101
00:10:57,464 --> 00:11:01,264
you have very little confidence...

102
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:06,034
for someone with
so much potential, talent.

103
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,382
What is that?

104
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,853
What is that over there?

105
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,258
You're very pretty.

106
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:29,123
Pretty and talented
aren't the same.

107
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,790
What? Says who?

108
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:37,095
That's where you're wrong.

109
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:45,267
You know, you just don't appreciate
your value as a woman.

110
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:53,777
You know, I think you're way ahead
of all the girls your age.

111
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,054
I forgot my notebook.

112
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:07,066
Well, get it.

113
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:14,441
What are you doing here, Madeline?

114
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,674
- What is going on here?
- Don't let us stop you.

115
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:22,272
- Go on with what you were doing.
- Pervert!

116
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:25,250
- Come here, Red.
- That young lady is in detention today.

117
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,116
We need to talk.

118
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,417
- Keep your hands off Rita.
- And Violet.

119
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,458
And whoever the fuck else
you do this to.

120
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,062
- How does that feel?
- Fucking little punk!

121
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:40,128
That's right. You better move.
You better keep moving.

122
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,792
Or what?

123
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,630
This is outrageous!
This is absolutely outrageous!

124
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:49,369
I'm a teacher!
Madeline.

125
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:51,570
Madeline!
Come on!

126
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,113
You don't believe Rita.
She's emotionally unstable.

127
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,615
- I'm not unstable!
- I didn't mean it like that.

128
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:59,152
I'm not unstable!

129
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:01,119
Leave her alone!

130
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,518
Stop!

131
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,669
If you ever put your hands
on me again...

132
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:20,229
I'll snip your little nuts off
with my toenail clippers.

133
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,036
All right?

134
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:26,045
This is great!
Buttinger's such a fuck!

135
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,511
All right, let's go. Let's go.
Get out of here. Go!

136
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,521
Come on.

137
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:46,394
Can you get up?

138
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:53,304
Next time you think about fucking
with some young girl...

139
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,002
you think about this first.

140
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,318
Fuck!

141
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,592
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

142
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:20,394
What if someone saw us?
Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?

143
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,868
- We should get the hell outta here.
- Oh, my God, we're in trouble.

144
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:27,373
-Just stay calm.
- We are in so much--

145
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,103
Who was she, anyway?

146
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,284
I think we should all
go somewhere together.

147
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,418
Does this bitch always talk
in exclamation marks?

148
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:53,989
We should all just go home.
This is gonna be what it's gonna be.

149
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:01,105
''If you ever put your hands
on me again...

150
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:04,941
I'm gonna snip your little nuts off
with my toenail clippers.''

151
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,139
I said that?

152
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:11,411
The dork!

153
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:13,469
Shit.

154
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,750
- Maddy, sweetheart, did I scare you?
- No, no. Get in here.

155
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,724
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,528
Okay. Come in.

157
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,068
Thank you.

158
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:46,478
Spica in Virgo.

159
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,842
AJune sky.

160
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,957
- How did you get here?
- I climbed.

161
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,323
No. I mean,
how did you find my house?

162
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:07,099
You dropped this.
Sorry, it's wet.

163
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,759
It's okay.

164
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:14,168
Do you have a dry shirt or something?
I'm really kind of wet.

165
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,766
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

166
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,979
- So where do you live, anyway?
- Mostly in my head.

167
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:31,289
I'm just passin' through.

168
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:34,418
- That's not very safe, you know.
- I look in their eyes.

169
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:37,429
If I don't think it's safe,
I don't get in the car.

170
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:41,900
- How can you tell?
- It's a question of really looking.

171
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:48,339
<i>Mad, pick it up.</i>

172
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:50,808
<i>Look, I heard what happened.</i>

173
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:53,311
- Is that your boyfriend?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

174
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,879
<i>Just call me.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

175
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:03,049
Here, put this on.

176
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,057
Thank you.

177
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:16,802
- So where do you go to school?
- Don't. I was thrown out.

178
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,807
- For what?
- For thinking for myself.

179
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,276
So tell me about Buttinger.
Is that his name?

180
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:28,109
God, I have never done anything
like that in my whole life.

181
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,382
Rita Faldes isn't even my friend.
None of those girls are.

182
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,615
That's what's so weird.

183
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,853
Well, she is now, for life.

184
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,030
- Do you mind?
- No, no, go ahead.

185
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,763
There's some beef jerky under that pile.
I can get you some.

186
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:52,304
It's okay.

187
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,137
Do you mind if I sleep
on your floor tonight?

188
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:02,806
Yeah.

189
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:06,776
Are you sure?

190
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,984
Good.

191
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:20,933
- Good morning, hon.
- Yeah. Are you gonna eat that?

192
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,492
I was thinking about it.
Yeah.

193
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,734
Did Ethan stay over, Maddy?

194
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,411
It's only a girl.

195
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:39,014
- Who is she?
- She doesn't believe in stairs?

196
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,514
- Who is she?
- She's my drug dealer.

197
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:33,201
Thought I lost you.

198
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:42,573
- I don't even know your name.
- She says the next morning.

199
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,785
- Don't worry. You're not my type.
- Oh?

200
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,824
What's this?

201
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:54,884
That's my art stuff.

202
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,895
It's a camera.

203
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,169
Legs.

204
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,501
What about 'em?

205
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,608
That's what people call me.

206
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:13,671
I vault without poles.

207
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:16,272
That sort of thing.

208
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,242
What are you doing?

209
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,093
Come on. You're gonna fall.

210
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:32,831
- I'm not watching this. I'm not.
- Come and get it.

211
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:37,529
- I'm afraid of heights.
- Oh, how afraid? Are you this afraid?

212
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,096
Does this scare you?

213
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,801
Come on, Legs.

214
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,436
If it was that important to you,
you'd come get it.

215
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,481
- I wanna puke! Come on!
- Come on up here. Dance with me.

216
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,948
- No way!
- Come on.

217
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:07,823
Oh, boy.

218
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,174
Don't worry, I'll get it.
Don't worry.

219
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:22,840
Legs--

220
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:28,987
Don't! Come on.
Oh, God.

221
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,987
Careful!
Legs, it's not worth it.

222
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:38,087
Yeah, it is.

223
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:44,361
You don't--

224
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:46,268
It's okay.

225
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,864
Oh, God.

226
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:07,054
Give it to me.

227
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:10,460
Almost. Okay.

228
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:16,863
- Easy.
- It's okay.

229
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:25,307
You're a frigging lunatic,
you know that? God!

230
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:38,252
- So is this good-bye?
- It depends on how many bottles I find.

231
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:42,318
Figure I need $50
before I move on.

232
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:45,421
Nine hundred and eighty
bottles to go.

233
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:49,497
I hope you don't find
all the bottles you need today.

234
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:59,472
Look, there's a house about
a half mile or so up the river.

235
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,810
It's abandoned.

236
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:04,816
If you needed a place
to stay, I mean.

237
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:06,909
Thank you.

238
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,082
I gotta go.
I'm late.

239
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:12,782
Don't take any shit.

240
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:20,555
How could you just do that
and not tell me?

241
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:25,570
- Because it's not about you, Ethan.
- Why didn't you go to Mr. Parks?

242
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,606
If Buttinger did that to you--

243
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:31,337
pressed you against the blackboard,
grabbed your balls, what would you do?

244
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:32,969
- That's different.
- How?

245
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:35,139
It just is, Maddy, and you know it.

246
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,113
All right. I'd kick his ass.

247
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,825
Where were you last night?
I called.

248
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:53,024
I passed out early.

249
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:02,772
Come on.
Live dangerously.

250
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:05,333
Walk me to class.

251
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:08,040
I'll be your substitute
for the next few days.

252
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:13,814
Mr. Buttinger is out
due to a minor accident.

253
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,219
Are you Madeline Wirtz?

254
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,184
You're wanted
in the principal's office.

255
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:30,729
This note was intercepted
between two students in class.

256
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:33,432
Is there any truth to it?

257
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:39,905
It says we beat up Buttinger.

258
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,249
- Things got out of hand.
- So it's true?

259
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,917
- He grabbed me.
- So she busted his nose.

260
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:53,924
What?

261
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:58,089
- He was sexually harassing Rita.
- And you.

262
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,197
This is a very serious charge.
What are you girls?

263
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,900
Some sort of gang here?

264
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:13,412
Girls who run with foxes?
That sort of thing?

265
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:18,946
So you find this funny.

266
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:23,250
Okay, I am going to suspend
you all for two weeks...

267
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:26,383
for your conduct in this office
and for assaulting a teacher.

268
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,450
I will have you escorted out.

269
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,792
Mr. Parks, I need to stop by
the art room, please.

270
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:33,662
- I don't think so.
- My application goes out tomorrow.

271
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,792
- You should've thought of that before.
- That isn't fair.

272
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,599
- Two and a half weeks.
- What about Mr. Buttinger?

273
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:40,400
- You leave that to me.
- He should be fired.

274
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,965
Three weeks.
Would you like to keep going?

275
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,754
- It's all my fault.
- Yeah. Why don't you kill yourself?

276
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,697
- Why don't you just drop dead?
- Savage wit.

277
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:11,362
Don't you get dizzy
constantly looking down on her?

278
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:14,338
I can't go home.
My parents will kill me.

279
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,776
We can go to my house
and watch TV.

280
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,678
TV sucks, man.
It's lame.

281
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,313
I know where we can go.

282
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:50,968
Mr. Parks,
this is Rita's mother...

283
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:55,174
and I'm very concerned
about the situation with Rita.

284
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:59,844
You do a lovely mommy.
Maybe you will call him for me?

285
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,047
Sure. I'll do it better
on the phone.

286
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:06,319
- Good.
- Where the fuck are we going?

287
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:09,088
I'll call your parents too
if you want.

288
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:11,323
Yeah, whatever.

289
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:14,432
Isn't it beautiful?

290
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,233
Bet it's haunted.

291
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:24,509
I bet the ghost that I saw
when I was little is still here.

292
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,035
You saw a ghost? Really?

293
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:30,776
- I saw a UFO.
- Did you really?

294
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:47,860
Whoa! There's a tree in here!
We can build a tree house.

295
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:50,160
So I hear you got suspended.

296
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,328
For thinking for myself.

297
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,768
Then cheers.

298
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,916
Get away from me!

299
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:18,184
I just found it.

300
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:24,695
We all got suspended together.

301
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:26,994
Mr. Parks is such an asshole.

302
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:31,400
Yeah, he wouldn't let Maddy
get his ar-- her art.

303
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:34,065
It's my portfolio.

304
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,904
- It has to go out tomorrow.
- Then we should get it.

305
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:40,605
- What do you mean?
- We should go to the school and get it.

306
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,083
If there's a utility hatch on the roof
or basement, we'll go in and get it.

307
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:48,245
If I got caught,
I would be in so much trouble.

308
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:52,587
- She took that risk for you.
- Yeah. I'm down for a felony.

309
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:57,594
- A felony?
- This is way risky.

310
00:30:57,663 --> 00:31:01,690
We could be like
dead gerbils up here.

311
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:04,566
This is where
they put the bad kids.

312
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:07,629
I need to get outta here.
It's not funny.

313
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:10,301
- Where's the thing?
- We're gonna get lost in here.

314
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:12,503
- We're gonna die.
- Here it is. Here it is.

315
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:16,940
Thank God!

316
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,592
This is so weird.

317
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:34,393
- I can't do it.
- Come on.

318
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,166
Guys, please don't go
anywhere without me.

319
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:41,172
We're not going anywhere.
We're right here.

320
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:46,137
- Oh, fuck.
- It's okay.

321
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:48,237
Come on, Rita.
You can do it.

322
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:51,442
- Oh, good job!
- Good girl.

323
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,294
Come on!
Don't you like flashlights?

324
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:11,427
I always wanted one
when I was little.

325
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:13,665
- Hand this to Violet.
- Not like a normal flashlight.

326
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:17,470
Like one that would suck up
the darkness like a vacuum cleaner.

327
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:19,010
Shut up already.

328
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:21,410
I gotta get my stuff.

329
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,542
I only knew how to draw
one thing in art class:

330
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,178
a penis!

331
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,226
- Okay, here.
- Calm down.

332
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:38,491
Just put the stuff in there.
One more. One more.

333
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:41,124
- Did you hear what I said?
- No, was it funny?

334
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,794
Okay, here it is.
Okay, I got 'em.

335
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,498
I got everything.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

336
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:55,276
I've got one more, though, so wait.

337
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:02,947
Great, okay.
I got 'em, I got 'em.

338
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:33,475
Front door!
Front door!

339
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,762
Let's go.

340
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:26,533
- See if you get it.
- You got it.

341
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:34,712
- Got anything?
- Not yet.

342
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:53,290
Okay, I got you.

343
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:57,464
Shit! This way, this way!

344
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:38,166
<i>This is Simon. There was a small fire</i>
<i>in the art room. Over.</i>

345
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:41,407
Yeah, it's probably
a chemical reaction to something.

346
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,414
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

347
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:50,884
Did you see--

348
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,195
- I wonder what happened to them.
- I found more candles.

349
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:09,901
You and your fucking weed.
You're a tea head.

350
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,543
Where were you guys?

351
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:25,323
We need more candles.

352
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:29,388
Where'd you get
all these candles?

353
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:32,556
- Look, it's a shrine.
- Where'd you find these?

354
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:36,260
Was it laying around in this house?
Probably like witches here.

355
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:39,896
- Crazy shit.
- That's right.

356
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:45,410
Oh, my God.

357
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,978
- What are you doing?
- Check out her pouch.

358
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,041
I'm commemorating tonight.

359
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:03,147
This is so I'll always
remember tonight...

360
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:04,985
and you, Maddy.

361
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:10,523
And Goldie.

362
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,632
And Violet.

363
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:19,570
And Red.

364
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,395
- Fire?
- Because it nourishes...

365
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:26,529
and also destroys
if you don't respect it.

366
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:30,198
That's how we were tonight.

367
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:34,539
Do it to me.

368
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,354
Hold still, okay?

369
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,402
Don't be scared.

370
00:43:34,253 --> 00:43:37,381
Oh, my God.
Is it done?

371
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:40,892
It's beautiful!
I love it!

372
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:43,655
We're like those girls
who run with foxes.

373
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:47,031
You're such a geek!

374
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,830
We're like those geeks
that run with foxes.

375
00:43:50,903 --> 00:43:54,100
I'm a runaway geek,
goddamn it!

376
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:06,502
We're supposed to do our portfolios.
You forgot?

377
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,512
No, I remember.

378
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:14,652
I just don't have mine.
It's not at my house.

379
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:28,990
- What's up?
- Hey.

380
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:50,751
What is this?

381
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:55,452
It's a--
I got a tattoo last night.

382
00:45:59,698 --> 00:46:01,666
- You're pissed.
- No.

383
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:03,894
I'm happy that
you beat up a teacher...

384
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,132
got a tattoo, stood me up.

385
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:13,100
Hit your head or something lately?

386
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:15,169
What's the deal?

387
00:46:19,918 --> 00:46:24,082
You should just do your portfolio
and get it in. I'll do mine alone.

388
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,060
We're hanging out tonight, right?

389
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,333
Why do you keep doing this?

390
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:44,875
Are you some kind of freak?

391
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:48,037
What is the matter with you?

392
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:50,775
Don't you have any respect
for yourself?

393
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:55,682
This room looks like a drug den.

394
00:46:55,754 --> 00:46:58,985
I want these candles out of here
before you burn the whole house down!

395
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,418
We're going to be late.

396
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:11,869
So, we'll be at the medical convention
in Miami. Remember?

397
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:14,132
The number's on the fridge.

398
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,538
Don't forget to feed the bird.

399
00:47:18,844 --> 00:47:22,405
Oh, there's a girl
or whatever to see you.

400
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,445
Honey, you want me
to stay home with her?

401
00:47:31,523 --> 00:47:34,856
She's 1 7. She's old enough
to take care of herself.

402
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,460
I gotta pee!

403
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,802
- What's that?
- It's nothing. It's a cut.

404
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,344
Would you just get out?
Get out. Get out!

405
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:30,279
- Get dressed. We'll be late for school.
- I'm getting a ride...

406
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:33,010
with a friend.

407
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:35,518
She doesn't have any friends.

408
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,154
My stash.

409
00:49:18,396 --> 00:49:21,263
- That shit can kill you.
- So can aspirins.

410
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,063
It only takes 60 aspirins
to kill yourself.

411
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:29,731
Hey. Put that money back,
young lady.

412
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:32,299
First you gotta take
the safety off.

413
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:36,072
Put it back.

414
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:40,346
Go ahead.

415
00:49:40,418 --> 00:49:43,148
Put me out of my misery.

416
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,131
It was just a joke.

417
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:15,915
If I hear any more shit
about 60 aspirins...

418
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:19,479
or one more of your fucking mood swings,
I'm going to tickle you to death.

419
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,788
Do you understand me?

420
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,556
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, come here.

421
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:35,469
- Hello?
- Come in.

422
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:43,777
- Did you bring your lunch?
- No. How are you? Hi.

423
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:45,475
Hi.

424
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:49,486
- Something to eat?
- No.

425
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:53,081
I brought Charlie Deen,
the galloping machine.

426
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:57,727
Oh, man! Figures.

427
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:00,959
I got it in second grade.
This I brought too.

428
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:11,305
I brought another candle,
but it's nicer than the others.

429
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:30,994
That one's my favorite.

430
00:51:31,062 --> 00:51:33,428
I haven't decided what I wanna do
with this one yet.

431
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,060
Why don't you leave it like that?
It's nice.

432
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,228
I don't know.

433
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:43,803
You will not believe what I got.
Read it.

434
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,275
Open it.

435
00:51:48,747 --> 00:51:50,806
'' Dear Violet,
you don't know me.

436
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:55,148
I'm only a freshman,
but I feel like I owe you my life.

437
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,987
Mr. Buttinger's been coming
after me lately, but he won't anymore.

438
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:02,083
I wish I could've been there.

439
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,458
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

440
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:07,089
Love, Anonymous.''

441
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,395
Fuckin' cool, huh?

442
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:13,024
So this is headquarters.

443
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,505
What are you doing here?

444
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,978
We have a little problem, girls.
It's called Lloyd Buttinger.

445
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:32,710
- What about him?
- This nasty rumor got started...

446
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:36,049
and now these girls are
signing a petition to have him fired.

447
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,611
Wow.

448
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:42,919
- What's your point, Dana?
- Our point is...

449
00:53:42,994 --> 00:53:46,555
you girls started it,
so you'd better stop it.

450
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:48,792
Or what, big guy?

451
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:50,835
Or you'll be fucking sorry.

452
00:53:50,902 --> 00:53:55,168
If Coach Buttinger loses
his job 'cause of you sluts...

453
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:59,307
you'll pay.

454
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:03,177
- Shut up, Dana.
- That's pretty big talk, Dana.

455
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:11,118
You know, Violet,
I was thinking about you last night.

456
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:14,920
That's funny, Dana,
because I was thinking about you too.

457
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:19,589
Oh, yeah, that fuzzy little head
of yours buried between my thighs...

458
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:21,529
just blowin' away
at what you love best.

459
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,626
Why don't you tell all your friends here
how much you love the way it tastes?

460
00:54:25,703 --> 00:54:27,933
In your fucking dreams!

461
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:30,736
Dana, why don't you
and your little boys here...

462
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:35,576
run back to Coach Buttinger and tell him
he deserves whatever the hell he gets?

463
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:39,247
Let's go, man. Come on.

464
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:49,288
So is it true,
the stuff about Buttinger?

465
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,157
Yeah, it's true.

466
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,996
Hey, Bobby,
do you know Rita?

467
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:03,137
- You're in my French class, right?
- <i>Oui.</i>

468
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:15,481
I'll see you around.

469
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:21,454
<i>Bon soir,</i> Bobby.

470
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,551
Good night.

471
00:55:23,628 --> 00:55:25,289
See ya.

472
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:33,067
- I'm such a hopeless romantic.
- So perfect.

473
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,162
So great.
<i>Oui.</i>

474
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,473
It's like panty hose.
You have to unroll it.

475
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,513
Like this. Okay?

476
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,014
Yeah, but am I the one...

477
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:47,984
that's gonna have to actually
put it on and do it?

478
00:55:48,052 --> 00:55:49,917
It's more fun
that way.

479
00:55:49,988 --> 00:55:53,549
- What are you guys doing?
- Talking about penises.

480
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:56,025
God! What flavor?

481
00:55:56,094 --> 00:55:57,721
This is Condom 1 01 .

482
00:55:57,795 --> 00:56:00,662
Now, we'll get into flavors
next week.

483
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:09,495
How do you know if a guy's got
a really big schlong...

484
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,235
before you actually--

485
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:13,140
You get an eye for it.

486
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:28,556
Okay, smartie.

487
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:32,027
What about--
No, not him.

488
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,085
Him.

489
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:34,927
- That guy over there.
- Him?

490
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,331
- Violet!
- Him?

491
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:40,303
- That guy right there?
- Violet, stop it!

492
00:56:40,371 --> 00:56:43,670
Bushel of potatoes.
Double meat!

493
00:56:46,344 --> 00:56:48,869
How do you know
if a guy's good in bed?

494
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,542
By how many times
he makes me come.

495
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:56,815
<i>Do you wanna come</i>
<i>inside my house</i>

496
00:56:56,888 --> 00:57:00,915
<i>Do you wanna show me things</i>
<i>I've never seen before</i>

497
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:04,985
<i>I don't wanna tie you down</i>
<i>I just wanna tie you up</i>

498
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:09,898
<i>Do you wanna come</i>
<i>inside my house</i>

499
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,233
I wrote that myself.
What do you think?

500
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:17,035
I think you need
to get laid.

501
00:57:17,108 --> 00:57:19,804
I know.
I masturbate, though.

502
00:57:19,877 --> 00:57:21,845
Have I gotta hear about it?

503
00:57:21,913 --> 00:57:25,178
Oh, is our little bald one
not familiar with the art...

504
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:29,117
of autoerotic exhilaration?

505
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,413
This is like
a bad tampon commercial.

506
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:14,356
Hey, smoke my dick,
you fuckin' whores!

507
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:17,299
- Fuck you, dick!
- Stupid redhead.

508
00:58:21,973 --> 00:58:24,100
You guys, I'm afraid
of heights...

509
00:58:24,175 --> 00:58:25,904
but I'm not afraid
of getting high.

510
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,104
I'm afraid of an island
with no boys on it.

511
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:30,443
- Are you afraid of anything?
- I'm afraid of Legs in a dress.

512
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:32,809
I'm afraid of myself.

513
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:19,059
I have been out all night
looking for you.

514
00:59:20,064 --> 00:59:21,929
Get in the car.

515
00:59:37,815 --> 00:59:40,477
- Legs, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

516
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,380
Who's Audrey?

517
01:00:19,457 --> 01:00:21,448
A friend.

518
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,459
Audrey's my mom.

519
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:37,897
How?

520
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:40,773
In a car.
She was drunk.

521
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,841
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

522
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:50,086
Do you have a dad?

523
01:00:50,154 --> 01:00:52,918
Yeah, somewhere I do.

524
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:03,264
Maddy, I'm thinking about moving on
in a couple of days.

525
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:11,705
- To where?
- To wherever.

526
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,204
Somewhere.

527
01:01:19,116 --> 01:01:20,845
Do you have
to go alone?

528
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:26,987
Would you take someone
with you?

529
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:31,318
Is that someone sure?

530
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:36,300
Is she cut out
for the unknown?

531
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:48,737
Sometimes the unknown
will disappoint you.

532
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,224
If I told you that I loved you,
would you take it the wrong way?

533
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:14,062
What do you mean
by ''wrong''?

534
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:25,746
It's just that I'm not--

535
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,081
And you're--

536
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:39,027
I'll take it
however you want me to, Maddy.

537
01:03:41,158 --> 01:03:42,455
Look.

538
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:45,789
You can see Spica
in Virgo.

539
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,059
Summer's on its way.

540
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,323
Hi.

541
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,357
Can I talk to you?

542
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:03,829
I'm scared.

543
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,341
Dana and I
got in this fight...

544
01:05:09,413 --> 01:05:14,214
and he started pushing me
and hitting me.

545
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:18,551
I took off on him,
but he's out looking for me...

546
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:20,886
and I'm sort of scared
to walk home alone.

547
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,758
Why'd you come here?

548
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:26,820
You guys just sort of
have this reputation.

549
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:30,901
I was kind of hoping
you'd help me out.

550
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:42,469
Thanks for doing this.

551
01:05:42,546 --> 01:05:45,344
It's no big deal.
I'd do it for any girl.

552
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,288
You guys really messed up
Buttinger.

553
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:54,688
- You know, they fired him.
- He deserved it.

554
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:55,986
I know.

555
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,028
But Dana says it's all bull.

556
01:05:58,095 --> 01:06:00,620
'' Dana says, Dana says.''

557
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:04,256
God, Cindy,
get a mind of your own!

558
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,708
I can go the rest of the way alone.
It's okay.

559
01:06:18,782 --> 01:06:20,113
It's okay.
Laurel's not far.

560
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:23,984
Yeah, but--
You should go home.

561
01:06:24,054 --> 01:06:26,488
What's goin' on?

562
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:31,361
We'll take over from here, babe.

563
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:33,293
Look, Dana,
let's just forget it.

564
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,922
Why don't we go for a ride?

565
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:37,399
You watch too many
corny movies.

566
01:06:37,468 --> 01:06:40,232
Yeah? We think you girls are gettin'
a little too big for yourselves.

567
01:06:40,304 --> 01:06:42,431
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do about it?

568
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:45,373
What you've been wanting me
to do for a long time.

569
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:48,809
Cindy knows you have.
That's why she's comin'.

570
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,005
She's a witness.

571
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,310
One girl's word against another.

572
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,613
Maybe this is
just a bad idea.

573
01:06:54,685 --> 01:06:56,949
We're just gonna fuck around.
Why don't you get in the car?

574
01:06:57,021 --> 01:06:58,750
We got a fighter here.
Get her in the car.

575
01:06:58,822 --> 01:07:01,689
- Fuck off!. Cindy!
- What do you want me to do?

576
01:07:02,126 --> 01:07:03,991
Get your hands off me, damn it!

577
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,359
Fuck you!
Let me out of here!

578
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,122
Let her out!

579
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,058
Tell them to let her out,
you stupid fuck.

580
01:07:12,836 --> 01:07:14,497
Let her out.

581
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,773
Come on.
Get outta the car, bitch.

582
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:21,402
Get out!
Legs, get in.

583
01:07:21,478 --> 01:07:23,309
- Get in. Let's go.
- Go!

584
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,076
Damn!
It's my fucking car!

585
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:28,979
I can't drive!

586
01:07:29,053 --> 01:07:31,544
You guys, shit!
Jesus Christ!

587
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:33,180
Hold on!

588
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:39,152
Have a nice walk, boys!

589
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:44,457
What should we do
with the car?

590
01:07:44,535 --> 01:07:47,663
Keep it.
We deserve it.

591
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:51,139
- After all of our hard work?
- Shit, man.

592
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:53,934
Come here!

593
01:07:54,545 --> 01:07:55,705
Get in!

594
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,684
- What's going on?
- What's up?

595
01:08:02,753 --> 01:08:04,778
Maddy almost got raped,
and we just stole this car.

596
01:08:04,855 --> 01:08:05,844
What?

597
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:18,427
Oh, my God,
I can't believe we're doing this!

598
01:08:29,947 --> 01:08:31,744
Fuck you, Dana Taylor!

599
01:08:31,849 --> 01:08:34,409
Where are you taking us?

600
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:38,012
<i>It's not what</i>
<i>you've been told</i>

601
01:08:39,123 --> 01:08:44,288
<i>There's nowhere</i>
<i>we won't go</i>

602
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:47,660
What's a beautiful girl like you
doing racing in a place like this?

603
01:08:47,731 --> 01:08:50,063
- Winning.
- <i>Winning</i>

604
01:08:59,543 --> 01:09:01,135
Shit, red light!

605
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:10,015
Excellent!

606
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:12,180
- Let's go!
- Yes!

607
01:09:12,256 --> 01:09:13,587
Where're we goin'?

608
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:17,192
To the beach.
Let's go to the beach.

609
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,663
Cops!

610
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:25,694
Oink! Oink!

611
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:30,102
Legs, we can explain this.

612
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:34,866
Shut up!

613
01:09:34,945 --> 01:09:36,537
What's up?

614
01:09:36,613 --> 01:09:38,945
Talk to me. Come on.

615
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,481
Talk to me.

616
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,649
I don't like police stations.

617
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,183
Carjacking.
resisting arrest...

618
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:17,584
assault with
a deadly weapon.

619
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:20,020
You girls fell in
with a bad element.

620
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,650
I hope you've learned
from it.

621
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:26,253
I'm going to turn you over
to the care of your parents.

622
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,197
They, better than I,
know what's best for you.

623
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:32,099
Don't let me see you
in here again.

624
01:10:32,169 --> 01:10:35,696
Now, Margaret Sadovsky.

625
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,708
I think some adult guidance,
supervision...

626
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,801
could benefit you too,
young lady.

627
01:10:40,878 --> 01:10:43,346
Because you have no legal
guardian-- Is that right?

628
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:44,937
Yes.

629
01:10:45,015 --> 01:10:48,883
And because you appear to be
the most culpable of the defendants...

630
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:51,284
and have
a previous record...

631
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:54,290
I hereby sentence you
to six months to a year...

632
01:10:54,358 --> 01:10:56,189
at a youth correctional facility.

633
01:10:57,227 --> 01:10:58,421
No.

634
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:00,690
- No, you can't do this.
- Be quiet.

635
01:11:00,764 --> 01:11:02,755
You don't understand.
She was just trying to protect me.

636
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:04,198
That's enough out of you!

637
01:11:04,268 --> 01:11:06,259
No, we're telling the truth!
You've got it all wrong.

638
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:08,896
They're the ones that lied.
They lied!

639
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:12,430
- Cindy, goddamn it, tell the truth!
- Watch your mouth in my courtroom.

640
01:11:12,509 --> 01:11:14,238
There's no justice.
Fuck your courtroom!

641
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:17,109
- You won't get away with this!
- If she goes, we all go.

642
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,046
Don't take any shit.

643
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:38,192
No dates, no boys.

644
01:11:38,268 --> 01:11:39,496
You hear me?

645
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,567
Maybe she's better off, Maddy.

646
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:48,938
Look, she'll be okay.

647
01:14:29,806 --> 01:14:33,367
Your Honor, we have new evidence
to be brought before the court.

648
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:37,903
I'd like to request a recess
to consult with my client.

649
01:14:37,981 --> 01:14:40,142
The court is in recess
for an hour and a half.

650
01:14:40,217 --> 01:14:41,684
Thank you very much.

651
01:14:57,768 --> 01:15:00,168
-Judge Holifield?
- Yes?

652
01:15:00,237 --> 01:15:03,001
I need to talk to you
about something.

653
01:15:03,106 --> 01:15:04,733
Yes?

654
01:15:06,676 --> 01:15:08,837
I lied.

655
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:33,292
Hi. Can I please
speak to Rita?

656
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:35,634
<i>Rita's not allowed</i>
<i>to come to the phone.</i>

657
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,274
Thanks anyway.

658
01:15:41,478 --> 01:15:43,070
Yeah, Mom.

659
01:15:43,146 --> 01:15:45,740
- There's someone here to see you.
- Hi.

660
01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:47,943
Girl, what're you doin'
in my house?

661
01:15:48,018 --> 01:15:50,748
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm at the library.

662
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:55,054
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

663
01:15:56,193 --> 01:15:59,026
Wow!
This place is great!

664
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,758
- Pull up a chair.
- What are you doin'?

665
01:16:01,832 --> 01:16:03,356
You'll see.

666
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,701
Come on, be here.

667
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:15,403
- Oh, yeah.
- ''I put my hand in his pocket--''

668
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:18,039
'' Never wanted more than a rocket!''
It's Red!

669
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:20,709
- Maddy, it's Rita!
- Yeah.

670
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:23,582
- Can you talk to her?
- Hold on. Hold on.

671
01:16:28,225 --> 01:16:29,920
'' Been eating any...

672
01:16:29,993 --> 01:16:33,451
meat and potatoes lately?''

673
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,157
You big slut!

674
01:16:35,232 --> 01:16:36,290
Can I just type?

675
01:16:36,366 --> 01:16:38,630
Yeah, talk to her for a while.
I gotta do something.

676
01:16:57,587 --> 01:16:58,611
Hello.

677
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:00,713
<i>Can I speak to Goldie, please?</i>

678
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:01,882
Goldie isn't here.

679
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,585
<i>Who is this?</i>

680
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,991
Maddy Wirtz.

681
01:17:05,061 --> 01:17:06,255
Is that her dad?

682
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:07,990
<i>Goldie hasn't been home</i>
<i>in two days.</i>

683
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:10,294
If you see her,
you tell her to get home.

684
01:17:16,106 --> 01:17:18,472
What?
Maddy, what's happening?

685
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:21,344
Goldie ran away.

686
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:43,024
I'm lookin' for Goldie.

687
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,726
Yeah?
And who are you?

688
01:17:50,006 --> 01:17:52,133
Tell me where she is.

689
01:18:07,257 --> 01:18:09,088
Goldie, get up.

690
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:13,294
Goldie, come on, get up.
Let's go. Come on.

691
01:18:13,363 --> 01:18:16,924
What are you doing here?
All right, all right.

692
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,628
If I ever catch you
near her again...

693
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:22,035
I will fucking kill you!

694
01:18:25,508 --> 01:18:26,907
Come on.

695
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:30,744
- Come on, Goldie.
- Get off me!

696
01:18:30,814 --> 01:18:32,805
We should stay with her,
make sure she doesn't try to leave.

697
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:34,247
Leave me alone.

698
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:36,785
I can't stay here all night.
I have to go home.

699
01:18:36,853 --> 01:18:39,754
We'll all take turns, okay?

700
01:18:39,823 --> 01:18:41,848
Maybe she's hungry.

701
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:45,224
- I have some chocolates.
- I don't want this. Get off me!

702
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:48,492
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

703
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:51,227
- Here's some pudding.
- I can't.

704
01:18:51,301 --> 01:18:54,998
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!
- You know that I can't.

705
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:58,837
Get the fuck away from me, then.
Everyone leave me alone!

706
01:19:00,043 --> 01:19:02,739
Just leave me
the fuck alone.

707
01:19:02,812 --> 01:19:06,373
- I don't know what to do.
- Maybe we should call a doctor.

708
01:19:06,449 --> 01:19:09,077
- No, it'll just get her in trouble.
- Get out of here.

709
01:19:09,152 --> 01:19:12,519
I'll stay with her tonight.
It'll be all right.

710
01:19:12,589 --> 01:19:15,490
- I'll stay. It's okay.
- Fuck.

711
01:19:15,558 --> 01:19:18,721
We should go.
I'll walk you home.

712
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:22,060
- Leave me alone!
- Maddy, I'll be back later.

713
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:25,764
Fuck.

714
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:25,721
Legs?
Shit! You guys!

715
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:36,063
Hey, lady.

716
01:20:36,139 --> 01:20:37,265
Hi.

717
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,145
Thank God you're back.

718
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:48,806
Hi.

719
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:04,766
What's wrong?

720
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:07,530
It's Goldie.

721
01:21:07,604 --> 01:21:09,435
What?

722
01:21:09,506 --> 01:21:13,272
She's upstairs.

723
01:21:15,145 --> 01:21:17,113
She's sick.

724
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:51,043
- How long has she been like this?
- Two days.

725
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:53,844
- She throwing up?
- She was.

726
01:21:56,519 --> 01:21:58,487
What're we gonna do?

727
01:22:13,837 --> 01:22:15,771
Yes?

728
01:22:15,839 --> 01:22:17,898
We're here about Goldie.

729
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:24,140
- What do you mean? Where is she?
- She's in trouble.

730
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:26,739
We need $1 0,000 from you
to help her.

731
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,318
What in the hell
has she done now?

732
01:22:32,388 --> 01:22:34,652
It's for rehab.

733
01:22:34,724 --> 01:22:36,851
Goldie has
a drug problem.

734
01:22:36,926 --> 01:22:41,022
- What are you talking about?
- She's sick.

735
01:22:41,097 --> 01:22:43,258
You tell me where she is,
and I'll take care of her.

736
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,267
No, I think
you've done enough.

737
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:48,668
I don't know who you think you are,
but I'm her father.

738
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:54,772
- Didn't they send you away?
- Fuck you!

739
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,111
Get out of my house!
No, not without the money.

740
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:05,346
- Where is she?
- No.

741
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:08,686
- Maybe you'd like to tell the police.
- Why don't we call the police?

742
01:23:08,758 --> 01:23:12,387
Why don't we call them and tell them
what a lousy father you are...

743
01:23:12,462 --> 01:23:15,329
and that they should lock you up
for beating your daughter?

744
01:23:15,398 --> 01:23:17,195
What?

745
01:23:17,267 --> 01:23:19,997
I never beat her.
Is that what she told you?

746
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:23,300
Stop blaming her
for everything!

747
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:30,204
You gonna give us the money
or not?

748
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:36,108
I want you, you and you
out of my house. Now.

749
01:23:37,253 --> 01:23:39,187
I'm calling the police.

750
01:23:41,824 --> 01:23:43,792
Put the phone down.

751
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,256
Put it down!

752
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:52,325
You give us $1 0,000 right now
or you're coming with us.

753
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:55,735
- Put the gun down.
- Or what, Maddy? It's not loaded.

754
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:59,639
What kind of asshole would keep
a loaded gun in the house?

755
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:00,971
- Wait.
- We can't--

756
01:24:01,044 --> 01:24:02,272
No!

757
01:24:02,345 --> 01:24:04,006
Not until he gives me the money!

758
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:07,543
Come on.

759
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:10,179
Shit. Get the keys, Maddy.

760
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:12,221
Pick them up off the table.

761
01:24:12,288 --> 01:24:15,951
Pick them up, Maddy, now!
Come on, let's go.

762
01:24:17,193 --> 01:24:20,026
- Girls, please.
- Move! You move!

763
01:24:36,145 --> 01:24:37,806
Maddy, drive.

764
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,314
- Let's just talk about this.
- Get in the fucking car.

765
01:24:40,383 --> 01:24:42,044
All right.

766
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,658
- Legs, we can't do this.
- Will you just drive?

767
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:56,824
- This is crazy!
- Don't choke on me.

768
01:24:56,899 --> 01:24:59,333
You don't have to obey her.
You can pull the car over.

769
01:24:59,402 --> 01:25:02,428
Shut up!
Just drive to the house.

770
01:25:04,574 --> 01:25:08,305
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Don't know. Don't worry about it.

771
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:12,477
- Shit! I'm gonna pull over.
- No, you're not!

772
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:14,482
I won't press charges.
I swear.

773
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,484
I will kill you.
I don't care.

774
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:27,960
Okay.

775
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:32,092
Look, we're just gonna
calm down, okay?

776
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:40,233
I'm just gonna drive.

777
01:25:55,224 --> 01:25:56,452
Get out.

778
01:25:59,262 --> 01:26:01,730
- What are we gonna do with him?
-Just get in.

779
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:08,570
- Where's Goldie?
- She's in here. She's awake.

780
01:26:08,638 --> 01:26:10,572
Go upstairs.
Could I have some help?

781
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:15,640
Maddy says it's okay.
Let's go!

782
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,680
Can you move?

783
01:26:23,453 --> 01:26:25,353
What the fuck happened?

784
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:31,851
Sit.

785
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:34,089
Come on, sit.

786
01:26:36,432 --> 01:26:38,525
Come here
and help me tie him up.

787
01:26:40,336 --> 01:26:42,270
Come on!

788
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,374
Take your socks off.

789
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:59,119
Red, gimme your hand.
You'll be okay. I'm just gonna think.

790
01:26:59,188 --> 01:27:01,418
Okay?
Hold it on him.

791
01:27:13,236 --> 01:27:16,137
Talk to me.
Tell me what you're doing.

792
01:27:28,084 --> 01:27:30,484
We're gonna call his wife
and make her drop off the money.

793
01:27:30,553 --> 01:27:33,021
- Ransom?
- That's kidnapping!

794
01:27:33,089 --> 01:27:35,523
That's just a word, Maddy.
Don't let it scare you.

795
01:27:36,926 --> 01:27:38,450
You're what's scaring me.

796
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:52,365
I'm just trying to make him
do the right thing.

797
01:27:52,441 --> 01:27:54,375
- Not this way.
- How?

798
01:27:56,012 --> 01:28:00,312
- He brought this on himself.
- He is not the point. We are!

799
01:28:01,184 --> 01:28:03,049
God!

800
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,782
We're the ones who live here.
They're gonna find us.

801
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:09,154
And when they do, we're the ones
who are gonna pay for this.

802
01:28:09,225 --> 01:28:11,352
Like last time?

803
01:28:24,874 --> 01:28:28,435
Come on. This is--
This is for Goldie.

804
01:28:30,246 --> 01:28:32,544
This is about
saving her life.

805
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:37,651
And who we are to her.

806
01:28:42,325 --> 01:28:44,919
It's about who we are.

807
01:28:46,662 --> 01:28:48,755
You're doing it wrong.

808
01:28:48,831 --> 01:28:50,389
Yeah? I don't see you
doin' it right.

809
01:28:50,466 --> 01:28:52,127
This is crazy!

810
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:54,260
There's gotta be another way
to go about this.

811
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,832
- So what is it, Red?
- I don't know what it is.

812
01:29:03,145 --> 01:29:05,113
Well, I'm out of ideas.

813
01:29:05,181 --> 01:29:07,172
Come on, Legs.

814
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:10,378
I want him
to see Goldie.

815
01:29:10,453 --> 01:29:13,786
- He doesn't give a shit about Goldie.
- He's her father!

816
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,120
She's right.

817
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:22,097
You know what?

818
01:29:23,132 --> 01:29:26,727
Fathers mean nothing!

819
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:31,367
They don't care.
They mean nothing.

820
01:29:36,712 --> 01:29:39,442
This isn't about you.

821
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,255
Maybe he'll come through
for her this time.

822
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,813
Maybe he'll come through
for her this time.

823
01:29:50,192 --> 01:29:52,126
What the fuck
is going on?

824
01:29:56,132 --> 01:29:58,600
- Someone call an ambulance!
- Dad!

825
01:29:58,668 --> 01:30:02,331
- What's he doing here?
- Violet, untie his hands.

826
01:30:02,405 --> 01:30:05,340
He's gonna be okay, Goldie.
It went clean through.

827
01:30:05,408 --> 01:30:07,808
We have to stop
this bleeding.

828
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:09,640
He's okay.
It went clean through.

829
01:30:09,712 --> 01:30:11,475
Oh, shit!
Red!

830
01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:14,107
It was an accident.
The gun went off.

831
01:30:14,183 --> 01:30:16,447
It's my fault.
Look at me!

832
01:30:16,519 --> 01:30:19,454
- Okay?
- Goldie, he's gonna be okay.

833
01:30:19,522 --> 01:30:21,820
We've gotta get him outta here.
Can you take the girls out?

834
01:30:21,891 --> 01:30:23,017
No way!

835
01:30:23,092 --> 01:30:25,356
- I'll take care of him.
- I'm not leaving you.

836
01:30:25,428 --> 01:30:27,055
Nobody's leaving.

837
01:30:28,331 --> 01:30:29,662
Let's get him to a hospital.

838
01:30:29,732 --> 01:30:32,394
Ready?
One, two, three.

839
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,735
- You're gonna be okay. I got him.
- Easy, you guys.

840
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:41,108
Put your weight on me.
Hear me?

841
01:30:45,614 --> 01:30:47,980
- Easy. Easy.
- Where are ya?

842
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:49,915
I'm here.

843
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,920
- Goldie, are you there?
- Dad, I'm here.

844
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,513
- Dr. Goldman, I've got you.
- Down the stairs.

845
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,048
- Easy, you guys.
- Everybody just slow down.

846
01:31:00,162 --> 01:31:02,892
Keep him steady, Violet.
Keep him steady.

847
01:31:02,965 --> 01:31:05,695
Dad...

848
01:31:05,768 --> 01:31:07,759
it's okay.

849
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,425
All right.

850
01:31:36,499 --> 01:31:38,899
Careful, careful.

851
01:31:38,968 --> 01:31:41,266
Watch his head.

852
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:46,232
- I'm sorry, man.
- It was an accident.

853
01:31:46,308 --> 01:31:49,971
- I'm driving.
- Where's Legs?

854
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,514
- Shut it.
- We've got to go! Go!

855
01:33:03,986 --> 01:33:05,783
Where are you going?

856
01:33:05,855 --> 01:33:08,346
You don't have to go.

857
01:33:08,424 --> 01:33:10,255
Stay with us.

858
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,618
We're your family.

859
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:18,957
Do you want
to go with me?

860
01:33:27,076 --> 01:33:30,773
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna do this, okay?

861
01:33:30,846 --> 01:33:33,747
And when a car stops,
you won't even have to think about it.

862
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:36,307
You'll just know
and you decide.

863
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:42,321
You just do what feels right
in your heart, okay?

864
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:36,170
I'll never forget you.

865
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:54,020
You're in my heart, Maddy.

866
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:42,231
<i>Goldie's dad claimed</i>
<i>he shot himself.</i>

867
01:36:42,304 --> 01:36:44,738
<i>It was just stupid enough,</i>
<i>the police believed it.</i>

868
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:49,443
<i>He got Goldie into rehab,</i>
<i>worked things out with her eventually.</i>

869
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,938
<i>I've traveled since.</i>
<i>Half the world.</i>

870
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:58,043
<i>Art museums, bus stations,</i>
<i>airports.</i>

871
01:36:59,755 --> 01:37:02,451
<i>I've never seen Legs again.</i>

872
01:37:03,792 --> 01:37:06,226
<i>The rest of us,</i>
<i>we've drifted...</i>

873
01:37:06,295 --> 01:37:09,128
<i>but we embrace when we meet,</i>
<i>veterans of a sort...</i>

874
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:13,390
<i>bound together for life.</i>
