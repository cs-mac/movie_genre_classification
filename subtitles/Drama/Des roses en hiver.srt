1
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,400
I said "You are gods, sons of the Most High,

2
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:48,659
but you shall die like men and fall like princes."

3
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:40,818
OF GODS AND MEN

4
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,694
<i>Lord, open my lips...

5
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:58,214
<i>And my mouth will
proclaim your praise...

6
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,661
Aspirin...

7
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,931
And cough syrup.

8
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,286
There's hot tea.

9
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,089
Help me, Papa.

10
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,649
- Brother Luc.
- Nouredine, labesse?

11
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,036
And you?

12
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,626
Saturday is Jamel's khtana.

13
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:14,919
Will there be a party?

14
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,690
Yes. You're all invited.

15
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,479
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.

16
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:21,226
See you later. Take care.

17
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,929
Yes, you too.

18
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:32,006
Little brat! You're here?

19
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,887
Not at school today?

20
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:56,050
Good.

21
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:57,682
It's almost dry.

22
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:01,360
Stop with the bandages.

23
00:07:01,702 --> 00:07:04,238
Be sure to keep her
out of the sun.

24
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,237
That would be dangerous.
Forbidden.

25
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,276
Otherwise, all's well.

26
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,368
Little kiss.

27
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,287
What else?

28
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,484
I see.

29
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,848
It's serious.

30
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,318
Be right back.

31
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,302
Asleep, brother?

32
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:28,155
Here.

33
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:57,548
Guide us in the straith path

34
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:01,306
the path of those whom
Thou hast blessed

35
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:04,787
not those against whom
Thou art wrathful

36
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:09,286
nor those who are astray.

37
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,914
Amen.

38
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:17,881
The Messenger believes
in what was sent down to him

39
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:21,310
from his Lord, and the believers:

40
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:26,277
each one believes in God,
His angels...

41
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:29,810
...His Books and His Messangers.

42
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:34,237
We make no division
between any one of His Messengers.

43
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,709
They say: "We hear and obey.

44
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,554
"Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness.

45
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,551
"Unto Thee is the homecoming."

46
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:49,480
God charges no soul
save to its capacity.

47
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:52,275
It will be rewarded
for good it has done...

48
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,844
...and punished for evil
it has done.

49
00:12:55,007 --> 00:13:02,954
Lord, take us not to task
if we forget or make mistake.

50
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:06,966
Lord, charge us not with load...

51
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:11,133
...such as Thou didst lay
upon those before us.

52
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,478
Lord, do not budren us beyond what
we have strength to bear.

53
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,303
And pardon us, and forgive us...

54
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,612
...and have mery on us.

55
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,335
Thou art our Protector.

56
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:31,645
And help us against people
of the unbelievers.

57
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,495
(Honey of Atlas.)

58
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,321
How do you know
when you're in love?

59
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,146
There's...

60
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,916
...something inside you
that comes alive.

61
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:11,331
The presence of someone.

62
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,534
It's irrepressible and makes
your heart beat faster, usually.

63
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:23,172
It's an attraction, a desire...

64
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,140
It's very beautiful.

65
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:29,258
No use asking too many questions.

66
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,091
It just happens.

67
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,783
Things are as usual,
then suddenly...

68
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:37,198
...happiness arrives,
or the hope of it.

69
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:38,914
It's lots of things.

70
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,926
But you're in turnmoil.

71
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:43,397
Great turnmoil.

72
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,732
Especially the first time.

73
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:52,407
Your father spoke to me
about Khaled.

74
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,407
My father speaks to much.

75
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:55,851
I don't want that.

76
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:59,785
I feel none of the things
you mentioned when I see Khaled.

77
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,422
That means it's not very serious.

78
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,920
My father wants it, not me.

79
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,206
That's another problem.

80
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,332
Ever been in love?

81
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,985
Several times, yes.

82
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:30,287
And then I encountered another love,
even greater.

83
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,833
And I answered that love.

84
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,621
It's been a while now.

85
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:40,318
Over 60 years.

86
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:46,943
Here, you have to put
your son's address.

87
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,887
He's no longer at home?

88
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:51,380
He lives far away now.

89
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:57,854
Here.

90
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,368
Abdallah...

91
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:07,846
Taroudi.

92
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:12,662
13th Etretat Street.

93
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,123
Le Havre.

94
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,717
And here they ask for two photos.

95
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,406
Do you have photos?

96
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:34,326
Listen, Tuesday we're
going to the market.

97
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,078
We can take you along.

98
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,024
And have photos taken.

99
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,096
Okay?

100
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,980
My cousin from Mostaganem...

101
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:07,013
They killed her granddaughter.

102
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,406
This afternoon.

103
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,760
She's 18. Samira.

104
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,583
They stabbed her on the bus.

105
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,926
Right in the heart.

106
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,107
Those dogs.

107
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,229
They threw her out like a dog.

108
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,117
And for veil!

109
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,789
She didn't wear the hijab.

110
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:30,692
What's the problem with these
people? It's beyond me.

111
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,524
Is that normal?

112
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,759
God says in the Koran:

113
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,386
You kill your brother,
you go to hell.

114
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:43,560
They say they're religious.
They've never read the Koran.

115
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,894
In the Koran, its written down.

116
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,902
Does it make sense to you?

117
00:21:49,094 --> 00:21:50,916
Look at what's happening in France.

118
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,148
Schoolgirls make an uproar...

119
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:54,725
...about wearing a veil.

120
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,215
The world's gone mad, Christian.

121
00:21:58,607 --> 00:21:59,752
True.

122
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:03,755
They're killing imams too.

123
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:06,309
Yesterday they killed an imam
in the street.

124
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,344
Where are we going?

125
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:12,097
I don't know who these people are.
Only God knows.

126
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,769
This is new. No one understands.

127
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,602
Who's killing who?

128
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,509
We'll pray for Samira
and her family.

129
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,273
May she go to Heaven.

130
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:03,721
It's not mine.

131
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,288
Whose then?

132
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:06,662
The haji's.

133
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:32,118
Get lost!

134
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,097
Kill him!

135
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,336
Beat it!

136
00:24:01,712 --> 00:24:03,406
Are you stupid?

137
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:33,822
Christian!

138
00:24:37,094 --> 00:24:39,119
- They killed the Croatians!
- What?

139
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,479
Our friends, the Croat workers.

140
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:44,547
Throats slashed, all of them.

141
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,306
You need military protection.

142
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,620
That is not an option.

143
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:18,357
How can you say that?
Those men were killed nearby!

144
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,224
The atrocities will continue.

145
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:24,383
The Wali's offer
deserves to be discussed.

146
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:27,706
There are families here.
Think of them.

147
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:29,965
I made my decision. I refuse.

148
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:35,654
Let's speak inside, allright?

149
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:46,517
We'll lock the gate at 7:30
and take no night calls.

150
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,656
Why do you think that's enough?

151
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:51,531
You don't know them.

152
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:07,181
Try to make him see reason.

153
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,192
Is your phone working?

154
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:10,767
Yes, we can't complain.

155
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:13,561
Call us before it's too late.

156
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:45,471
<i>Because He is with us
in this time of violence...

157
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,071
<i>...let us not dream
that He is everywhere...

158
00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:52,194
<i>other than where we die.

159
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:54,304
<i>Let us make no haste

160
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:58,899
<i>Let us draw patience from him.

161
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,538
<i>Let us turn to the Man of Sorrows.

162
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,670
<i>...who beckons us from the cross...

163
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:17,659
<i>Because he is with us
as on Easter morn...

164
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:22,365
<i>Let us not forgot...

165
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,454
<i>...the blood he shed.

166
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,633
<i>Let us break the bread...

167
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:31,840
<i>Let us drink from
the chalice of passage...

168
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:37,297
<i>Let us greet the one
who sacrificed himself

169
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:42,545
<i>by loving us until the end

170
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:21,313
Through him, with him and in him...

171
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,286
...you shall receive, Almighty Father...

172
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,944
...in the unity of the Holy Spirit...

173
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:30,968
...all glory and honor,
forever and ever.

174
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:35,869
How could you deside this
without consulting us?

175
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,508
All our lives are at stake.

176
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,126
What would you have done?

177
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:45,604
I'd have let everyone speak
and listened to each position.

178
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:47,852
To answer what, in the end?

179
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:49,857
The answer doesn't matter.

180
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:54,876
The very principle of community
is compromised by your attitude.

181
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:01,210
Allright, then, who wants the army
present in the monastery?

182
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:06,472
You refuse to understand
what we're saying.

183
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:07,872
I do understand very well!

184
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:11,078
None of us chose to live here...

185
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,795
...to be protected by
a corrupt goverment.

186
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:22,805
Christian...

187
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:26,503
...we didn't elect you
to decide on your own.

188
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:35,167
And if they come to monastery?

189
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,723
We lie down and die?

190
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,170
It's a risk.

191
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,229
We were called to live here.

192
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,691
In this country, with these people...

193
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:51,498
...who are also afraid.

194
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:56,855
We will live with this unknown, yes.

195
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:01,910
I didn't come here
to commit collective suicide.

196
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:07,324
Maybe we can try to figure out...

197
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:10,622
...what each of us could do
if they came here.

198
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:14,287
What's there to do?

199
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,558
Look at the Croatians.

200
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:19,632
Play hide-and-seek.

201
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,046
Cough.

202
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:22,035
Once more.

203
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:33,767
You'll outlive us all.

204
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,728
Hello, haji.

205
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:40,922
Still got your head?

206
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:43,641
I don't care. They can have my head.

207
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:44,984
May I?

208
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:46,520
Sure. Be my guest.

209
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:30,982
The roads are blocked.

210
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,958
I won't go to Meznir doday.

211
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:35,964
Not after what happened.

212
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:17,875
We don't need anything.
I'll let you know.

213
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:23,148
Christmas is in a week.

214
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:27,185
You know it's inmportant
for us to be here together.

215
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:31,801
Thanks again.

216
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:34,256
Talk to you soon.

217
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:45,897
Accepting our powerlessness
and our extreme poverty...

218
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:50,344
...is an invitation, an urgent appeal
to create with others...

219
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:52,801
...relationships not based on power.

220
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:55,885
Recognizing my weaknesses,
I accept those of others.

221
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:59,928
I can bear them, make them mine...

222
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:01,772
...in imitation of Christ.

223
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:05,310
Such an attitude transform us
for our mission.

224
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:08,258
Weakness in itself is not a virtue..

225
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:12,052
...but the expression
of a fundamental reality...

226
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:16,920
...which must constrantly
be refashioned by faith...

227
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:19,731
...hope and love.

228
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,978
The apostle's weakness
is like Christ's...

229
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:25,956
...rooted in the mystery of Easter...

230
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,976
...and the strenght of the spirit.

231
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:30,964
It is neither passivity

232
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:32,521
...nor resignation.

233
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:34,418
It requires great courage...

234
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,141
...and incites one
to defend justice and truth...

235
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:41,033
...and to denounce the temptation...

236
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:43,458
...of force and power.

237
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:45,662
End of article.

238
00:36:46,524 --> 00:36:48,090
New article.

239
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:49,830
By Carlo Carretto...

240
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,516
"The God Who is Coming."

241
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,812
Often throughout my life...

242
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:57,749
...I've wondered how God
could act so strangely.

243
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:00,548
Why does he stay silent to long?

244
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,616
Why is faith so bitter?

245
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:09,274
<i>And nothing exists except love...

246
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:13,353
<i>Except love which now begins...

247
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:18,660
<i>By separating sand from water...

248
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:23,125
<i>God has prepared earth like cradle...

249
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:28,781
<i>For his comming from above...

250
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,909
<i>This is the night...

251
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:36,483
<i>Happy night in Palestine...

252
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:40,505
<i>And nothing exists except Child...

253
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:44,795
<i>Except the Child of life divine...

254
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:01,800
What do you want?

255
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,103
- Are you the Pope?
- No.

256
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:08,495
Where's the Pope?

257
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,848
There's no Pope here.

258
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:12,781
Your leader, what's his name?

259
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:14,833
His name!

260
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,223
Brother Christian.

261
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:20,677
Christian!

262
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,516
Who are you? Christian?

263
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:07,896
Come on.

264
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,175
Here he is.

265
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,855
This is Christian.

266
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:18,659
What do you want?

267
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,431
This is a house of peace.

268
00:39:23,473 --> 00:39:24,512
Are you Christian?

269
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,409
Yes.

270
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,447
No weapons allowed here.

271
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:34,817
If you wish to speak, you must
leave them outside monastery.

272
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:36,600
Please.

273
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:40,466
I never part with mine.

274
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:44,210
Then follow me. We'll talk outside.

275
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:04,436
I need the doc.

276
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:11,473
He has to come with us.

277
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,397
Impossible.

278
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:18,975
I have 3 men wounded an hour away.

279
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:23,154
He can't leave here. He's sick.
He's old and asthmatic.

280
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:27,108
Brother Luc
sees patients at the clinic.

281
00:40:28,357 --> 00:40:31,315
He tends to everyone
who needs his help.

282
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:34,652
Their identity is not an issue
and never will be.

283
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,362
That's all.

284
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,964
So you can give us medicine.

285
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:44,303
We're short on supplies.

286
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,517
We see 100 villagers a day.

287
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:47,682
Enough!

288
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:50,808
You have no choice!

289
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:52,985
Yes.

290
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:55,979
I do.

291
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,288
We can't give what we don't have.

292
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,009
Ask your brothers in the village.
We live modestly.

293
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:05,618
With products we grow.

294
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:09,610
You know Koran?

295
00:41:10,724 --> 00:41:14,607
"Those nearest in love
to the believers...

296
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:17,528
"...are those
who say 'We are Christians'...

297
00:41:19,197 --> 00:41:21,693
"Among them are priests and monks."

298
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:24,491
Priests and monks...

299
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,607
...and they wax not proud.

300
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,468
That's why
we're close to our neighbors.

301
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:49,195
Come on, let's go.

302
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:04,230
Tonight
is different from other nights.

303
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:12,549
Why?

304
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,593
It's Christmas.

305
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:17,654
We celebrate the birth
of the Prince of peace.

306
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:23,129
The Prince of peace?

307
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,296
<i>Sidna Aissa.

308
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:29,670
Jesus.

309
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,061
I'm sorry, then.

310
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:47,432
I didn't know.

311
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:31,601
Christophe?

312
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,131
Michel?

313
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,446
Come out now.

314
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,300
They're gone.

315
00:43:46,046 --> 00:43:47,057
We're fine.

316
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:48,367
We made it.

317
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,683
Hold this down gently.

318
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,584
You can let go.

319
00:44:33,443 --> 00:44:36,642
You'll be fine. Don't worry.

320
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:47,193
<i>This is the night...

321
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:52,176
<i>The immense night of origins...

322

00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:21,235
<i>Except this place of ruined hope...

338
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:26,208
<i>By stopping in our abode...

339
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:31,410
<i>God, as with the bush, did forebode...

340
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:37,442
<i>The world on which fire would fall...

341
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:22,573
Why...

342
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:25,388
...why not give them medicine?

343
00:47:26,362 --> 00:47:27,382
We have enough.

344
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:32,275
If you have medicine,
I'd like to know about it.

345
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:36,225
We can't start negotiating.

346
00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:39,094
Every day they'll ask for more.

347
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:42,409
I agree with Luc.

348
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:45,770
Don't forget,
I was held at gunpoint.

349
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:51,540
If we stay, our lives
would be at risk every day.

350
00:47:53,277 --> 00:47:55,034
I became a monk to live.

351
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:58,551
Not to sit back
and have my throat slit.

352
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:00,744
You're right, Celestin.

353
00:48:01,113 --> 00:48:03,524
We shouldn't be seeking martyrdom.

354
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,590
Maybe we should leave.

355
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,285
Or at least
take refuge in a safer place.

356
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:15,586
I think that Celestin...

357
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,681
...is asking a good question.

358
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:24,026
They've come once. They'll be back
sooner than we think.

359
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,738
The fact that
you refused all their demands...

360
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:32,831
...could be taken
as a declaration of war.

361
00:48:34,388 --> 00:48:36,417
Look what they did to Croatians.

362
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,128
If they'd wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

363
00:48:42,284 --> 00:48:45,544
Maybe Fayattia
isn't the only one who decides.

364
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:48,889
Maybe others
will come back tommorow.

365
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:54,733
There's another solution.

366
00:48:57,186 --> 00:48:58,389
Leave for good.

367
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:04,923
We should each decide
according to his own conscience.

368
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:08,129
Go back to France...

369
00:49:08,998 --> 00:49:12,536
...or to another,
safer monastery in Africa.

370
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,122
To leave is to run away.

371
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:19,885
And to leave village
to the terrorists.

372
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:22,326
We'd do it gradually...

373
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:24,670
...so the villagers won't worry.

374
00:49:24,952 --> 00:49:26,671
That won't change a thing.

375
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:31,543
The Good Shepherd doesn't
abandon his flock to the wolves.

376
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,676
We should each express our oppinion
about leaving.

377
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,899
Jean-Pierre?

378
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,029
We stay.

379
00:49:56,523 --> 00:49:58,842
Since when do we yield to arms?

380
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:01,655
Paul?

381
00:50:02,928 --> 00:50:04,635
I think we should leave.

382
00:50:05,012 --> 00:50:06,413
Gradually.

383
00:50:08,554 --> 00:50:09,855
Celestin?

384
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:12,786
I'm ill. I want to leave.

385
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,017
Luc?

386
00:50:17,788 --> 00:50:19,321
To leave is to die.

387
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,410
I'm staying.

388
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:25,164
Michel?

389
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,110
I have no one else, anywhere.

390
00:50:32,223 --> 00:50:33,472
I'll stay.

391
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:38,357
Amédée?

392
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,943
I don't know yet.

393
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:45,878
We need to think...

394
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:49,890
...and pray together.

395
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,790
I think we should leave.

396
00:51:03,038 --> 00:51:04,542
And you, Christian?

397
00:51:09,285 --> 00:51:12,919
I agree with Amédée.
It's too early to decide.

398
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,277
Help will come from the Lord.

399
00:51:24,605 --> 00:51:26,886
Who made heaven and earth.

400
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:30,083
<i>We do not know your mistery...

401
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:34,232
<i>Infinite Love...

402
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:38,187
<i>But you do have a heart...

403
00:53:39,176 --> 00:53:45,494
<i>For you seek the prodigal son...

404
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:50,572
<i>And hold against your breast...

405
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:54,783
<i>This troublesome child...

406
00:53:55,971 --> 00:54:01,599
<i>Which is the world of mortals...

407
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:13,657
<i>We do not see your face...

408
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:18,323
<i>Infinite Love...

409
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,988
<i>But you do have eyes...

410
00:54:23,403 --> 00:54:30,075
<i>For you weep through the oppresed...

411
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:35,274
<i>And look upon us...

412
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:40,126
<i>With a shining gaze...

413
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:47,447
<i>That reveals your forgiveness...

414
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:27,213
I fear for the fate of this country.

415
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:31,145
Yesterday two women teachers
were found murdered.

416
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:34,559
For telling teenagers
falling in love is normal...

417
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,551
...that they're allowed to.

418
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:40,838
It's a 15-year-old girl
who tipped off the extremists.

419
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,159
We're as sad as you are.

420
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,186
What do you know?

421
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,553
This here is my country.

422
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:53,126
Besides being sad,
I'm tired of not seeing it grow up.

423
00:56:53,571 --> 00:56:57,275
And despite what you think,
I blame French colonization.

424
00:56:57,965 --> 00:57:00,130
That organized plundering.

425
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:06,924
This is for you.

426
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:20,757
Ministry of the Interior

427
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,194
They mean business.

428
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,894
They're giving you orders.

429
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:33,079
No one other than ourselves...

430
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,944
...can decide that we must leave.

431
00:57:35,646 --> 00:57:37,023
I'd have been surprised.

432
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:38,895
Really surprised.

433
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:41,914
Your stubbornness
is getting dangerous.

434
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,422
Look at all these people.

435
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,307
They're at home here.

436
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,634
They're terrorized.
They all wish they could leave.

437
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:58,974
But they have no choice, no money.

438
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,481
It's not cowardly to want to leave.

439
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:07,427
It's about being free.

440
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,047
Terror strikes Djelfa.

441
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:13,993
Sooner or later, it'll be you.

442
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:17,510
No one can control
what's going on these days.

443
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:20,765
You'll end up
becoming just another pawn.

444
00:58:20,992 --> 00:58:23,857
Your sacrifice
will eventually be exploited.

445
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:30,639
I've known you for years.

446
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:32,530
I have respect for you.

447
00:58:33,284 --> 00:58:35,556
And for what
your community has done.

448
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:38,799
But I would ask you to go back to France.

449
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:02,688
- Did your car break down?
- Yes, it broke down.

450
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,741
Is any of you mechanic?

451
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:10,619
If you know how to fix it,
be my guest.

452
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,507
Should I try?

453
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:21,896
- Should I try?
- Is it in neutral?

454
00:59:25,081 --> 00:59:27,318
You're in neutral? Go on, try.

455
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:30,500
All right, it's good. It's good.

456
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:15,432
Will the village need
the army to protect it?

457
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:18,124
Because...
they'll be back someday.

458
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:20,480
Forget the army!

459
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,923
It's a disaster.

460
01:00:22,347 --> 01:00:23,948
The army won't come.

461
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:26,348
The protection is you.

462
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:30,692
This village
grew up with the monastery.

463
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:34,964
What was the name of that priest, before?

464
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,608
A while back, before the war.

465
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:39,288
Brother Bernard?

466
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:42,039
No, no, no. Another one. Old.

467
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,632
Brother Daniel.

468
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,595
That's him.

469
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:46,685
Brother Daniel.

470
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,774
He told my mother not to stay here.

471
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:53,257
To move to a city.
There was no more work here.

472
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:57,687
She made him swear
to say nothing to my father.

473
01:00:58,385 --> 01:01:01,887
Because my mother,
she feels good living here.

474
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,362
Comfortable.

475
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:11,305
We may be leaving.

476
01:01:12,606 --> 01:01:13,846
Why are you leaving?

477
01:01:19,931 --> 01:01:22,634
We're like birds on a branch.

478
01:01:23,066 --> 01:01:24,835
We don't know if we'll leave.

479
01:01:28,193 --> 01:01:29,342
We're the birds.

480
01:01:29,627 --> 01:01:31,067
You're the branch.

481
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,517
If you go, we lose our footing.

482
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:47,801
Forgive us our trespasses...

483
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:50,361
...as we forgive those...

484
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:52,659
...who trespass against us...

485
01:01:53,394 --> 01:01:55,884
...and lead us not into temptation...

486
01:01:56,272 --> 01:01:59,056
...but deliver us from evil. Amen.

487
01:02:00,648 --> 01:02:03,210
<i>Let us bless the Lord...

488
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:08,126
<i>We render thanks unto Him...

489
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:19,392
So you want to leave?

490
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:26,425
I was thinking that.

491
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:32,397
I wonder what my life would be.

492
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:42,505
Your family, in France?

493
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:44,387
They're worried?

494
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:47,879
I'm not sure they realize
what's going on here.

495
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:50,288
I haven't said anything.

496
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:57,199
The last time I saw them,
it was strange.

497
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:00,189
What do you mean?

498
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:11,486
We celebrated my mom's 80th birthday
at the restaurant.

499
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,328
I saw everyone.

500
01:04:16,803 --> 01:04:19,013
My sisters were there...

501
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:21,604
...nephews, nieces, my goddaughter.

502
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:24,755
Everyone was talking, telling stories.

503
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,306
Taking pictures.

504
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,743
They know that's not my thing.

505
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:33,430
I was there, listening. I was happy.

506
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:38,617
They put me next to my mom.

507
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:42,726
And at the same time...

508
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,133
I was totally out of it.

509
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:50,465
I was thinking...

510
01:04:51,775 --> 01:04:53,980
...if I stopped everything, if...

511
01:04:54,942 --> 01:04:57,596
I could move back home.

512
01:04:59,072 --> 01:05:01,042
Get back to work, plumbing.

513
01:05:02,142 --> 01:05:03,952
Town council...

514
01:05:04,844 --> 01:05:06,975
...fire department, chorus.

515
01:05:08,494 --> 01:05:11,140
Then I thought:
no, that's not possible.

516
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:14,790
My life's over here.

517
01:05:18,365 --> 01:05:20,151
Here. With you.

518
01:05:26,107 --> 01:05:29,108
Christian's teaching today
was interesting.

519
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:32,295
Don't you think?

520
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:36,836
Did you understand anything?

521
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:40,718
Fuck off!

522
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,216
Okay.

523
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:50,936
Just tired. Not his fault.

524
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:56,373
"There was a time
when French toe-punt was crummy...

525
01:06:56,374 --> 01:07:00,318
"...and its Irish equivalent
a mere display of folklore.

526
01:07:04,108 --> 01:07:09,163
"When these damned men didn't know
what to do with their ten digits...

527
01:07:09,164 --> 01:07:13,776
"...but were great at bending the rules
to piss everyone off."

528
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:18,175
Is that all?

529
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,587
"Even though we agree
with Mr. Briscou...

530
01:07:22,588 --> 01:07:25,060
"...that our amiable guests...

531
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:28,185
"never closed the game out...

532
01:07:28,186 --> 01:07:32,136
"...we still wonder
whether they prefer, deep down...

533
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:34,556
"...the dervish-like scrums..."

534
01:07:34,557 --> 01:07:37,189
"...and bleak brawls of yesteryear.

535
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:44,020
"Back when players still
cared about not being...

536
01:07:44,473 --> 01:07:46,118
"...naughty old men."

537
01:07:48,968 --> 01:07:50,647
A little more.

538
01:09:55,302 --> 01:09:57,470
Help me, help me.

539
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:04,054
Don't abandon me.

540
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:07,391
Don't abandon me. Please.

541
01:10:07,556 --> 01:10:09,363
Help me.

542
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:39,471
Not very pretty. Ig got infected.

543
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:46,959
Tell him
I'll be giving him two shots.

544
01:12:49,728 --> 01:12:52,394
An anibiotic and a tetanus shot.

545
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:00,427
He is in pain. He needs medicine.

546
01:13:00,428 --> 01:13:02,686
I will give him a tranquilizer.

547
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:05,885
Let's clean this up.

548
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:20,168
You'll be fine.

549
01:13:24,178 --> 01:13:29,865
<i>Glory be to the Father,
and the Son and the Holy Spirit...

550
01:13:30,307 --> 01:13:33,636
<i>World without end...

551
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:43,588
<i>Save us, Lord...

552
01:13:43,589 --> 01:13:46,572
<i>Wilst we watch...

553
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:51,016
<i>Keep us, Lord...

554
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:54,969
<i>Whilst we sleep...

555
01:13:55,853 --> 01:14:02,179
<i>And we shall watch with Christ...

556
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:08,341
<i>And we shall rest in peace...

557
01:15:10,066 --> 01:15:11,884
I'm worn out.

558
01:15:13,396 --> 01:15:14,961
Does Amédée help out?

559
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:18,567
Fortunately. I don't know
how I'd manage otherwise.

560
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:24,475
I've never had so many visits.

561
01:15:25,314 --> 01:15:27,966
I'm up to 150 a day.
Can you imagine?

562
01:15:28,216 --> 01:15:31,736
People come from everywhere around.

563
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:35,220
I'm dealing with new pathologies.

564
01:15:35,554 --> 01:15:38,441
Lots of hypertension.
They're stressed.

565
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:40,972
Some are in state of shock.

566
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:43,945
Not to mention
the effect on the kids.

567
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:51,530
The villagers may talk
about these men we help.

568
01:15:51,531 --> 01:15:53,160
Be careful.

569
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:58,627
Throughout my career I've met
all sorts of different people.

570
01:15:59,327 --> 01:16:00,830
Including Nazis.

571
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:02,746
And even...

572
01:16:02,982 --> 01:16:04,204
...the devil.

573
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:16,137
I'm not scared of terrorists,
even less of the army.

574
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:22,830
And I'm not scared of death.
I'm a free man.

575
01:16:34,485 --> 01:16:36,095
Let the free man through!

576
01:17:05,548 --> 01:17:07,358
My men tied him to a truck...

577
01:17:07,511 --> 01:17:08,969
...dragged him through the city.

578
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,847
People jumped for joy.

579
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:12,595
Lucky for him he was dead.

580
01:17:12,978 --> 01:17:15,111
Why didn't you stop them?

581
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:16,961
Stop them?

582
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:22,055
Lots of people in the crowd
were victims of his atrocities.

583
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:23,154
Their families.

584
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:24,477
Friends who died.

585
01:17:24,815 --> 01:17:26,053
Many innocent people.

586
01:17:26,592 --> 01:17:29,358
Disgraceful.
No one should be treated this way.

587
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:32,152
Want to know his faworite torture?

588
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:36,322
Fayattia and others like him
deserve no compassion.

589
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,828
You're very indulgent
with the terrorists.

590
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,334
Overindulgent.

591
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:47,073
Rumor has it
he was shielding the monastery.

592
01:17:47,698 --> 01:17:49,251
Did you ever treat them?

593
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:52,794
Where did you find him?

594
01:17:55,307 --> 01:17:59,012
Two days ago,
the Wali's car was ambushed.

595
01:17:59,289 --> 01:18:00,680
Near Tikrit.

596
01:18:01,759 --> 01:18:03,390
The terrorists got away.

597
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:05,967
We found
a wounded man on the ground.

598
01:18:06,494 --> 01:18:08,731
His friends ditched him like a dog.

599
01:18:08,954 --> 01:18:10,575
He talked about his mother.

600
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:12,810
Said his name was Fayattia.

601
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:14,947
My men let him suffer.

602
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:18,001
He died
before we could make him our trophy.

603
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:21,811
How can you be sure it's him?

604
01:18:22,169 --> 01:18:24,579
Why do you think I asked you here?

605
01:18:45,644 --> 01:18:46,790
So?

606
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:53,703
It's him.

607
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:23,469
Get out. Go on.

608
01:19:24,151 --> 01:19:25,052
Outside.

609
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:40,994
I sleep badly.

610
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:45,738
The slightest noise wakes me.

611
01:19:47,209 --> 01:19:48,767
I think over my life.

612
01:19:51,886 --> 01:19:53,245
My choices.

613
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,145
As a kid
I wanted to be a missionary.

614
01:20:03,826 --> 01:20:06,462
Dying for my faith
shouldn't keep me up nights.

615
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:16,154
Dying here...

616
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,619
...here and now...

617
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:20,731
...does it serve a purpose?

618
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:26,372
I don't know.

619
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:29,785
I feel like I'm going mad.

620
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:34,040
It's true that staying here...

621
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:37,936
...is as mad as becoming a monk.

622
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:45,228
Remember.

623
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:49,013
You've already given your life.

624
01:20:50,714 --> 01:20:53,121
You gave it by following Christ.

625
01:20:53,539 --> 01:20:55,797
When you decided
to leave everything.

626
01:20:56,113 --> 01:20:57,555
Your life...

627
01:20:57,883 --> 01:20:59,170
...your family, your country.

628
01:21:00,312 --> 01:21:02,326
The family you could have raised.

629
01:21:03,156 --> 01:21:04,899
I don't know if it's true anymore.

630
01:21:08,622 --> 01:21:09,730
I pray.

631
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:14,112
And I hear nothing.

632
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,619
I don't get it.

633
01:21:22,564 --> 01:21:24,316
Why be marthyrs?

634
01:21:25,236 --> 01:21:26,302
For God?

635
01:21:27,176 --> 01:21:28,548
For be a heroes?

636
01:21:28,787 --> 01:21:30,446
To prove we're the best?

637
01:21:31,483 --> 01:21:34,498
We're martyrs out of love,
out of fidelity.

638
01:21:36,485 --> 01:21:37,812
If death...

639
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,827
...overtake us, despite ourselves...

640
01:21:42,209 --> 01:21:43,698
...because up to the end...

641
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:47,344
...up to the end we'll try to avoid it...

642
01:21:48,522 --> 01:21:51,326
...our mission here
is to be brothers to all.

643
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,692
Remember that love...

644
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:58,093
...is eternal hope.

645
01:22:00,008 --> 01:22:02,672
Love endures everything.

646
01:22:09,306 --> 01:22:10,415
I'm sorry.

647
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:25,236
<i>Like parched earth...

648
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:29,853
<i>I stand before you, Lord...

649
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:44,466
<i>O Lord, hear my prayer...

650
01:22:44,885 --> 01:22:48,051
<i>Listen to my cry for mercy...

651
01:22:48,347 --> 01:22:50,975
<i>In your faithfulness, answer me...

652
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,606
<i>Enter not into judgement
with your servant...

653
01:22:55,175 --> 01:22:58,336
<i>For no man living
is righteous before You...

654
01:22:59,293 --> 01:23:02,916
<i>The enemy persecutes my soul...

655
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:06,519
<i>He has smitten my life to the ground...

656
01:23:06,837 --> 01:23:10,599
<i>He has made me dwell in darkness...

657
01:23:11,023 --> 01:23:14,256
<i>With those long dead...

658
01:23:14,895 --> 01:23:18,252
<i>My spirit grows faint within me...

659
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,972
<i>My heart within me, dismayed...

660
01:23:23,638 --> 01:23:26,232
<i>Answer me quickly, O Lord...

661
01:23:26,578 --> 01:23:29,471
<i>My spirit fails...

662
01:23:29,844 --> 01:23:32,710
<i>Do not hide your face from me...

663
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:36,828
<i>Lest I be like them
who fall into pit...

664
01:23:37,904 --> 01:23:40,146
We've received
so many letters recently.

665
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:41,964
People are worried.

666
01:23:43,258 --> 01:23:45,191
I can't answer them all.

667
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:51,273
There's that French journalist
who wants to meet us.

668
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:54,028
I don't know what to tell her.

669
01:23:55,507 --> 01:23:59,659
We shouldn't expose ourselves
further by doing publicity.

670
01:24:01,094 --> 01:24:02,219
Of course, but...

671
01:24:04,084 --> 01:24:07,367
...it's a way of making
people understand our choices.

672
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:10,275
To show that...

673
01:24:10,524 --> 01:24:12,360
...amid all this drama,
for people here...

674
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:14,753
...still there's reason for hope.

675
01:24:15,568 --> 01:24:19,405
You know, hope
is not what interests journalists.

676
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:21,041
It doesn't mobilize them.

677
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:22,375
Exactly.

678
01:24:23,163 --> 01:24:24,763
Maybe we should mobilize them.

679
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:32,732
I suggest we take a vote.

680
01:24:33,138 --> 01:24:37,032
To see if we're all of one mind.

681
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:41,598
Who wants to leave?

682
01:24:44,477 --> 01:24:48,045
I've already told you
my position on this matter...

683
01:24:49,143 --> 01:24:52,727
...and my calling is to be here,
with everyone.

684
01:24:55,311 --> 01:24:57,060
I don't see myself leaving.

685
01:25:05,671 --> 01:25:08,049
Leaving would lead nowhere.

686
01:25:12,422 --> 01:25:14,764
I'm not ready to leave myself.

687
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:19,613
Last night I thought about leaving.

688
01:25:19,992 --> 01:25:21,849
I'm not comfortable with it.

689
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,758
Not at peace.

690
01:25:26,057 --> 01:25:29,637
Deciding to run of like that
makes no sense.

691
01:25:30,636 --> 01:25:33,944
We didn't come here
for our own personal interest.

692
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:40,508
I still think that our mission here
is not finished.

693
01:25:41,999 --> 01:25:42,866
I'm staying.

694
01:25:46,657 --> 01:25:49,294
I prayed all morning
while I was cooking.

695
01:25:50,189 --> 01:25:50,502
The disciple...

696
01:25:52,182 --> 01:25:53,777
...is not above his master.

697
01:25:57,804 --> 01:26:00,315
This is no time for me to stray.

698
01:26:02,127 --> 01:26:04,565
Let God set the table here.

699
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,758
For everyone.

700
01:26:07,894 --> 01:26:09,724
Friends and enemies.

701
01:26:15,585 --> 01:26:16,958
And you, Christian?

702
01:26:22,322 --> 01:26:26,080
Wildflowers don't move
to find the sun's rays.

703
01:26:27,527 --> 01:26:30,306
God makes them fecund...

704
01:26:30,843 --> 01:26:32,212
...wherever they are.

705
01:26:35,969 --> 01:26:36,733
Who...

706
01:26:37,157 --> 01:26:38,255
...prefers to stay?

707
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:18,896
You.

708
01:28:22,609 --> 01:28:25,841
You envelop me,
hold me, surround me.

709
01:28:26,822 --> 01:28:28,503
You embrace me.

710
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,309
And I love you.

711
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,171
- Where do you live?
- In town.

712
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:25,285
- ID.
- I don't have on me.

713
01:29:25,512 --> 01:29:27,789
- Where do you live?
- Just nearby.

714
01:29:28,014 --> 01:29:29,607
- ID.
- I don't have them.

715
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,794
- Where do you live?
- The village.

716
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:35,579
Stop this nonsence!

717
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,878
These women and children
are here to be treated.

718
01:29:39,106 --> 01:29:41,125
This is not a police station!

719
01:29:41,605 --> 01:29:43,189
Enough!

720
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,008
Unbelievable.

721
01:29:49,321 --> 01:29:50,588
Sit down.

722
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:54,686
Follow me.

723
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:57,787
I recently read
this pensée of Pascal's:

724
01:30:58,131 --> 01:31:01,527
"Men never do evil
so completely and cheerfully...

725
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:05,047
"...as when they do it
from religious conviction."

726
01:31:06,064 --> 01:31:08,097
Here it is mayhem...

727
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:09,835
...and violence.

728
01:31:13,736 --> 01:31:17,016
We are in a high-risk situacion...

729
01:31:17,997 --> 01:31:21,602
...but we persist in our faith
and our confidence in God.

730
01:31:22,497 --> 01:31:25,577
It is through poverty,
failure and death...

731
01:31:25,787 --> 01:31:27,575
...that we advance towards him.

732
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:34,137
Heavy devastating downpours...

733
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:37,235
...have put no damper
on the spread of violence.

734
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:41,516
Two opponents,
one clutching onto power...

735
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,795
...the other out to seize it.

736
01:31:44,187 --> 01:31:46,184
They'll fight to the bitter end.

737
01:31:46,526 --> 01:31:48,758
I don't know
when or how it will end.

738
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:51,546
In the meantime, I do my duty...

739
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:54,083
Caring for the poor and the sick...

740
01:31:54,423 --> 01:31:58,655
...awaiting the day I close my eyes.
Dear friend...

741
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:03,424
...pray form me,
that my leaving this world...

742
01:32:03,741 --> 01:32:07,155
...will pass in peace and joy of Isus.

743
01:33:16,335 --> 01:33:18,193
<i>O Father...

744
01:33:18,813 --> 01:33:21,303
<i>Of light...

745
01:33:23,878 --> 01:33:28,525
<i>Eternal light...

746
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:35,053
<i>And source of all light...

747
01:33:37,309 --> 01:33:43,207
<i>You illuminate us,
at the threshold of night...

748
01:33:43,427 --> 01:33:49,538
<i>With the radiance of your face...

749
01:33:51,951 --> 01:33:56,399
<i>The shadows, for you...

750
01:33:56,668 --> 01:34:01,166
<i>Are not shadows...

751
01:34:02,359 --> 01:34:05,626
<i>For you, night...

752
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:11,542
<i>Is as clear as day...

753
01:34:15,184 --> 01:34:21,787
<i>May our prayers before you...

754
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:27,315
<i>Rise like incense...

755
01:34:28,826 --> 01:34:36,222
<i>And our hands
like the evening offering...

756
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,096
Welcome, Bruno.

757
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:21,337
Celestin.

758
01:35:22,981 --> 01:35:24,286
Christophe.

759
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:33,599
Hello, Luc.

760
01:35:36,067 --> 01:35:37,229
Jean-Pierre.

761
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:42,577
Amédée.

762
01:36:16,925 --> 01:36:19,105
- Hosts.
- For me.

763
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:20,343
For us.

764
01:36:20,543 --> 01:36:21,851
For us all.

765
01:36:23,338 --> 01:36:24,745
Medicine.

766
01:36:25,548 --> 01:36:26,667
For Luc.

767
01:36:29,379 --> 01:36:30,758
Lots of medicine.

768
01:36:33,045 --> 01:36:35,235
- You found it?
- I found your book.

769
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:36,919
Is it the right one?

770
01:36:37,112 --> 01:36:38,032
"The Choosen".

771
01:36:39,601 --> 01:36:41,656
- And from me.
- Cheese!

772
01:36:45,016 --> 01:36:46,705
Any news of Brother Didier?

773
01:36:48,256 --> 01:36:50,459
Of course he said to say hello.

774
01:36:50,668 --> 01:36:53,286
And I have a letter for you.

775
01:36:54,787 --> 01:36:56,696
Thank you.
So how was your trip?

776
01:36:57,037 --> 01:36:58,142
How long was it?

777
01:36:58,391 --> 01:37:01,603
It took a while
to come from the diocese.

778
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:05,129
At least 3 hours.
There were 3 checkpoints!

779
01:37:06,678 --> 01:37:09,362
Between the last two checkpoints...

780
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:12,213
...there was a bus
burning on the roadside.

781
01:37:12,388 --> 01:37:13,760
Smoke coming out of it.

782
01:37:14,133 --> 01:37:16,058
And we didn't know
if the checkpoints...

783
01:37:16,274 --> 01:37:18,098
...were real or fake.

784
01:37:19,117 --> 01:37:20,758
On the way here...

785
01:37:21,754 --> 01:37:24,848
...as we got closer,
there were fewer vehicles.

786
01:37:25,323 --> 01:37:26,558
Many soldiers?

787
01:37:27,683 --> 01:37:29,535
Yes, near the checkpoints.

788
01:37:33,877 --> 01:37:35,654
They were all very tense.

789
01:37:35,956 --> 01:37:38,988
Out of the question
to speak to them.

790
01:37:39,897 --> 01:37:42,256
- How do we stand?
- However we want.

791
01:37:42,452 --> 01:37:43,819
Short ones up front.

792
01:37:50,178 --> 01:37:51,503
Squeeze in closer.

793
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:54,160
Ready?

794
01:37:56,519 --> 01:37:57,762
Set.

795
01:37:59,159 --> 01:38:00,419
Let's take another.

796
01:38:02,634 --> 01:38:04,221
Smile a little.

797
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,464
I've often thought of that time.

798
01:38:41,305 --> 01:38:42,618
That time...

799
01:38:44,048 --> 01:38:46,502
...when Ali Fayattia and his men left.

800
01:38:51,469 --> 01:38:52,829
Once they were gone...

801
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:57,626
...all we had left to do was to live.

802
01:38:59,451 --> 01:39:01,136
And the first thing we did...

803
01:39:01,573 --> 01:39:02,596
...was...

804
01:39:04,658 --> 01:39:06,150
...two hours later.

805
01:39:06,919 --> 01:39:10,653
We celebrated
the Christmas Vigil and Mass.

806
01:39:11,682 --> 01:39:13,297
It's what we had to do.

807
01:39:14,497 --> 01:39:15,818
It's what we did.

808
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,157
And we sang the Mass.

809
01:39:20,299 --> 01:39:24,782
We welcomed that child
who was born for us...

810
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,709
...absolutely helpless and...

811
01:39:30,644 --> 01:39:32,455
...and already so threatened.

812
01:39:36,752 --> 01:39:38,003
Afterwards...

813
01:39:38,552 --> 01:39:43,020
...we found salvation
in undertaking our daily tasks.

814
01:39:44,832 --> 01:39:46,086
The kitchen...

815
01:39:46,412 --> 01:39:47,487
...garden...

816
01:39:47,883 --> 01:39:49,969
...the prayers, the bells.

817
01:39:50,305 --> 01:39:52,032
Day after day.

818
01:39:56,415 --> 01:39:59,033
We had to resist the violence.

819
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:03,900
And day after day, I...

820
01:40:05,186 --> 01:40:07,578
I think each of us...

821
01:40:08,115 --> 01:40:09,514
...discovered...

822
01:40:09,892 --> 01:40:12,488
...that to which Jesus Christ...

823
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:14,593
...beckons us.

824
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:17,185
It's...

825
01:40:18,572 --> 01:40:19,779
...to be born.

826
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:22,961
Our identities as men...

827
01:40:23,408 --> 01:40:25,385
...go from one birth to another.

828
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:30,079
And from birth to birth,
we'll each end up...

829
01:40:30,586 --> 01:40:33,985
...bringing to the world
the child of God that we are.

830
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:36,226
The Incarnation, for us...

831
01:40:36,594 --> 01:40:39,355
...is to allow
the filial reality of Jesus...

832
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:42,186
...to embody itself in our humanity.

833
01:40:45,217 --> 01:40:48,396
The mistery of Incarnation remains...

834
01:40:49,798 --> 01:40:51,963
...what we are going to live.

835
01:40:53,092 --> 01:40:58,419
In this way what we've already
lived here takes root...

836
01:40:58,821 --> 01:40:59,899
...as well as...

837
01:41:00,223 --> 01:41:01,853
...what we're going to live...

838
01:41:02,665 --> 01:41:03,674
...in the future.

839
01:41:04,876 --> 01:41:08,998
Whoever tries to save his life
shall lose it...

840
01:41:10,471 --> 01:41:13,423
...and whoever shall lose it,
preserves it.

841
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,826
I tell you...

842
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,478
...on that night,
two people shall be in one bed.

843
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:24,664
One shall be taken, the other left.

844
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,356
Two women shall
be grinding grain together.

845
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:30,366
One shall be taken...

846
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:32,416
...the other left.

847
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,109
The disciples asked him:

848
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,151
"Where, Lord?"

849
01:41:38,067 --> 01:41:39,525
He answered:

850
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:41,988
"Where there is a body...

851
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:45,264
"...there too
the vultures shall gather."

852
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:56,370
The Gospel of the Lord.

853
01:41:56,626 --> 01:41:59,548
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

854
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,621
The body of Christ.

855
01:42:17,345 --> 01:42:18,540
The body of Christ.

856
01:42:49,506 --> 01:42:53,941
Lord, blessed art thou for this meal
which unites us as brothers...

857
01:42:54,696 --> 01:42:56,740
...now and...

858
01:42:58,515 --> 01:43:00,703
World without end.

859
01:47:54,011 --> 01:47:55,471
Hurry up!

860
01:48:14,228 --> 01:48:14,958
Move!

861
01:48:18,773 --> 01:48:20,099
Hurry, faster!

862
01:48:24,971 --> 01:48:27,347
Hurry, get dressed.

863
01:48:27,809 --> 01:48:28,643
I just get here.

864
01:48:30,268 --> 01:48:31,151
I can't.

865
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:52,054
I said don't push!

866
01:48:53,449 --> 01:48:57,397
Careful with that medicine.
It's for children, not you.

867
01:48:57,596 --> 01:48:59,338
It's very precious.

868
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:02,558
Stop pushing me! That's enough!

869
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:03,969
Calm down!

870
01:51:31,368 --> 01:51:33,474
I am brother Paul.

871
01:51:33,776 --> 01:51:36,188
A monk at the Monastere de l'Atlas.

872
01:51:36,764 --> 01:51:39,030
And I'm in good health.

873
01:51:43,536 --> 01:51:45,816
I am Brother Celestin.

874
01:51:48,721 --> 01:51:50,618
I'm 63.

875
01:51:54,515 --> 01:51:57,103
A monk at the Monastere de l'Atlas.

876
01:51:59,862 --> 01:52:01,395
I'm in good health.

877
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,668
Your turn, Luc.

878
01:52:13,241 --> 01:52:16,840
My name is Brother Luc.

879
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:19,739
From the Monastere de l'Atlas.

880
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:25,858
I heard
what they're saying on the news.

881
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:30,063
I've been taken hostage...

882
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:33,747
...with my colleagues by the Jama...

883
01:52:34,585 --> 01:52:35,661
What's it called?

884
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:37,171
Islamiyya.

885
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:40,126
Jama Islamiyya, that's it.

886
01:52:44,613 --> 01:52:45,783
Your turn, Christian.

887
01:52:51,997 --> 01:52:54,157
In the early hours
of Friday morning...

888
01:52:54,743 --> 01:52:59,845
...the Mujahideen read us the bayan
of the Jama Islamiyya Moussalaha...

889
01:53:01,625 --> 01:53:02,466
Signed by?

890
01:53:04,675 --> 01:53:07,169
Signed by Abu Abderrahamane Amine.

891
01:53:07,772 --> 01:53:10,227
It says we're being held hostages...

892
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:13,243
...and demands
that the French government...

893
01:53:13,462 --> 01:53:17,634
...free hostages
belonging to their group...

894
01:53:18,099 --> 01:53:20,088
...in exchange for our liberation.

895
01:53:21,342 --> 01:53:23,775
This exchange is non-negotiable.

896
01:53:26,871 --> 01:53:28,668
Did you hear?

897
01:53:51,211 --> 01:53:53,053
Should it ever befall me...

898
01:53:53,425 --> 01:53:54,842
...and it could happen today...

899
01:53:55,304 --> 01:54:00,024
...to be a victim of the terrorism
swallowing up all foreigners here...

900
01:54:01,226 --> 01:54:03,233
...I would like my community...

901
01:54:03,673 --> 01:54:04,802
...my church...

902
01:54:05,283 --> 01:54:06,181
...my family...

903
01:54:06,577 --> 01:54:10,582
...to remember that my life was given
to God and to this country...

904
01:54:12,136 --> 01:54:14,665
That the Unique Master of all life...

905
01:54:14,948 --> 01:54:17,709
...was no stranger
to thid brutal departure.

906
01:54:18,911 --> 01:54:22,415
And that my death is same as
so many other violent ones...

907
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:25,522
...consigned to the apathy of oblivion.

908
01:54:26,629 --> 01:54:28,378
I've lived enough to know...

909
01:54:28,401 --> 01:54:31,381
I am complicit in the evil that,
alas...

910
01:54:31,929 --> 01:54:33,513
...prevails over the world...

911
01:54:34,059 --> 01:54:36,618
...and the evil
that will smite me blindly.

912
01:54:37,181 --> 01:54:39,530
I could never desire such a death.

913
01:54:40,316 --> 01:54:44,167
I could never feel gladdened
that these people I love...

914
01:54:44,571 --> 01:54:47,171
...be accused randomly of my murder.

915
01:54:48,797 --> 01:54:51,714
I know the contempt
felt for people here...

916
01:54:52,098 --> 01:54:53,588
...indiscriminately.

917
01:54:53,857 --> 01:54:57,456
And I know how Islam is distorted
by certain Islamism.

918
01:54:59,207 --> 01:55:02,098
This country, and Islam, for me...

919
01:55:02,392 --> 01:55:03,738
...are something different.

920
01:55:04,062 --> 01:55:06,723
They're a body and a soul.

921
01:55:07,621 --> 01:55:09,655
My death, of course...

922
01:55:09,978 --> 01:55:13,216
...will quickly vindicate
those who called me naive...

923
01:55:13,547 --> 01:55:14,831
...or idealistic...

924
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:17,638
...but they must know
that I will be freed...

925
01:55:17,962 --> 01:55:19,952
...of a burning curiosity...

926
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:24,650
...and, God willing,
will immerse my gaze in the Father's...

927
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:28,456
...and contemplate with him
his children of Islam...

928
01:55:28,832 --> 01:55:30,124
...as he sees them.

929
01:55:31,394 --> 01:55:35,363
This thank-you
which encompasses my entire life...

930
01:55:36,366 --> 01:55:37,972
...includes you, of course...

931
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:40,732
...friends of yesterday and today...

932
01:55:41,414 --> 01:55:44,063
...and you too,
friend of the last minute...

933
01:55:44,755 --> 01:55:46,653
...who knew not what you were doing.

934
01:55:47,139 --> 01:55:49,110
Yes, to you as well...

935
01:55:49,482 --> 01:55:51,079
...I address this thank-you...

936
01:55:51,452 --> 01:55:53,169
...and this farewell...

937
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:55,027
...whish you envisaged.

938
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:57,997
May we meet again...

939
01:55:58,445 --> 01:56:01,514
...happy thieves in Paradise...

940
01:56:01,851 --> 01:56:02,809
...if it pleases God...

941
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:05,163
...the Father of us both.

942
01:56:05,714 --> 01:56:06,765
Amen.

943
01:56:07,289 --> 01:56:08,019
<i>Inchallah.

944
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:04,414
Christian, Luc, Christophe,
Celestin, Paul, Michel and Bruno...

945
01:59:04,415 --> 01:59:06,456
...were killed on May 21, 1996.

946
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:08,802
The identity of their murderers...

947
01:59:09,237 --> 01:59:11,368
...and the circumstances
of their deaths...

948
01:59:11,701 --> 01:59:12,975
...remain a mystery.

949
01:59:13,722 --> 01:59:15,746
Amédée died on July 27, 2008.

950
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,256
Jean-Pierre is still alive.
He is now 86.

951
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:46,456
