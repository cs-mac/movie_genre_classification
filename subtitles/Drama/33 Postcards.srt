1
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,466
I don't remember anything...

2
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:34,299
Not even my name.

3
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,432
But I remember the day I came

4
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,433
here.

5
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,532
And I remember good the year

6
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,199
they say I turned 6.

7
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,933
I was angry that day.

8
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,500
But then I met you.

9
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,566
"Dear Mei Mei, my name is"

10
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,866
Dean Randall.

11
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,132
I'm from Australia, and I'm

12
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,733

13

"or godparent in a baptism."

15
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, a parent from god.

16
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,232
"I work as a park ranger",

17
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,032
taking care of wildlife...

18
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,399
Animals and birds.

19
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,266
My wife, Jenny, looks after the

20
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,732
kids, Aiden and Maggie.

21
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,366
"And we live in Sydney."

22
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:53,799
"I want much seeing Sydney."

23
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,699
I want much meeting you.

24
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,333
"Yours truly, Mei Mei."

Yeah.

You know?

42
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,132
Yep. No, you're right.

Hey! What are you doing?!

47

Back of the line!

00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,432
Australian money only.

49
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,632
You can change it at the bank.

50
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,533
Hurry up!

51
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,432
Come on! Get a move on!

52
00:07:58,433 --> 00:07:59,566
Please. Wait.

53
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:00,966
I-I have no time. Please...

54
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,566
no, no, sorry. It's got to...

55
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:03,600
here. I got it.

"Dear Mei Mei, we went to a"

57
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,032
Christmas concert at the beach

58
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:14,800
last week.

59
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,232
And because it's summer here,

60
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,233
it was really hot.

61
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,566
But it was a lot of fun.

62
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,632
I thought about you and

63
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,899
imagined you singing Carols

64
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,800
"with our children."

65
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,932
"Winter in China... sky"

66
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,132
always gray.

67
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,866
I like see blue sky, white bird

68
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,732
"in your picture cards."

69
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,199
"Our house is by the beach."

70
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,799
It's really beautiful.

71
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,266
On the weekends, we swim or

72
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,799
bushwalk or just stay at home

73
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,266
and play with the kids in the

74
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,067
"garden."

75
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,300
You are Mei Mei.

76
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,899
Wake up, miss.

77
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,833

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,433

00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:24,567

How you do, Mr. Randall?

81
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:30,599
What are you, red cross or

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,966

00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,432
I look after Dean Randall.

179
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:33,399
His m.I.N. Number is 256904.

180
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,367
I'll sign her in.

181
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:35,799
I'll put my extension number

182
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,632
here for future reference.

183
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,532
Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,266
Can you sign your name in

185
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:41,733
here?

186
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,367
Okay.

187
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,167
How you do, Mr. Randall?

188
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,899
I Mei Mei.

189
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,533
I am Mei Mei.

190
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,667
Yeah, I know you are.

191
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,232
I want to say thank you,

192
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,799
Mr. Randall... for school,

193
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,032
for write me.

194
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,299
It was... it was nothing.

195
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,132
It... everything... for me.

196
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,099
I learn english.

197
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,932
I can read... read your life.

198
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,567
And your picture cards.

199
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,500
Yeah, the postcards, yeah.

200
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:54,599
I bring gift for you, but...

201
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,932
They take it.

202
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,632
Yeah, the... the screws would

203
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,233
take it.

204
00:15:58,234 --> 00:15:59,266
No... the guard.

205
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,399
Yeah, the screws

206
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,299
security-check everything.

207
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,799
Did they... Secure each of

208
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,599
my letters, too?

209
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,766
How'd you get here?

210
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:14,132
Motor bicycle. Very fast.

211
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,566
But...

212
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,432
"Cow." Honda.

213
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:19,932
H-h-how'd you know I was

214
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:20,400
here?

215
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,933
Your brother... uncle Gary.

216
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,000
Right. "Uncle Gary."

217
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,199
So, what do you want?

218
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,132
Want?

219
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,532
Yeah.

220
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,366
I-I...

221
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,232
I-I don't understand.

222
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,966
Nothing seem like your words.

223
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,899
Nothing looks same... no like

224
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,966
picture cards.

225
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,132
What do you want?

226
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,399
I want to see you.

227
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,766
I want to see Mrs. Jenny, Aiden,

228
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,533
Maggie.

229
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:53,599
They aren't real, okay?

230
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,766
Wh... what this mean?

231
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,199
It means they don't exist.

232
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,633
Why?

233
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,032
You really shouldn't have

234
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:02,633
come here, you know?

235
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,433
Sorry, miss. Visit's over.

236
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,032
Visiting a prison can be a

237
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,799
very confronting experience.

238
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,399
Everything is wrong.

239
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,932
I ask stupid questions.

240
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,866
It's probably not your

241
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:35,733
fault.

242
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,366
Mr. Randall doesn't get many

243
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:37,967
visitors.

244
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,632
Everything

245
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:40,633
is wrong.

246
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,232
My car is over there.

247
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,632
Well, technically, she's got

248
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,899
to be missing for 48 hours

249
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,366
before she's considered missing.

250
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,432
But she is missing!

251
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,300
Not technically.

252
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,680
Hey, mate. How'd you go?

253
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,300
Hey, good, mate.

254
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,366
Fletch is in the office.

255
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,233
Thanks.

256
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,399
How'd you go?

257
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, good.

258
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,632
Mrs. macneil lost her job, so

259
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,732
she missed a payment, but she

260
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,932
said she could pay next week, at

261
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,433
the latest.

262
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,432
Stupid woman.

263
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,799
She'll get her husband killed if

264
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
she's not careful.

265
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,399
Hey, Brian.

266
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,267
Good. Good.

267
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:38,432
Dad, she said she could pay

268
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:38,933
next week.

269
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,199
Can't you tell the guys to leave

270
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,799
him alone...

271
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,966
yeah.

272
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,032
No, cool.

273
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,966
Just one... macneil.

274
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,732
Yeah.

275
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,467
Yeah.

276
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,599
You are not gonna let them

277
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,732
bug you... do you understand?

278
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,066
Get back to your cell.

279
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:02,767
Tommy.

280
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,467
Ta-ta.

281
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,699
You sprung?

282
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,500
It's macneil's wife.

283
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:19,267
Hands up, macneil.

284
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,699
It's your warning.

285
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,767
Please, no!

286
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,267
You know the rules.

287
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,467
Get him up, Dwight.

288
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,232
Now, you listen to me, all

289
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:32,800
right?

290
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,399
You tell wifey on the outside

291
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,099
that she respects my timetable,

292
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,199
and then I'll respect you.

293
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
You understand?

294
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,866
Then we won't have all this

295
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,200
nonsense.

296
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,632
You didn't see anything,

297
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,433
okay?

298
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,899
Hey!

299
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,132
He asked you a question.

300
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,867
Leave him alone, Brian.

301
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,799
He's okay.

302
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,533
His brother always pays on time.

303
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,766
How many years have you known.

304
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,099
Mr. Randall?

305
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,566
Many years.

306
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,566
We talk in letters...

307
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,066
And picture card.

308
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,599
Nice.

309
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,066
And did he ask you to come to

310
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,466
Australia to visit him?

311
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,699
No. I come with orphanage.

312
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,866
Orphanage?

313
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,066
We sing for choir festival.

314
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,632
Right.

315
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,232
I love music.

316
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,766
My daughter plays the piano

317
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:57,899
really beautifully.

318
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,466
Unfortunately, she's... she's

319
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,100
given it up.

320
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,633
Thank you.

321
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:07,533
That's okay.

322
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,032
She has disobeyed the

323
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:54,967
regulations.

324
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:56,799
All meeting with sponsors should

325
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,266
be organized through our

326
00:21:58,267 --> 00:21:59,033
orphanage.

327
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,599
It's a waste of our time.

328
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,467
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,267
It won't happen again.

330
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,132
There's no evidence that my

331
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:14,432
client was involved in macneil's

332
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:14,900
beating.

333
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,866
I'm aware of that.

334
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,532
This protection-money racket,

335
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:22,266
cashish... is this the head guy,

336
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:24,067
Tommy fields?

337
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,866
Would help your chances at your

338
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:29,467
parole hearing.

339
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:31,267
We'd look after you.

340
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,132
Very well, then.

341
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:36,632
If you change your mind, contact.

342
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:37,433
Mrs. crenaugh.

343
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:38,532
Make sure Mr. Randall

344
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,632
participates in outdoor

345
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:40,732
activities and weekly

346
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,400
excursions.

347
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,866
I'd like the parole board to

348
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,399
consider the fact that my client

349
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,866
has been sponsoring a child for

350
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,966
many years.

351
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,400
Haven't you? In China?

352
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:57,032
I've met her. She's a nice kid.

353
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,299
If you want to see more of

354
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,699
her, I would consider the deputy

355
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,233
director...

356
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:02,033
she won't be coming back.

357
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,266
Mr. Randall?

358
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,299
Can I call you "Dean"?

359
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,399
What happened on the bus

360
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,766
this morning?

361
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,199
It's in the doctor's report.

362
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,266
Yeah, I read it...

363
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,432
"self-sabotage."

364
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,732
You know, Dean, it's not

365
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,299
uncommon for you to be feeling

366
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,699
anxious about your parole.

367
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,966
It's a big change in your life.

368
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:28,933
Do you want to make an

369
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,199
appointment, and we can have a

370
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,299
chat, or I can arrange some

371
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,133
counseling for you?

372
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:33,366
You didn't have to mention

373
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,032
the girl.

374
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,199
Well, should I mention you're

375
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,899
a park ranger, then?

376
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,367
She left this in my car.

377
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,532
10 years, you've been writing

378
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,232
to her and sending her money,

379
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:51,067
she told me.

380
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:51,633
So?!

381
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,432
Why?

382
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,366
I don't know.

383
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,400
It's just something to do.

384
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,132
"There's a family of eagles"

385
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,399
nesting in the bush near where

386
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,566
we live.

387
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,232
I love watching them fly.

388
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,866
They do kill to survive, but

389
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:41,867
they also play.

390
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:43,399
They certainly know how to

391
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,966
protect their young.

392
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,732
If you ever come to visit, I'd

393
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:49,532
love to show you our beach and

394
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,032
where the animals come to

395
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:51,567
"feed."

396
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:53,066
"the animals come to"

397
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:53,600
"feed."

398
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,567
You'd like it here.

399
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:55,567
"You'd like it here."

400
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:56,766
And you can bring the other

401
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:57,467
children, too.

402
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:58,599
We'd love to hear you sing.

403
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,267
"We'd love to hear you sing."

404
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,566

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,432
Come on. Let's go.

414
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,633
Come on.

415
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,566
Out. It's an order.

416
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,732
Get out there now.

417
00:28:57,733 --> 00:29:01,467
Come on.

418
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,532
Come on.

419
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:15,932
Throw it up here, mate.

420
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,833
Oi. Hey.

421
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,799
I heard they, they got you

422
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,633
into a little talk.

423
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,699
Anything I should know?

424
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,066
Are you deaf, Dean?

425
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,366
Tommy! Tommy!

426
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,532
Are we playing or what?

427
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,333
Go ahead. I'll be there.

428
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,632
Mei Mei!

429
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,067
Mei Mei!

430
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,299
* happiness is just a little

431
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,632

* happiness is just...

439
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:41,699
Make the beamers a priority.

440
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Keep your eyes open for the

441
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,367
other ones?

442
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,599
Beamer. Right-o.

443
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,267
Be good.

444
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:47,267
Yeah.

445
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,232
Yeah?

446
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,699
G'day, mate. How are you?

447
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,866
Make sure that it's straight.

448
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:58,867
Yep.

449
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,199
Hold it.

450
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,299
Hold on to the wheel.

451
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Grab the brace.

452
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,733
Okay.

453
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:04,300
Good.

454
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,532
They want to know if I can

455
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:06,699
still stay with you when I...

456
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,400
When I get out.

457
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,033
Is that okay?

458
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:08,867
Yeah, of course.

459
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:10,199
Where else would you stay?

460
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,100
I don't know.

461
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,933
Come on. Time.

462
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,199
They've got those halfway

463
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,566
houses and...

464
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,099
I haven't seen you for ages.

465
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,366
Yeah, sorry.

466
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,966
That place freaks me out.

467
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:24,732
I've been, you know... busy.

468
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,966
Yeah, you must have been.

469
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,199
It's been, like, eight months.

470
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Hey, look, I have been

471
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,466
busting a gut trying to organize

472
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:31,133
things for you.

473
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:33,599
Yeah, all right.

474
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,232
Hey, I need you to come in

475
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,399
today, if you can, and sign

476
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,432
something for my welfare

477
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,899
officer.

478
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,232
What, you... what, you want

479
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:42,399
me to just drop everything?

480
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,766
It's for the parole hearing.

481
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,132
Yeah, all right. All right.

482
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:45,767
I'll...

483
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,232
I can do it after lunch.

484
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,532
Okay. Thanks.

485
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,300
I'll let her know.

486
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,100
Get off, mate.

487
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,900
Right-o.

488
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,399
Yeah?

489
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,766
I want to see cow.

490
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:21,366
Cow?

491
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,132
Cow? Like a... like a moo cow?

492
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,466
Like a... "Moo"?

493
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,099
Moo-moo!

494
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,033
Moooooo!

495
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,866
Oi!

496
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:32,599
Hello, cow.

497
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,299
"Cow."

498
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,367
back off, Dave.

499
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:37,400
This is Dave.

500
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,267
Don't worry about him.

501
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,267
I'm gonna break for lunch.

502
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,199
Yeah, sure you are.

503
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,267
Hungry?

504
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:43,567
Yeah?

505
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:44,766
You want to grab something to

506
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:45,300
eat, or...?

507
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:48,532
I want see Mr. Randall.

508
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:52,066
What... right now?

509
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:53,432
Yeah, look, I don't know how

510
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:54,932
they do things in China, but...

511
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,733
I'm not a taxi service.

512
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,567
Hey.

513
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,932
You just want to put your arms

514
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,067
around me again, don't you?

515
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:19,299
Sorry.

516
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,100
After you.

517
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,532
I tried calling your brother.

518
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,333
He's not answering.

519
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,632
I meant to say the other day,

520
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:45,232
it's really admirable what

521
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,099
you've done... sending donations

522
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,699
to that child for so long.

523
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,266
Might tell my other clients

524
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:51,967
about it.

525
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:53,732
I don't reckon Gary's gonna

526
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:54,367
show up.

527
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,066
Because many of my clients

528
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,532
need my help to rebuild their

529
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,932
lives after parole... form

530
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,567
connections again.

531
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:07,366
Why don't you go down to the

532
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:07,800
workshop?

533
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,866
I'll page you if your brother

534
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:11,233
turns up.

535
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,699
Yeah, good job.

536
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,699
Yeah.

537
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,866
Yeah, turned out well.

538
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:55,933
Yeah!

539
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:59,966
M.i.n. number is 256904, report

540
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:02,099
to the visitors hall.

541
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,467
M.i.n. number 256904.

542
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,299
Hey, visitor?

543
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,467
Christmas, is it?

544
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,933
You're up.

545
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,632
You coming?

546
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,433
Hey!

547
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,732
Screw bring gift?

548
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,667
Yeah. Yep. Thanks.

549
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,599
Panda bring you good luck.

550
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,732
And the cd is our choir, but

551
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,633
about five year old already.

552
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,199
I didn't think I'd... See you

553
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,000
here again.

554
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:25,866
I stay here.

555
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:26,899
Where?

556
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,366
Here... Australia.

557
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,133
What for?

558
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,266
You are alone. Me too.

559
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:34,066
Now we no more alone.

560
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:36,700
Yeah, but... but...

561
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,232
W-w-where you gonna live?

562
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:40,566
Who's gonna look after you?

563
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:42,132
You look after me already...

564
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:42,867
Many years.

565
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:43,967
Now I can look you.

566
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:46,366
No, no. I mean...

567
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,932
How are you gonna cope?

568
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,566
You no want me stay?

569
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,632
You don't know anybody.

570
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:51,766
I know uncle Gary and his

571
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:52,200
friend.

572
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:53,399
Uncle Gary doesn't have any

573
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,200
friends, okay?

574
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:59,767
All right? He...

575
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,132
He has alibis.

576
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,933
Do you know what that means?

577
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:09,866
That means you'll end up like

578
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:10,932
me, in a place like this.

579
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,566
Why are you in place like

580
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:13,567
this?

581
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,732
You never said anything to me

582
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:19,132
about y-y-your parents in any of

583
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,566
your letters and what happened

584
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,067
to them.

585
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:22,966
What... what happened to them?

586
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,632
Don't know. Don't care.

587
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:25,600
They don't want me.

588
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,866
I don't want them. Okay?

589
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:27,933
Would you shut up?!

590
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,267
Dad, I want to go!

591
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:39,632
All right.

592
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:40,866
I've always liked the name.

593
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:41,700
"Mei Mei."

594
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:44,066
It's... it's good.

595
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:47,599
It's... it's a cute little name.

596
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,366
"Mei Mei" mean "little

597
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:50,100
sister."

598
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:52,099
Not even real name, you know.

599
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,532
I big now.

600
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,799
I can find a stronger name

601
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,866
myself.

602
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,132
"Mimi."

603
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,366
That's right.

604
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,132
"Mimi" is a bigger name.

605
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,066
I no more crying "little"

606
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:04,633
"sister," like that one.

607
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Hey, I told you... shut up!

608
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:10,567
No!

609
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:11,599
Hey, leave her alone, will

610
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:11,933
you?

611
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:12,933
Both of you, sit down!

612
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,767
Or what, bigmouth?

613
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,099
You two... outside, or the

614
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,867
visit's over.

615
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:16,767
Hey! Hands off!

616
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,099
She's just trying to help,

617
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
okay?

618
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,467
You don't like outside?

619
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,532
Children cry.

620
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,532
No one listens.

621
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:05,799
That father no good.

622
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,366
He no listen her cry.

623
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,167
Yeah.

624
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,266
Look.

625
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:22,100
Like your picture card.

626
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:33,233
Can I come tomorrow?

627
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,600
For the buses, okay?

628
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,766
A-and tell them my m.I.N.

629
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:03,266
Number, which is 256..

630
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:06,066
904.

631
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:07,966
Yeah.

632
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,767
Yeah.

633
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,232
Why... why you always go

634
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:16,033
first?

635
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,132
Hoo!

636
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:57,199
Well, they've already left

637
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
for Canberra, but they said

638
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:59,232
they'll be back on Sunday for

639
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,733
the Sydney concert, so...

640
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:11,366
Do you miss them?

641
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:12,766
Your friends?

642
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:15,966
Yeah?

643
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,632
Well, it can't be all that bad.

644
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,199
I mean, you like our beaches,

645
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,299
right?

646
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,632
Yes.

647
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:23,433
I've never been to beach before.

648
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:29,132
How old are you, Mimi?

649
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,933
I old enough.

650
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:34,699
You know, you shouldn't be so

651
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,099
trusting of everyone.

652
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,132
You shouldn't even trust me.

653
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:42,632
Who's coming in the water?

654
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:44,099
But definitely don't trust

655
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,867
these idiots.

656
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:47,133
You're going in the water!

657
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:48,867
No!

658
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:49,600
Water!

659
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,032
Put her down, Dave!

660
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:51,900
No! Carl!

661
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,232
Hey! Put her down!

662
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,266
Let me down!

663
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,100
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

664
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,567
Hoo!

665
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:58,566
All right.

666
00:43:58,567 --> 00:43:59,799
Come on. Open the door, babe.

667
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,966
Open the door. I got to pee.

668
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:01,900
Yeah, this is it.

669
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:03,799
This is our place.

670
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,767
Open the door, babe.

671
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,767
I'm going! I'm going!

672
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:06,733
Hurry! I got to pee!

673
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:07,899
Don't do it. Don't do it.

674
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,433
Shut up!

675
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:09,033
Let's go!

676
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:10,700
And we're home sweet ho...

677
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:13,533
easy.

678
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,532
That's Dave and Ruby's room.

679
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:17,700
And this...

680
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,599
this is our room.

681
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,467
Dave.

682
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,532
Or you can sleep on the

683
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:27,967
couch.

684
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:28,867
That's cool, too.

685
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:29,767
Wait a minute.

686
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:30,533
Wait a minute.

687
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,732
Get these out...

688
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:34,067
Dave's left his junk everywhere.

689
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:43,466
You can watch TV if you

690
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:43,900
want.

691
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:47,032
Got some videos and DVDs.

692
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:49,299
Ruby's?

693
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,133
No.

694
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:54,399
Actually... that's mine.

695
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,599
Y-you cook?

696
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,899
Yeah.

697
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,232
Yeah...

698
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:01,233
Yes.

699
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:19,199
"Hello, Mr. Randall."

00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:07,299
plate... I changed the plate.

876
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:07,900
No, no, no.

877
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,199
I come all the way down here to

878
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:09,867
help you out.

879
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:11,066
I don't want to touch stolen

880
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:11,467
cars...

881
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:12,100
no. Ruby, Ruby.

882
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,132
I don't want to touch them in

883
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,133
the first place.

884
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:19,567
Take a seat. Thanks.

885
00:53:25,933 --> 00:53:27,066
So, what was that all about?

886
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:27,867
What do you mean?

887
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:28,800
Parole hearings can be

888
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,233
quite...

889
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:29,900
no. Not that.

890
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,900
What was that crap about you

891
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,867
testifying against Tommy?

892
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:32,467
Don't worry.

893
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:33,367
It's not gonna happen.

894
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:34,399
Then why were they asking?

895
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,100
'Cause they...

896
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:36,432
Gary... Gary, you were an

897
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:37,233
asset in there.

898
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:38,699
Now the parole board knows that

899
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,066
your brother has somewhere to

900
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:41,566
stay and that someone's gonna be

901
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:43,399
looking after him.

902
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,099
Hey, any more news about the

903
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,232
immigration lawyer?

904
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:46,733
Yeah.

905
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:48,132
You can't sponsor her because

906
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:49,366
of your record, but he can

907
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:50,799
organize a visa for her and look

908
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,399
for a foster family.

909
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,067
All right.

910
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:54,067
But it's not cheap.

911
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,067
It's $2,000.

912
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,699
Shut up, will you? Shut up.

913
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,566
All right, well, tell him to do

914
00:53:59,567 --> 00:53:59,933
it.

915
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:01,866
He'd need an establishing fee

916
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:03,366
of $500.

917
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:05,766
That's okay.

918
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:06,966
And, as I said, you can't be

919
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:08,032
seen to be sponsoring her.

920
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:09,232
It would have to be anonymous.

921
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:11,866
Yeah, that's fine.

922
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:12,867
That's good.

923
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:14,599
Mrs. crenaugh, can you come

924
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,900
here for a moment?

925
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:22,099
Immigration?

926
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,967
The Chinese chick?

927
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,066
Listen, can you take

928
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:25,267
500 bucks out of my money?

929
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:27,233
Your money?

930
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:27,933
Yeah.

931
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,966
Mate, your money ran out six

932
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:30,867
months ago.

933
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:31,267
Why?

934
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,366
You keep stuffing up your

935
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:32,767
parole.

936
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:33,799
What are you talking...

937
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,866
there is no money there,

938
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:35,233
okay?

939
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:36,233
I am the one who has been

940
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:38,966
paying... overheads in here.

941
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:40,132
Yeah, but...

942
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:41,633
do you understand?

943
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:46,266
After all I've done for you.

944
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:47,432
What you've done for me?

945
00:54:47,433 --> 00:54:48,766
I took the rap for both of us,

946
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:49,133
okay?

947
00:54:49,134 --> 00:54:50,466
I'm the one keeping you alive

948
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:53,533
in here.

949
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:56,932
It's 500 bucks.

950
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:58,733
Can you do it or not?

951
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,032
Not if I have to pay Tommy,

952
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:02,433
as well.

953
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,400
Don't worry about that.

954
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,133
I'll sort that out.

955
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,266
Just make sure you get the money

956
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:07,632
to her.

957
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,232
You are lucky fletch has got

958
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:10,367
a big job coming up.

959
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,699
W-why are you still doing stuff

960
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,300
with him?

961
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,233
You're an idiot.

962
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:15,799
Where do you think I'm gonna

963
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,866
get the money from?

964
00:55:16,867 --> 00:55:18,033
Jesus, Dean, grow up.

965
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,000
You can come in now.

966
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,132
Thank you for waiting,

967
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:34,967
Mr. Randall.

968
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,299
The board has reached a

969
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,466
decision.

970
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:39,699
Parole is granted.

971
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,432
You'll be released two weeks

972
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:43,267
from today.

973
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,366
Well, I'll tell you what I am

974
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,067
concerned about.

975
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:48,099
I'm concerned about fletch

976
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,232
taking more money than we've

977
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:49,800
agreed upon.

978
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:50,899
You're the one on the phone

979
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,600
talking to him.

980
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:52,799
If the phone's tapped, it won't

981
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,567
be m going down.

982
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:54,133
It'll be you.

983
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:54,900
I know, Tommy.

984
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:56,066
So this is your problem...

985
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:56,900
Not min all right?

986
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,533
All right.

987
00:55:57,534 --> 00:55:59,333
Tommy?

988
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,900
Tommy?

989
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,599
Yes, Dean?

990
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,066
Man, I have to be a bit late

991
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,466
with the next cashish, I think.

992
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:15,366
Maybe... tuesday, if that's all

993
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:17,799
right?

994
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,066
Is he for real?

995
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:20,867
I mean, are you for real?

996
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,432
I just heard you're getting out

997
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:26,133
soon, Dean.

998
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:27,799
And now you're trying to wiggle

999
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,132
out of your last payment.

1000
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,933
Don't do it.

1001
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,667
Toddle off, Dean. Away you go.

1002
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,400
For the beamer.

1003
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:06,233
Thanks.

1004
00:57:06,234 --> 00:57:07,766
You good for Tuesday night?

1005
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:08,866
Yeah. What is it?

1006
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:10,566
Two this time.

1007
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:11,300
Sweet.

1008
00:57:11,301 --> 00:57:12,732
How's your brother?

1009
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,266
Yeah, he... good. Good.

1010
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:16,099
Gets out in a couple weeks.

1011
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,299
Fast pair of hands, your

1012
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:17,800
brother.

1013
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,399
Business expanding... be a real

1014
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,299
asset.

1015
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,600
I'll tell him you said hi.

1016
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,766
Don't take all bloody day on

1017
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:30,700
that thing.

1018
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,066
Okay, Mr. fletch.

1019
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:33,867
We do quick.

1020
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:41,467
Hey.

1021
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Sorry.

1022
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,266
Thank you.

1023
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:51,599
Is that your daughter?

1024
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,900
Yeah, that's right.

1025
00:57:57,433 --> 00:58:00,232
I've...

1026
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:04,599
Got the...$500.

1027
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,732
Terrific.

1028
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,532
Thank you. I'll pass that on.

1029
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:09,066
Count it if you want.

1030
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:10,366
No, that's okay.

1031
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:11,467
Thanks.

1032
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,766
You all right?

1033
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:16,966
Yep. Good night.

1034
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,767
'Night.

1035
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:34,633
Hello-o-o-o-o.

1036
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:40,367
All right.

1037
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:44,632
Hey.

1038
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:45,932
Hi.

1039
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:47,399
Come up.

1040
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,532
N-no.

1041
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:49,732
Come on, Mimi.

1042
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:51,132
Got to learn to ride sooner or

1043
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:53,399
later.

1044
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,267
Hop up.

1045
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,966
Right.

1046
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,699
What you want to do is put both

1047
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,966
your hands on the handlebars.

1048
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:05,399
Yep? All right.

1049
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,366
And what you got to do is when I

1050
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,599
turn, you lean.

1051
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:09,967
Okay?

1052
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:10,433
Okay.

1053
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:11,067
All right.

1054
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:13,899
So when I turn, you lean.

1055
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Ready?

1056
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,299
Lean.

1057
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:17,800
Nice.

1058
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:19,299
All right. Gonna go left.

1059
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,300
Ready?

1060
00:59:20,633 --> 00:59:21,966
Lean.

1061
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:22,967
Good!

1062
00:59:22,968 --> 00:59:24,367
And turn...

1063
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,199
got to lean a little bit.

1064
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,000
Okay?

1065
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,100
Aa-aa-aa!

1066
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,566
Is she okay?

1067
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:49,632
Yeah.

1068
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:52,066
Nice work, Carl.

1069
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:54,132
Paint job's not bad, either.

1070
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,866
All right, kiddies, it's just

1071
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:56,800
like Christmas.

1072
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,199
Hey!

1073
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,400
Pizza!

1074
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:01,867
There you go.

1075
01:00:01,867 --> 01:00:02,567
Thank you, fletch.

1076
01:00:02,568 --> 01:00:05,567
Now, Ruby.

1077
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:06,767
Dave.

1078
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:07,767
Thanks, mate.

1079
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:10,967
And Mimi.

1080
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,200
No, no, no.

1081
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:21,867
You keep that.

1082
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:22,467
That's yours.

1083
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:26,699
But... look.

1084
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,232
That's a lot of money,

1085
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:28,900
Mei Mei.

1086
01:00:28,901 --> 01:00:30,366
Who are you working for?

1087
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:32,132
Rich man. Nice.

1088
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,299
Lots of cars.

1089
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,066
He take our business.

1090
01:00:35,067 --> 01:00:37,432
What kind of business is it?

1091
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,566
Is it legit?

1092
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,699
Put that away, will you?

1093
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,799
Is it legal?

1094
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,566
I work hard.

1095
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:46,399
Money's for us.

1096
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,566
I not break a law.

1097
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:49,132
Yeah, how do you know?

1098
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:49,867
You sure?

1099
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:51,532
Put it away!

1100
01:00:51,533 --> 01:00:52,699
You not believe me.

1101
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,266
Well, just seems a bit suss,

1102
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:55,299
that kind of money.

1103
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,599
Why you no believe me?

1104
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,132
I always tell you everything in

1105
01:00:58,133 --> 01:00:58,733
letters.

1106
01:00:58,734 --> 01:01:00,866
No lie. Always tell truths.

1107
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:01,733
But you?

1108
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,966
Picture cards all wrong... no.

1109
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:06,732
Mrs. Jenny, no Megan, no Aiden.

1110
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:07,367
And here?

1111
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:08,799
You don't tell me why you're

1112
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,233
here.

1113
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:09,633
Why?

1114
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:10,799
You want to know why I'm

1115
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,200
here?

1116
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:12,232
You want me to tell you?

1117
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:14,200
Because I killed someone, okay?

1118
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:25,799
Now, all we had to do was burn

1119
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,866
down a print shop, and we were

1120
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:27,767
gonna make a lot of money.

1121
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,633
That's what Gary's mate

1122
01:01:28,634 --> 01:01:29,900
reckoned.

1123
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:33,733
I'm sorry.

1124
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:37,433
You know, the whole time, I

1125
01:01:37,434 --> 01:01:39,767
had a bad feeling about it.

1126
01:01:41,533 --> 01:01:43,232
But I just wanted that money.

1127
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,399
So, you know, I just pretended

1128
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,333
everything was all right.

1129
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,399
There wasn't gonna be anyone

1130
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,700
in that building, they reckoned.

1131
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:02,933
Mr. Randall.

1132
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:06,199
He died, Mei Mei, that old

1133
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,532
man.

1134
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:12,100
It was my fault.

1135
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:21,699
Yes.

1136
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,433
But you have paid.

1137
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:30,466
I don't know about that.

1138
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,732
And you have give me a good

1139
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:34,533
life.

1140
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,099
Well, you've got to live a

1141
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,132
good life.

1142
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:42,532
And not be doing things that

1143
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:43,467
make you feel bad.

1144
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,399
I don't feel bad.

1145
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,966
Look, Mrs. crenaugh's gonna

1146
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,399
try and help you, okay?

1147
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,199
It's complicated, but s-she's

1148
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,066
gonna try and find you a family,

1149
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:54,732
and we're gonna take care of

1150
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:55,200
you.

1151
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
A family?

1152
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:56,967
Yeah.

1153
01:02:56,968 --> 01:03:00,599
But... you are my family.

1154
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,699
You don't want me?

1155
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,232
No, no, no. It's not that.

1156
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:06,532
You see, legally, I...

1157
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:07,799
What I'm trying to say is,

1158
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,232
you're gonna be taken care of.

1159
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:09,867
All right?

1160
01:03:09,868 --> 01:03:11,199
When I get out of here, I'm

1161
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,366
gonna come and see you.

1162
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:12,933
All right?

1163
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:14,466
I'm gonna get out of here in two

1164
01:03:14,467 --> 01:03:15,932
weeks.

1165
01:03:15,933 --> 01:03:17,966
Two weeks?

1166
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:19,367
Yep.

1167
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:24,566
So happy!

1168
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,132
I will go to work.

1169
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:27,366
You will see.

1170
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:28,899
I can make money.

1171
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,299
I will help you.

1172
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,500
In two weeks, you will see.

1173
01:03:46,467 --> 01:03:47,866
That... t-that's him!

1174
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,199
Yes! That's him!

1175
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:49,967
That's him!

1176
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:50,567
Nope.

1177
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:52,032
Can't you help us out?

1178
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:53,432
You have to calm down.

1179
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,266
Hey, Gary.

1180
01:03:55,267 --> 01:03:58,366
So, my place, 8:00, yeah?

1181
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,432
Two items.

1182
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:01,566
Two different locations.

1183
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:03,599
Yeah. Right.

1184
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,232
Done.

1185
01:04:07,233 --> 01:04:10,866
Dad, I want to do one.

1186
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:12,667
Seriously?

1187
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,099
You reckon you're up to it?

1188
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,699
I'm not doing it for free,

1189
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,299
though.

1190
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,766
Exploiting your old man, are

1191
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:25,767
you?

1192
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:26,800
Don't worry, kid.

1193
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,432
You'll get your cut, you do a

1194
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:29,732
good job.

1195
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,767
You saving up for a new bike?

1196
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,200
No.

1197
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:37,632
I'm gonna go do that... that

1198
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:39,500
course I was telling you about.

1199
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:43,066
Did you get the money to my

1200
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:43,900
welfare officer?

1201
01:04:43,901 --> 01:04:45,399
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She got it.

1202
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,866
How'd you go with the... The

1203
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:47,567
other thing?

1204
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:48,467
You know... Tommy?

1205
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,433
Good. Yeah.

1206
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:50,766
Spoke to him, and, you know,

1207
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:51,367
it's fine.

1208
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:52,033
He'll wait.

1209
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:52,767
All right.

1210
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:54,099
Well, I don't... I don't

1211
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,599
think you'll have to wait long.

1212
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,732
Got a big job tonight.

1213
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:58,066
I don't want to know about

1214
01:04:58,067 --> 01:04:58,400
it.

1215
01:04:58,401 --> 01:04:59,766
Thought you were all right

1216
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:00,633
with fletch now.

1217
01:05:00,634 --> 01:05:02,032
Why would you think that?

1218
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:03,399
Well, the Chinese chick...

1219
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,866
Didn't you set her up with him?

1220
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,099
What are you talking about?

1221
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,266
Yeah, well, that's where

1222
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:08,599
she's working... helping fletch

1223
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,566
with the cars.

1224
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:13,767
All right. Got to go.

1225
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:26,267
Here you go.

1226
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:30,267
What's the urgency?

1227
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:39,200
I want to testify.

1228
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,932
Against Tommy fields?

1229
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:45,932
Yep.

1230
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:47,199
Good.

1231
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,799
That's good.

1232
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,966
Why did you change your

1233
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:51,633
mind?

1234
01:05:51,634 --> 01:05:54,099
What difference does it make?

1235
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,366
I mean, that's what you want,

1236
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:57,267
isn't it?

1237
01:05:57,268 --> 01:05:58,932
Well...

1238
01:05:58,933 --> 01:05:59,933
I'm glad.

1239
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:01,132
I'll... I'll let the

1240
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,100
deputy director know.

1241
01:06:02,101 --> 01:06:03,366
The thing is, I-i have to

1242
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:06,732
get out today, okay?

1243
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:08,099
I don't think that

1244
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,067
that's possible.

1245
01:06:09,067 --> 01:06:09,933
Come on.

1246
01:06:09,934 --> 01:06:11,599
I mean, he can make it happen

1247
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,367
if he wants.

1248
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,899
You people are doing deals all

1249
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,900
the time, right?

1250
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:17,500
Okay. I'll try.

1251
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,500
I am here to help you.

1252
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,233
Nice!

1253
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:43,200
All right, wait.

1254
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:44,932
If you lift up the black thingy

1255
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:46,099
and then scrub right

1256
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,933
underneath...

1257
01:06:46,933 --> 01:06:47,533
hey.

1258
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:48,067
Hey.

1259
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:49,632
Mimi, want to come on a

1260
01:06:49,633 --> 01:06:51,066
joyride with us tonight?

1261
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:52,300
Joyride?

1262
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,199
This will be fun.

1263
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,732
Okay.

1264
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:58,533
Good girl.

1265
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,232
I want you to check through

1266
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,466
the transcript of your statement

1267
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:11,732
for accuracy.

1268
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:13,099
My client will need a

1269
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,599
decree of protection before he's

1270
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,200
released.

1271
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:16,466
You did the right thing.

1272
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:17,632
Thank you, Mr. Randall.

1273
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,600
I didn't do it for you, mate.

1274
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:24,599
Well, I didn't.

1275
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,932
Bring it back.

1276
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:27,199
Got you covered.

1277
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,299
No, you've got to get over it

1278
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,632
and like that.

1279
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:31,200
See?

1280
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,033
Tommy.

1281
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:34,000
You-know-who has been talking.

1282
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,700
Open up!

1283
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,067
Open up, will you?!

1284
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,900
Hurry up!

1285
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,600
Paperwork?

1286
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,233
Here.

1287
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:47,866
I'll be seeing you later,

1288
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:48,899
Randall.

1289
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,700
Did you hear that?

1290
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,699
Mimi?

1291
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,866
What is she doing here?

1292
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:06,366
We get her hands dirty, she's

1293
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:07,267
part of the team.

1294
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,799
She's part of us. Understand?

1295
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,199
This was not part of our

1296
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,867
deal, dad!

1297
01:09:10,868 --> 01:09:13,066
Deal?

1298
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,099
Which particular position are

1299
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,899
you deali from, Carl?

1300
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,366
You wanted to come.

1301
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,200
You're in or you're out.

1302
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,100
Uncle Gary!

1303
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:45,099
What's going on?

1304
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,232
You know her?

1305
01:09:46,233 --> 01:09:47,932
How you do, uncle Gary?

1306
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,766
That's... that's Dean's

1307
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:50,267
kid.

1308
01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:52,032
The... the kid he sponsors.

1309
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:53,232
You knew this?

1310
01:09:53,233 --> 01:09:54,566
What's going on?

1311
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:56,032
What's she doing here?

1312
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:59,732
Let's go.

1313
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:01,066
You all right?

1314
01:10:01,067 --> 01:10:02,900
Yes.

1315
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,033
Well... good luck.

1316
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,233
Okay.

1317
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:29,366
Who wants to do the honors?

1318
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:29,933
Here, I'll...

1319
01:11:29,934 --> 01:11:32,099
I'll do it.

1320
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,532
You up for it?

1321
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:34,599
Come on.

1322
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,500
No, it'll be all right.

1323
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:48,866
Carl, what's this?

1324
01:11:48,867 --> 01:11:50,266
You... what are you doing?

1325
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:51,866
It's got nothing to do with

1326
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:53,533
you, Mimi.

1327
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:58,899
You want to steal that car?

1328
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,733
It'll be okay.

1329
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:00,100
No.

1330
01:12:00,101 --> 01:12:01,132
It'll be all right.

1331
01:12:01,133 --> 01:12:01,933
That's wrong.

1332
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:02,867
You no can do that.

1333
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:03,899
That is... this is bad.

1334
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,032
Hey, Mimi. Mimi.

1335
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,766
Shut up and let him do his work,

1336
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:07,267
yeah?

1337
01:12:07,268 --> 01:12:08,432
No, that's wrong!

1338
01:12:08,433 --> 01:12:09,532
It'll be okay!

1339
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:10,632
It'll be all right!

1340
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:13,966
Shut up!

1341
01:12:13,967 --> 01:12:14,633
You gonna do it?

1342
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:15,367
Mate, come on.

1343
01:12:15,367 --> 01:12:16,300
Let's just call this off.

1344
01:12:16,301 --> 01:12:17,366
We should not have brought the

1345
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:17,733
kids.

1346
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:18,799
Hey, there's nothing wrong

1347
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,567
with my kid, mate.

1348
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,367
Just leave it.

1349
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,766
You will be like Mr. Randall.

1350
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:28,633
You will be inside...

1351
01:12:28,634 --> 01:12:31,100
you don't understand!

1352
01:12:33,067 --> 01:12:34,432
Just stay in the Van.

1353
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,100
Don't go.

1354
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,900
Are you gonna do it?

1355
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:39,933
Yeah.

1356
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:41,466
No! Don't!

1357
01:12:41,467 --> 01:12:43,299
Don't!

1358
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,100
Stay in the Van.

1359
01:13:29,933 --> 01:13:31,633
This feel no good.

1360
01:13:33,767 --> 01:13:35,066
No good?

1361
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:36,699
"Feel no good"?

1362
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,399
Come on.

1363
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,766
What's that supposed to

1364
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:40,767
mean... "no good"?

1365
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:42,567
You bad father!

1366
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,232
Come on, mate.

1367
01:13:46,233 --> 01:13:47,266
Seriously, mate.

1368
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:47,867
Fletch!

1369
01:13:47,868 --> 01:13:48,966
I said shut up!

1370
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:49,733
Come here!

1371
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:50,733
Just had it!

1372
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,800
Uncle Gary!

1373
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,299
Right! Come here! Come on!

1374
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:53,967
No! No!

1375
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:54,700
Uncle Gary!

1376
01:13:54,701 --> 01:13:56,066
I told you to shut up in

1377
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:56,567
there!

1378
01:13:56,568 --> 01:13:58,532
No!

1379
01:13:58,533 --> 01:13:59,799
In the back! Go on.

1380
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,933
No, no.

1381
01:14:02,467 --> 01:14:03,732
Stay there!

1382
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:05,532
Get in! Get in the back!

1383
01:14:05,533 --> 01:14:06,533
Stay there!

1384
01:14:06,534 --> 01:14:07,699
Uncle Gary!

1385
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,700
Shut up!

1386
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:09,867
Uncle Gary!

1387
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:32,100
Uncle Gary, you help me!

1388
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:41,567
Mr. fletch! This is wrong!

1389
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,300
Get me out!

1390
01:14:47,301 --> 01:14:48,632
Hey! I'll punch your lights

1391
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:49,799
out if you don't shut up.

1392
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,733
Just ignore her.

1393
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:51,633
Blue beamer, right?

1394
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:52,799
Yeah... the automatic.

1395
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,033
Get on with it.

1396
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,966
Dave?

1397
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:27,099
Where's Mei Mei?

1398
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,132
Who the hell are you?

1399
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:29,067
I'm Gary's brother.

1400
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:29,733
Where is she?

1401
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:30,899
She's with my

1402
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,767
dad at the car yard.

1403
01:15:31,768 --> 01:15:33,032
Okay, well, you got to take

1404
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:33,533
me there.

1405
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:34,766
I can't, man. The car's hot.

1406
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:35,533
I don't care!

1407
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:37,833
She's in trouble, all right?!

1408
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,367
Come on!

1409
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,032
That should be down in the

1410
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:28,700
garage!

1411
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,300
Dean.

1412
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:30,366
Where is she?

1413
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:31,932
I don't know what you're

1414
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:32,900
talking about.

1415
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:34,400
I'm here!

1416
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,267
Where is she?!

1417
01:16:36,268 --> 01:16:37,399
What are you doing?!

1418
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,732
Just tell me where she is!

1419
01:16:38,733 --> 01:16:39,766
You'll bloody ruin

1420
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:40,400
everything!

1421
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,133
I don't know!

1422
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:42,133
I told your brother!

1423
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:43,067
Come on, fletch!

1424
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:44,199
I don't want to hear...

1425
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:44,733
Gary!

1426
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:45,300
Hey, Gary!

1427
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:46,932
Bring it back in now!

1428
01:16:46,933 --> 01:16:48,599
I just want Mei Mei!

1429
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,299
You're gonna ruin it!

1430
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,432
Where are you?!

1431
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:54,099
Security 1 to base.

1432
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,566
I need the police.

1433
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:57,233
Roger that, security 1.

1434
01:16:57,633 --> 01:16:58,799
Dad! Dad, get off of him!

1435
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,600
Where is Mei Mei?!

1436
01:16:59,601 --> 01:17:00,799
You shouldn't have brought

1437
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,800
him here!

1438
01:17:02,233 --> 01:17:03,432
You're gonna bugger everything

1439
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:04,699
up as usual, you bloody idiot!

1440
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,132
No!

1441
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:08,532
No! I'm here!

1442
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:10,866
Mei Mei?

1443
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,199
Mei Mei?!

1444
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,232
Where is Mei Mei?

1445
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:14,366
Mei Mei, just wait!

1446
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,267
I'll get you out!

1447
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:16,932
Mr. Randall!

1448
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:18,366
Dad! Dad!

1449
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:18,933
Dad!

1450
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,633
Stop! Let her go!

1451
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,199
Just wait, Mei Mei.

1452
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,867
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1453
01:17:26,867 --> 01:17:27,467
Let go of me!

1454
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:29,033
Stop!

1455
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:30,633
All right, it's over!

1456
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:31,867
Just stop!

1457
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:34,133
Let go of me!

1458
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:35,567
It's over!

1459
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,300
You're an idiot!

1460
01:17:42,067 --> 01:17:44,066
Hey!

1461
01:17:44,067 --> 01:17:45,932
Hands behind your back.

1462
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,367
All right.

1463
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,799
Run!

1464
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,300
Go!

1465
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,200
No!

1466
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
Stop! Not him!

1467
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,067
Stop! Stop!

1468
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:03,766
All right, hands behind your

1469
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:04,300
back.

1470
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:05,632
You're under arrest.

1471
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:07,833
No!

1472
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:40,232
Stealing cars?

1473
01:18:40,233 --> 01:18:41,233
I didn't steal anything.

1474
01:18:41,234 --> 01:18:42,299
I got you out of here this

1475
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,233
morning, and now you are

1476
01:18:43,233 --> 01:18:44,100
straight back in here!

1477
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,033
You don't understand.

1478
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:45,900
Mei Mei was in trouble.

1479
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:47,732
I was just trying to help her!

1480
01:18:47,733 --> 01:18:49,467
This is so disappointing.

1481
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,066
Do you realize that the lawyer

1482
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:53,532
has almost finalized Mei Mei's

1483
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:54,367
temporary visa?

1484
01:18:54,367 --> 01:18:55,233
Where is she?

1485
01:18:55,234 --> 01:18:56,732
Is she here?

1486
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,400
No!

1487
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,632
She is locked up, thanks to you.

1488
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:01,199
But that's all right.

1489
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,766
We can sort that out.

1490
01:19:02,767 --> 01:19:03,932
We'll find her a foster family,

1491
01:19:03,933 --> 01:19:05,032
andcan look after her until

1492
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:05,400
then.

1493
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,233
Is she all right?

1494
01:19:06,234 --> 01:19:07,866
Can I see her?

1495
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:09,366
She can't have anything more

1496
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:10,133
to do with you.

1497
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:10,800
Why not?

1498
01:19:10,801 --> 01:19:12,700
Or with this place.

1499
01:19:15,233 --> 01:19:17,232
Do something right for once and

1500
01:19:17,233 --> 01:19:20,532
let her go.

1501
01:19:20,533 --> 01:19:22,232
What she needs now is a nice

1502
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:24,066
home and a responsible guardian

1503
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:25,866
and someone with financial and

1504
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:26,966
social stability.

1505
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:29,132
And that's you, is it?

1506
01:19:29,133 --> 01:19:32,299
You don't even know her!

1507
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,399
But what I know is that she

1508
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,067
needs help.

1509
01:19:53,267 --> 01:19:56,266
"Mr. Randall, I tell you"

1510
01:19:56,267 --> 01:19:57,866
everything...

1511
01:19:57,867 --> 01:20:00,466
Things I no tell others.

1512
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:03,132
You always there... hear my

1513
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:04,700
"words."

1514
01:22:41,967 --> 01:22:43,466
She was brought in last

1515
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:43,933
night.

1516
01:22:43,934 --> 01:22:45,366
I have authority to take her

1517
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:46,100
into my care.

1518
01:22:46,101 --> 01:22:48,099
Mei Mei.

1519
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,366
I have an interim order here

1520
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:50,532
granting Mei Mei temporary

1521
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:52,432
protection status.

1522
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,466
Mei Mei, this is what you want.

1523
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,532
You can stay here in Australia.

1524
01:22:56,533 --> 01:22:58,432
You can stay with me while we

1525
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,733
find you a foster family.

1526
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:11,732
I go back to China.

1527
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:12,799
But...

1528
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,132
No, but, Mei Mei, you can stay

1529
01:23:15,133 --> 01:23:15,800
here.

1530
01:23:15,801 --> 01:23:17,866
You can start a whole new

1531
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,932
life... a nice house, good

1532
01:23:19,933 --> 01:23:20,733
school.

1533
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:22,400
No.

1534
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,367
Thank you.

1535
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:12,799
* happiness is just a little

1536
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,599

1537

* shrink yourself, and maybe

1542
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,299
then you'll fit *

1543
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:55,466

1546
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,099
Always you appear real to me.

1547
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,766
Please stay real.

1548
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:57,566
Please.

1549
01:26:57,567 --> 01:26:58,567
For me.

1550
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,600
Please.

1551
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,099
Thank you.

1552
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,900
Thank you.

1553
01:27:33,233 --> 01:27:34,632
D-don't move.

1554
01:27:34,633 --> 01:27:38,532
You're hurt... hurt bad.

1555
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:41,767
You need to rest, Mr. Randall.

1556
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:54,932
I'm sorry, Mr. Randall, but I

1557
01:27:54,933 --> 01:27:56,767
have something to tell you.

1558
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,033
Children need me...

1559
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:05,833
and I miss them.

1560
01:28:13,633 --> 01:28:16,299
So you...

1561
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,399
You won't be here?

1562
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,899
Yes. I will.

1563
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,732
In letters.

1564
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:25,866
And you will be with me, like

1565
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:27,732
before...

1566
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:31,066
But different.

1567
01:28:31,067 --> 01:28:32,867
Different.

1568
01:28:36,933 --> 01:28:38,567
Real?

1569
01:28:46,733 --> 01:28:48,933
I have a name for you.

1570
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,632
May.

1571
01:28:56,633 --> 01:28:58,099
Mei?

1572
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,567
That... that already my name.

1573
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:10,532
May... may's spring in China.

1574
01:29:10,533 --> 01:29:15,199
And Autumn... here, it's Autumn.

1575
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,699
So...

1576
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,032
So you can be "may" in both

1577
01:29:19,033 --> 01:29:22,299
places.

1578
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,100
It's a real name.

1579
01:29:26,467 --> 01:29:28,667
It's a big girl's name.

1580
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:36,132
But, you know, in China, only

1581
01:29:36,133 --> 01:29:40,600
parents can give name to child.

1582
01:29:44,233 --> 01:29:46,033
May.

1583
01:30:17,633 --> 01:30:21,232
How are you feeling?

1584
01:30:21,233 --> 01:30:23,532
Yeah, I'm all right.

1585
01:30:23,533 --> 01:30:25,300
Where are you going?

1586
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:27,299
To speak to the deputy director.

1587
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,566
You don't need to speak

1588
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:29,567
to the deputy director.

1589
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:30,233
Yes, I do.

1590
01:30:30,234 --> 01:30:31,432
We had a deal, and he didn't

1591
01:30:31,433 --> 01:30:32,100
live up to it.

1592
01:30:32,101 --> 01:30:33,899
You didn't let me finish.

1593
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,266
I've made all the arrangements.

1594
01:30:35,267 --> 01:30:36,566
They realize that they can't

1595
01:30:36,567 --> 01:30:38,799
fight any lawsuit you'd bring,

1596
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,600
so you're free to go.

1597
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:52,633
And joining the

1598
01:30:52,634 --> 01:30:54,066
Sydney children's choir today

1599
01:30:54,067 --> 01:30:56,099
is the dong ying choir.

1600
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,132
Put your hands together and

1601
01:30:57,133 --> 01:30:59,766
give them a warm welcome.

1602
01:30:59,767 --> 01:31:01,399
This is the final performance of

1603
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,700
their Australian tour.

1604
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:42,766
* it's because I love you

1605
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:46,732
* not because we're far apart

1606
01:32:46,733 --> 01:32:49,799
* it's because I love you

1607
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,532
* and because you're near my

1608
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:54,432
heart *

1609
01:32:54,433 --> 01:32:57,732
* oo-oo-oo-

1610
01:32:57,733 --> 01:32:59,366
* do what you wanna do

1611
01:32:59,367 --> 01:33:02,966
* be what you wanna be, yeah

1612
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:04,132
* do what you wanna do

1613
01:33:04,133 --> 01:33:07,266
* ooooooooooh

1614
01:33:07,267 --> 01:33:08,799

1615
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,299
* be what you wanna be, yeah

1616
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,599
* be what you wanna be

1617
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,732
* ooooooooooh

1618
01:33:16,733 --> 01:33:18,266
* do what you wanna do

1619
01:33:18,267 --> 01:33:22,399
* be what you wanna be, yeah

1620
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,799
"dear Mr. Randall..."

1621
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,232
Two new little Mei meis come

1622
01:33:27,233 --> 01:33:29,599
stay in orphanage last week.

1623
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,299
I teach them sing.

1624
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,632
Their voices are small, but

1625
01:33:33,633 --> 01:33:36,199
will be stronger next year for

1626
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,866
when you come to see us.

1627
01:33:38,867 --> 01:33:40,667
Love, may.

1628
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:48,699
* ooooooooooh

1629
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:50,232
* do what you wanna do

1630
01:33:50,233 --> 01:33:53,966
* be what you wanna be, yeah

1631
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:55,299
* do what you wanna do

1632
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:58,066
* ooooooooooh

1633
01:33:58,067 --> 01:33:59,699
* do what you wanna do

1634
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,266
* be what you wanna be,

1635
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:05,867
ye-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-a-a-a-*
