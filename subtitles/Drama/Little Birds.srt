You're like a fucking tornado, kid.
You know that'?

There's my poor little cousin.
You're late.

Did you get my cigs'?
Yeah.

God, I really can't
do anything right today.

22

Well, I don't want him ending
up with shaken kid syndrome.

23
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,943
I might be
doing him a favor.

You want this'?
Hmm?

Yeah, yum.

Hogan says the fish
don't die from pollution,

38
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:31,529
because when the algae blooms,
it sucks up all the oxygen.

And then the fish suffocate.

That's boring.

Oh, how is your dad'?
Oh, he's good.

Are they up your ass'?

And you're surely
not talking to me.

Did what, Mother'?
You know what.

I'm sorry, Mother,
but I surely don't.

Why did you
out your leg'?

90
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,924
I was shaving.

91
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,162
I guess I'm just
not that good at it yet.

Can you give me some space to
fucking pee by myself, please?

You know, stop saying the word
"fuck" so much. You sound--

Well, then will you
give me some privacy, Mom'?

What makes you think
you're being punished?

109

I'm here, aren't I'?

110
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,844
Well, what would
you rather be doing

instead of sitting
here with me'?

112

I don't know. Shooting
myself in the face'?

Ifs funny how you often
mention hurting yourself.

Thanks. I thought
I was funny, too.

116

No, I guess I meant ironic.

Does she have a boyfriend?

I'm trying to help, Lily.

Why do you think
you cut your legs?

124

Why don't you
just out it off'?

125

Cut what out'?
Cut it off.

126

Off'? Yeah, the
hair on your face.

I feel like I'm gonna barf'?

think it's really starting to help.

I don't know.

was talking about.

Hey! Cut the shit!
It ain't yours.

So, it ain't yours neither, and
I hope it bites your face off.

They took Mark

Probably going to parade him
around the neighborhood.

150
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,195
Our son, the war hero.

151
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,502
He is a war hero.

152
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,404
Great.

153
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:54,409
Give me his medal in one
hand and shit in the other.

See what I got.
Fuck.

155

That whole table there is 40
percent off for just today.

Till death
do you part, right'?

00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:11,755
Mark died the day some sand nigger
buried an IED in a garbage can.

00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,993
I don't know what that is,
but ifs not my husband.

161
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:30,738
Did you get
lipstick all over me'?

162
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,838
<i>(Margaret)
Look, it's the Bobbsey Twins.</i>

163
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,214
<i>(Bonnie) Aw, they're like
a little cartoon duo.</i>

164
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,275
Lily and Ali and the case
of the haunted mansion.

165
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,617
She doesn't want
to be called Ali anymore.

166
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:40,781
What does
she wanna be called?

167
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,085
Alison.

168
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:44,353
Oh, excuse me.

169
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,725
Lily and Alison in the case
of the haunted mansion.

170
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:50,095
Jesus Christ. Come sit
next to your old mom.

171
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,963
I've got
a mystery for you.

172
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,003
Who's shit-faced at two
o'clock in the afternoon?

173
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,005
Guilty as charged, Scooby Doo.
That's right. Yeah!

174
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,270
You look cute. Maybe you should do
something with this hair, though.

175
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,439
Like put a deep conditioner
on it or something.

176
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,575
Wow. You know what'? You should do
something with your face, okay'?

177
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,448
That's not nice.
Can we dress up'?

178
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,579
<i>No, l have to sell this stuff.
Why?</i>

179
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,645
You can use
the things over there.

180
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,589
No, I wanna
use this stuff.

181
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,251
Don't use
the feather thing.

182
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:21,422
Why? it's the best one.

183
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:24,432
<i>Can I wear the skirt at least'?
(Margaret) Yeah.</i>

184
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,627
<i>(Bonnie) At least that one
picked something normal.</i>

185
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,399
Look, I want to look
like a fuzzy alien.

186

At your service,

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,351
Lily! Lily!

191
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,416
My fearless queen,
don't you dare!

192
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,226
I'm going to push you
in the water.

193
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,027
Yes! Yes!

194
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:35,059
No! No! No!
I'm melting.

195
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,073
Oh no! Don't die.

196
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,608
Ifs too late.

197
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,240
Here. Don't you
ever forget me.

198
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,977
<i>Then, I'll put one on.</i>

199
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,697
What's that sound?

200
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:06,666
I don't know.

201
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,967
Let's investigate.

202
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:11,792
My queen, you are alive! Shh!

203
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,661
You look stupid.

204
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:35,722
You guys want some beers'?

205
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,524
Sure.

206
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:42,427
Climb over then.

<i>(Jesse) What, are you,
like a raver or something?</i>

209
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,573
What's that'?

210
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:36,751
Somebody who
dresses all crazy.

211
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,310
No, it was just
this stupid thing.

212
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,155
I like your boots.
Yeah?

213
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:51,895
Yeah, I think they're cool.
Thanks.

214
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:11,014
You know, you can't find empty
pools like this in L.A. no more.

215
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:14,454
We heard about this spot
and drove all the way out.

216
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:18,392
But your town
smells like shit.

217
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:23,523
Ifs the salt influx from the
sewage and irrigation runoff.

218
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:26,765
Are you a scientist?

219
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,171
No.

220
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:43,418
See all this white stuff'?
The sand'?

221
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:48,355
It's not really sand. it's
dead fish and bird bones.

222
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,255
Cool.

223
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:54,057
Yeah.

224
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,028
So, you have
a boyfriend?

225
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,132
[hunk]

226
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:05,036
Jesse, let's
fucking go!

00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,570
[honking]

228
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,839
You cold?

229
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,223
<i>(Jesse's friend) What the fuck?
Let's go.</i>

230
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,988
Thanks.

231
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,060
Sorry.

232
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,274
If you're ever in L.A.

233
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,210
Sorry.

234
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:26,013
Bye, Lily.

235
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:26,952
Bye.

236
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:35,495
Woo!

237
00:27:57,007 --> 00:28:00,250
Where'd you go?

238
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,586
Didn't think
you'd notice I'd left.

239
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:06,788
What's up your ass'?

240
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,828
Nothing.

241
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:15,132
I kissed that boy.

242
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:17,103
Yeah?
Yeah.

243
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,037
I bet he's kissed
lots of other girls.

244
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,344
Maybe.

245
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:35,414
We're gonna
hang out in L.A.

246
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,787
How are you
getting there'?

247
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,224
I don't know.

248
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:50,366
You can come along
if you want.

249
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,676
Maybe.

250
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,590
Hey, Tiger Lily.

251
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,433
I know you're awake.

252
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:33,438
Why do you always
have to touch me'?

253
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:35,108
Because I didn't
get to hold you

254
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:39,780
for that whole
first month you were born.

255
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:45,885
You were stuck
in the incubator.

256
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,156
Your dad said that
you looked like

257
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:52,530
a little chicken who came
out of the oven too early.

258
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:01,632
Mom.

259
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:05,812
Please, Mom.

260
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:48,289
Lily, what are
you doing here?

261
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:51,519
I figured it out. We're gonna
take Hogan's truck to L.A.

262
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:55,962
No way. He's never gonna notice. It
just, like, sits here all the time.

263
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,761
<i>Shh. (Hogan) Hey, Lily.</i>

264
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,860
You here
to unload some hay'?

265
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:04,132
No.

266
00:31:04,194 --> 00:31:06,435
Well, I hear worlds
good for the soul.

267
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,203
My soul's beyond repair.

268
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:10,711
Think about it.

269
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:16,344
I see that charm school
is really paying off.

270
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:19,119
She don't mean it.

271
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:22,953
She just doesn't
like living here.

272
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:26,927
Well, one day she'll realize
ifs just geography.

273
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,520
Where's the furthest
you've ever been?

274
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:34,796
Bora Bora Bora Bora.
No way.

275
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:38,067
I found work
on a freighter.

276
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:41,803
We docked there
and I decided to stay.

277
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:44,004
Was it amazing?

278
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,605
I got a job at a resort
where this mangy dog

279
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:51,915
and her pup would hang
around begging for food.

280
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,818
The guest complained,
so the manager sent me

281
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:57,757
and this other guy, just
a local, out to get 'em.

282
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:00,795
The mother, she trusted
humans, so she was easy.

283
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:05,800
But her pup, she was
a slippery little sucker.

284
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:08,962
We couldn't get her
no matter how hard we tried.

285
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:13,634
We were supposed to take her
out to the bigger island,

286
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:17,144
about a 20-minute boat ride.

287
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,806
My co-worker wanted
to get home for dinner, though.

288
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,148
His wife was making
a Poisson Cru.

289
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:27,051
So he threw the dog off the
boat about halfway there.

290
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,112
Oh, my God!

291
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:31,284
That night
the whole island

292
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:33,350
could hear
that pup howling

293
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:36,864
and crying
for its mother.

294
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,900
I traveled halfway
across the world

295
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,402
to find out
that people are

296
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,497
dumb and cruel everywhere.

297
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,269
I could've just stayed home.

298
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:15,102
I went
to Aunt Bonnie's.

299
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:20,107
You weren't there.

300
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:22,006
Did you change your mind'?

301
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:30,611
I can't, Lily.

302
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,648
I can't do that
to Hogan.

303
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:45,630
Fine.

304
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,264
What's so great
about L.A. anyway?

305
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:01,107
Ifs not here.

306
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,715
Where are you going?

307
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,123
I don't know.

308
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,161
Can I come'?

309
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:14,354
No.

310
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,548
You're ugly.
So'?

311
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:16,056
So don't go walking around here acting
like you better than everybody else.

312
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:20,027
I don't. You told my brother you
was going to burn down my house?

313
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,893
No.
Liar.

314
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:25,126
I'm gonna ask your ass again.

315
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:28,692
Did you tell my brother you
was gonna burn down my house?

316
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:33,731
Don't look at that cunt.
Look at me! Look at me.

317
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:35,708
No, I didn't say that.

318
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:37,244
[spits]

319
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,903
[laughs]

320
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,843
Next time I see you

321
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:43,783
I'm gonna stab you in
your little frizzled head.

322
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:01,324
Thanks a lot.

323
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:04,563
What was I
supposed to do'?

324
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:12,272
I'm leaving tonight.

325
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,542
How?

326
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:18,177
<i>I'll wait by the bar and get some
trucker or methhead to drive me.</i>

327
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:22,018
Are you stupid? That'll get you
dead in a ditch somewhere.

328
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:25,184
Yeah, well,if I stay here, Shawna's
just gonna kill me anyway,

329
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:27,194
so, what's
the fucking difference?

330
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:38,757
[knocking]

331
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,795
I knew you'd
come through.

332
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,769
You're my best friend, stupid.

333
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:59,572
Fuck you!

334
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:00,842
Woo!

335
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,094
[bumps]

336
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:17,921
What the fuck?
it's fine.

337
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:19,728
Did you just fall asleep?

338
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:24,465
Ifs three in the morning.
You're such a baby.

339
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:25,938
Fine, Lily,
why don't you drive?

340
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,976
Oh wait,
nobody taught you how.

341
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:31,376
You don't have
to be a bitch about it.

342
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:34,779
I'm sorry. Let's just pull
over and sleep for a while.

343
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,948
[giggling]

344
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,648
Do you remember
when we thought

345
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:45,750
that your mom
was gonna marry my dad

346
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:49,456
and we were gonna
be sisters for real'?

347
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,396
Yeah. Then we realized
that your dad's, like,

348
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:54,128
100 years old
and super ugly.

349
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,670
You're just upset because we
saw Darryl Baker's father

350
00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:03,643
coming out of your
mom's room in his underwear.

351
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,475
Oh, you cried.

352
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,105
You cried so hard
thinking that Darryl

353
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,309
was gonna be
your brother instead.

354
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:25,188
Yeah, my mom was
gonna marry your dad.

355
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:28,759
And we were gonna
move to the beach.

356
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:32,705
A real beach
with a real ocean.

357
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,673
And every morning
we would wake up

358
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:38,440
and roll out of bed and dive
straight into the water.

359
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:45,017
Yeah.

360
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,344
Hey- Hey"

361
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:48,507
So Jesse said
we're not far out.

362
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:50,414
Woo-hoe.

363
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:54,421
He gave me an address
for where we got to meet them.

364
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,423
Hey, where'd you
get those chips?

365
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,049
I bought them.

366
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:02,187
But I thought you
didn't have any money.

367
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:05,358
Fine. Whatever.
I stole them. Sue me.

368
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:08,766
Lily.
What'?

369
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:11,305
Who cares, huh'?

370
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:13,102
Something for you anyway.

371
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,604
Hypocrite.

372
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:30,985
Hey, I'm just kidding. Where are you going?
To pay for these.

373
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:34,460
No, if you pay for them,
they're gonna know I took them.

374
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:37,396
For the first time in your life,
could you just not be a baby'?

375
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,735
No fucking way. No.

376
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,240
God damn it.

377
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:09,329
Your friend send you back for more'?
No, I was just putting it back.

378
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:11,763
Do I look that fucking stupid'?
No! I'm sorry, okay'?

379
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,664
We're gonna wait right
here for the police.

380
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:15,634
No, please let me go. You
and your little girlfriend

381
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:17,501
come in here thinking the
sun shines out your asses.

382
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,301
Well, I got a rude awakening
for you, all right'?

383
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:20,500
This is
a citizen's arrest.

384
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:22,440
Stand back!
Ow!

385
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:23,499
Lily! Rum

386
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:28,048
<i>What {he hell
are you doing?</i>

387
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:28,707
<i>Don't!</i>

388
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,389
<i>Fucking, drive!
Come back here!</i>

389
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,857
Go, go, go!
Come on!

390
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:39,860
Shit.

391
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,691
Fucking bitches!

392
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:47,827
[laughing]

393
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,370
That's not funny!

394
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:52,963
"This is
a citizen's arrest."

395
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:58,472
<i>It's a little funny.</i>

396
00:44:57,193 --> 00:44:59,605
Hey, there they are!
Look! Pull over.

397
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:03,505
Pull over. Come on.
I'm going. I'm going.

398
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,182
Pull over.
I'm going.

399
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,284
Where am I
supposed to park'?

400
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,980
Lily, where am I
supposed to park'?

401
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,249
Lily!

402
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:17,188
[honking]

403
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,155
Hey.

404
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:26,227
Where's Jesse?

405
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:30,034
Ifs Lily.
From the pool.

406
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:34,466
He said he don't
want to see you.

407
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,171
What'? He said to go back to
wherever the hell you came from.

408
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:41,215
Why'? What did I do'?

409
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:47,814
Yo, we're just playing'. He's there
with the homeless dude gettin'' booze.

410
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:51,620
<i>Yeah, I'll keep you safe till he
gets back, what do you think'?</i>

411
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:54,924
Yeah?
No.

412
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:57,260
Where's your ugly friend?
She's not ugly.

413
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,492
She ain't pretty.

414
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:01,528
Lily?

415
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:05,597
Hi.

416
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:08,041
Hi.

417
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:11,306
Dickhead,
you trying to get busted'?

418
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,847
Let's not stand in the middle
of the fucking street with beer.

419
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:17,043
Huh'? Use your fucking head.

420
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:18,176
What do you think'?

421
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:22,115
Jesus.

422
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,626
What's going on'?

423
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:33,894
Just drive.

424
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:38,565
Let's go.
Take a left.

425
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:11,264
Yo, so there are, like,
a bunch of Wildcats up here

426
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:13,204
like fucking cougars
and shit like that.

427
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,264
They fucking are eating
people, like, all the time.

428
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,709
No way. I don't believe you.
That's bullshit.

429
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,509
I swear. I swear. David.

430
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,948
What'?

431
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:24,951
No, man.

432
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:26,918
They all died in the wildfires.
You know that.

433
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:28,387
You're fucking
full of shit.

434
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:30,117
He's just trying
to spit game--

435
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:34,958
That's really awful.
Like, a wildfire? Like--

436
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:37,463
Yeah, you know,
ifs crazy.

437
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,526
Me and David, after the last
fire, we snuck up here.

438
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:44,572
But you gotta be really
careful because there's

439
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:46,629
firemen and police
and you gotta sneak in.

440
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:48,642
And then when
you get up here,

441
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:55,081
there's nothing but charred
rabbits and fucking coyotes.

442
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:57,242
Then there was
the fucking deer tree.

443
00:47:57,306 --> 00:47:58,979
There was
this tree somewhere.

444
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,043
I don't remember
where we were,

445
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,920
but there's this deer just
strung up-- it was in the tree'?

446
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,290
I don't know, he must've had
his antlers stuck in a branch

447
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,556
when he was trying to outrun
the flames or something.

448
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:12,498
But when we found him
there was nothing left.

449
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:15,092
He was, like, just
charred meat and skeleton--

450
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:18,661
Okay, we get the picture.
Okay, we get it. It was awful.

451
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:21,800
No, it's awesome.

452
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:25,175
That's reality.
Living's hard.

453
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:27,908
Especially around here.

454
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,917
Living's hard
everywhere.

455
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:35,183
Oh, wise one, do you have any other
pearls of wisdom for us today'?

456
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:40,284
Screw you. No thanks.
I like girls.

457
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:42,022
Okay. Okay.

458
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:45,028
I'm serious.
Okay.

459
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:49,695
Be nice to Lily's friend.
Okay. Let's be friends.

460
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:52,330
Shut the fuck up
and do what you're told.

461
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:53,840
Wait. Where are you going?

462
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:56,240
To piss.
You want to hold my dick'?

463
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,919
I like him.

464
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:09,688
I know you do.

465
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:36,513
Are you drunk'?
I don't know.

466
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:38,347
I'm, like, totally
fucked up right now.

467
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:40,478
Be careful.
Of what'?

468
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:42,079
[glass shattering]

469
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:44,818
I fucking
love it here.

470
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,587
My bad.
Excuse me.

471
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,856
Hey, watch where the
fuck you're going. Lily.

472
00:49:48,918 --> 00:49:51,262
Wow, there's no
reason to be a bitch.

473
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,163
Fuck you.
Lily.

474
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:55,429
Okay, tough guy,
have a nice life.

475
00:49:56,826 --> 00:50:00,171
What's up'?
Hi. What happened?

476
00:50:00,229 --> 00:50:02,175
<i>(Alison) Nothing.
Nothing happened.</i>

477
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:04,074
This guy called me a bitch.

478
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,443
<i>(David) Did you call
my friend a bitch?</i>

479
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:08,914
Listen, I don't got
a problem with you.

480
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:10,917
Well, maybe I got
a problem with you.

481
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:15,422
If I offended anyone, it was my mistake.
And I'm sorry.

482
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:18,015
Okay, but you don't
need to apologize to us.

483
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,620
You need to apologize
to the girls.

484
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:23,823
I'm sorry.

485
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:26,464
Oh shit!

486
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:30,295
Gimme this bag,
mother fucker.

487
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:33,602
Run!

488
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:41,170
You okay?

489
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:44,976
Run!

490
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,315
Yo.

491
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:52,288
Come on. Come on.

492
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,419
Hurry UP-

493
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:56,190
Jesus.

494
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:04,565
What is this place?

495
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,502
This is where we live.
This is cool.

496
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:12,478
Yeah, it's sick. David even
tapped into the power.

497
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:39,198
You guys don't get in
trouble for staying here?

498
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,605
No, every once in a while
you gotta come through

499
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,508
and kick some fucking
homeless people out, but...

500
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:49,107
Yeah, they poop in the hallways.
That's gross.

501
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:54,712
Okay, so we got a laptop, a
calculator, and a bunch of books.

502
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:57,883
Probably get, like, a grand on
Craigslist for the computer?

503
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,551
Yeah, but that guy
probably needs it

504
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,323
for school
or something, right'?

505
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:04,364
Golly gee willakers,
she's right.

506
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,730
We should probably turn it
into the lost and found.

507
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,700
Actually, the next time
we wanna hear from

508
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:14,230
the my bitty titty committee,
we'll be sure to ask.

509
00:52:14,296 --> 00:52:16,469
<i>(I Louis) my bitty
fifty committee.</i>

510
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:25,418
Are you gonna
make outwith Louis?

511
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:28,580
What'? No.

512
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:30,146
I think you should
hook up with him.

513
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,551
Why'?

514
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:35,892
I don't wanna
be the only one.

515
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,667
Then why
don't you either?

516
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,967
Can you just
try to have fun'?

517
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:51,168
For once?

518
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:52,576
For me'?

519
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,380
I think you're pretty.

520
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:28,540
Really?

521
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,684
Kinda.

522
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:45,589
I have to go
to the bathroom.

523
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:48,134
I have to go
to the bathroom.

524
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,424
Hey, I hope you
didn't drop a deuce.

525
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,060
The plumbing
don't work.

526
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,426
Where are we going?

527
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:22,155
I wanna
show you something.

528
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:46,418
Hey, where did you go'?

529
00:55:46,475 --> 00:55:49,285
Jesse?

530
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,688
Home sweet home.

531
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:07,330
This is your house?

532
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:10,005
It used to be.

533
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:15,742
Where's your family?

534
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:18,148
Moved to Arizona
about six months ago.

535
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:25,257
Are you rich?

536
00:56:25,314 --> 00:56:29,319
If we were rich, we
would still live here.

537
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:33,231
<i>So then out of the
blue my dad says</i>

538
00:56:33,288 --> 00:56:35,632
we're moving
to Scottsdale.

539
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:37,568
And we're staying
with my grandparents.

540
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:40,539
And they told me that I
wasn't allowed to take King.

541
00:56:42,297 --> 00:56:44,243
Who's King'?

542
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:47,303
King was...

543
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:49,849
this big dumb...

544
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:52,181
fat, and he's
completely retarded,

545
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,243
he was this big,
fat, ginger cat

546
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:57,483
that I had, you know, since I
was, like, five years old.

547
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:02,525
He was cool.

548
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:07,090
But he got kinda sick, so he needed,
like, a lot of medication and stuff.

549
00:57:07,156 --> 00:57:12,128
So one day my dad drove
him to the animal shelter

550
00:57:12,194 --> 00:57:15,403
while my mom and my sister
packed up the house.

551
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:22,473
And then it was
just like that.

552
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,781
We were,
we were up and gone.

553
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:31,551
I bet he ended up going home
with a really great family.

554
00:57:34,116 --> 00:57:37,029
Or he's dead,
put to sleep.

555
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:45,168
You know, I stayed, like, in
Scottsdale for about a month.

556
00:57:45,227 --> 00:57:47,867
Close to a month,
and I couldn't take it.

557
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:51,241
So I snuck out one night
and hopped on a bus

558
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,302
and I came back here.

559
00:57:53,368 --> 00:57:56,212
Aren't they, like, freaking
out looking for you'?

560
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,813
Yeah, probably.

561
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:10,889
Fuck it, you know?

562
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:16,699
Now they got
one less mouth to feed.

563
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:19,898
I'm-can you do me a
favor and please don't

564
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:23,341
tell the other guys about
this place, okay'? Why'?

565
00:58:23,398 --> 00:58:25,935
You should all live here
instead of that nasty motel.

566
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:28,003
No, they'd just
come and trash it.

567
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:34,252
I mean this is
still my home.

568
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:35,481
Okay.

569
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:02,913
[phone ringing]

570
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:04,780
Here. Get it.

571
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,757
Hello?

572
00:59:12,814 --> 00:59:14,953
Is that them'?

573
00:59:15,017 --> 00:59:16,553
Hello?

574
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,770
What'd they say'?

575
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:35,747
Nobody there.

576
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:37,579
They hung UP-

577
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:45,886
[phone ringing]

578
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:56,058
Hello?

579
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:02,899
I'm sorry, Hogan.

580
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:08,645
Look, I swear I'm gonna
bring your truck back

581
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:10,650
without a scratch
on it, I promise.

582
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:13,312
<i>Oh hell, I don't care
about that truck.</i>

583
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:17,221
I care a little
about that truck.

584
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:21,557
I care a whole lot more about you
getting home without a scratch.

585
01:00:21,617 --> 01:00:22,823
How's Lily'?

586
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:25,387
<i>She's okay.</i>

587
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:27,661
<i>We're both okay.</i>

588
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:32,638
I don't know. I don't
know anything anymore.

589
01:00:32,694 --> 01:00:34,196
Well, they say
if you're not confused

590
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:36,242
that means
you're not thinking enough.

591
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:38,335
<i>I'm sorry, Hogan.</i>

592
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,107
Now, now, hey, hey, hey.

593
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:45,418
So what kind of trail of murder
and mayhem have you two left'?

594
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:48,679
Not too bad.

595
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:51,554
<i>Really?
No harm, no foul, right?</i>

596
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:54,594
You just come home.

597
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,257
You got people here
worried about you.

598
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,197
Okay.

599
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:01,632
<i>It's time to come home.</i>

600
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,798
BYE, Hogan.

601
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:34,623
Hey, come on.

602
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:54,848
You sure you
wanna do this'?

603
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:01,392
'Cause we don't have to.

604
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,062
I know. I want to.

605
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:02,551
What is that'?

606
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:03,749
Ifs nothing.

607
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:09,053
Are they scars'?
Uh-huh.

608
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:12,891
What happened?

609
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:14,592
I don't know.
I got bored.

610
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:23,632
Did it hurt'?

611
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:26,874
No.

612
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:40,982
I'm sorry.

613
01:03:47,088 --> 01:03:53,164
Maybe we should just
wait anyway, you know?

614
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:55,299
Whatever.

615
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:02,307
<i>(Realtor) --foreclosures now.
Oh, shit!</i>

616
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:05,402
They're ripping up
the carpet and faucets.

617
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,640
<i>I don't know.
That's disgusting.</i>

618
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:12,343
Seriously, that's gross. Really.

619
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,819
I'm not sure how I feel about...
(scream)

620
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:18,790
and we'll probably have to blast out these
walls to make room for the nursery.

621
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,294
The kids could always live in the backyard.
What do you think you're doing?

622
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,227
Maybe make a shed
for them or something.

623
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:31,095
Excuse me.

624
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,307
Yo, you gotta
check this out.

625
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:44,213
Thick uncut cock
ready to unload.

626
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:46,684
What are you talking about'?

627
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:50,553
Young sexy couple
looking for a kinky girl.

628
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:54,116
<i>I really don't wanna look at porn
with you guys. It's no! porn.</i>

629
01:05:54,182 --> 01:05:57,891
It's this website where people put these
personal ads and they meet up and fuck.

630
01:05:57,953 --> 01:06:03,062
Any ladies in need of some big black
dick this morning? Yes, please.

631
01:06:03,124 --> 01:06:07,869
Who the fuck is Tina'? Everybody's looking for her.
ifs crystal meth, idiot.

632
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:11,001
All this shit is drugs, like
party favors, snow, powder.

633
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:13,171
We're gonna write one.
Why'?

634
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:16,238
We're gonna lure some pervert
back here and rob him.

635
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:20,082
How exactly do you
plan on doing that'?

636
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,584
<i>No. (Louis) Come an.</i>

637
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:28,423
We'll be right
in the bathroom hiding.

638
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:30,429
She says the code word,
fucking-- We jump out.

639
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:32,055
Yeah, and then what happens
when she gets hurt'?

640
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,929
How'? We're right there.

641
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:36,060
Okay, then, what happens
when they call the police?

642
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:38,195
Oh, you think he's gonna
call the fucking police?

643
01:06:38,259 --> 01:06:40,739
"Yes, Officer, I was about to
have sex with this underage girl

644
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:42,866
and then some hooligans
jumped out and robbed me."

645
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,706
Fuck that.
Yeah, fuck that.

646
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:47,144
Shut the fuck up, Louis.
Shut the fuck up, Louis.

647
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:53,179
<i>(David)
Come an.</i>

648
01:06:53,241 --> 01:06:55,050
I don't know, man.

649
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,953
See, everybody
always wants to be down

650
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:59,356
and when shit gets real-- No,
look, I'm just sayin''--

651
01:06:59,414 --> 01:07:02,918
Yeah, you're just saying
you're a fucking pussy.

652
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,431
What about you'?

653
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,863
What do you say'?

654
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:19,745
Okay.

655
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:23,442
Thank you. Fuck.
Some nuts, finally.

656
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:47,734
Young, white girl

657
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:54,873
looking for my big daddy.

658
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:58,612
That's gross.

659
01:07:58,673 --> 01:08:05,249
Must be white

660
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:07,657
and very generous.

661
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:33,279
Hi.

662
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:35,617
Hi.

663
01:08:35,677 --> 01:08:37,486
Come find Alison
with me.

664
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:39,855
(Louis) Shit. I keep
losing the connection.

665
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:44,158
Please? Come on.

666
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,132
Yeah, we're gonna
go look for Alison.

667
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:49,031
Holy shit!
What'?

668
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,862
<i>(Louis) Look, dude, look
at all of these responses.</i>

669
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:55,134
Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.

670
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:00,212
<i>I'll be your daddy.
Sugar daddy here.</i>

671
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:03,477
What can Daddy for you'?

672
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:05,040
Oh!
Oh!

673
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:07,677
Dude just sent
a picture of his dick.

674
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:09,915
Oh my God,
I'm going to throw up.

675
01:09:09,978 --> 01:09:11,719
<i>(David)
What about this guy?</i>

676
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:19,858
I don't know,
he looks nice.

677
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:21,696
Yeah, no, he does.

678
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:25,329
You guys are pathetic.
This guy's a piece of shit.

679
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:28,738
<i>He looks nice? What the hell's the
matter with you people? What'?</i>

680
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,833
We're going to rob
a perv. Come see.

681
01:10:01,629 --> 01:10:03,006
Lily?

682
01:10:19,714 --> 01:10:23,491
This is so stupid.
She could be abducted.

683
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:25,861
She'll be fine.

684
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:33,067
This feels like
a surprise party.

685
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:39,176
Where are we going?
My car is back there.

686
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,771
I just gotta
grab my stuff.

687
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:44,112
You live back here?

688
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:46,015
Yeah, just for now.

689
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,081
Are you a runaway?

690
01:10:50,311 --> 01:10:52,188
I guess.

691
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:54,488
Well, does anyone
know where you are'?

692
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,528
You do.

693
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,335
This is taking too long.

694
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:09,671
<i>Shut up. (Man) Sorry.</i>

695
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:17,080
Nice little
setup you got.

696
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:22,746
I like it.

697
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:28,086
Looks like the
bed's seen some use.

698
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,328
Did you bring money?

699
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,462
Maybe.

700
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:40,802
How generous would you
like me to be'?

701
01:11:48,903 --> 01:11:50,382
I like your eyes.

702
01:11:50,438 --> 01:11:52,475
Surprise!
Whoa.

703
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,814
Very generous motherfucker.

704
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,912
We were just talking.

705
01:11:55,977 --> 01:11:57,684
I don't give a fuck. Give me
your money, you fucking pervert.

706
01:11:57,745 --> 01:12:02,660
Okay. Okay. Let's all relax. No.

707
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:04,754
How about I leave and we
pretend this never happened?

708
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:07,265
Yeah, go and get
the fuck out of here!

709
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:08,665
Get the fuck back!

710
01:12:08,723 --> 01:12:11,397
Whoa, hey!
Look, relax, man.

711
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:13,097
We got his money.
Just let him go.

712
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:14,731
I know you got a phone.
Give me your phone.

713
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:16,400
No, ifs a Blackberry.

714
01:12:16,464 --> 01:12:19,673
I don't give a fuck, motherfucker.
Here.

715
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:21,372
I'm gonna assume that
somewhere in that phone

716
01:12:21,436 --> 01:12:22,847
there's a number
that says "home"

717
01:12:22,904 --> 01:12:24,781
and at said home
there's a woman

718
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:26,876
who would be less than pleased
to find out her husband

719
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:28,852
was trying to fuck
a 15-year-old girl.

720
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,117
I'm sorry.
Shut the fuck up!

721
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:34,183
So when I ask you for the PIN number
I assume you're telling the truth.

722
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:38,697
<i>Otherwise, I'll have to call
your wife and ask her for it.</i>

723
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:41,461
<i>Seven, four-- (David) Speak!</i>

724
01:12:41,522 --> 01:12:44,366
Seven, four, nine, four.

725
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:48,202
Is that your final answer?
Yes. Yes.

726
01:12:48,262 --> 01:12:50,435
Michael Kenneth White.

727
01:12:50,498 --> 01:12:53,809
1460 Eldorado Street,
Glendale, California.

728
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:54,642
Yes.

729
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:02,150
Get the fuck
out of here.

730
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,918
Go. Go.

731
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:06,549
Holy shit!

732
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:11,093
That was such...

733
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:12,688
a fucking rush.

734
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:16,602
<i>(Louis)
Is that your final answer?</i>

735
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:17,192
Fuck!

736
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:21,230
What the hell?

737
01:13:24,732 --> 01:13:26,575
You never said
anything about a gun.

738
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:28,978
I didn't realize
I had to clear it with you.

739
01:13:29,036 --> 01:13:31,141
Can I hold it'?

740
01:13:31,205 --> 01:13:32,741
<i>(Alison)
Lily, be careful.</i>

741
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:34,582
You're such a baby.

742
01:13:34,642 --> 01:13:36,622
Yeah, well, I know a lot
more about guns than you.

743
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,520
I shoot with Hogan
all the time.

744
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:42,026
(Louis)
What the fuck's a Hogan?

745
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,858
It's Alison's Big Daddy.

746
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,398
Screw you, Lily.

747
01:13:48,322 --> 01:13:52,395
Careful.
it's not a toy.

748
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,773
<i>Let's go get some fucking shit.
(Louis) Fuck yeah.</i>

749
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:10,950
What if he had
hurt that guy'?

750
01:14:11,012 --> 01:14:12,355
He didn't.

751
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:14,120
No, I know,
but what if he had'?

752
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:15,286
Ifs not a big deal.

753
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:18,025
We have to go back.

754
01:14:18,085 --> 01:14:20,361
What'? No. Not yet.

755
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:21,695
Okay, when?

756
01:14:23,691 --> 01:14:28,071
I just want to spend
some more time with Jesse.

757
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:31,076
We'll go back tonight, okay'?
Promise?

758
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:34,409
Sure. No, you have to promise me, Lily.
Okay. Don't spazz out.

759
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:36,847
(David) Oh, shit. The only
time they put the jump man

760
01:14:36,904 --> 01:14:41,011
on anything other than Jordan was the
P-Rod collaboration. How do you know?

761
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:42,884
Well, because I'm not
some stupid fucking spic

762
01:14:42,944 --> 01:14:45,049
who doesn't know jack shit
about sneakers like you.

763
01:14:45,112 --> 01:14:46,420
I got you something.

764
01:14:55,256 --> 01:14:58,396
What now'? We are gonna
go buy more sneakers.

765
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:03,568
(Louis) If we don't do our part, the
terrorists will have won. Come on, Alison.

766
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:28,590
Louis, I can physically
hear you developing diabetes.

767
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,598
I'd rather have diabetes than drink
diet soda and get rectal cancer.

768
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:40,036
Alison's mom
died of cancer.

769
01:16:40,094 --> 01:16:42,335
Lily!
What? it's true.

770
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:44,000
Yeah, but it's none
of their business.

771
01:16:44,065 --> 01:16:46,272
I don't go around
talking about your dad.

772
01:16:46,334 --> 01:16:49,713
What'? That he killed himself?
Wow.

773
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:53,684
Everybody knows now. I guess
I should totally freak out.

774
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:57,613
How'd he do it'?

775
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:06,162
A gun.

776
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,997
<i>That's so fucking cool.</i>

777
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:14,802
<i>Shit, if I was gonna kill
myself I'd use a gun, too.</i>

778
01:17:14,862 --> 01:17:17,536
<i>or jump off
a big ass bridge.</i>

779
01:17:17,598 --> 01:17:20,374
Yeah, I hear when you
jump off a bridge

780
01:17:20,434 --> 01:17:24,473
you fall and you die on impact
when you hit the water.

781
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:31,080
The bridge
gotta be high, though.

782
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:33,352
Thank you, Louis.

783
01:17:33,414 --> 01:17:34,916
That's very
enlightening.

784
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:36,689
Of course ifs gotta
be fucking high,

785
01:17:36,751 --> 01:17:41,097
otherwise you'd just
hit the water and drown.

786
01:17:41,155 --> 01:17:43,362
I hear drowning's a really
beautiful way to die.

787
01:17:43,424 --> 01:17:45,529
<i>It's really peaceful.</i>

788
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:47,732
Who told you that'?

789
01:17:47,795 --> 01:17:51,834
<i>I don't know.
I read it.</i>

790
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:53,742
How the fuck
would they know?

791
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:57,613
They obviously didn't drown
if they wrote it in a book.

792
01:17:57,672 --> 01:18:01,586
Well, maybe they, like,
maybe, like, almost drowned.

came and saved them.</i>

795
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:08,687
No, but that ain't drowning.

796
01:18:10,184 --> 01:18:11,185
Like...

797
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:19,532
what if almost drowning
was all peaceful and shit

798
01:18:19,593 --> 01:18:26,442
like those last few minutes of
actually drowning is fucking horrible.

799

I mean, how fucking
pissed would you be'?

800

You're fucking, like,
expecting rainbows

and fucking
angels and shit...

802

total fucking horror.

Did I stutter'?

Hey!
What are you doing?

817
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:56,394
I'm going home, Lily.
Sorry.

818
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:58,630
Why do you have
to ruin everything?

819
01:19:58,692 --> 01:20:02,071
I'm not ruining anything. I just
don't even recognize you anymore.

820
01:20:02,129 --> 01:20:06,908
That's because for the first time in
my entire life, I'm really happy.

821

Good for you.

He doesn't care
about you, Lily!

825
01:20:17,945 --> 01:20:20,357
You're just some
stupid girl to him.

826
01:20:20,414 --> 01:20:21,984
We're moving in together.

827

Ifs huge.

832

Right.
Mm-hmm.

834

What about
your mom, Lily'?

835

Now she'll have
one less mouth to feed.

You know what, Alison?

838
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:00,621
You should go back
to the Salton Sea.

839

You belong there.

840

Don't say that.
Things are different now.

Passed by a couple times to make
sure there weren't any cops.

Yeah. No, you look too young.
You're like a kid, huh'?

Okay.

Want something
to eat or anything?

857

I'm not really hungry.
Do you just want to go'?
