00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,491
<i>It looks like a paradise, but it is the
most treacherous desert in the world:</i>

3
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>The Kalahari.
After the short rainy season...</i>

4
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,498
<i>...there are many water holes,
and even rivers.</i>

5
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>But after a few weeks, the water sinks
away into the deep Kalahari sand.</i>

6
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>The water holes dry,
and the rivers stop flowing.</i>

7
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>The grass fades to a beautiful
blond colour...</i>

8
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,095
<i>...that offers excellent grazing.</i>

9
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,682
<i>But for the next nine months,
there'll be no water to drink.</i>

10
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,478
<i>So most of the animals move away,
leaving the blond grass uneaten.</i>

11
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:07,568
<i>Humans avoid the Kalahari like the
plague because man must have water.</i>

12
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>So the beautiful landscapes
are devoid of people.</i>

13
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,660
<i>Except for the little people
of the Kalahari.</i>

14
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:26,378
<i>Pretty, dainty, small and graceful,
the Bushmen.</i>

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,965
<i>Where any other person
would die of thirst in a few days...</i>

16
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,886
<i>...they live quite contentedly
in this desert.</i>

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,598
<i>They know where to dig for roots
and bugs and tubers...</i>

18
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>...and which berries and pods
are good to eat.</i>

19
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,368
<i>Of course they know what to do
about water.</i>

20
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,163
<i>In the early morning,
you can collect dewdrops...</i>

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,958
<i>...from leaves that were carefully
laid out the previous evening.</i>

22
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>Or a plume of grass
can be a reservoir.</i>

23
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:17,596
<i>If you have the know-how, a clump
of twigs can tell you where to dig...</i>

24
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,974
<i>...and you come to light
with an enormous tuber.</i>

25
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,899
<i>You scrape shavings off it with a stick
that is split for a sharp edge.</i>

26
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,779
<i>You take a handful of the shavings, point
your thumb at your mouth and squeeze.</i>

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,873
<i>They must be the most
contented people in the world.</i>

28
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,585
<i>They have no crime, no punishment,
no violence, no laws...</i>

29
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>...no police, judges, rulers or bosses.</i>

30
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:59,888
<i>They believe that the gods put only good
and useful things on the earth for them.</i>

31
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,975
<i>ln this world of theirs,
nothing is bad or evil.</i>

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,187
<i>Even a poisonous snake is not bad.</i>

33
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>You just have to keep away
from the sharp end.</i>

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,780
<i>Actually, a snake is very good.
In fact, it's delicious.</i>

35
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,366
<i>And the skin makes a fine pouch.</i>

36
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,663
<i>They live in the vastness of the
Kalahari in small family groups.</i>

37
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,667
<i>One family of Bushmen might meet up
with another once in a few years.</i>

38
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,171
<i>But for the most part,
they live in complete isolation...</i>

39
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,090
<i>...unaware there are other people
in the world.</i>

40
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:40,762
<i>In the deep Kalahari, there are Bushmen
who have not heard of civilized man.</i>

41
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,683
<i>Sometimes they hear a thundering
sound when there are no clouds.</i>

42
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>They assume the gods have eaten too
much and their tummies are rumbling.</i>

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,193
<i>Sometimes they can even see
the evidence of the gods' flatulence.</i>

44
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,196
<i>Their language has
an idiosyncrasy of its own.</i>

45
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,866
<i>It seems to consist
mainly of clicking sounds.</i>

46
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,498
<i>They're very gentle people.</i>

47
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,585
<i>They'll never punish a child
or even speak harshly to it.</i>

48
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>So the kids are extremely well-behaved.
Their games are cute and inventive.</i>

49
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,476
<i>When the family needs meat...</i>

50
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,188
<i>...the hunter dips his arrow
in a brew that acts as a tranquilliser.</i>

51
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,900
<i>When he shoots a buck, it feels
a sting and the arrow drops out.</i>

52
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,778
<i>The buck runs away,
but soon it gets drowsy...</i>

53
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,988
<i>...and it stops running.</i>

54
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,868
<i>After a while, it goes to sleep.</i>

55
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:54,461
<i>The hunter apologizes. He explains
that his family needs the meat.</i>

56
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:00,759
<i>The characteristic which really makes
them different from all other races...</i>

57
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,887
<i>...is that they have
no sense of ownership at all.</i>

58
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>Where they live,
there's nothing you can own.</i>

59
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,560
<i>Only trees and grass and animals.</i>

60
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,397
<i>These Bushmen have never seen
a stone or a rock in their lives.</i>

61
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,775
<i>The hardest things they know
are wood and bone.</i>

62
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:23,365
<i>They live in a gentle world, where nothing
is as hard as rock, steel or concrete.</i>

63
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,080
<i>Only 600 miles to the south,
there's a vast city.</i>

64
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,587
<i>And here you find civilized man.</i>

65
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,487
<i>Civilized man refused
to adapt himself to his environment.</i>

66
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,365
<i>Instead he adapted his environment
to suit him.</i>

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,368
<i>So he built cities, roads,
vehicles, machinery.</i>

68
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,873
<i>And he put up power lines
to run his labour-saving devices.</i>

69
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,958
<i>But he didn't know when to stop.</i>

70
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,295
<i>The more he improved his
surroundings to make life easier...</i>

71
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,672
<i>...the more complicated he made it.</i>

72
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,676
<i>Now his children are sentenced to
10 to 15 years of school, to learn...</i>

73
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,180
<i>...how to survive in this complex
and hazardous habitat.</i>

74
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,476
<i>And civilized man, who refused
to adapt to his surroundings...</i>

75
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,062
<i>...now finds he has to adapt
and re-adapt...</i>

76
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,274
<i>...every hour of the day
to his self-created environment.</i>

77
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,360
<i>For instance, if it's Monday...</i>

78
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:46,365
<i>...and 7:30 comes up, you have to dis-
adapt from your domestic surroundings...</i>

79
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,369
<i>...and re-adapt yourself to an
entirely different environment.</i>

80
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,380
<i>8:00 means everybody
has to look busy.</i>

81
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,179
I've got a good story
about handicapped children.

82
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:14,476
<i>Handicapped children? No! You don't
recommend stuff you don't....</i>

83
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:19,690
Sorry. I'll only print sweetness and light,
even if it bores the pants off them.

84
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,069
<i>10:30 means you can stop looking
busy for 15 minutes.</i>

85
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,991
<i>And then,
you have to look busy again.</i>

86
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,994
-Hi, Kate.
-Hi, Pete.

87
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,080
Can you use this about the
teacher shortage in Botswana?

88
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,582
-Good story?
-Yeah.

89
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,168
They'll take anybody
who can read and write.

90
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,880
I don't know. I got bawled out
for writing a story on mugging.

91
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:47,384
My page should be sweet and light,
like Liberace and Jackie Onassis.

92
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,096
<i>Your day is chopped into pieces.
In each segment of time...</i>

93
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:55,475
<i>-...you adapt to new circumstances.</i>
-May I share a table?

94
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,687
<i>No wonder some people go
off the rails a bit.</i>

95
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,067
Does the noise in my head
bother you?

96
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,862
No.

97
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,490
Still got that story about
the teacher shortage in Botswana?

98
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,077
-Yeah. You gonna use it?
-No. Maybe they can use me.

99
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:20,167
<i>In the Kalahari, it's always Tuesday,
or Thursday if you like. Or Sunday.</i>

100
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,296
<i>No clocks or calendars tell you
to do this or that.</i>

101
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,467
<i>Lately, strange new things
sometimes appeared in the sky.</i>

102
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>Noisy birds that flew
without flapping their wings.</i>

103
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,362
<i>One day, something fell from the sky.</i>

104
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,963
<i>Xi had never seen anything
like this in his life.</i>

105
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,968
<i>It looked like water, but it was harder
than anything else in the world.</i>

106
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:15,180
<i>He wondered why the gods
had sent this thing down to the earth.</i>

107
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,980
<i>It was the strangest and most
beautiful thing they had ever seen.</i>

108
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,400
<i>They wondered why the gods
had sent it to them.</i>

109
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:36,994
<i>Pabo got his finger stuck in the thing and
the children thought he was very funny.</i>

110
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:54,386
<i>Xi tried the thing out to cure thongs.
It had the right shape and weight.</i>

111
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,682
<i>It was also beautifully smooth
and ideal for curing snakeskin.</i>

112
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,481
<i>And Pabo discovered
you could make music on it.</i>

113
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,070
<i>And every day they discovered
a new use for the thing.</i>

114
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,993
<i>It was harder and heavier and smoother
than anything they'd ever known.</i>

115
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,371
<i>It was the most useful thing
the gods had ever given them.</i>

116
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,665
<i>A real labour-saving device.</i>

117
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,879
<i>But the gods had been careless.
They had sent only one.</i>

118
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,883
<i>Now, for the first time, here was a
thing that could not be shared...</i>

119
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,093
<i>...because there was only one of it.</i>

120
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,478
<i>Suddenly, everybody needed it
most of the time.</i>

121
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,773
<i>A thing they had never needed before
became a necessity.</i>

122
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,776
<i>And unfamiliar emotions
began to stir.</i>

123
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,780
<i>A feeling of wanting to own,
of not wanting to share.</i>

124
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,877
<i>Other new things came.
Anger, jealousy, hate and violence.</i>

125
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,187
<i>Xi was angry with the gods.</i>

126
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:30,274
<i>He shouted, "Take back your thing!
We don't want it!</i>

127
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,276
<i>Look at the trouble it brought. "</i>

128
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,194
<i>The gods did not take it back.</i>

129
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:38,198
<i>He shouted, "You must be crazy
to send us this thing! Take it back!"</i>

130
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,784
<i>Then he shouted,
"Look out! Look out!"</i>

131
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:47,082
<i>But he spoke too late and
the thing felled his daughter Dani.</i>

132
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,978
<i>Xi carried the thing away
from the shelter and buried it.</i>

133
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,662
<i>That evening, there was no laughter
and no chatter around the family fire.</i>

134
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,375
<i>A strange feeling of shame
had come over the family...</i>

135
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,170
<i>...and they were very quiet.</i>

136
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:41,678
<i>Xi said, "I have buried the thing.
It will not make us unhappy again. "</i>

137
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:01,365
<i>That night, a hyena smelled the blood
on the thing, and dug it up.</i>

138
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:11,792
<i>A bad-tempered warthog chased the
hyena away and it dropped the thing.</i>

139
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,965
<i>The next day, Dani found it.</i>

140
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,188
<i>Her brother Toma heard her playing on it
and said, "Let me try. Let me try too. "</i>

141
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,688
<i>That night the family was very unhappy.</i>

142
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,491
<i>They began to talk about this thing.
They did not have a name for it.</i>

143
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,286
<i>They called it the "evil thing. "</i>

144
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,961
<i>Gaboo said, "Perhaps the gods
were absent-minded...</i>

145
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,881
<i>...when they dropped
the evil thing on the earth.</i>

146
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:46,178
<i>They've always sent only good things,
like rain, trees, roots and berries to eat.</i>

147
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:52,768
<i>We are their children and they love us.
But now they've sent this evil thing. "</i>

148
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,692
<i>Xi said, "The thing does not
belong on the earth.</i>

149
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,696
<i>Tomorrow I will take it to the end
of the earth and throw it off. "</i>

150
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,993
<i>Gobo said, "I think the end of the earth
must be very far.</i>

151
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,664
<i>I think you'll have to walk
for 20 days. Perhaps 40. "</i>

152
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,877
<i>Xi said,
"I will start walking tomorrow. "</i>

153
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,289
<i>Two thousand miles to the north
in the state of Birani...</i>

154
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,583
<i>...trouble was brewing.</i>

155
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,466
It's 35 million to combat erosion
in the valley.

156
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:11,096
-And 6 million for improvement of the--
-Hold it, minister. We can't expect--

157
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,470
Get out. We need the car.

158
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,869
That was Sam Boga's gang.
You said they were in Cabinda.

159
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,289
-That's what I thought.
-How many got away?

160
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,292
There were two jeeps.
Four got away.

161
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,877
-Sam Boga was there?
-No.

162
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:30,175
This time, he's got to die.
Find him and kill him yourself.

163
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,974
Bring him here.

164
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,484
Where is Sam Boga?

165
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,865
Where is your hideout?

166
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,662
Bring the one in the corridor.

167
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,498
Bring that one.

168
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,468
Where is Sam Boga?
Where is your hideout?

169
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,179
Take them...

170
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,391
...to the helicopter.

171
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,859
They went south.

172
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,778
-I'll direct you from the helicopter.
-Yes, sir.

173
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,083
Gas guzzler.

174
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,961
<i>Four of the eight assassins
got away in two jeeps.</i>

175
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,174
<i>The other four were shot in the
Cabinet room by the security guards.</i>

176
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,260
-Bastards.
<i>-The assassins wore brown T-shirts...</i>

177
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,679
<i>...the trademark
of the terrorist gang...</i>

178
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,765
<i>...led by the notorious Sam Boga.</i>

179
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:05,479
<i>However, eyewitnesses state Sam Boga
did not take part in the assassination.</i>

180
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:10,567
<i>It is assumed that he masterminded the
attack, some distance from the capital.</i>

181
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,195
<i>Sources announced
that the assassins killed...</i>

182
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,282
<i>...the ministers of education,
public works and agriculture.</i>

183
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:21,870
<i>The president, who survived the hail
of bullets with only a flesh wound...</i>

184
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,998
<i>...will be addressing the nation
in a few moments.</i>

185
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:35,092
We did it! We did it! We got the
president, and five of his ministers!

186
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,594
You didn't, you know. That's him.

187
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,472
It was the will of the Almighty
that I was spared.

188
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,766
We mourn the deaths
of three members...

189
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,769
<i>...of my Cabinet.
We extend our deepest sympathies--</i>

190
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,564
He's lying. We got six.
I saw them go down.

191
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,776
You killed three and wounded five.

192
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,362
And you lost four.

193
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,366
Why do I have to work with
amateurs? Did you get away clean?

194
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:03,579
Yes, we were in and out in two
minutes. They will never find us.

195
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,978
Attention.

196
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,486
-What happened?
-We ran out of gas.

197
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:40,199
-How long ago?
-About 15 minutes, sir.

198
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,284
Okay, let's go!

199
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,083
Now, you tell me.

200
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,879
Where is Sam Boga?

201
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,382
Where is your hideout?

202
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,975
Next time you're going
to be a bit higher.

203
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:10,687
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

204
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,485
I'll tell you, I'll tell you! I'll show you.
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

205
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,071
I'll tell you. I'll show you where.

206
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,698
<i>-Do you hear me?</i>
-Right here, general.

207
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:25,285
<i>-Banana forest at Dumgaze. Follow me.</i>
-Right, general.

208
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:30,374
The man we want is the president,
not the bloody minister of education.

209
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,878
Understand? I'll come with you.
We'll get him in his bed.

210
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,673
Cover up! Cover up!

211
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,763
Come on. Mount the bazooka.
Move it, move it!

212
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,767
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

213
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,271
Now take cover. You, you go there.

214
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,065
Not there, you bloody fool.
Get out of there.

215
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,575
-Well?
-They're there. They're there.

216
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,661
You cannot see them,
but they're there.

217
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:11,874
Okay.

218
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,759
You see, there they are.

219
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,060
Okay. No, hold it.

220
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,163
Okay. Shit.

221
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,168
Cut it out, man!

222
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,087
Okay.

223
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,776
-Born to be our champion.
-You showed them.

224
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,778
-Beautiful, man.
-Hey.

225
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,363
Quiet.

226
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,367
Stand by.

227
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,260
Let's go.

228
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,983
<i>The most inquisitive creature
in Africa is the baboon.</i>

229
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,589
<i>Xi said,
"That is a very evil thing you've got.</i>

230
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,885
<i>You better give it back so I can
take it and throw it off the earth.</i>

231
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,597
<i>It brought unhappiness to my family.
If you don't give it to me...</i>

232
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,600
<i>...it'll bring grief to you
and your family too. "</i>

233
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:23,482
<i>He spoke long and earnestly until
the baboon began to pay attention.</i>

234
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,986
<i>He must have convinced it,
and it dropped the thing.</i>

235
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,573
<i>And Xi said,
"You have done a very wise thing. "</i>

236
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:59,476
<i>-So you want to go to Botswana?
-I want to get away from all this.</i>

237
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,186
<i>But in the Kalahari?</i>

238
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,274
<i>Mom, it's not in the Kalahari.
Botswana isn't all desert.</i>

239
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:07,794
Get in there. Why do they put the
nuts where you can't get at them?

240
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:11,590
Right in my bloody face.

241
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:17,596
Every year I have to lay here
on my back.

242
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:23,060
Keep it down a bit, Mpudi.
I'm trying to tune the scanner.

243
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,564
Okay, Mpudi. Go ahead.

244
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:32,694
Every year you come here with a bigger
and better tent and equipment.

245
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:38,200
And every year, you turn up with this
and I have to work my ass off.

246
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:44,998
That's funny. This elephant's dung
shows a complete lack of boron.

247
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,469
Hello, Reverend.
What are you doing on a horse?

248
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:00,597
I hit a rock with my crankcase.
Cracked it wide open.

249
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,268
The trouble is, I have to meet the
new schoolteacher at Mabula.

250
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,563
You can have that one,
but she's in a terrible shape.

251
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,399
We've been knocking around
in the Hamadulas.

252
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:15,571
I promised Mpudi that I'd work here,
so he could have a week to patch it.

253
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,281
Here, Reverend.

254
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,284
-Thank you.
-Get in there, you bloody--

255
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,286
Morning, Mpudi.

256
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,079
Morning, Mpudi.

257
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:27,165
-Morning.
-Will this make it to Mabula and back?

258
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:30,169
She's gonna be a bastard to start.
Sorry, Reverend.

259
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:35,090
-I put in new rings and they're tight.
-But will she make it?

260
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,176
You said I could have a whole week.

261
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:41,889
This is an emergency. We want to know
if she'll make it to Mabula and back.

262
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,892
I haven't looked at the brakes
or steering gear.

263
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,977
-Mpudi.
-Okay, she'll make it.

264
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,481
As soon as I connect the steering
rack, but she'll be a bastard to start.

265
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,484
There we are, Reverend.
Then she'll be all yours.

266
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:59,281
I don't think I can handle her.
I hear Mpudi calls her the antichrist.

267
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,868
Well, she is a thing.

268
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,373
I was hoping-- I was ho--

269
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:18,592
-I was hoping you could go.
-I'm very awkward around women.

270
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,261
-Yes, aren't we all?
-No, it's not like that.

271
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:26,099
When I'm in the presence of a lady,
my brain switches off or something.

272
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,269
-I turn into an idiot.
-You ought to meet more women.

273
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:33,899
-It only gets worse.
-But you will do this for me?

274
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,786
Come on, Prince. Come on. Go, boy.

275
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,498
Come on, boy.
Come on, come on. Okay.

276
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,084
Okay.

277
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:57,464
Son of a--
Choke. Choke, choke, choke, choke.

278
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:04,179
You tried to murder me,
you son of a--

279
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:08,267
Don't switch her off or let her stall.
You'll never start her.

280
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,894
Don't park on a slope.
You got no hand brake.

281
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,771
Now you tell me.

282
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,273
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Andrew.

283
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,276
-Take care, now. Goodbye.
-Bye, Mpudi.

284
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:31,790
<i>One day, a very noisy animal rushed
past where Xi was sleeping.</i>

285
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:39,590
<i>It left very peculiar tracks, as if two
enormous snakes had slithered past.</i>

286
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,194
Everybody lie down on the ground.

287
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,197
All of you, lie down!

288
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,490
Come on, lie down, you and you!

289
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,492
Everybody lie down!

290
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:26,663
Hey, you! Didn't you hear me?
Lie down!

291
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:33,670
He can't hear you, sir.

292
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,380
-He's deaf.
-Shut up!

293
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:35,274
Hey, wake up!
Come and give us petrol here.

294
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,067
Did two jeeps pass here?

295
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,695
Yes, sir. They took half my stock.

296
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:43,198
They took a big can of petrol,
and they made me to lie down.

297
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:46,285
If you find them, ask them.
They must pay me my money.

298
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,078
It's a lot of stuff they took.

299
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,760
Morning.

300
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,396
-Miss Thompson?
-Yes.

301
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,773
-My name--
-How do--?

302
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:20,569
My name-- My name is--

303
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:23,280
My name--

304
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,461
My name is Andrew Steyn.

305
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,796
How do you do?

306
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:44,760
The Reverend cracked his crankcase,
so he asked me to....

307
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:00,567
Thank you.

308
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:26,176
How far do we have to go?

309
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,596
How far do we have to go?

310
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:30,889
How--?

311
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,474
Oh, sorry.

312
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:39,773
Hello, Andrew.

313
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,483
Hello, Phineas.

314
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:44,069
-Good morning, madam.
-Good morning.

315
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,697
-I'm sorry, madam. Sorry.
-It's all right.

316
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,074
Here. I'm truly sorry,
madam. Sorry.

317
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,659
It's all right.

318
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,584
What are you doing?

319
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,471
What--? What--? What are you--?
Your brakes are shot.

320
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,182
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

321
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,560
I'm opening the gate.

322
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:21,565
How do I get out of here?

323
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:24,693
No, it's all right. I....

324
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:31,200
Now I just....

325
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:45,881
-Oh, this is too weird. I'm getting out.
-No, it's okay. I just have to....

326
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:50,594
-What are you doing now?
-I'm closing the gate. But don't worry.

327
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:54,264
Are you crazy? It has no brakes!
Do you wanna get me killed?

328
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:57,559
-Are you crazy?
-All right, it'll come back.

329
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:00,771
-What?
-The Land Rover, it'll come back.

330
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:04,399
-What do you mean, it'll come back?
-It's all right.

331
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:08,278
-I suppose you think it was funny.
-I'm sorry. The brakes don't work.

332
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,781
I noticed.

333
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:36,682
<i>Xi saw a strange-looking person,
and greeted him.</i>

334
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,560
<i>But the man didn't hear him.</i>

335
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:50,696
<i>Xi said, "This is a funny stick.
Did it grow on a tree?"</i>

336
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:10,382
<i>He couldn't understand
why he ran away.</i>

337
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,969
<i>He realized the man must've seen
the evil thing he was carrying.</i>

338
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:15,679
<i>That's what made him run.</i>

339
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:38,368
-She stopped.
-I noticed.

340
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,871
Can you start her again?

341
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:44,666
No. We gave her new rings,
and they're very tight.

342
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:49,171
-How far are we from the mission?
-About 30 miles.

343
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,965
-Will we get there before dark?
-I don't know.

344
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:55,886
-This thing has stopped.
-I noticed.

345
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,971
Are you sure you can't start her?

346
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,266
Yes. This morning it took a horse
and three men.

347
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,393
-So now what?
-I can make a fire.

348
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,688
And there's some food
and a sleeping bag.

349
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,065
Spend the night?

350
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,192
I'm afraid so.

351
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,069
You sure this thing's stopped?

352
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,280
Yes. Didn't you notice?

353
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:22,162
I can carry you across.
Then you don't have to....

354
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,665
Okay.

355
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,800
Watch it! Be careful!

356
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,179
Thank you.

357
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:43,892
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

358
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:48,564
-I'm sorry.
-Look at my dress! I lost my shoes!

359
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,775
-Your what?
-My shoes.

360
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:55,696
I'm sorry.

361
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:57,573
Well, watch it, buster.

362
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,285
I'm sorry.

363
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:04,496
-Sorry. I'll fetch your bags.
-No! You'll drop them!

364
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,082
I'll get them myself.

365
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:11,795
I'm all right. I'm okay.

366
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:26,685
Leave that one. I don't need it.

367
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:39,489
Idiot.

368
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:09,978
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! Don't you dare!

369
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,689
-Go away!
-It's all right. She's gone!

370
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:15,484
Keep away! You keep away from me!

371
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:18,195
No, I wasn't-- There was this warthog.

372
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,572
-What warthog?
-She's gone, but--

373
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:22,783
Keep away.

374
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:24,660
-I wasn't--
-Go away!

375
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:29,164
I wasn't--

376
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,376
I didn't....

377
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:32,668
<i>Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner
when he was rudely interrupted.</i>

378
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:36,380
<i>Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner
when he was rudely interrupted.</i>

379
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,761
<i>The rhino is the self-appointed
fire-prevention officer.</i>

380
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:47,266
<i>When he sees a fire,
he rushes in and stamps it out.</i>

381
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:07,661
-Do you work here in Botswana?
-Yes, I-- Yes. Yes.

382
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,788
And what do you do?

383
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,084
I-- I collect manure. I--

384
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:16,587
Get away from-- Get away from--

385
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,965
Leave me alone!

386
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,160
Miss Thompson?

387
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,581
Miss Thompson?

388
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,085
Miss Thompson!

389
00:47:57,294 --> 00:48:01,465
Miss Thompson!
Oh, it's all right. He's gone.

390
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,592
-Who's gone?
-The rhinoceros.

391
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,469
What bloody rhinoceros?

392
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:08,472
Didn't you see him?
He stamped out the fire.

393
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:10,682
You stamped out the fire.
I saw you.

394
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:14,269
No, he did it first.
I didn't want him to come back, so....

395
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,396
-But didn't you see?
-Keep away.

396
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:22,486
Miss Thompson, if you make a fire,
and a rhinoceros sees it...

397
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,488
...he comes and stamps it out.

398
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,076
Rhinos do that.
It's a most interesting phenomenon.

399
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,871
You get sudden urges, and come
up with warthogs and rhinoceroses.

400
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,584
All right, I'll show you.
I'll make another fire.

401
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:42,589
Think I'm lying. I'll show you.

402
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:50,973
You see how I'm making another fire?

403
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:54,059
You'll see he'll come back.
Think I'm a liar.

404
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,487
Maybe it's too far away.

405
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,489
Maybe it's upwind.

406
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:25,299
Mr. Steyn.

407
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,692
Ask them. They'll tell you
rhinoceroses always stamp out fires.

408
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,694
I don't speak the language.

409
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:48,488
Okay, I'll ask them.

410
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,580
-See?
-I noticed.

411
00:49:56,788 --> 00:50:01,668
They're Tswanas. They always shake
their heads when they mean to say yes.

412
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,283
What are you doing?

413
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:36,286
I'm making coffee.

414
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,178
Some people didn't show
me their passports.

415
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,890
They smashed the barrier.
They've got guns. This is Frank.

416
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:58,976
<i>-Were they in two jeeps?</i>
-Yes, sir.

417
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:01,895
<i>They're being followed by
armoured cars. Can you see them?</i>

418
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:04,398
Excuse me, sir.

419
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,069
-Yes, sir. I can see one.
<i>-Stop them!</i>

420
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:10,571
Yes, sir.

421
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:13,198
Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

422
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:18,078
<i>Frank?</i>

423
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,164
<i>Frank? Frank, what was that noise?</i>

424
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:24,168
<i>Frank?</i>

425
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,879
I stopped them, sir.

426
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,382
<i>Right. Explain that they cannot cross
our border under arms.</i>

427
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,886
<i>We cannot allow them to violate
our territorial integrity.</i>

428
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:38,765
Request permission to cross
your border in hot pursuit of Sam Boga.

429
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:42,686
<i>Sorry. We cannot allow an armed force
to come into Botswana.</i>

430
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,480
I gotta get Sam Boga.
He shot up half our Cabinet.

431
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:49,776
<i>Our police will track him down and
hand him over to you, dead or alive.</i>

432
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:03,290
Bye. Bye. Can't they help us?

433
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:05,792
They'll take a message to the river.

434
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,879
I think I can get the thing
out of the river.

435
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:12,382
There's an electric winch on the front.

436
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,083
Mr. Steyn?

437
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,794
Mr. Steyn!

438
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:36,175
-Miss Thompson?
-Could you help me, please?

439
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,594
Don't look.

440
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,390
That's a watape tree. You mustn't go
near a watape tree. They grab you.

441
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,895
Could you hand me my gown, please?
It's in the suitcase.

442
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,195
The pink one with the white edging.

443
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:08,874
Ow! Thank you.

444
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,962
Sorry.

445
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,892
Sorry.

446
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,361
Sorry.

447
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:01,385
Thank you very much. Thank you.

448
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:38,088
<i>That morning, Xi saw the ugliest
person he'd ever come across.</i>

449
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:42,092
<i>She was as pale as something
that had crawled out of a rotting log.</i>

450
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:43,969
<i>Her hair was quite gruesome...</i>

451
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:47,181
<i>...long and stringy and white,
as if she was very old.</i>

452
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:48,765
<i>She was very big.</i>

453
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:53,187
<i>You'd have to dig the whole day
to find enough food to feed her.</i>

454
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:01,278
Go away.

455
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:07,284
<i>Although it was a hot day,
she was wearing skins...</i>

456
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:11,079
<i>...that looked as if they
were made from cobwebs.</i>

457
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:17,794
<i>She was doing strange
and magical things.</i>

458
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:20,380
<i>It struck him that she must be
one of the gods.</i>

459
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,883
<i>He wondered what she
was doing on earth.</i>

460
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,969
<i>He was glad he met her.
He'd give her the evil thing...</i>

461
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:28,180
<i>...and go home to his family.</i>

462
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:32,684
<i>He said tactfully that he didn't need
the thing, and she could have it back.</i>

463
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:36,563
<i>But she was very rude,
and she walked away.</i>

464
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:44,196
-That's a Bushman. How'd he get here?
-I don't know. He's rude.

465
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:47,074
<i>There was another god.
He had a fire inside him.</i>

466
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,993
<i>The smoke came out
through his mouth and nostrils.</i>

467
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:53,664
<i>Xi said politely, "It was kind of you
to send us this thing...</i>

468
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:56,667
<i>...but it made my family unhappy.
Please take it. "</i>

469
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,086
Sorry, no
<i>sabe.</i>

470
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,296
Where's the truck?

471
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:18,272
I'll try and get it down.

472
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,985
<i>There was a peculiar sound, and Xi saw
a most amazing animal approaching.</i>

473
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:25,696
<i>It's legs went around
instead of up and down.</i>

474
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:28,365
<i>And there was
a weird-looking god on its back.</i>

475
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:31,285
<i>He wore blue skin on his head
and red on his body.</i>

476
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:33,370
<i>And hair grew on his face.</i>

477
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:37,374
What the hell happened?
Where have you been?

478
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,960
<i>The funny thing was
that they couldn't speak.</i>

479
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:41,879
<i>They made sounds like monkeys.</i>

480
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:46,300
-Hi.
-What happened? Where's the antichrist?

481
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:52,764
What the hell did you do that for, huh?

482
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,475
I'll tell you later. Let's get it down.

483
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,770
And the little Bushman?
What's he doing in these parts?

484
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:02,065
I don't know. He was trying
to tell me something.

485
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,361
-You speak Bushman?
-Yeah.

486
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:12,492
<i>The hairy one could speak.</i>

487
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,667
He says, "Thanks for the bottle,
but you can have it back."

488
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:22,377
I didn't give it to him.

489
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:26,798
-Well, he don't want the bottle.
-Then he'd better throw it away.

490
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:32,387
<i>The hairy one said, "We don't want it.
You'll have to throw it away yourself. "</i>

491
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:34,473
<i>Xi was very disappointed.</i>

492
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:38,060
<i>It was unfair of the gods to make him
throw it off the earth.</i>

493
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:43,190
<i>In fact, he began to doubt
whether they really were gods.</i>

494
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,162
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get in there.

495
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,499
Get in there! Move it! Move it!

496
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:04,461
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

497
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:34,700
Yes, yes, yes. Here comes
the great white hunter to the rescue.

498
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,493
Miss Thompson, I presume.

499
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,080
Hello, Steyn. How would you like
to travel in style for a change?

500
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:42,791
Yes, thank you.

501
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:47,379
How do you open this thing?
With a can opener?

502
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,886
Quaint. Milady?

503
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:57,598
-Thank you very much, Mr. Steyn, for....
-Bye-bye, Steyn.

504
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,974
Goodbye, Miss Thompson.

505
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:00,767
By the way, I am Jack Hind.

506
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:03,979
The Reverend's worried.
He got to me on the short-wave...

507
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:07,274
...so I offered to look for you.
That was very sweet of me.

508
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:09,985
-It sure was.
-Would you like to sit over there?

509
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:11,361
Sure.

510
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:14,364
Thank you, Mr. Steyn.

511
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,784
See you, Steyn. See you, Mpudi.

512
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:54,863
I don't want to talk about it.

513
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:59,493
She thinks I'm a lunatic,
and I don't blame her.

514
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:04,790
You know, she asks me what do I do,
and I say I collect manure.

515
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:08,168
I don't tell her I analyse it
for my doctoral thesis.

516
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:11,672
I bet you she thinks I shovel the stuff.

517
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,592
Was it rough?

518
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:18,470
I'd rather not talk about it.

519
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,097
That rough.

520
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,392
It won't be long now,
and your suffering will be over.

521
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,271
When you get there, you'll have to
stand there and look beautiful...

522
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,566
...while the whole tribe sings
their welcome song at you.

523
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:33,777
Then you can relax, have a bath
and a nice breakfast.

524
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:37,990
Is it true that when a rhino sees a fire,
he stamps it out?

525
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:42,286
Where did you hear that one?
Did Steyn tell you?

526
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:44,288
Why would he tell you that?

527
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,082
I'd rather not talk about it.

528
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:51,295
-Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
-That's all I need.

529
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,594
She wouldn't believe me about
the warthog and the rhinoceros.

530
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,597
-What rhinoceros?
-I don't want to talk about it.

531
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:04,683
So how did this thing get up the tree?

532
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:08,687
She got stuck in a watape tree
and I had to....

533
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:12,399
You know she's got flowers
on her panties?

534
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:15,694
So that's how this thing got up the tree.

535
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:17,988
Yes.

536
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:00,197
Don't I wave or take a bow
or something?

537
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,074
No.

538
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:23,262
<i>Notorious Communist guerrilla leader
Sam Boga and his band...</i>

539
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:25,681
<i>...have crashed through into Botswana.</i>

540
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:28,892
<i>-They are heading for Mozambique.</i>
-Well, how many?

541
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,769
Not even 300.

542
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:33,272
I told you bastards,
don't waste ammunition!

543
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,774
Now we can't even fight back anymore.

544
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:40,279
All of you switch your guns over
from automatic to single-fire.

545
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:44,283
<i>Anyone withholding information
which could lead to their capture--</i>

546
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:47,077
That's automatic. That's single.

547
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:50,664
<i>Citizens are warned that Sam Boga
is a dangerous person...</i>

548
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:55,377
<i>...and that he and his gang
are well-armed. So it'll be unwise--</i>

549
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:57,296
And why are you so beautiful?

550
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:59,798
I'm going to the school
to give her these.

551
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,592
You gonna look like that?

552
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:03,468
-Like what?
-Like it's a funeral.

553
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:06,263
You've gotta smile
and tell her she looks good.

554
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,265
How are you an expert on women?

555
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:10,475
I got seven wives. How many you got?

556
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:13,979
-Why aren't you at home with them?
-I know how to marry them.

557
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:18,358
-Nobody knows how to live with them.
-So, what did you marry them for?

558
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:23,197
Someday I have to tell you
the facts of life.

559
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:32,289
"And yet we all agree
that every plate we break...

560
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:35,083
...was cracked by Mr. Nobody.

561
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:38,962
'Tis he who tears our books, who--"

562
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,273
Come in.

563
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:01,568
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

564
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,488
Morning, class.

565
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:07,282
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

566
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,661
I-- I brought--

567
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:37,896
Please, just leave it.

568
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:43,360
I brought you your shoes.

569
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:51,285
Come in.

570
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,960
Come in.

571
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,591
Shoe.

572
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:27,571
You don't want to talk about it, huh?

573
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:32,576
Shame.

574
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:50,260
<i>The animals looked ridiculous
but good to eat...</i>

575
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:51,762
<i>...and he was hungry.</i>

576
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:27,673
<i>Suddenly a young boy made
chattering noises at Xi.</i>

577
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:30,676
<i>So he said, "I shot
one of those animals.</i>

578
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:34,263
<i>It'll go to sleep soon,
and then we can eat it. "</i>

579
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:39,768
<i>But the boy ran away, maybe to call
his family to join in the feast.</i>

580
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:02,499
<i>There was a weird sound...</i>

581
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:06,461
<i>...and another of those strange animals
with the round legs appeared.</i>

582
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,677
<i>The young boy and a grownup got
out of it, and seemed very excited.</i>

583
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:17,181
<i>Xi said, "Come, sit down.
There's enough meat for all of us. "</i>

584
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:25,480
<i>But the man was rude and greedy.
He took the whole animal.</i>

585
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,569
<i>He said, "You have very bad manners.</i>

586
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:34,698
<i>If you eat the whole thing,
I'll have to shoot another for myself. "</i>

587
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:40,579
<i>The man shouted,
but he didn't want anything to do...</i>

588
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,999
<i>...with such an uncouth person,
so he ignored him.</i>

589
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,960
<i>Suddenly there was a thunderclap.</i>

590
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,881
<i>The animals ran away, and he ran
after them. He was very hungry.</i>

591
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:10,692
Do you speak English?

592
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:14,279
You are free to remain silent
until you have seen your lawyer.

593
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:18,659
If you speak now, whatever you say will
be taken down as evidence against you.

594
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,886
And why are you so beautiful?

595
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:39,888
I got to go to court.

596
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:41,598
What did you do?

597
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:45,769
The cops were here. They say they
caught a little Bushman for stock theft.

598
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:49,982
They say all he can speak is "Xixo,"
so they want me to interpret.

599
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:50,274
Xixo.

600
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:53,569
Xixo.

601
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:00,284
<i>They brought Xi into a place
with several people.</i>

602
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:04,371
<i>He smiled at them in greeting,
but nobody smiled back.</i>

603
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:16,967
Interpreter.

604
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:28,562
You, Xixo, are hereby charged with
wrongfully and unlawfully slaughtering...

605
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:33,192
...one goat on the 21st of September,
1980, in Oniamatokwe.

606
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,069
How plead you?
Guilty or not guilty?

607
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:40,073
<i>Mpudi found it difficult to interpret
because, in his language...</i>

608
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:42,284
<i>...there was no word for "guilty. "</i>

609
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:48,373
Finally he asked,
"Did you shoot an animal?"

610
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:53,378
<i>Xi said, "Yes, I did, but that man took it.
He did not want to share it with me. "</i>

611
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:57,090
-Well, what does he plead?
-Not guilty.

612
01:10:57,174 --> 01:11:01,678
-They gave him the death sentence.
-For killing a goat? No.

613
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:06,767
Three months in jail, same thing.
He gonna die for sure.

614
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:10,062
He never seen a wall.
Now, he got walls all around him.

615
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:12,397
But didn't you explain to them?

616
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:16,777
-They said, "Silence in court."
-Yeah, but surely they ought to know.

617
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:20,364
Nobody knows the Bushmen.

618
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:23,575
Nobody ever goes
into the deep Kalahari.

619
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:26,370
How come you know so much
about them?

620
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:31,166
When Botswana belonged to the British,
I hit a policeman for insulting my father.

621
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:34,461
So I fled, right into the Kalahari.

622
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,381
I died, you know. Dehydration.

623
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:40,384
Some of those little buggers
found me, and buried me.

624
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:41,885
Only my head stuck out.

625
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:45,180
For two weeks, they pushed water
and food into my mouth.

626
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,766
And when they dug me up,
I was nearly white.

627
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:49,268
Like you.

628
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,064
I lived with them for three years.
They're the sweetest little buggers.

629
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,567
He gonna die for sure.

630
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:11,582
Can I go to Mahadi tomorrow?

631
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,293
You wanna go and see
little what's his name?

632
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:16,587
I want to get him out.

633
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,797
Now, don't do anything silly.

634
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:21,091
They got to let him out.

635
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:24,678
Maybe if we explain to them.

636
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:28,390
-You coming too?
-Yes.

637
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:51,872
Says he's sorry.
He try to eat the food tomorrow.

638
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,959
-Has he eaten anything? It's been a week.
-No.

639
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,465
Of course we're worried.
We can't force-feed him.

640
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:04,468
-You've got to let him out.
-He's got 11 weeks to go.

641
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:08,388
Well, is there no way?
Can't we buy him out or something?

642
01:13:08,472 --> 01:13:12,059
Well, if somebody wants to employ
him as a convict-labourer.

643
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:14,770
But he has no experience,
no qualifications.

644
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:16,688
He got qualifications.

645
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:19,900
He can teach you things
about plants and animals.

646
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:24,279
Yes. We want to employ him
as an ecological expert.

647
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,375
He will have to remain in your employ
for the full 11 weeks.

648
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:40,295
If he leaves, we will hunt him down
and lock him up for a long time.

649
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,172
Okay, thanks.

650
01:13:57,688 --> 01:13:59,565
We can't put him inside.

651
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,400
No, you're right.

652
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,489
I understand the words,
but the meaning....

653
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:53,869
Talks about a bad thing,
an evil thing.

654
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:56,163
And about the end of the world.

655
01:14:56,371 --> 01:15:00,584
Well, explain to him he has
to stay with us for the full 11 weeks.

656
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:04,963
-He doesn't know from weeks.
-We'll tell him when it's okay to go.

657
01:15:12,763 --> 01:15:15,265
-Hello, Andrew. Mpudi.
-Hello, Jack.

658
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:17,559
I hear a Bushman's working for you.

659
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,770
Yeah, his name is Xi.

660
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:22,689
-Are they good trackers?
-Best in the world.

661
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:24,191
Mind if I borrow him?

662
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,069
One of my guests wounded a cougar.
My trackers can't find it.

663
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,994
This is where we lost him.

664
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:59,268
You'll see, he'll find him.

665
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:15,284
Hey! Hey!

666
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:31,592
Scram, go away!

667
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:34,261
Get!

668
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:39,683
Go away!

669
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:57,367
-I'm sorry, I didn't realise--
-I don't want to talk about it.

670
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,963
What do you want?

671
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:14,092
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Get them out.

672
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:17,471
Come on. Get him.
Hurry up, man.

673
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:32,569
You can drop those guns.

674
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:41,870
Bastard.

675
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:43,997
You want me to let fly?

676
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:50,671
Now get out.
With your hands up.

677
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,762
Bring out all the kids.

678
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:05,394
Sergeant, I'm going to walk due east
from here to Motambe...

679
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,771
...and I'm taking
all these kids with me.

680
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,191
If I see one truck or one aeroplane
or one policeman...

681
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:13,777
...or one soldier or one person...

682
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:16,572
...we'll mow these kids down.

683
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,991
-Have you got shortwave in there?
-Yes.

684
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:24,872
Now get on to headquarters, and tell them
I want a corridor 10 miles wide.

685
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,792
The army and the police
better clear out everybody.

686
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:32,296
And they've got to put down food
and water every 20 miles.

687
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:36,675
And then get the hell out of the way
before we get there. Tell them that.

688
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:41,972
All right, get them into a circle.
I want a big circle around me.

689
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:45,559
Leave the small ones. It's miles
to Motambe. They'll never make it.

690
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:51,190
Okay, now buzz off.

691
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:53,275
Clear out the people from this end...

692
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:56,570
...because I want to start marching
in two hours.

693
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:03,285
And I warn you,
you better clear out everybody.

694
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,082
Clutch.

695
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:16,381
Brake. Brake.

696
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:19,384
Clutch. Clutch!

697
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,391
I'm teaching him to drive.
Just for the hell of it.

698
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,977
Nothing else to do around here anyhow.

699
01:19:29,186 --> 01:19:32,189
-Still mooning about the schoolmarm?
-Sort of.

700
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:35,776
I want to move up to Nioko for a
few days so we can do a game count.

701
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:39,363
-How will this get us through the jungle?
-We strip it down.

702
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:57,673
Come on, Xi. Come on!

703
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:04,471
He don't know from doors.

704
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:42,885
Stop playing that bloody game.

705
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:45,262
Okay, it's time. Let's go.
Move them.

706
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:46,889
Come on. Everybody up.

707
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:49,975
Come on, let's go.
Keep them going.

708
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:51,977
Keep them in a circle around me.

709
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,563
Move them!
Don't leave any stragglers.

710
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,191
-Keep your paws to yourself!
-Shut up.

711
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:01,069
Get them into a circle.
A circle, a circle!

712
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:05,866
-Stop yelling at them.
-That's not a bloody circle.

713
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,577
-Can't you do anything right?
-I can't get them into a circle.

714
01:21:08,785 --> 01:21:10,495
They keep coming up in a square.

715
01:21:10,662 --> 01:21:13,373
Then, make it a square.
Let them walk in a square.

716
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:16,460
Keep them going.
Don't let them straggle.

717
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:19,880
Who says they'll come this way?

718
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:23,467
He says he wants a corridor
10 miles wide.

719
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:28,388
I'm sorry. We'll have to get out of the way
for now until he passes this point.

720
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,474
Where can I find Andrew Steyn?

721
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:33,477
You'd better warn him too.
He's five miles that way.

722
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:35,062
You turn right at the....

723
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,272
Damn it, I'll come and show you.

724
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:40,692
Johnny, will you take them to Machadi?

725
01:21:56,875 --> 01:22:00,879
Tell them to sing.
Come on, everybody. Sing, sing!

726
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:26,381
Wouldn't you know?

727
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,175
Now where do we find him?

728
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:35,390
They left this morning.

729
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:38,060
Come on!

730
01:24:06,964 --> 01:24:08,465
They went through.

731
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,592
They'll meet up with Boga for sure.

732
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:14,388
-Is there a way around this?
-It's a hell of a long way.

733
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:16,181
Well, let's go.

734
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,590
Mpudi.

735
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:13,989
One, two, three, four, five...

736
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:16,283
...six adult oryx.

737
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:23,081
He says there are people
things down there.

738
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,375
-Where?
-Down there.

739
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:38,597
Army truck. Unloading something.

740
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:42,684
I wonder what they're up to.

741
01:25:46,063 --> 01:25:49,399
Looks like food.
Cooking pots and stuff.

742
01:25:50,067 --> 01:25:51,693
Maybe it's a picnic.

743
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:55,197
Funny. They're going away.

744
01:25:57,574 --> 01:26:02,079
-They went away and left their stuff.
-Yeah, funny.

745
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:05,874
Oh, well.

746
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,585
One, two, three, four, five, six....

747
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:31,775
You've got to let them rest.

748
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:34,486
The smaller ones can't keep up.

749
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,780
They can rest
when they get to the food.

750
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:40,284
-You're driving them too hard.
-It's a long way to Motambe.

751
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:43,579
You said 20 miles.
They can't walk 20 miles without eating.

752
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,163
Halt!

753
01:26:52,963 --> 01:26:54,673
Look at that!

754
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:58,677
I told you,
stop playing that bloody game!

755
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:05,684
You've got to let
the little ones turn back.

756
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,686
Nobody turns back.

757
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:11,481
Next thing,
everybody's gonna get sore feet.

758
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,484
Next one drops out, I shoot him!

759
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:18,488
You, you, help her.
If you got to carry her, carry her.

760
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:22,659
If I catch you playing again,
by God....

761
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,661
March!

762
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,873
They can't march 20 miles.
They're not soldiers!

763
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:31,877
If they want to eat,
they'd better march 20 miles!

764
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:37,382
Are you scared it'll spoil your image
if you admit you made a mistake?

765
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:41,178
Halt!

766
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:50,395
You! Come here!

767
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:58,487
See that hill over there?

768
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:02,783
Go to the top, and wave this thing
until the army people see you.

769
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:09,081
Then you go down to them, and
tell them Sam Boga made a mistake.

770
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:15,796
Now I want them to leave food
every 1 0 miles.

771
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:17,673
-Understand?
-Yes.

772
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:19,883
Now, get going. Move!

773
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:25,973
March!

774
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,392
One ostrich and four, five...

775
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:31,186
...six, seven, eight--

776
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:45,284
A lot of children. The food
must have been left there for them.

777
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:47,870
-What the hell? They've got guns.
-The kids?

778
01:28:48,078 --> 01:28:52,291
No. There are men down there
with guns. It's no picnic.

779
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,085
I think those kids are hostages.

780
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:57,880
What was that on the news
about Sam Boga?

781
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:07,264
That man said I must go to the top,
and I must wave my conga.

782
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:15,564
So Miss Kate said 20 miles
is too much.

783
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:18,066
-Is she down there?
-Yes.

784
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:31,788
We'll have to immobilise them.

785
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:35,292
-Are Bushmen good stalkers?
-Best in the world.

786
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:37,294
Let him have a look at them.

787
01:29:44,468 --> 01:29:45,886
All right.

788
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:50,974
Explain to him that the men with the guns
are bad. We have to put them to sleep.

789
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:59,983
He want to know how did
those people get in there?

790
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:02,778
No, no, they're not....

791
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:05,280
You explain.

792
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:07,491
One hour, then we move!

793
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,868
I'm gonna have a snooze.

794
01:30:34,768 --> 01:30:36,061
"Dear Miss Thompson:

795
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:40,774
Your abductors have been injected
with an immobiliser.

796
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,570
When they go to sleep,
you must disarm them."

797
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:49,074
Tell him he must give her the note
only after he's shot all the men.

798
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:56,665
When he shoots, he must
pull back on the thread quickly...

799
01:30:56,874 --> 01:31:00,878
...so the man can think it was a horsefly
or a wasp that stung him.

800
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:12,472
He's fast. It'll work.

801
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:15,267
He must dip the needle each time.

802
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:52,888
I can't see the little bugger.

803
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,973
Yeah, I see him.

804
01:32:14,368 --> 01:32:15,786
Now, look at that.

805
01:32:16,495 --> 01:32:18,497
Yeah, he's clever.

806
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:26,273
Nothing's happening down there.

807
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:28,275
It takes time.

808
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:36,200
Who are you?

809
01:34:19,493 --> 01:34:23,288
Some of those guys are down.
She'll need help when they wake up.

810
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:28,877
Hey, wake up, man.
You gotta wake up.

811
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:32,798
Come on, you can't sleep now.
Come on.

812
01:34:56,864 --> 01:34:59,700
We need some rope.
There's plenty in the Land Rover.

813
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:02,578
He can fetch it.
I didn't teach him for nothing.

814
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,877
Says he don't understand the gears.

815
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:14,590
-Told him he can drive in any gear.
-Let's go!

816
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:16,466
And you take that one.

817
01:35:16,675 --> 01:35:18,886
And you, that one.

818
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:20,095
And I'll take--

819
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,266
There's only six.
There should be eight.

820
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:36,695
Maybe they're asleep as well.
I don't know.

821
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:41,867
All right.

822
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:45,495
I want you to circulate
among the children.

823
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:49,166
Quietly. And tell them that
when we grab the guns...

824
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:52,961
...they must run fast into that crevice
behind us and take cover.

825
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:55,380
Okay? Good.

826
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:10,187
Ready? Go!

827
01:36:16,485 --> 01:36:17,986
Come on!

828
01:36:25,994 --> 01:36:28,163
No! Get down, get down!

829
01:36:29,164 --> 01:36:30,999
And stay there!

830
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:37,381
Get back! All of you!

831
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:41,176
-Hey, watch it!
-Sorry.

832
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:57,359
We've got to outflank them.
You go around. I'll keep you covered.

833
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:21,091
Get back! Get back!

834
01:37:21,967 --> 01:37:23,760
Hurry up!

835
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:37,482
-You okay?
-Yep.

836
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:39,484
-Who are they shooting at?
-I don't know.

837
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:46,491
Four, five, six.

838
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:47,993
Two are missing.

839
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,871
This one here, and I heard
shots from over there.

840
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:01,465
Look.

841
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:19,483
Roll over.

842
01:38:21,276 --> 01:38:22,986
Mpudi, hold him.

843
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:51,575
What's happened?

844
01:39:51,992 --> 01:39:53,994
Have you got water in there?

845
01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:56,079
Hold these for me.

846
01:40:00,876 --> 01:40:03,670
-Get up.
-But what happened, man?

847
01:40:03,879 --> 01:40:05,797
Oh, it's a long story.

848
01:40:06,298 --> 01:40:09,092
What happened to those guys?
Are they all dead?

849
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:12,179
Did you kill them?

850
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:13,972
They've been immobilised.

851
01:40:14,473 --> 01:40:16,391
Where's Kate and the kids?

852
01:40:16,475 --> 01:40:19,269
They're hiding back there.
They can come out now.

853
01:40:19,478 --> 01:40:21,063
Oh, my God. Mpudi.

854
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:24,983
Keep that guy covered.

855
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:36,286
Kate! It's okay.
You can come out now!

856
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:42,584
We've got everything under control.
You can come out!

857
01:40:42,793 --> 01:40:45,796
-Jack?
-Hi there. The marines have landed.

858
01:40:45,963 --> 01:40:48,298
It's okay. You can all come out.

859
01:40:49,174 --> 01:40:51,760
All right, come on. Come on.

860
01:41:08,193 --> 01:41:09,194
You're safe now.

861
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:13,365
Better collect those men before
they wake up. You were right.

862
01:41:13,574 --> 01:41:16,493
-Did you fix him good?
-Yeah, get up.

863
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:19,872
Walk.

864
01:41:29,298 --> 01:41:31,884
Boy, you had a tough time, huh?

865
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:33,677
Watch out!

866
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,470
Stop fooling around, Steyn.

867
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:38,682
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

868
01:41:55,699 --> 01:41:57,159
I'm sorry.

869
01:41:57,367 --> 01:41:59,870
It's all right, Steyn. Move.

870
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:10,380
Milady.

871
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:16,178
Sergeant, get on the radio and organise
some buses to take the kids home.

872
01:42:16,678 --> 01:42:18,889
How come suddenly he the big hero?

873
01:42:20,098 --> 01:42:22,893
We'd better get back to our equipment.

874
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:36,990
Says thank you, goodbye and
hopes you have lots of children.

875
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,868
-Tell him thanks. I'll miss him.
-He can't use that.

876
01:42:40,077 --> 01:42:42,371
-l have to--
-Bushmen don't know about money.

877
01:42:42,663 --> 01:42:45,666
-What can I give him?
-There's nothing here he can use.

878
01:42:45,874 --> 01:42:49,670
-Bushmen don't need things.
-He's gotta take the money. It's the law.

879
01:42:56,885 --> 01:42:59,763
He's going the wrong way.
The Kalahari's that way.

880
01:43:03,267 --> 01:43:06,061
Says he got to find the
evil thing and get rid of it.

881
01:43:06,395 --> 01:43:08,063
I don't know.

882
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:12,568
-I'm going to miss the little bugger.
-Yeah, me too.

883
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:15,279
-You gonna look like that forever?
-Like what?

884
01:43:15,362 --> 01:43:17,364
Like Jack Hind is better than you.

885
01:43:17,573 --> 01:43:20,993
-No, I'm going to talk to her.
-Tell her you were the big hero.

886
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:22,786
No, I can't do that.

887
01:43:22,995 --> 01:43:25,163
But I do want to talk to her.

888
01:43:25,372 --> 01:43:26,874
I'll tell her....

889
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:30,169
I'll say, "Look, Miss Thompson...

890
01:43:30,669 --> 01:43:32,588
...I know you think I'm an idiot...

891
01:43:32,671 --> 01:43:34,965
...but normally I'm quite normal.

892
01:43:35,174 --> 01:43:38,177
It's only when I'm in the presence
of a lady that I....

893
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:41,763
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

894
01:43:41,972 --> 01:43:46,685
If a man who is susceptible to a type
of para-Freudian syndrome like this...

895
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:49,271
...encounters a nubile
female, what happens?"

896
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,399
I suppose another big word happens.

897
01:43:52,983 --> 01:43:55,986
-Too erudite?
-Yeah, whatever that means.

898
01:43:56,195 --> 01:43:58,989
Okay. I'll put it more simply. I'll say:

899
01:43:59,865 --> 01:44:01,575
"Look, Miss Thompson.

900
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:05,162
Kate. Kate.

901
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:08,665
It's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon."

902
01:44:08,874 --> 01:44:11,668
She'll understand that bit.
She's a schoolteacher.

903
01:44:11,877 --> 01:44:14,796
I'll say, "When there's no lady present...

904
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,382
...I can catch an insect
without hurting it."

905
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:20,469
If she knew me better, she'd
see I'm not a stumblebum.

906
01:44:20,677 --> 01:44:25,182
-All I need is a little practise. If I--
-Wait for me. You need moral support.

907
01:44:46,286 --> 01:44:47,663
There she is.

908
01:44:51,959 --> 01:44:54,962
You better do your thing
before the pupils come.

909
01:44:55,295 --> 01:44:56,797
Yeah.

910
01:45:03,178 --> 01:45:04,680
Morning.

911
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:07,182
Morning, Miss Thompson.

912
01:45:07,599 --> 01:45:09,184
Morning.

913
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:11,687
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks. How are you?

914
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:13,564
Fine, thanks, and how are you?

915
01:45:14,565 --> 01:45:16,275
I'm fine, thank you.

916
01:45:19,194 --> 01:45:20,863
Kate...

917
01:45:21,196 --> 01:45:23,490
...I know you think I'm an idiot...

918
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:26,493
...but I'm not really like that. It's...

919
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,662
...only when I'm around wom--

920
01:45:29,788 --> 01:45:32,082
Around you. I'm sorry.

921
01:45:32,791 --> 01:45:35,169
Normally, I'm quite normal.

922
01:45:35,377 --> 01:45:38,297
But whenever I'm
in the presence of a lady...

923
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:43,594
...my fingers turn into thumbs,
my brain switches off.

924
01:45:44,178 --> 01:45:45,596
Watch it!

925
01:45:50,184 --> 01:45:51,560
It's flour.

926
01:45:51,768 --> 01:45:53,187
I noticed.

927
01:45:53,896 --> 01:45:55,772
It's actually--

928
01:46:00,068 --> 01:46:04,781
Actually, it's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

929
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:07,784
Perhaps it's some Freudian syndrome.

930
01:46:08,368 --> 01:46:11,163
When I brought you your shoes,
I came to apologise...

931
01:46:11,371 --> 01:46:14,499
...for the stupid things I did
when I met you at Mabula.

932
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:17,169
To explain that I'm not as stupid as that.

933
01:46:17,461 --> 01:46:19,796
But then, of course, I blew it, and I....

934
01:46:19,963 --> 01:46:22,674
So I don't blame you if you think....

935
01:46:22,966 --> 01:46:26,386
But it's really only an
interesting psychological....

936
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:32,768
When you get to know me better, you'll
see that I'm not always stumbling.

937
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:43,362
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

938
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:47,199
Yes, you are a very interesting
psychological phenomenon.

939
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:49,284
And I think you're very sweet.

940

<i>Xi was beginning to think he'd
never find the end of the earth.</i>

941
01:47:22,776 --> 01:47:25,362
<i>And one day, suddenly, there it was.</i>

942
01:47:25,387 --> 01:47:38,487
