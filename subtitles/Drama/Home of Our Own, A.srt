1
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,142
Bobby!

2
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,843
Bobby, are you in there with Amada?
Bobby!

3
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:12,320
- It's Jumbo.
- I'll be out in a second, Jumbo.

4
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,583
You gotta come out.

5
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,059
There's chicks dancing naked right
in the bar, in the lobby. Unbelievable.

6
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,458
- We gotta go.
- What?

7
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,690
- Bob!
- We gotta go.

8
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,266
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

9
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,101
Bob!

10
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,800
Fucking animal.

11
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,705
I gotta ask Mr. Buzhayev
if we can take the night off.

12
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,607
I love you.

13
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:39,348
I'm gonna run across the street.
You meet me at the car, okay?

14
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,746
- Okay. Go.
- Amada..

15
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:47,153
I'm the luckiest man on the planet.
If I died right now, I'd be happy.

16
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,139
Hey, Mr. Green,
thanks for hooking me up, man.

17
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,710
How are you?

18
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,573
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

19
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,443
You got the best club in Brooklyn.

20
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,642
Just wait
till I take over Manhattan, baby.

21
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,811
Hey, do me a favor. Get them
a couple of drinks, all right?

22
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:36,240
Hey, baby, give me my purse.
I'm meeting the family tonight.

23
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,501
I don't want Coco paying
for his shit tonight.

24
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,305
Not after that little mix-up
we had last weekend, ladies.

25
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,504
- All right.
- Bye.

26
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,148
Bye, Amada. Good luck, girl.

27
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,858
Take it off! Take it off!

28
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,498
Hey, get the fuck down here!

29
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,661
Hey, you! Get the fuck down!

30
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,567
Calm down. Let's give them space.
Good looking out, Jumbo.

31
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,075
No problem, Bob.

32
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,443
Oh, what the fuck?!

33
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,242
- Don't strain yourself.
- You got it.

34
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,646
Looks like everything's under control.
I'll take my break.

35
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,844
I didn't do nothing!

36
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,216
You're bleeding all over the place.
Go home.

37
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,483
- Freddie, take him home.
- I didn't do nothing.

38
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,684
Go easy on them, Jumbo.

39
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:44,233
I'm going across the street to see
the boss. Bring my car around.

40
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,310
- You got it. I need you to come..
- Be right back.

41
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:57,413
Hi, Kalina. Look at you.

42
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,289
You wanna go with me to
the club, huh? Do a little dance?

43
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,386
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey, Bobby.

44
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:09,625
- Hey, Mr. Buzhayev, how are you?
- Look, she got the watch.

45
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,100
Oh, yeah, it's great. I told you.
He's the best.

46
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,262
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I know deals.

47
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,464
Digital.

48
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,236
Yeah, it's great. Hey, listen.
I gotta go do something tonight..

49
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:23,313
but Freddie will watch the place,
make the night drop later.

50
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,246
Good. So how is my club doing?

51
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,783
- Everything's fine.
- Good.

52
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,911
For me? Just this one.

53
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,422
Amada tells me I put on 5 pounds
every time I come over here.

54
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,255
I'm telling you,
you guys are fattening me up.

55
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:39,786
- Good?
- Excellent.

56
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,424
Always. Real good. Excellent.

57
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:44,330
Listen, Bobby..

58
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:49,736
Next week you come by, we talk.
We talk about plans for you.

59
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,138
We like what you do
at the club very much.

60
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,335
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah.

61
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,146
- Good.
- Something more?

62
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,114
More? I just said I can't eat it.
I can't even eat this.

63
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,977
I can't have another bite.

64
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,249
What are you doing to me?

65
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,892
No, no, no, Amada's waiting.
I have to go.

66
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,253
You're too good to me.

67
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,658
Why do I deserve this?

68
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,301
- No, I gotta go.
- Where? Where you run off to?

69
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,172
It's my bike. Don't!

70
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,157
- Keep being brave, okay?
- Thank you.

71
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:47,355
Thank you.

72
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,168
- Here comes the right. Watch the right.
- Catch.

73
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,104
- Keep.. Keep it up. Keep the guard..
- Careful.

74
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,301
- Sorry, babe. Keep..
- Joseph.

75
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,140
- All right, hey. Hey.
- Joseph.

76
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,441
- Hey, quit fooling around.
- Did he bag it?

77
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,278
No, he never did. His gun jammed,
so he started crying.

78
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,976
That's terrible. A nine-point?

79
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,622
- Joseph, come on.
- Pop's calling. Look..

80
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,985
we'll go to Metropole,
cut loose a little.

81
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,490
- You got it.
- Come over here.

82
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,252
Gotcha.

83
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:21,088
Get your picture taken.
It's your big night.

84
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,325
- We took them already.
- The more, the better.

85
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,561
- Get your face out there.
- Stevie, come here.

86
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,001
The P.C. will see this in the magazine,
all right?

87
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,835
- All right.
- Get used to it, it's good. Come on.

88
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,844
- Good.
- Thanks, chief.

89
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,404
Go over there to Mommy,
all right?

90
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:38,412
It's almost 11.
Where's your brother?

91
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,347
If he comes at all, he'll come late,
Pop. You know him.

92
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,449
Baby.

93
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,414
There's cops all around.

94
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,553
- They're all fucking drunk anyways.
- Give me some.

95
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:55,630
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be nervous. They're harmless.

96
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,963
Jumbo came through.
It's good, right?

97
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,130
Yeah, it's good. Okay.

98
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,210
You coming?

99
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,855
Do we have to? I don't know if I can
fucking deal with them tonight.

100
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:21,151
Come on, honey. It's your family.
You gotta support them.

101
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,055
Hey, remember
what I told you, right?

102
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,890
Nobody at the club knows about
my family. Not even Jumbo.

103
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:28,089
I know. Baby, I won't
say anything. Come on.

104
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,565
Last thing I need is anybody
thinking I'm a fucking cop.

105
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,267
- Never happen, baby.
- I could be a cop.

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
- What do you have to do?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

107
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:42,203
Freeze. All right, spread them.
Spread them. Move!

108
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,041
- Get him! Get him!
- Arrest her.

109
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:47,116
- Where you going?
- Just kidding, officers.

110
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,049
He must know someone
because I'm talking about..

111
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,882
Shit. Oh, shit, look at this.

112
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,890
Bobby. Bobby Grusinsky.
Is that you?

113
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,790
It's me, Russ De Keifer
from across Union Turnpike.

114
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,191
- How you doing?
- All right.

115
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,299
- Still bartending at that Russian joint?
- I'm managing it now.

116
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,991
Hey, listen to you.

117
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,933
- Did he just call you "Grusinsky"?
- I'll talk to you later.

118
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,094
That guy's funny.

119
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,807
Oh, my God.

120
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,880
That's them.
In the corner down there.

121
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,354
Hey, Pop.

122
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:31,091
They don't look that bad,
though, for cops.

123
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,358
All right, let's go.

124
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,628
- He's got company.
- Give me a break.

125
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,030
- Here comes trouble.
- Look at you.

126
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,540
- You came.
- Congratulations, you're moving up.

127
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,679
Mr. Big Shot honors us
with his presence.

128
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,381
- At your service. You look great.
- Thanks.

129
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,380
Everybody,
this is my girlfriend, Amada.

130
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,314
- That's my father..
- Nice to meet you.

131
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:56,954
Chief Burt Grusinsky.

132
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,919
- My brother, Joe.
- Hi.

133
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,580
That's Michael and Jack.

134
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,283
You guys look good.

135
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,760
- You put up with this guy?
- I'm a Leo. I can put up with anything.

136
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,632
If you got a minute,
we'd like to talk to you.

137
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,236
- Let's get a drink first.
- No, right now. Right now.

138
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,172
It's only gonna take a minute.

139
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,240
- Upstairs in the church.
- "Right now."

140
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,899
Come on.

141
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,272
Don't worry. We'll bring him back
in one piece.

142
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,181
That's a great crowd
you got down there, Joe.

143
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:35,190
- You know all the right people.
- That's a nice suit you got, Bobby.

144
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:37,052
Was that funny?

145
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,992
I didn't know you had a sense
of humor, Michael. I like it.

146
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,963
How much did that earring
set you back?

147
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,029
- What?
- You heard what I said.

148
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,570
Bobby, I asked Pop
to bring you up here.

149
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:53,207
- Bobby. Please, I'm serious.
- Why? What's the matter?

150
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,146
I'll be heading up this new
narcotics team starting this week.

151
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,909
Russian unit
out of PSA-One in Brighton.

152
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,043
What?

153
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,121
You brought me up here
to tell me that?

154
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,329
Do any of you fucking guys talk?

155
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,762
- You ever say anything back there?
- I'm old-fashioned. I listen first.

156
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,602
Oh, God. Excuse me.

157
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,829
We're looking at this guy,
Vadim Nezhinski.

158
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:24,770
Served time in the Soviet Union
for black-market activity..

159
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:29,903
come over in 1979.
He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust.

160
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,674
This guy's bringing in major weight
and we need to track it.

161
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,082
He's operating out of that spot
you manage, the El Caribe.

162
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,858
Oh, I don't know nothing
about that. I'm not..

163
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,722
No, we know. We checked
the rest of the management too..

164
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,456
his uncle, the owner.
- The old man?

165
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:50,795
- Well, he is his uncle.
- You been fucking watching me too?

166
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:55,167
Everybody else came up clean.
It's just Nezhinski we're looking at.

167
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,905
You want me to inform?

168
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:01,569
No.

169
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,271
- Are you kidding me?
- Just observe, that's all.

170
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,316
It's a closed community.
You're our only way in right now.

171
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:11,055
Great. You guys are the fucking cops.
Why are you coming to me?

172
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,019
Why..? Why is this my problem?

173
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:18,127
The whole city's falling apart. Don't
you have any sense of responsibility?

174
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,325
Let me think.

175
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:23,626
No. No, not really. I don't.
I got enough fucking problems, Joe.

176
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,702
The streets are
in fucking chaos, Bobby.

177
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,703
- Our guys are dropping like flies.
- Joseph, come on. L..

178
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:33,071
Joseph, you go downstairs.
Let me talk to him, all right?

179
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:36,042
- Yeah, thanks for coming.
- It's always a pleasure. Thank you.

180
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,682
You better be careful out there
the next couple weeks.

181
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,477
- What's that mean?
- You know.

182
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,746
- Joseph.
- Fine, Pop. You fucking deal with him.

183
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:49,560
- Take care, Bobby.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:54,364
Move over. Move over.

185
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,527
Been a long time
since we've seen you.

186
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:03,206
Your brother says you don't
answer the phone anymore.

187
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,274
I've been busy, Pop.
That's all.

188
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,035
Yeah?

189
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:09,708
What's going on with you?

190
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,413
You can't talk?

191
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,451
I don't know.

192
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,486
You what?

193
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,248
Things are all right.

194
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,393
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

195
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,720
Yeah?

196
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:27,888
You know, I could've gotten you
a good job with us, a safe job.

197
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,460
If you would have asked.
If you'd been around.

198
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,803
I got a job. I got a job. A good job.

199
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,908
That's the whole point
of this conversation we had.

200
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:41,204
That's why your brother was here,
because of this club.

201
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:50,652
Your brother says that you've been
using your mother's name these days.

202
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,813
Yeah, just for the business.
You know, it's easy.

203
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,290
"Bobby Green"?

204
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:59,294
Well, people can pronounce it,
you know?

205
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:02,797
That Puerto Rican you brought.
She been hooking you up?

206
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,998
- What do you mean?
- Come on, I can smell it on you.

207
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,071
You keep laughing.

208
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,641
Your mother, rest in peace,
I think she was too easy on you.

209
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,541
All right.

210
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,344
I gotta go, Pop.

211
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,647
Bobby, let me tell you something.

212
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:29,282
Sooner or later,
either you're gonna be with us..

213
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,224
or you're gonna be
with the drug dealers.

214
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,288
This is like a war out there.

215
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,761
Now, do you understand that?

216
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:41,464
Do you?

217
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:46,740
I'll see you.

218
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,175
Careful.

219
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,524
It's getting late. How are
the kids doing? They tired yet?

220
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,032
They're always tired. They worry
about you when you're out at night.

221
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:13,261
- Baby, sit up straight.
- Baby, do me a favor.

222
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,167
Don't start, all right?

223
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,267
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

224
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,840
Hi, my name is Deputy Commissioner
Spiro Giavannis..

225
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:27,507
and we're here this holiday season
to honor one of our new leaders..

226
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:28,777
Let's get out of here..

227
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,887
and go party with Jumbo.
- Why?

228
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:34,388
Baby, your family don't like me,
I don't care. I'm here for you, okay?

229
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,186
Fuck them. Let's go. It's boring.

230
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,022
- They're stiffs. Yeah.
- Really?

231
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,494
I'm sure the chief would like
to say a few words.

232
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,225
So I'd like to bring him
up here now. Chief?

233
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,605
Thank you. Thank you very much.

234
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,299
Yeah, chief.

235
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:55,913
You know, I used to tell my kids,
"Work first, play later."

236
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,243
And my son Joseph
really took that to heart.

237
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:03,612
Been a real fighter over the years.
He overcome the dyslexia..

238
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:07,815
and eventually wound up
graduating John Jay as salutatorian.

239
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,716
And hey..

240
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:13,022
I'm very proud here tonight.

241
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:27,535
I wanna thank you all for coming.
Happy Thanksgiving.

242
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,142
Before I say anything else..

243
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:33,374
one of our brothers was killed
in the line of duty last night.

244
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,946
Edward Conlon was gunned down..

245
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,452
serving a warrant
on Northern Boulevard.

246
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,318
Hey. Come here.

247
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:43,085
The clock is about to strike 11.

248
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:47,225
I thought we might be able to give
a moment of silence to remember.

249
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,279
- Come on, get over here.
- Which one?

250
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,716
Come on, I'm meeting with Buzhayev
tonight. Which one? This one?

251
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,977
That one. Hey, baby.

252
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,882
- I got good news.
- Yeah?

253
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:47,183
So I talked to my mom yesterday.
She's feeling better.

254
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,327
So I can move in whenever I want.

255
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,023
Really?

256
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,226
- Don't joke with me.
- I'm not.

257
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:00,837
I like it. I like it.

258
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:04,572
It's official. You get your side
of the bed, I get mine.

259
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,541
Seriously, it's great news.

260
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:11,011
- Hey, I got you something.
- What?

261
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:14,208
You've been working so hard lately.

262
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,617
- What is it?
- Open it up.

263
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,986
- Now?
- Go ahead, open it.

264
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,536
It's nice.

265
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,002
I like it.

266
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:38,835
Thank you.

267
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:42,908
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, babe.

268
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,811
We'll have a lot of kids..

269
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:48,884
big house.
- Yeah?

270
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:53,584
Can we get big kids
and a lot of houses?

271
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:56,018
Hey, Bobby! Get your ass out here.

272
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,630
It's probably Jumbo. Come on, let's
go hang out with them for a minute.

273
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,288
Everybody, the life of the party
is here.

274
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,229
Hey, Falsetti,
you get what we wanted?

275
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,200
Absolutely. I got a little of
what everybody asked for here.

276
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:11,307
I got uppers, I got downers.
Hash, mescaline, some blow.

277
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:14,501
The troops require sustenance.

278
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,712
Go, go, go!

279
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:56,782
You gotta get dressed.
You gotta get dressed.

280
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,819
Come on, get dressed.

281
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,525
You can't be late
for the boss, baby.

282
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:13,033
- Bobby!
- Well, hello, how are you?

283
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:16,838
I thought you could ride. Not riding
so good. You don't ride bareback?

284
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,737
How are you?

285
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:20,967
- Bobby.
- You wouldn't believe it.

286
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:26,048
It's 40 degrees out, line's halfway
around the block. It's unbelievable.

287
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,986
I'll grab something in a second,
thank you.

288
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,948
Take kids in the other room.

289
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:38,689
Don't worry, kids.

290
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:42,321
You will see Grandpa on Tuesday
to ride the horses.

291
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,466
Not on the furs!

292
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:46,162
- Bobby.
- Pop.

293
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,134
- Have a seat.
- Why? What'd I miss?

294
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:50,399
Listen, we're thinking
about expanding.

295
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:54,639
Maybe we'll open another spot
next year across from Brighton.

296
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:56,575
- I like it.
- Yeah, good.

297
00:21:56,747 --> 00:22:00,547
And we think you'll run it
and we'll do it exactly like here.

298
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:02,282
- Could be good.
- Good?

299
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,921
Good, yeah. Listen..

300
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,490
I've been thinking. If you wanna
open another spot, I mean..

301
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,856
why not try Manhattan?
- Manhattan's very expensive.

302
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,223
Depends on where you go.

303
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:15,991
I mean, you get in there now,
get something for cheap.

304
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,397
I'm talking a big space,
a big warehouse.

305
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,127
You get different levels going.

306
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,465
We could do something different
on each floor.

307
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,403
Like one floor could be rock 'n' roll.

308
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,669
Then you do another floor,
you got disco. Something like that.

309
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,646
He's got so many ideas!

310
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:36,145
And don't let your hair-brained
nephew Vadim screw it up!

311
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,515
It's a lot of money, Papa.

312
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:42,420
Your fur business can
support that right now?

313
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:46,052
My son-in-law, he worries people
take advantage of me.

314
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,219
I understand that.

315
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,889
But I think we can do something
special and different.

316
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:52,228
Worst-case scenario,
it's a great investment.

317
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,769
I mean, I think it's worth looking into.

318
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,341
All right.

319
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:00,568
So bring some details.
We'll figure out the numbers.

320
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,444
- Yeah?
- Okay?

321
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,046
Good.

322
00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:06,209
I love you.

323
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:16,859
Hey, who is this?

324
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:20,554
You are in the presence
of the future king of New York.

325
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,756
The future king?
What are you talking about?

326
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,458
Listen, nothing's definite
so don't say anything.

327
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:27,069
I was just with Mr. Buzhayev.

328
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:29,763
He's talking about opening
another spot in Manhattan.

329
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,400
He wants me to run it.
I want you, my brother, to be a host.

330
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:37,638
Of course! I'm a people person.
That's my specialty.

331
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:39,976
- I know.
- My fucking man.

332
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,982
I'm the "hoster" with the "moster."

333
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,020
That's beautiful news, Bob.
Beautiful.

334
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:48,448
Now you'll finally be getting me
all the women I deserve.

335
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,321
What's Amada doing
at Vadim's table?

336
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,596
She's doing what she's supposed
to do. She's charming the customers.

337
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:01,397
- What do you hear about him, Jumbo?
- I don't know what I hear.

338
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,167
- I hear stories.
- You hear stories. Like what?

339
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:06,673
Stories.

340
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:11,107
Like last year, one of his guys
was gonna rat him out.

341
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,113
Cops found his head
on Brighton Avenue.

342
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:17,118
- Fucking dick was in his mouth.
- Sure it wasn't your dick?

343
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,589
Are you sure it wasn't your mouth?

344
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:27,886
But I tell you, he wouldn't be
running around here like a king..

345
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,659
if his uncle didn't own the place,
that much I know.

346
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,029
I gotta get back to work.

347
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:34,933
All right. Nice talking to you. Bye.

348
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,173
I'm gonna go talk to Amada.

349
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:41,378
- All right, I'll see you later.
- I'll be downstairs.

350
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:53,754
I was just telling her how you
stuffed a pill up her nose.

351
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:56,654
Yeah, that's going
on the wall of shame.

352
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,125
See you later.

353
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:01,364
Hey, babe, listen.

354
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:04,228
I don't think you should be around
Vadim so much right now.

355
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,301
Why? You jealous?

356
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,462
No, I'm not jealous. Listen,
it's nothing for you to worry about.

357
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,629
Okay.

358
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:13,072
I wanna tell you about
my meeting with Buzhayev.

359
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,438
This is the police!

360
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,012
- This is a raid!
- Let's go.

361
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,839
- Police!
- Fuck.

362
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,243
Let's find this motherfucker right now.
Let's go.

363
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:26,821
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

364
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,323
Everybody get your hands
on your fucking heads.

365
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,053
- Let go of me, man.
- Get the fuck down!

366
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,933
Empty your pockets!
Oh, jackpot.

367
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:44,040
- Get on the bar. Hands on the bar.
- Who authorized this?

368
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,335
Tell me who authorized it.
I have the right..

369
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,705
What's the matter? You on
something? Come here.

370
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:52,645
That's right. Hands on your
fucking head and don't move!

371
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:55,148
- Hey, easy, easy.
- Toss them all, Pudge!

372
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,152
- Where is he?
- Get on.. Get on the fucking ground!

373
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:00,552
Give him the charcoal.
Open your fucking mouth!

374
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:02,191
Who the fuck authorized this?

375
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,760
- I'm looking for Vadim Nezhinski.
- He must be on something.

376
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,424
Get the fucking charcoal.
You do a little dust?

377
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,261
- Bring him the fuck down here!
- Get this piece of shit up.

378
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:13,926
- Where is he?
- He's up here, captain! We got him.

379
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:16,265
How about some charcoal
to absorb the toxins?

380
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,533
Clear some space here
for me, ladies, please.

381
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,973
- Turn him, he's gonna puke.
- Where's Nezhinski?

382
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,944
- Get this piece of shit up.
- Here we go.

383
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:26,844
- Give me some space here, please.
- Get the fuck out here.

384
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:28,678
- Who else?
- Don't you move.

385
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,080
- Turn around.
- Here we go.

386
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,848
What are you looking at?
Turn your head the other way.

387
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,523
Turn around.

388
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,835
- What is this?
- Stay down, stay down.

389
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,128
Tough guy, huh?

390
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,273
What, you want me
to double your money?

391
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:55,468
- Stay down.
- There it is.

392
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,546
It's doubled. How's that?

393
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,710
What are you looking at?
Turn around.

394
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,320
What else you got in here, huh,
joker? What about the girls?

395
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,790
Come here.
You got anything in here?

396
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,399
You got a cross and a Jewish star
on you.

397
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,967
- What's the matter? You confused?
- Not me.

398
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,595
- What we got?
- This one's holding.

399
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,241
- Couple dimes of cocaine, some PCP.
- Good.

400
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,469
You and you are under arrest.
Possession and sale of narcotics.

401
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,046
Talk to them and
we go after your mother.

402
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,740
What the fuck
did you just say to him?

403
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:36,045
Nothing.

404
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:41,190
Your boy's gonna open up on you.
And when he does, I'm coming back.

405
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,885
All right. Let's go.

406
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,552
Come on!

407
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:51,566
Good night, everybody. Pleasure
doing business with you. Wrap it up.

408
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:53,895
Let's go.

409
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:56,769
- Mr. Buzhayev.
- Yes?

410
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,374
- I'm Captain Jack Shapiro.
- Nice to meet you.

411
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,135
This has nothing to do with you..

412
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,836
but do you have a nephew
named Vadim Nezhinski?

413
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:06,608
- Yes.
- Does he have an office here?

414
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,753
Clean him up. I don't want to
get it all over the car.

415
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,683
You got him dirty, you clean him up.

416
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,715
- Does he have an office here?
- No.

417
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:16,416
Okay.

418
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,192
We'll be in touch.

419
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,297
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

420
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,798
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

421
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:30,303
- How the fuck did he get out here?
- Get out!

422
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:33,466
- What do you got?
- Possession and resisting arrest.

423
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:35,874
He's also got $207 on him.

424
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:38,173
- Two-oh-seven? Take him in the back.
- Let's go.

425
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,873
- Who frisked this asshole?
- Don't forget the pedigree.

426
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,383
- All right.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.

427
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:46,022
- What do you got?
- He's bleeding all over the place.

428
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,624
- Don't touch him!
- Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

429
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,885
- The Russian guy cut himself open.
- Jesus.

430
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:53,461
- Where'd he get the blade?
- He had it on him, man.

431
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,856
Hey, hey.
What the fuck is going on in here?

432
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,662
- He cut his throat.
- He pulled some cutting, man.

433
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:03,068
Put pressure on him, all right?
Put pressure.

434
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,904
Why are you standing there?
Get us a fucking bus.

435
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,067
All right, all right, all right.

436
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,609
Shit.

437
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,050
Good morning, chief.

438
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:27,254
You ready to go home?

439
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,365
Or do you have a home?

440
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,368
Your brother wanted me
to let you out.

441
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:38,167
If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here
another couple of days or a week.

442
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,640
- Maybe a month.
- Do you want me to thank him?

443
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,137
Disgusting.

444
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:48,949
You're uncontrollable. You know?

445
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,215
Give him a bath.

446
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,988
I ought to rap you one.

447
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:08,136
Hey, sign out with the desk sergeant
before you leave, please.

448
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:14,139
Guy cut his own throat.
Nezhinski must've..

449
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,677
really put the fear of God in him.
- Look..

450
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:19,338
that guy knew how they're
bringing the product in.

451
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:20,915
- Absolutely.
- That's the key.

452
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,746
We find the right guy,
we're gonna get him..

453
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:42,765
We waited till it was your day off.
We had to go. I'm sorry. That's it.

454
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,067
You had to hit that spot.
Of all the places..

455
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:48,507
you gotta come to my place?
- That's where Nezhinski's been seen.

456
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,510
We supposed to
announce it in advance..

457
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,582
and compromise the whole thing?
I told you I'm very sorry..

458
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,015
Sorry's not good enough. You don't
come in, act like you own the place.

459
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,087
Got your guys putting shit
down my throat!

460
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:02,589
You want me to come in here, fuck
everything up, push everything around?

461
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,852
You wouldn't be in this
if you didn't fuck around!

462
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:08,486
No, I wouldn't be in this shit
if you weren't trying to be top cop.

463
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:11,532
You know fucking Nezhinski's guy?
His fucking throat cut open.

464
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,465
Congratulations, Captain Joe.
Good job!

465
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:16,572
Think you're above it? You fuck
around with your Puerto Rican?

466
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,868
- Grow up and act like a man..
- Try thinking about my Puerto Rican..

467
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:22,568
while trying to fuck your fat wife!
How's that?

468
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:26,006
- Knock it off! Bobby!
- Get off!

469
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,276
- Come on!
- Get off me!

470
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,282
Don't touch me! You're not Pop!

471
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:35,888
I'm done with you. I don't wanna
see your fucking face anymore.

472
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,993
Get out of here!

473
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,662
I'm going home.

474
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,498
It's a fucking holiday.

475
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:04,176
Winter, spring, summer, fall..

476
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:08,848
 call 966-7210 for reservations
at Pocono Gardens and..

477
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:12,689
Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.

478
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:24,265
Shit.

479
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,464
Jab, combination.

480
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:56,334
Come on, dig. Dig. Come on.
Dig! Dig! Dig! Combination.

481
00:32:56,506 --> 00:33:00,033
Combination. Jab. Jab. Jab.
Combination.

482
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,178
Dig. Dig. Dig. With authority.

483
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,679
Dig. Dig. Finish it up. With authority.

484
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,840
That's it. That's it.

485
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:10,384
Good. Take a rest. Take a rest.

486
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,889
- Chief.
- Yeah.

487
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,067
Which kid is it?

488
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,098
It's Joseph.
He's in Jamaica Hospital.

489
00:33:34,277 --> 00:33:37,610
It don't look good right now.

490
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,881
Want us to contact
your other son, chief?

491
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:44,077
No, I'll do that. Thanks.

492
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,216
You okay, chief?

493
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,121
You guys go on.
I'll be right out. Thank you.

494
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,631
- Chief.
- Yo, chief. You all right?

495
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:03,602
I'm all right. I'm all right.

496
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,738
C-note.

497
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,247
Come on, man. Let's go.

498
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:20,149
All right, tell you what, José.

499
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:22,086
I'll see you..

500
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:27,522
and I'll bump you two C's.

501
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:40,800
Call.

502
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,203
Hello.

503
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,714
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
introduce you to José's new friends..

504
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:51,149
Siegfried and Roy. Two queens.

505
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,949
- Hey, Bobby.
- How you like that, huh?

506
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,457
- Bobby!
- What? Hang up on them.

507
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:01,495
What you got?
Come on, you fold with that?

508
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:04,065
- That's what..
- It's the police.

509
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,260
All right, all right, deal again.
Deal again. I'm feeling hot!

510
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:09,462
José, I thought you knew
how to play poker.

511
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,971
I told him to keep going.
He was gonna pack it in.

512
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:14,269
Go fuck yourself
and just deal the cards.

513
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:16,139
- Hello.
- Bobby?

514
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:17,905
Yeah.

515
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,879
Bobby, it's Michael Solo.
I got some bad news.

516
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,713
It's your brother.
Your brother's been shot.

517
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:27,186
About an hour ago,
outside his house.

518
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:28,381
What? Who?

519
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:31,959
Can you hear me? Your brother's
been shot. He's at Jamaica Hospital.

520
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,756
They're working on him now.

521
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,160
What are you talking about?
I was just with him.

522
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,233
Listen, your father's coming.
I gotta go.

523
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:42,201
But he's at Jamaica.
I just thought you should know.

524
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,232
What happened?

525
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,041
- My brother was shot.
- Oh, my God.

526
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:57,685
They're operating on him..

527
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:00,015
They're operating on him right now.
I gotta..

528
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,748
Bobby.

529
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:04,894
- Where are my keys?
- They should be on your desk.

530
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:08,420
- I'll get my coat. I'll go with you.
- No. No.

531
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:10,657
Stay here tonight.
I'll call you later.

532
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:14,634
- Bobby, I wanna go with you.
- No. I'll call later.

533
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:17,633
Bobkes?

534
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:21,106
- Where you going?
- Deal the cards, man.

535
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:37,657
Pop, Joe gonna be all right?

536
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:40,129
He's all right?

537
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:43,932
You got into a fight with him,
I heard.

538
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,698
- No.
- Well, you got what you wanted..

539
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:51,067
and you stayed out of it.

540
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,174
- Burt.
- Why would you say that?

541
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:56,278
- The union sent a shrink over for you.
- I don't need that crap.

542
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:58,409
- Your Honor.
- Chief.

543
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:02,643
- Chief, I'm sorry.
- What happened, Michael? Tell me.

544
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,650
- What's going on?
- I'm glad you're here.

545
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:06,755
First, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am.

546
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:10,689
We'll get them, Your Honor.
I'll come back in and run it myself.

547
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,192
The bullet went into his cheek,
came out his jaw.

548
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:15,228
- It missed his brain, thank God.
- Jesus.

549
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:16,922
He's very lucky, considering.

550
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,161
Do you know who did it?

551
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:21,668
No.

552
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:24,669
Definitely a professional.
They bombed his car.

553
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,643
It's a calling card.
We think it's the Russians.

554
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:33,679
You know, it's a real shame
we didn't get to Nezhinski before this.

555
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,681
Are you fucking blaming me?

556
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:40,989
No.

557
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,822
But I'm not the only one
around here with an opinion.

558
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,795
Best-case scenario..

559
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:56,234
doctor says your brother will have to
be here for at least a couple months.

560
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,134
Anyway..

561
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:01,333
let's just..
Let's just hope he pulls through.

562
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,479
I'm going to see him.

563
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,442
- Easy.
- Nobody's allowed in..

564
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,713
except immediate family.
- I'm his brother.

565
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:14,288
I'm his fucking brother!

566
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:16,550
Officers, hold on!
Let him in. It's all right.

567
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:19,524
- His nametag says "Green."
- It's his brother.

568
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:21,425
Okay, boss.

569
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,689
I'm sorry, Joe.

570
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:37,126
This guy got two queens
and he bumps the guy $200?

571
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,100
And then he wins and where the fuck
do you run off to, like a Jew, huh?

572
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,102
The place went fucking bananas.

573
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:46,538
I gotta straighten things out. I had
to bust some heads like Bruce Lee.

574
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm in there busting fucking heads.
They..

575
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:51,312
All right, Jumbo?
Jumbo, do me a favor.

576
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:54,177
Would you grab the check?
Let's get out of here. I'm tired.

577
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,046
All right, fine. I'll go pay the check.

578
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,986
But, Bob, just don't forget that nobody
could ever do for you what I did.

579
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:03,421
Busting heads.

580
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:06,585
Hey, don't say nothing to Jumbo
about what happened, all right?

581
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,994
Of course. I just thought he could
cheer you up a little, that's all.

582
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,031
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.

583
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,561
- Hi, Vadim.
- Hey.

584
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,763
We were just about to leave.

585
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:21,667
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

586
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:24,074
Made it through the bust okay?

587
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:27,978
- I'm here.
- Good. Good. Glad to hear it.

588
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:31,647
Your uncle's got some
trouble now, though.

589
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,880
You fucked up the club.

590
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,392
He does what he's gotta do,
I do what I got to do.

591
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,323
He don't own me.

592
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,363
He's got grandkids to worry about,
chasing them around.

593
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:53,408
Hey, baby, go keep Jumbo company
for a sec, all right?

594
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:56,673
Nice girl you got there.

595
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:59,406
One is prettier than the other.
He knows everybody.

596
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:01,015
He's pretty popular.

597
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:06,312
You must know a whole network
of people. Clubs, everything, huh?

598
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,049
Listen..

599
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,559
I got some shit coming in.

600
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,988
And some of us think maybe
you could help us get it out there.

601
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,764
My product needs a reputation.

602
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:21,130
A little dangerous right now,
don't you think?

603
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,539
We got a lot of muscle behind this.

604
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:28,603
- Muscle?
- Yeah, that's right.

605
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,511
You know a cop got hit today?

606
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:34,475
Do you think
that was a coincidence?

607
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:41,955
Well, they're not gonna
sit still for that, you know?

608
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:44,123
Police are a fucking joke, dude.

609
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:46,720
Mickey Mouse ain't gonna
do nothing.

610
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:50,898
Cop got lucky. He zigged
when he should have zagged.

611
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,830
You sit with them.

612
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:01,033
Bobby.

613
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,708
The cops..

614
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,575
they ain't no problem.

615
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:08,239
So don't worry about it.
We'll get them all.

616
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:12,320
You cut the head off, the body will fall.
Am I right?

617
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:16,051
We do it until they get the message.

618
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,086
We just heard that cop's father
is going to be in charge now.

619
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,094
We'll get him too.

620
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:27,594
We got all their names on a list.

621
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:31,566
The chief of police will be next.

622
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:36,305
If you change your mind, call Pavel.

623
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,777
I got a great product.

624
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:41,416
Why don't you come down
and check it out for yourself?

625
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,108
All right.

626
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,189
Well, you're wrong, chief.

627
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:55,331
We gotta make a move.
We gotta make it now.

628
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:58,626
- No! We don't go nuts.
- You heard what Bobby just said.

629
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:01,167
Nezhinski's got a contract
out on us, Burt.

630
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:04,397
I know that. You wanna
take over my department?

631
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:06,337
You wanna run it?
What do you wanna do?

632
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:08,670
- I want an answer from you.
- Answer for what?

633
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:13,043
I have no answers now.
We're looking for him, all right?

634
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:17,410
Use your head. If we go arrest them,
they'd be back on the street in a day.

635
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:19,748
We gotta catch them
with their hands full..

636
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:22,982
find out where they got the real
weight, then we make the move.

637
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,094
- We don't have that much time.
- Doesn't matter. It's the right play.

638
00:44:26,262 --> 00:44:27,593
- I say we hit them all.
- What?

639
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,858
- Wipe them out. No survivors.
- Don't be a first-class schmuck.

640
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:34,299
- We don't have the time to infiltrate.
- That is exactly my point.

641
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,028
Then we make the time.

642
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:38,435
- At whose expense?
- Hold on!

643
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,974
I want you all
to understand something, all right?

644
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:44,272
We don't ever play in the dirt here.
Not ever, no matter what.

645
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:48,339
When you piss in your pants,
you can only stay warm for so long.

646
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:52,882
Bobby.

647
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:55,957
Is there anything else you know
or anything you can tell us?

648
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,289
Nezhinski come in and..

649
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,825
he was saying they're trying
to create a brand name, that they..

650
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,991
wanna corner the market.

651
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:08,328
Why did he tell you this?

652
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:13,197
I don't know. He thought
I could help him build a reputation.

653
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:15,206
Nice friends you got there.

654
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:18,370
Know what, Pop? He's not my friend.
All right? He came at me.

655
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:19,905
All right.

656
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,381
I'm not interested in that.
I don't deal.

657
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,019
But didn't you lead him on?

658
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:26,212
No, I didn't fucking lead him on.

659
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:30,155
The guy's crazy. He told me
I could come look at his operation.

660
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:32,794
- I didn't even ask.
- He talked about his operation?

661
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:35,594
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's key.

662
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,665
What's your point?

663
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:40,428
We put a Kel on him.
Then send one of our uncles in.

664
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:42,935
Wait a minute. Wait.
Who's gonna be the tail?

665
00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:47,436
No, forget about it. No way.
No. Forget it. Forget it!

666
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,272
You go to his spot, right?
And you let him talk.

667
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:52,277
You let him hang himself.

668
00:45:52,448 --> 00:45:55,008
And then we trail you,
you know, to the location.

669
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:56,845
A week later, we pop him.

670
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:59,249
And your name's cleared.
Nobody knows it's you.

671
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:02,118
Mike, it's too dangerous for him.
He's my son.

672
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:05,556
- He's connected to all of us.
- No one knows I'm connected to you.

673
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:09,061
- What?
- I don't talk about you.

674
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,492
What about your girlfriend?
She knows about you, right?

675
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:17,770
Yeah.

676
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:22,333
All right, leave me alone
a minute. Okay?

677
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:28,711
I gotta fill out these line-of-duty reports
for your brother, for Joseph.

678
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:40,025
I didn't know this
was gonna happen, Pop.

679
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:42,925
Yeah, well..

680
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:45,329
what can you do, right?

681
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,138
I don't want you to get hurt.

682
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,331
Don't worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

683
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:56,740
I hear anything about your brother,
I'll call you. Goodbye.

684
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:02,910
Goodbye.

685
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:37,843
Hey, baby.

686
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,988
Hey, babe.

687
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:45,049
How's your father?
Is he holding up okay?

688
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:48,254
- Yeah.
- Good.

689
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:51,730
I heard on the television
your brother's doing better.

690
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:57,095
Me and my mom,
we said a prayer for him.

691
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,372
Thanks, baby.

692
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:03,972
Did they find out who did it?

693
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:10,413
Baby?

694
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,426
It was Vadim.

695
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,523
Vadim shot Joseph.

696
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:24,029
Oh, my God.

697
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:27,430
Oh, my God.

698
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:29,935
They tried to tell me..

699
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:33,803
but I didn't listen.
- Oh, my God.

700
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:37,503
Bobby, what are we gonna do?

701
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,978
Michael.

702
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:16,515
Hey.

703
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:21,688
You been up to see Joe?

704
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:26,260
Yeah. He's doing much better.
They reset his jaw this morning.

705
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:31,560
He was awake when I left him.
Your old man's up there with him now.

706
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,629
How you doing?

707
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:39,564
You can't protect my father.

708
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:42,540
We'll do the best we can.

709
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:45,510
Those guys aren't afraid
of the police.

710
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:49,176
If anything should happen to him..

711
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:55,490
Listen, that thing
you were talking about..

712
00:49:55,658 --> 00:50:00,027
if I wanted to help you,
what would I have to do?

713
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:06,562
I'll call you.

714
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:16,207
There's a wire in here.
We hear everything that goes down.

715
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:20,076
We'd also have a tail on you,
so we'd be with you at all times.

716
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,685
Small. Light as a feather.

717
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:27,319
You're fucking kidding me. That's it?

718
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,722
That's it. That's the risk.
You just gotta find that stash house.

719
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:34,260
- This can't get out.
- It won't.

720
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:41,067
Well, what if
something goes wrong?

721
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:46,072
Give me a word.
First word comes to your mind.

722
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:50,608
- Feather.
- Okay.

723
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,443
Anytime we hear the word "feather,"
we come in early.

724
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:58,144
Otherwise, stay there, do what you
gotta do and get the fuck out.

725
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,915
- This will all be kept confidential.
- Yeah, it better.

726
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:07,090
You get burnt, we have to
put you into protection.

727
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,629
That's better than ending up dead.

728
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,626
- Fuck.
- Listen..

729
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:16,431
nobody will ever know
you're involved.

730
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:20,564
Not your father, not your girlfriend,
nobody.

731
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:24,008
And maybe someday your brother
will thank you for all this.

732
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,909
So, Bobby..

733
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:29,349
 you call Vadim's people
and set it up.

734
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:33,511
You won't see us, but we'll be
following your every move.

735
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:37,022
Don't be a hero.
Don't make conversation.

736
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,191
You sense they're onto you,
just remember the word is "feather."

737
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,625
Your life is in that lighter.

738
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,758
Good luck.

739
00:52:04,653 --> 00:52:07,213
Bobkes. Jesus.

740
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:09,186
Where you been?
I left you a message.

741
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:11,519
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
- You all right?

742
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,321
- Yeah.
- What's the matter? You sick?

743
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,361
Yeah, I've been out of it.
I gotta..

744
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:16,691
Come on, Amada's here.

745
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:18,729
- Two Jack Daniels, please.
- No, no, no.

746
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:22,359
I gotta take care of something.
I'll call you tomorrow.

747
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:24,768
All right. Call me tomorrow.

748
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:41,184
Please.

749
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,685
See my friends out there?

750
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:51,564
Vadim is really glad
that you made up your mind.

751
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,126
He's very happy.

752
00:52:57,072 --> 00:52:58,630
You ready?

753
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,842
Yeah.

754
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:07,748
You'll meet me at the boardwalk
in one hour.

755
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,612
For your protection, and for ours..

756
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:13,016
you'll be searched and blindfolded
as we arrive.

757
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,555
You'll be able
to sample the product..

758
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:18,716
see if you like it. I'm sure you will.

759
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:21,692
You will discuss the rest
of the details with Vadim.

760
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:24,355
Don't raise your voice,
he doesn't like it.

761
00:53:25,935 --> 00:53:27,800
And for me..

762
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:32,870
I'm taking you to the place
where I never took anybody before..

763
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,533
especially no Americans.

764
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:40,413
And I don't trust you
the way Vadim does.

765
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,510
So don't.

766
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:45,478
All right?

767
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:50,381
And if you want to see
your girlfriend ever again..

768
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,992
you will come alone.

769
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,058
Boardwalk. One hour.

770
00:54:56,992 --> 00:55:00,120
You don't mind
that I sit behind, do you?

771
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:02,955
Do what you gotta do.

772
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:09,796
Let me see your hands.

773
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:17,932
Take this. Put it on.

774
00:58:57,866 --> 00:58:59,527
What do you think?

775
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:02,630
Good.

776
00:59:04,506 --> 00:59:06,337
What do you got there?
How many keys?

777
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:08,772
What, like three to four months?

778
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:10,912
It's not gonna dry up on us, is it?

779
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:13,877
We got a whole lot of stuff
coming in..

780
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,411
in a way nobody could ever trace.

781
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:29,022
All the shit I got in here,
at least 86 percent pure.

782
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:30,687
Sasha.

783
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:51,912
The whole city will be
sucking our glass soon.

784
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:54,681
We'll push the guineas out.
The Domos will work for us.

785
00:59:54,856 --> 00:59:55,590
It's good.

786
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:56,319
It's good.

787
00:59:59,528 --> 01:00:01,553
So where's this coming from?

788
01:00:16,178 --> 01:00:18,271
You're breathing heavy.

789
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:21,645
Yeah, because I just took a hit.

790
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:32,124
You know, I seen fighters
breathe like that.

791
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:34,421
It means they get nervous.

792
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:37,529
- Are you nervous?
- No.

793
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:41,002
I told you,
it's because I took some shit.

794
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:43,228
What do I have
to be nervous about?

795
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:51,703
They already searched me.

796
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:54,913
I'm not here to fuck you.
What are you doing?

797
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:21,371
How come you got both
matches and a lighter?

798
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:27,140
I'm feeling light as a feather
from that shit.

799
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:34,622
- What?
- Feeling light as a feather..

800
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:36,754
from that stuff.

801
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:49,229
- He's wired.
- No, wait.

802
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:52,499
You were right.
Kill the motherfucker.

803
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:54,938
Wait. Wait! Wait!

804
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,891
Get up! Get over there!

805
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:17,658
Take the roof. Bobby!

806
01:02:24,973 --> 01:02:26,065
Get the weapon!

807
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:31,478
Go, go!

808
01:02:45,627 --> 01:02:48,118
- Police! Don't move!
- I'm with you! I'm with you!

809
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:50,495
Don't move!

810
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:03,101
Police! Don't move!

811
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:06,736
Put your hands up! Put your
hands up! Put your hands up!

812
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:08,644
Back up to my voice!

813
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:14,920
- Who is he? Is he one of us?
- He's still breathing.

814
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:16,990
Get him a stretcher, quick.

815
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:20,060
Copy that, Rescue 238.
Patient is a Caucasian male..

816
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:23,163
 mid-30s, with a leg fracture,
broken ribs, abrasions..

817
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:25,026
 and a possible neck injury.

818
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:42,382
Where's Bobby? Where's my son?

819
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:44,820
He's in the bus, chief.
They said he'll be okay.

820
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:47,619
You guys call an operation
like this without telling me?

821
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:49,489
You think I was born yesterday?

822
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:51,528
- He came to me.
- He could've been killed!

823
01:03:51,698 --> 01:03:53,427
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm sorry.

824
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,626
Well, my son's gotta go into
protection now. Thank you very much.

825
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:58,236
- It was his idea.
- Where is he?

826
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:00,873
I wanna see him. Is he all right?

827
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:04,533
He's a dead man.

828
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:17,179
You hear me, son?

829
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:24,125
Crazy kid.

830
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:26,631
Stupid kid.

831
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,824
Pop..

832
01:04:28,802 --> 01:04:30,861
my girlfriend.

833
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:33,966
Call my girlfriend.

834
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:37,635
Don't worry. I'll call her, all right?

835
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:40,439
I'll let your brother know too.

836
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:43,182
We gotta get you..

837
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:47,048
Get you well again.

838
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,216
Things are gonna be different
for you now, Bobby.

839
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,018
We're gonna
have to protect you now.

840
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,970
1010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

841
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:07,030
1010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

842
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:10,472
This is Stan Brooks in Queens.
Police captain Joseph Grusinsky..

843
01:05:10,644 --> 01:05:13,044
 is leaving Jamaica Hospital
this afternoon.

844
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:16,740
His doctors cleared him for release
following a four-month stay.

845
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,909
The 11-year veteran was shot
in the face by a masked gunman..

846
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:23,613
 outside his home
the night before Thanksgiving.

847
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,361
Hey, big guys,
let's see what you got.

848
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:30,860
Get out. Get lost.

849
01:05:32,632 --> 01:05:35,260
Everybody, I see the car.

850
01:05:37,337 --> 01:05:38,861
Here they are.

851
01:05:47,214 --> 01:05:49,273
Welcome home, Joe.

852
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:53,912
Welcome home. We love you.

853
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:56,282
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

854
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,020
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Bob.

855
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:02,789
- I saw your guards out there.
- Daddy!

856
01:06:02,963 --> 01:06:05,454
- I didn't think they'd let you come.
- No, I wanted to.

857
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:08,601
What's up? What's up, buddy?

858
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:11,931
- Hey, how's your leg? You all right?
- Yeah. I'm glad you're home.

859
01:06:12,872 --> 01:06:14,499
Hey, we'll talk later, all right?

860
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:18,272
Everyone, let's move inside.
There's plenty to eat.

861
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:20,572
You gonna eat? Young lady. No?

862
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:27,549
Stop it!

863
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:29,650
Joe, you look just great.

864
01:06:30,557 --> 01:06:33,321
- Does it hurt at all?
- Yeah, a little, when I look at you.

865
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:36,758
Oh, finally. Finally he gets you back.

866
01:06:36,963 --> 01:06:39,261
Do you think maybe we could
go see my mom?

867
01:06:39,432 --> 01:06:43,027
No, honey, they made an exception
for this. I'm sorry, I don't think you can.

868
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:44,693
Hey, Pop.

869
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:48,036
You wanna go outside and
talk a little business on the porch?

870
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,233
It's time you
brought me back up to speed.

871
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,002
Whatever you say. Let's go.

872
01:06:52,312 --> 01:06:55,543
Bobby, come on, I want you
to hear this. It's for the trial.

873
01:06:55,715 --> 01:06:57,706
- All right.
- Baby, I wanna go.

874
01:06:57,884 --> 01:07:00,910
- No, stay here. I'll be 10 minutes, tops.
- Let me just go back.

875
01:07:01,087 --> 01:07:04,386
No. Just wait here. We'll go back
to the motel together.

876
01:07:04,557 --> 01:07:06,787
Hey, Sandra, these brownies
are really good.

877
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,359
Careful.

878
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:11,992
Nezhinski's cache was
even bigger than we thought.

879
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:15,162
Forty kilos of yayo. Angel dust too.

880
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:17,132
We gotta try to
make a deal with him..

881
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:19,295
find out how they're bringing it in.

882
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:21,406
He might not be too reliable, Pop.

883
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:23,542
Hey, listen, you marry an ape..

884
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,008
you don't complain
about the stench of bananas.

885
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:29,646
- Where is he now?
- At Rikers, tucked in nice and comfy.

886
01:07:29,816 --> 01:07:31,545
We take him
to the ADA's next week.

887
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:34,653
Good, I wanna go with you on that.
I wanna see his fucking face.

888
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:38,689
We gotta lean hard, get him to open
up. We got nowhere else to look.

889
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:40,826
Well, what about his uncle?
Buzhayev?

890
01:07:40,994 --> 01:07:42,586
No, he's clean.

891
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:45,356
We tapped his phone, tailed him.
We got nothing.

892
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:47,199
Went to his fur store on Monday.

893
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:50,029
Tuesday he took his grandkids
horseback riding.

894
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:52,728
- Nothing there.
- I'll tell you, the streets are dead.

895
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:56,501
The junkies are out there waiting
for something big, no question.

896
01:07:57,243 --> 01:07:59,268
Well, we got their number one.

897
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:02,040
Gotta put the full-court press
on him, get him to fold.

898
01:08:02,215 --> 01:08:04,740
- It won't work.
- What?

899
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:11,080
He won't trust you. These guys
think of you like you're a joke.

900
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:14,055
They call you Mickey Mouse.
He's not gonna turn for you.

901
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:17,560
Listen to the expert here. You don't
gotta get involved in this no more.

902
01:08:17,731 --> 01:08:20,598
I asked him to come in.
He's gotta know all this to testify.

903
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:22,792
This is official police business, Pop.

904
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:25,699
You gonna make him an honorary
member of the department?

905
01:08:25,872 --> 01:08:27,863
- What's the matter with you?
- He's right.

906
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,406
Didn't you hear what I said?

907
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:33,574
I asked him to come in here.
I brought him in.

908
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:36,944
Your brother's got a price on his head
and you talk to him like that?

909
01:08:41,988 --> 01:08:44,149
- Let's go.
- You have to wait for another car.

910
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:47,589
Ms. Juarez just left.
She went to her mother's.

911
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,423
- Bobby.
- What?

912
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:51,928
What was said in there,
he didn't mean it.

913
01:08:52,098 --> 01:08:53,759
Ever since this thing happened..

914
01:08:53,933 --> 01:08:56,959
he flies off the handle sometimes.
But, you know..

915
01:08:57,303 --> 01:08:59,533
Doctor says it may be part
of a stress disorder.

916
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:02,539
- Needs a little more time to adjust.
- I understand that, Pop.

917
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:05,906
I got my own shit to deal with.
I got a girlfriend that's pissed off.

918
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:07,910
I just want this to be over with.

919
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:11,573
Listen to me. A lot of people been
talking about how good you did.

920
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:15,482
Now, I think,
considering the alternatives..

921
01:09:16,222 --> 01:09:18,816
maybe you ought to think
about going on the job.

922
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:22,317
You got special knowledge.
The department likes that.

923
01:09:22,495 --> 01:09:23,757
I'm gonna go, Pop.

924
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,024
Why do you have to go?
Where you going?

925
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,670
- Think fast.
- Hey.

926
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:38,342
Hello.

927
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:45,007
- When is she gonna marry me?
- That is my mother. That's gross.

928
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:55,955
- Is it all clear? Good.
- Place is clear.

929
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:00,331
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

930
01:10:04,437 --> 01:10:06,701
I'm sorry, but she can't be here
right now, okay?

931
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:08,738
Baby, I was just finishing eating.

932
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:12,810
Just get your stuff, let's go.
I'll be outside. I wanna talk to you.

933
01:10:25,592 --> 01:10:27,890
She can't do this, Jumbo.

934
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:32,054
There are people out there trying
to kill me. Understand? It's dangerous.

935
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:33,426
I.. I know.

936
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:36,124
She called me. I got no idea
where you guys are.

937
01:10:36,302 --> 01:10:39,100
- Because no one can know.
- You all right?

938
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:44,372
I miss you.

939
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:45,943
Jeez, Bob.

940
01:10:46,112 --> 01:10:48,307
I'm stressed out.
Don't know what I'm doing.

941
01:10:48,481 --> 01:10:50,039
Me too.

942
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:54,016
Hey, Bob, everyone's asking
about you at El Caribe.

943
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,550
Freddie and all the girls..

944
01:10:56,723 --> 01:10:59,351
and Mr. Buzhayev.
I mean, you were like a son to him.

945
01:10:59,526 --> 01:11:01,551
We were surprised
to hear about your family.

946
01:11:01,728 --> 01:11:04,595
Your father's like J. Edgar Hoover.

947
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:07,533
I'm sorry I never said nothing.

948
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,827
Don't worry, Bob. It's all right.

949
01:11:10,003 --> 01:11:13,461
Listen, I gotta get her out of here,
and we'll call you.

950
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:16,071
- Let's go.
- Okay.

951
01:11:16,376 --> 01:11:18,640
We gotta move. Let's go.

952
01:11:25,919 --> 01:11:28,410
She misses me, Bobby.

953
01:11:29,923 --> 01:11:34,417
- You got to see your family.
- I know, baby, but that's different.

954
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:35,822
How?

955
01:11:35,995 --> 01:11:38,555
Mike and Vitt,
they have a route planned.

956
01:11:38,865 --> 01:11:41,333
You can't just go
and jeopardize all this.

957
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:43,765
Nobody can even know
what motel we're staying at.

958
01:11:43,937 --> 01:11:45,734
You gotta understand that.

959
01:11:46,172 --> 01:11:50,199
Listen, baby, Vadim's trial's
in two months.

960
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:51,775
Two months.

961
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:57,643
I'm sorry.

962
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:03,620
It just feels like sometimes
the walls are closing in on me.

963
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:06,054
It's gonna be okay.

964
01:12:19,138 --> 01:12:22,335
I'll go in the lead car. You stay
with him till we get to the A.D.A.

965
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:25,500
Yeah. We got two cars.
One behind, one in front.

966
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:28,977
If we make a deal with him, then
my brother don't have to testify.

967
01:12:29,148 --> 01:12:31,013
At least that's something.

968
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:37,452
I'm here for an inmate pickup.
Vadim Nezhinski.

969
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:40,951
- Is he ready?
- Yeah.

970
01:12:41,728 --> 01:12:43,320
They took him 20 minutes ago.

971
01:12:44,063 --> 01:12:46,293
- What?
- He complained of chest pains.

972
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:48,593
They had to take him down
to Elmhurst Hospital.

973
01:12:48,768 --> 01:12:49,826
Elmhurst Hospital?

974
01:12:50,003 --> 01:12:52,699
Yeah, we had to do it.
It's the law.

975
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:56,270
Give me the phone.

976
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,271
You deaf?
Give me the fucking phone!

977
01:12:59,445 --> 01:13:00,878
Hey, what's wrong with you?

978
01:13:02,582 --> 01:13:04,641
Thanks for being here.

979
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:09,445
I know it's been really hard.

980
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:17,386
Yeah.

981
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:22,357
Bobby, your brother just called.
We have an emergency.

982
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:25,902
Nezhinski's out. So get your stuff
together, we're moving you.

983
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:27,562
- What?
- He escaped.

984
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,174
They took him to the hospital
with chest pains. He..

985
01:13:30,343 --> 01:13:33,779
He had cooperation from the outside.
Our guys got ambushed.

986
01:13:35,314 --> 01:13:37,373
Start packing up, sweetheart.
Let's go.

987
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:41,680
Somebody might know this location.
We better get you moved.

988
01:13:42,321 --> 01:13:45,654
I'll meet you outside, all right?
Let's go.

989
01:13:58,438 --> 01:14:00,963
The backup should be here
any minute.

990
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,540
Probably got held up in the rain.

991
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:06,702
You all right?

992
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:15,080
- Pop, I'm fucked.
- No, you're not. You'll be okay.

993
01:14:19,726 --> 01:14:21,956
You're never gonna get Nezhinski.

994
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:24,225
Me and Amada
can't take this anymore.

995
01:14:24,397 --> 01:14:27,764
- Bobby.
- I don't know what to do.

996
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:30,969
I'm gonna protect you, all right?

997
01:14:32,371 --> 01:14:34,498
I'll make you a promise right now.

998
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:37,301
I'm gonna protect you.

999
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:39,911
Don't worry.

1000
01:14:43,282 --> 01:14:46,740
It's gonna be okay, son.
We'll see it through.

1001
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:51,247
- Chief?
- Yeah.

1002
01:14:51,424 --> 01:14:53,892
- We have three vehicles on the way.
- Okay.

1003
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,322
We'll move them to Corona.

1004
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:56,928
I'll lead the line.

1005
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:00,426
- Let's go, son.
- Honey.

1006
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,262
You guys stay close behind my car.

1007
01:15:17,784 --> 01:15:20,685
There's flooding up ahead.
Watch my brake lights.

1008
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:24,248
It's really coming down.

1009
01:15:26,793 --> 01:15:29,591
Vitt, where's the car that's
supposed to be following us?

1010
01:15:29,762 --> 01:15:32,162
He should be right behind us,
Bobby.

1011
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:36,135
Shit, I left the watch you gave me
at the hotel.

1012
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:38,570
Is that it on the right?

1013
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:42,907
- Vitt!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:44,667
Amada, get down! Get down!

1015
01:15:46,012 --> 01:15:49,846
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Motherfucker!

1016
01:15:50,016 --> 01:15:51,711
Oh, my God!

1017
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:54,910
What the fuck?!
How'd they find us?

1018
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:58,690
- Amada, stay down!
- Get off, they're shooting.

1019
01:15:59,425 --> 01:16:01,222
Get off the road!

1020
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:03,321
Fuck.

1021
01:16:08,835 --> 01:16:10,530
Fuck!

1022
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:14,696
Get off! Now! I'll take care of them!

1023
01:16:32,525 --> 01:16:36,222
Get off the road, Bobby!
Get off the road! Get off!

1024
01:16:38,297 --> 01:16:40,891
You hit? Amada, are you hit?
You hit?

1025
01:16:41,067 --> 01:16:44,230
- No! No!
- You hit?

1026
01:16:53,646 --> 01:16:55,273
Jesus.

1027
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,435
Pop, pull over!

1028
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:20,100
Pull over! Pull over!

1029
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:55,964
You're in a suite at the Sheraton
near Kennedy Airport.

1030
01:18:56,135 --> 01:18:58,296
Your brother is here for you.

1031
01:19:23,062 --> 01:19:25,428
I wanted to let you sleep a little bit.

1032
01:19:25,598 --> 01:19:27,327
Where's Pop?

1033
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:30,764
I had to go and identify the body.

1034
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:43,078
I saw him die.

1035
01:19:43,883 --> 01:19:46,716
It's all right.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1036
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:49,480
- I don't wanna be alone.
- I know.

1037
01:19:49,989 --> 01:19:51,684
I'm here.

1038
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:53,648
Now, don't worry, all right?

1039
01:19:53,826 --> 01:19:56,818
I'll be ready to come back and
head things up, and we'll get him.

1040
01:19:57,363 --> 01:20:01,390
You just wait till after the funeral.
They're gonna get Nezhinski.

1041
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:03,831
- How did they know where we were?
- It's all right.

1042
01:20:04,303 --> 01:20:06,601
How'd they find us?

1043
01:21:06,398 --> 01:21:08,423
Your father was a great man.

1044
01:21:08,601 --> 01:21:10,193
Thank you.

1045
01:21:11,537 --> 01:21:14,199
He gave me his combat ribbon..

1046
01:21:14,373 --> 01:21:16,967
after we got back from Korea.

1047
01:21:18,477 --> 01:21:21,446
I was gonna put it in with him..

1048
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:24,913
but I think he would have wanted
you to have it now.

1049
01:21:25,451 --> 01:21:27,214
Thanks.

1050
01:21:27,653 --> 01:21:29,678
It's now in your hands..

1051
01:21:29,855 --> 01:21:32,050
but we're gonna help you
get Nezhinski.

1052
01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:34,222
And we got a lead, Joe.

1053
01:21:34,393 --> 01:21:36,190
Word got back
from one of our uncles..

1054
01:21:36,362 --> 01:21:39,661
that a big Russian shipment's
coming in sometime next week.

1055
01:21:39,832 --> 01:21:41,561
We'll find it.

1056
01:21:42,268 --> 01:21:45,101
Your father will not
have died in vain.

1057
01:22:01,587 --> 01:22:04,112
You're not sleeping again.

1058
01:22:05,824 --> 01:22:08,622
Did you take the pills
the doctor gave you?

1059
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:11,056
No.

1060
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:17,525
What is this?

1061
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,905
Is this a police exam?

1062
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,578
Bobby, is this a police exam?

1063
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:41,288
Yes.

1064
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:49,496
Were you gonna talk to me
about it?

1065
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:52,059
Yeah.

1066
01:22:52,705 --> 01:22:54,434
When?

1067
01:22:55,441 --> 01:22:57,170
I don't know.

1068
01:23:00,846 --> 01:23:04,145
Bobby, do you know
how this makes me feel?

1069
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:09,049
You just went off,
you made this decision.

1070
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:16,426
You didn't even talk to me about it.

1071
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:22,167
After this nightmare
we've been through?

1072
01:23:22,334 --> 01:23:25,428
I don't know if I could
live through that again.

1073
01:23:28,207 --> 01:23:31,176
You're gonna join the police, Bobby?

1074
01:23:31,744 --> 01:23:35,271
Baby, you could be killed.
Look at your brother.

1075
01:23:35,447 --> 01:23:37,381
Your father, he died for nothing.

1076
01:23:37,549 --> 01:23:39,574
No! No!

1077
01:23:39,752 --> 01:23:42,482
Don't talk about them!
You don't talk about them!

1078
01:23:42,655 --> 01:23:45,283
- You wanna get shot like him?
- Don't talk about them!

1079
01:23:46,025 --> 01:23:48,823
Do not talk about them!
You don't understand!

1080
01:23:50,429 --> 01:23:53,398
You can't do this!
I won't let you!

1081
01:23:53,565 --> 01:23:55,533
- No, you can't!
- I have to do this!

1082
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:57,828
- No, you don't!
- I have to do it!

1083
01:23:58,003 --> 01:24:00,699
No, you're gonna get yourself killed!

1084
01:24:00,873 --> 01:24:02,670
I fucking hate you!

1085
01:24:16,588 --> 01:24:19,648
The commissioner's aware you have
special knowledge for this case.

1086
01:24:20,626 --> 01:24:22,992
He made it top priority.

1087
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:24,629
Come.

1088
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,900
We're all very sorry
about your father, Robert.

1089
01:24:32,071 --> 01:24:35,268
- Thank you.
- Pursuant to your request..

1090
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:38,137
we've decided to grant you
a special dispensation..

1091
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:40,244
and appoint you
a conditional member..

1092
01:24:40,412 --> 01:24:42,846
of this department,
effective immediately.

1093
01:24:43,015 --> 01:24:45,279
- I appreciate that.
- Good.

1094
01:24:45,451 --> 01:24:49,387
You will be required to go to the
academy once this case is completed.

1095
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:52,214
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

1096
01:24:52,591 --> 01:24:53,922
All right, then.

1097
01:24:54,093 --> 01:24:57,187
Would you raise
your right hand, please?

1098
01:24:57,863 --> 01:25:01,060
"I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare..

1099
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:04,225
that I will support and defend
the Constitution.."

1100
01:25:04,703 --> 01:25:07,968
I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare..

1101
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,904
that I will support and defend
the Constitution..

1102
01:25:11,076 --> 01:25:12,976
"..both of
the United States government..

1103
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:15,773
 and the state of New York,
to the best of my ability. "

1104
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:17,813
- both of
the United States government..

1105
01:25:17,983 --> 01:25:21,111
 and the state of New York,
to the best of my ability.

1106
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:25,916
"I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer.."

1107
01:25:26,091 --> 01:25:30,551
I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer..

1108
01:25:30,729 --> 01:25:32,754
"..in the New York City
Police Department. "

1109
01:25:32,931 --> 01:25:34,922
- In the New York City
Police Department.

1110
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,661
- "So help me God."
- So help me God.

1111
01:25:38,837 --> 01:25:41,397
Congratulations, Robert,
and welcome.

1112
01:25:41,573 --> 01:25:42,597
Thank you.

1113
01:25:42,775 --> 01:25:44,504
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1114
01:25:44,676 --> 01:25:46,906
They're all expecting you
down at the precinct.

1115
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:51,982
Work all your contacts. We gotta find
out where that deal is going down.

1116
01:25:52,317 --> 01:25:55,081
Jumbo, I'm not gonna party,
but I need to talk to you.

1117
01:25:55,988 --> 01:25:59,651
All right, so, look, I'll come down later
and I'll see you there. All right.

1118
01:25:59,925 --> 01:26:01,984
No, don't tell Freddie.

1119
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:03,822
Jumbo, listen to me.

1120
01:26:03,996 --> 01:26:07,295
Just meet me at El Caribe
at 11:30, all right?

1121
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:09,024
All right.

1122
01:26:09,601 --> 01:26:11,068
Hey.

1123
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,733
You get your ID card this morning?

1124
01:26:13,906 --> 01:26:17,603
Yeah, but they wouldn't give me
a piece. I should have one.

1125
01:26:18,143 --> 01:26:20,043
I'll get you one.

1126
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:24,445
Pop always said
you were a good shot.

1127
01:26:28,687 --> 01:26:31,884
- What's the matter, Joe?
- Nothing.

1128
01:26:32,558 --> 01:26:34,890
It's kind of weird seeing you here.

1129
01:26:37,996 --> 01:26:40,760
- Yeah, I know.
- Bobby.

1130
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,060
I never meant
to get you involved in all this.

1131
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:46,636
I'm sorry.

1132
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:49,706
You don't gotta apologize to me.

1133
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:53,610
I never listened to you or Pop.

1134
01:26:55,647 --> 01:26:57,342
You wanna hear something funny?

1135
01:26:57,816 --> 01:27:00,250
I was kind of jealous of you for that.

1136
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:05,015
I was. I don't think
I had a lot of faith in myself.

1137
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:07,454
I just did what Pop wanted me to do.

1138
01:27:08,227 --> 01:27:11,890
I mean, you..
I mean, you were free.

1139
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,325
Anyway, look..

1140
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:20,028
I didn't mean to get into all this.
It just..

1141
01:27:21,139 --> 01:27:23,937
Maybe it's just because
I ain't been sleeping lately.

1142
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:27,340
I'm kind of having some nightmares
about what happened to me.

1143
01:27:29,681 --> 01:27:31,205
Well..

1144
01:27:35,254 --> 01:27:39,190
all that matters
is that we finish this.

1145
01:27:39,925 --> 01:27:43,122
And we catch Nezhinski
when that deal goes down.

1146
01:27:43,295 --> 01:27:46,526
Bobby, an Amada Juarez
is calling for you on line three.

1147
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,531
- Tell her I'll call her back later.
- All right.

1148
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:53,261
Are you gonna be okay?

1149
01:27:55,874 --> 01:27:59,401
I gotta go downstairs and
get fitted for a vest, all right?

1150
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:01,136
Yeah.

1151
01:28:22,334 --> 01:28:24,097
Amada?

1152
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:26,835
Hey.

1153
01:28:27,372 --> 01:28:30,273
Miss Juarez left about an hour ago.

1154
01:28:30,475 --> 01:28:32,534
She said to give you this.

1155
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:41,315
- Hey, get me some food, would you?
- Yeah, sure.

1156
01:28:41,486 --> 01:28:44,649
We're checking you out at noon
tomorrow. Get your stuff together.

1157
01:28:44,823 --> 01:28:46,848
I'll bring the menus.

1158
01:29:29,635 --> 01:29:31,068
Lou.

1159
01:29:31,236 --> 01:29:34,000
My brother. The grand return.

1160
01:29:34,172 --> 01:29:37,664
I can't believe you called. Look at you.
You look great. You look different.

1161
01:29:38,076 --> 01:29:39,839
- Who is this?
- That's my bodyguard.

1162
01:29:40,145 --> 01:29:43,046
Look at this place.
You put more tables up here?

1163
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:46,275
No. I don't know. Come here.
Come on, have a drink for a second.

1164
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:49,887
- Why don't you get us some drinks?
- Don't you think you've had enough?

1165
01:29:50,055 --> 01:29:53,491
You wanna be a pain in my ass?
You my mother? Get us some drinks.

1166
01:29:53,659 --> 01:29:56,526
- Fuck you in the ass.
- I'm ready.

1167
01:29:56,695 --> 01:29:59,721
- I wanna talk to you about something.
- Sure.

1168
01:30:01,366 --> 01:30:04,665
You know of anything going down
the next few days? Something major?

1169
01:30:06,171 --> 01:30:07,263
No.

1170
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:10,602
I mean, they never tell me
their heavy stuff anyway.

1171
01:30:10,776 --> 01:30:14,177
Yeah, but you hear about things.
People talking, anything?

1172
01:30:16,048 --> 01:30:18,539
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

1173
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:22,447
- What about Freddie? He around?
- Freddie's downstairs.

1174
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:24,919
- Come on, pay attention.
- Where's Amada?

1175
01:30:27,826 --> 01:30:29,384
Bob.

1176
01:30:29,561 --> 01:30:31,893
- She left.
- She left?

1177
01:30:32,798 --> 01:30:35,266
- What do you mean, she left?
- Jumbo, leave it alone.

1178
01:30:35,434 --> 01:30:37,163
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1179
01:30:37,335 --> 01:30:40,304
Amada, she probably
just needs some space.

1180
01:30:40,872 --> 01:30:42,464
She'll be back.

1181
01:30:42,641 --> 01:30:45,633
Between us, that place they
had you in was driving her crazy..

1182
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:48,177
I know that.
The Cue Motor Inn?

1183
01:30:48,346 --> 01:30:51,372
We used to call it the "Screw Motor
Inn," with all the hookers.

1184
01:30:53,885 --> 01:30:56,115
How'd you know
where we were staying?

1185
01:31:01,393 --> 01:31:03,861
How did you know
where we were staying?

1186
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:08,792
It was in the papers.

1187
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:12,132
You know, those reporters,
they got their noses everywhere.

1188
01:31:12,304 --> 01:31:14,636
Always looking through
everybody's garbage.

1189
01:31:14,806 --> 01:31:17,775
Anyway, homeslice,
what do you think of the floorshow?

1190
01:31:17,943 --> 01:31:21,344
Wanna go downstairs for a bit?
Go outside? It's loud in here.

1191
01:31:21,513 --> 01:31:23,777
- What?
- Talk, catch up?

1192
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,409
You wanna go outside?
We got drinks coming.

1193
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:30,419
Forget the drinks. I haven't
seen you in forever. Let's go.

1194
01:31:30,589 --> 01:31:32,887
- It's cold out.
- Get your coat.

1195
01:31:33,058 --> 01:31:35,492
Come on. Give us a few minutes.
It'll be all right.

1196
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,890
Okay, but make it quick.

1197
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:58,071
It wasn't in the papers, Lou.

1198
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:08,584
Where's Nezhinski?

1199
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,489
I don't know.

1200
01:32:11,663 --> 01:32:13,597
Don't play games with me.

1201
01:32:13,765 --> 01:32:18,498
- I don't know.
- I said, don't play games with me.

1202
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:25,503
Amada told you where
we were staying, didn't she?

1203
01:32:26,711 --> 01:32:28,975
She trusted you like a brother.

1204
01:32:29,147 --> 01:32:31,411
Bob. Come on.

1205
01:32:33,285 --> 01:32:35,048
I swear, I don't know nothing.

1206
01:32:41,626 --> 01:32:44,424
My father's dead because of you.

1207
01:32:45,597 --> 01:32:47,861
You know I'm with the police now?

1208
01:32:48,433 --> 01:32:51,596
And I can do anything to you.

1209
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:55,797
Bob, I told them where you were,
but it ain't what you think.

1210
01:32:55,974 --> 01:32:57,999
Amada said you moved
every couple days.

1211
01:32:58,176 --> 01:33:01,668
I thought you'd be gone by then.
It's the truth. I sw..

1212
01:33:01,847 --> 01:33:03,280
I swear to God.

1213
01:33:03,715 --> 01:33:07,276
I tried to give them
the wrong information. I tried.

1214
01:33:07,452 --> 01:33:10,512
Come on. Tell me who.

1215
01:33:11,122 --> 01:33:13,818
Who? Who? Who?

1216
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:18,822
Marat.

1217
01:33:18,997 --> 01:33:21,295
Marat Buzhayev.

1218
01:33:21,733 --> 01:33:25,726
I'm sorry, Bob. I know
he was like a father to you..

1219
01:33:26,671 --> 01:33:27,899
but he owns me.

1220
01:33:28,073 --> 01:33:32,476
Don't say that! Don't say that!
Don't say that!

1221
01:33:32,811 --> 01:33:35,473
- My eyes.
- You fuck!

1222
01:33:35,914 --> 01:33:40,044
You fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1223
01:33:40,218 --> 01:33:42,448
You fuck!

1224
01:33:46,091 --> 01:33:47,820
Get up. Get up!

1225
01:33:49,561 --> 01:33:52,792
Get up! Get up!

1226
01:33:54,699 --> 01:33:56,564
This Jumbo Falsetti guy confirmed..

1227
01:33:56,735 --> 01:34:00,796
 that a major shipment
is coming tomorrow for Buzhayev.

1228
01:34:01,406 --> 01:34:05,240
He says Buzhayev uses
his grandkids as couriers.

1229
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:08,811
They go everywhere for him. That's
why we weren't able to catch him.

1230
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:11,972
We should've been putting a tail
on a couple of 10-year-olds.

1231
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:14,618
It's unbelievable.
Did Jumbo know the location?

1232
01:34:14,786 --> 01:34:18,449
No. No, we tried, believe me.
We interrogated him all night.

1233
01:34:18,757 --> 01:34:20,418
He was crying like a 4-year-old.

1234
01:34:20,592 --> 01:34:24,460
But he did say he thought
Nezhinski would be there, though.

1235
01:34:24,629 --> 01:34:26,961
Tomorrow's Tuesday, right?

1236
01:34:27,132 --> 01:34:30,693
Buzhayev takes his grandkids to
Floyd Bennett Field every Tuesday.

1237
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:33,167
He takes them horseback riding.

1238
01:34:33,338 --> 01:34:36,136
Joe, we should
put our money on that.

1239
01:34:36,574 --> 01:34:40,010
- No, that's not really much to go on.
- You got a better idea?

1240
01:34:40,178 --> 01:34:42,476
Anyone?
We can sit on our fucking asses..

1241
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:44,774
or we can crush these..
- Bobby.

1242
01:34:45,317 --> 01:34:47,751
It's a process, you know?

1243
01:34:48,086 --> 01:34:52,648
Look, that's what we got.
I guess that's what we should go with.

1244
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,956
You heard him. Let's go.

1245
01:34:57,595 --> 01:34:59,426
Coats are on the porch.

1246
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:02,327
Contact ESU. Make sure we don't
come up short, all right?

1247
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,161
We got it covered.

1248
01:35:04,336 --> 01:35:06,566
- Sorry about the mess, Sandra.
- It's all right.

1249
01:35:06,738 --> 01:35:10,003
Joe, you know, they're laughing at us
out there on the street.

1250
01:35:10,175 --> 01:35:12,769
Now, when we get there,
what we do will be up to you.

1251
01:35:12,944 --> 01:35:15,572
But I hope
you drop the hammer on them.

1252
01:35:17,282 --> 01:35:19,375
After your father
and everything else?

1253
01:35:19,651 --> 01:35:22,882
I mean, these people
are like fucking lice.

1254
01:35:23,655 --> 01:35:26,647
Just think about
what I'm saying to you.

1255
01:35:29,728 --> 01:35:31,355
Joe.

1256
01:35:32,097 --> 01:35:34,156
Joe, you okay?

1257
01:35:36,401 --> 01:35:38,301
I hear you, GQ.

1258
01:35:51,316 --> 01:35:54,717
Take that, all right?
It's one of Pop's.

1259
01:35:58,289 --> 01:36:01,486
I don't need any more guns in my life,
that's for sure.

1260
01:36:01,659 --> 01:36:04,127
But you should have one to be safe.

1261
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:08,657
It's better to be judged by 12
than carried by six.

1262
01:37:42,227 --> 01:37:44,855
Joe, we're all ready.
What's the move?

1263
01:37:45,029 --> 01:37:46,826
Wait till they complete the sale.

1264
01:37:46,998 --> 01:37:49,159
Then we move.
ESU will grab the kids.

1265
01:37:54,072 --> 01:37:56,905
They're so fucking close,
the two of them.

1266
01:38:34,512 --> 01:38:37,413
This is what
we've wanted for so long.

1267
01:38:37,615 --> 01:38:42,177
My nephew has stayed
just to see this through.

1268
01:38:44,189 --> 01:38:46,487
When this is done..

1269
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:49,587
we'll control
almost the whole market.

1270
01:38:51,529 --> 01:38:54,020
Each load is completely untraceable.

1271
01:38:57,569 --> 01:39:00,436
It's my own method.

1272
01:39:02,073 --> 01:39:03,131
Impressive.

1273
01:39:03,841 --> 01:39:08,540
You put the drugs right on the coat.

1274
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,281
We are importing 200 imitation sables
per week.

1275
01:39:41,446 --> 01:39:43,311
Try it.

1276
01:39:50,388 --> 01:39:52,447
Very good. Give them the money.

1277
01:39:54,792 --> 01:39:58,523
All right, deal's about to close.
Let's go.

1278
01:39:58,696 --> 01:40:01,597
This is the police! Drop your weapons.
Come out!

1279
01:40:01,766 --> 01:40:03,290
Police! Put your weapons down!

1280
01:40:03,635 --> 01:40:05,330
They're firing at us.
Everybody down!

1281
01:40:05,603 --> 01:40:07,400
Eli! The kids!

1282
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:15,311
Get down! Joseph! Get down!

1283
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,806
Joe! Joe, are you hit?

1284
01:40:19,284 --> 01:40:22,151
- What happened?
- He's okay. He's okay.

1285
01:40:23,588 --> 01:40:25,283
He's all right. He ain't hit.

1286
01:40:25,456 --> 01:40:27,822
- Should we move?
- I don't know what's wrong.

1287
01:40:27,992 --> 01:40:30,153
- Bobby. Bobby, take his shotgun.
- Okay.

1288
01:40:30,328 --> 01:40:32,523
- I'll stay here with him.
- Go, go, go!

1289
01:40:44,309 --> 01:40:45,606
Run!

1290
01:40:45,777 --> 01:40:47,677
We got runners out the back!

1291
01:40:55,019 --> 01:40:57,487
- It's okay.
- Come with me.

1292
01:40:57,655 --> 01:40:58,679
Keep going! Go! Go!

1293
01:40:58,856 --> 01:41:00,187
- Watch your back!
- Go! Go!

1294
01:41:00,358 --> 01:41:02,622
Kelly, we're gonna move to the left!
Let's go.

1295
01:41:02,794 --> 01:41:04,193
Okay.

1296
01:41:09,867 --> 01:41:12,028
Halt! Police!

1297
01:42:01,719 --> 01:42:04,210
Freeze. Hold it right there.

1298
01:42:29,781 --> 01:42:32,716
All right. Fuck!

1299
01:42:34,585 --> 01:42:37,053
We'll kill each other in here.

1300
01:42:37,221 --> 01:42:39,212
Nezhinski's in here with us.

1301
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:41,517
Let's smoke him out.

1302
01:42:41,692 --> 01:42:44,354
Radio our guys.
Tell them to clear out.

1303
01:42:44,529 --> 01:42:46,224
Absolutely.

1304
01:42:47,298 --> 01:42:50,290
We got the old man.
We got Buzhayev.

1305
01:42:50,468 --> 01:42:53,096
All right, guys. Clear out.

1306
01:42:54,205 --> 01:42:56,503
Go on. Into the clearing.

1307
01:43:33,578 --> 01:43:35,671
Bobby!

1308
01:43:35,847 --> 01:43:37,838
Bobby, what are you doing?

1309
01:43:39,317 --> 01:43:40,750
Bobby!

1310
01:43:42,453 --> 01:43:45,616
Don't go in there.
We have Vadim surrounded.

1311
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:49,692
Be patient, he'll come out!
Bobby!

1312
01:43:54,098 --> 01:43:55,690
Bobby!

1313
01:43:58,469 --> 01:44:00,266
Bobby!

1314
01:44:46,584 --> 01:44:48,245
Bobby..

1315
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:51,485
fuck you.

1316
01:45:58,889 --> 01:46:00,914
Bobby..

1317
01:46:01,092 --> 01:46:04,152
I didn't know
it would be your family.

1318
01:46:07,098 --> 01:46:09,328
Get on your knees.

1319
01:46:32,423 --> 01:46:34,084
We're done here.

1320
01:47:41,058 --> 01:47:42,082
Hey, Joe.

1321
01:47:42,259 --> 01:47:44,090
- Can't believe how nervous I am.
- Bobby.

1322
01:47:44,261 --> 01:47:45,455
- Big day.
- Look at you.

1323
01:47:45,663 --> 01:47:48,393
All dressed up, huh?
Looking like a chief.

1324
01:47:48,566 --> 01:47:50,830
I don't know about that.
Maybe a lieutenant.

1325
01:47:51,001 --> 01:47:52,662
- You look good.
- Captain?

1326
01:47:52,837 --> 01:47:55,397
Hey, Joe, I got through
to McClennan at Personnel.

1327
01:47:55,573 --> 01:47:57,404
He's still holding that slot for you..

1328
01:47:57,575 --> 01:48:00,100
if you're ready
to switch to administration.

1329
01:48:00,277 --> 01:48:02,404
Yeah, can we talk about it
another time?

1330
01:48:03,214 --> 01:48:04,272
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1331
01:48:04,615 --> 01:48:07,482
- Hey, good luck.
- All right.

1332
01:48:08,052 --> 01:48:09,917
Now, what's this?

1333
01:48:11,288 --> 01:48:14,052
Look, I meant to tell you.

1334
01:48:14,425 --> 01:48:18,054
I gotta start doing the right thing.
I gotta spend more time at home.

1335
01:48:18,229 --> 01:48:20,459
I got three kids now.
What am I supposed to do?

1336
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,065
Look, I was gonna
talk to you about it.

1337
01:48:25,035 --> 01:48:27,299
Do what you need to do.

1338
01:48:28,005 --> 01:48:31,270
They're gonna get started.
We should probably go in. Come on.

1339
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:35,906
Ladies and gentlemen..

1340
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:40,107
we shall begin today's ceremony
with the traditional invocation..

1341
01:48:40,284 --> 01:48:42,616
moving then
to the valedictorian address..

1342
01:48:42,787 --> 01:48:45,551
to be given by Robert Grusinsky..

1343
01:48:46,223 --> 01:48:49,818
son of the late
Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky..

1344
01:48:49,994 --> 01:48:52,986
brother of
Captain Joseph Grusinsky.

1345
01:48:53,497 --> 01:48:57,024
You know, as I look at that fine
young man seated behind me..

1346
01:48:57,802 --> 01:49:01,568
I can't help but think of all the
young members of our department.

1347
01:49:02,273 --> 01:49:04,901
I get filled with such pride.

1348
01:49:05,075 --> 01:49:09,910
Men like him
are the future of the force.

1349
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:14,016
Let us remind ourselves
we are in God's presence.

1350
01:49:14,185 --> 01:49:16,176
Let us pray.

1351
01:49:17,788 --> 01:49:20,552
O God, we come together
at this most joyous occasion..

1352
01:49:20,724 --> 01:49:24,820
the New York City Police
graduation ceremony.

1353
01:49:25,162 --> 01:49:29,326
We ask you to guide, bless and
protect those who are graduating.

1354
01:49:30,568 --> 01:49:34,334
Please bless their families and friends
who gather and share their joy.

1355
01:49:34,505 --> 01:49:37,235
- I love you very much.
- Strengthen us, our Lord..

1356
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,933
now and forever. Amen.
- I love you too.

1357
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:42,340
Amen.

1358
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,900
