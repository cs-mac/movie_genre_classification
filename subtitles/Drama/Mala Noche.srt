1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,810
BAD EDUCATION

2
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,170
Enrique Goded

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,870
"The current spell of icy weather
has claimed its first victim.

4
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,910
A motorcyclist froze to death
On Highway 4

5
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,820
and drove for a further 90 km
after he was dead.

6
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,820
Two patrolmen flagged him down

7
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,190
and as he didn't react
they pursued him.

8
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,600
They drove alongside

9
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,470
and rebuked him for his attitude.

10
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,910
As he didn't move
They realized something was wrong."

11
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,320
It seems incredible.

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
It's a wonderful image.

13
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,750
A dead young man drives
his motorcycle across the icy plain,

14
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,570
escorted by two patrolmen.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,590
Where was he going
in that icy dawn?

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,870
To see someone who couldn't wait
until the morning.

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
There's a story here!

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,690
I'll cut it out and keep it,
it might inspire me.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,370
I'll get it.

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,790
- Hello.
- What is it?

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,150
I'm an actor.
I'm looking for Enrique Goded.

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,250
He isn't here.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,930
But I can see him, man.

24
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,790
In any case,
we don't have any projects so...

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,630
I'd like to speak to him.
We were old pals at school.

26
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,210
I'm Ignacio Rodriguez.

27
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,630
- All right, come in.
- Thank you.

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,350
- I don't think he'll see you.
- That's all right.

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,520
Wait a minute.

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,550
He's an actor, a nuisance!

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,690
I told him
we aren't preparing a film now.

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,710
- Tell him I'm not in.
- I did, but he saw you.

33
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,710
And I can see him.

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,910
He said he was
a friend of yours at school.

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,510
- Who can he be?
- Ignacio Rodriguez.

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,540
Ignacio?

37
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,180
- It can't be!
- That's what he said.

38
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,820
Ignacio, is it really you?

39
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,630
Of course, Enrique.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,780
- I'm delighted you remember me!
- How could I forget you?

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,950
Well, it's been sixteen years.

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,120
- That long?
- More or less.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,370
I wouldn't recognize you
with that beard.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,310
You'd look better without it.
Come into my office.

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,470
- You want a coffee?
- No, thanks.

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,690
- I'm having one.
- Then, yes.

47
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,990
- Martin, will you make some coffee?
- Yes.

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,530
Sit down.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,030
What brings you here?

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,150
I came to ask for work.
I'm an actor.

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,320
I've brought my resume.

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,770
- Bumblebee Group.
- An independent theater company.

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,990
"El Retablillo de San Christobal"
By Garcia Lorca.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,320
"The Diary of Adam and Eve",
by Mark Twain

55
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,590
Mark Twain, Garcia Lorca...

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,930
Only the best
for the Bumblebee.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,070
Don't you write anymore?

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,710
No, I stopped ages ago.

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,980
But I've brought my last story.

60
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,870
"THE VISIT"
by Ignacio Rodriguez

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,870
"The Visit"...

62
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,270
By the way, when are you starting
your next film?

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,780
- Well...
- I'll do anything.

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,990
We're eyeing tabloids
to see if I can think of stories.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,510
You've caught me
in a creative crisis.

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,730
That's a bummer!

67
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,670
Read my story,
it might give you some ideas.

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,710
What's it about?

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,530
Our school.

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,200
One part is based
on our childhood,

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,100
and the other part isn't,
when the characters grow up.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,220
That's fiction.

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,550
I haven't introduced you.
Ignacio, Martin...

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,010
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,320
- Sugar and milk?
- Yes, please.

76
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,590
By the way,
I don't call my self Ignacio now.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm Angel.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,060
Why's that?

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,880
It's my stage name.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,870
An actor can't be called
Ignacio Rodriguez.

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,790
- He can't?
- Of course not.

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,790
Angel Andrade.

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,430
Everyone calls me that,
even my mother.

84
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,420
That's great.

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,790
Thank you.

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,360
- Ignacio was...
- Angel!

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,550
- Ignacio...
- Angel!

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,770
Well, Ignacio,
before he became Angel,

89
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,090
was..
is an old school friend.

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,110
Martin is my production director.

91
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,680
And maid of all work.

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,030
- Well, Ignacio...
- Angel!

93
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,500
Right!

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,070
I'm delighted to see you.

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,340
As soon as I've got anything...

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,590
Give me your number,
I'll call you.

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,210
I don't have a phone.

98
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,700
But I'll call you.

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,430
Shold I leave you another photo?
- No, don't worry.

100
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Well, Angel,
It was great seeing you.

101
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,570
- So should I go?
- Yes I think so.

102
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,020
Can't I help you cut out...?
- No, thanks a lot.

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,450
- So long.
- My pleasure.

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,220
You look great!

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
So do you.

106
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,790
- Do read "The Visit".
- Yes, I will.

107
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,890
- I'm dying of curiosity.
- Great. See you.

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,370
I thought he'd never leave!

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,590
- Is he really a friend of yours?
- Yes.

110
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,390
I haven't seen him
since school.

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,850
We were reall close.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,970
Well, he was my first love.

113
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,610
But he's changed a lot.

114
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,560
I didn't recognize him.

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Will you see him again?

116
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,870
It seemed that you liked him.

117
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,370
No. there's nothing less erotic
than an actor looking for work.

118
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,230
"The Visit".

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,030
Ever since we started touring
with the show, "The Bomb"

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,540
I've been waiting
for this moment.

121
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,870
Today we're playing in the town
where I went to school.

122
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,530
I won't mention its name
so as not to promote it.

123
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,670
I owe my best memories
to the Olympo Cinema

124
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,300
which is now in ruins.

125
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,310
"THE BOMB"

126
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,840
Card.

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,870
- I'm fucking sick of losing!
- Then clear off.

128
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,860
Take a break.

129
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,150
Thank you.

130
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,810
She defines herself as

131
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,140
a mix of desert, hazard,

132
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,270
and cafeteria.

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,920
She's a great artiste

134
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,250
and a great friend of mine.

135
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,050
With all of you,

136
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,220
our next act,

137
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,450
the mystery

138
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,300
and the fascination

139
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,430
of the one and only,

140
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,490
the inimitable,

141
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,360
Zahara!

142
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,210
A bit of applause,
For Crissake!

143
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,510
- So...
- What?

144
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,990
- Listen...
- I'll see you at the hostel.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,750
- Yeah, but...
- Paquito, you heard me.

146
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,100
You've got time
for everything, fag.

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,540
Monda!

148
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,850
Wait for me, love!

149
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,820
Hello.

150
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,660
- What's wrong?
- I can't find my keys.

151
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,030
May I help you?

152
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Sure.

153
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,960
No, they're not here.

154
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Let's see.

155
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,960
Not here either.

156
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,000
Here they are!

157
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,900
My lips are wearing out!

158
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,030
I drank too much.

159
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,730
You're telling me.

160
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,550
Hey!
I'm sucking your dick!

161
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,170
He's out cold!

162
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,990
A kid.

163
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,940
Not a cent.

164
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,800
A lottery ticket.
I'll keep that.

165
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,800
Don't start the engine
right outside.

166
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,510
But he passed out!
Well hung, isn't he?

167
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,550
He's not bad.

168
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,510
And look, he's still hard!

169
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,000
Love...

170
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,950
- Let me suck him off a bit.
- No, you've got things to do.

171
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,510
You've been at him for hours.
Look at your lip!

172
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,350
Come on
the bike won't run away.

173
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,430
Shut up!
Now, go hide the bike.

174
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,510
Hurry back, I'll see you
in your room before 7:00.

175
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,640
Sure, I get all the dirty work
and you have all the fun.

176
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Now you got a hard-on,
asshole!

177
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,210
It's not fair!

178
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,110
Enrique Serrano.

179
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,100
Enrique!

180
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,860
Paquito!

181
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,300
Come up here!

182
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,150
What about the bike?

183
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,960
Leave it there.
Come up.

184
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,310
There's nothing like
loading up on drugs

185
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,420
and on hormones

186
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,890
to end up
as crazy as you, bitch.

187
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,270
The keys!
We're not stealing the bike!

188
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,360
Why not?
We've got a buyer.

189
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,510
I'll explain later.
I'll meet you to go to mass.

190
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,550
- So we're going to the school?
- Yes now more than ever.

191
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm flipped out, bitch!
- I bet.

192
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,670
Dear Enrique.
It's me, Ignacio.

193
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,390
I've dreamed so much
of this moment!

194
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,510
Years have gone by,
but I've never forgotten you.

195
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,070
We have to meet again,
but when you're not plastered.

196
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,750
I want to tell you about my life
and hear about yours

197
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,350
While we eat cream cake
in the Mallol Patisserie,

198
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,500
like when we got out of school
on weekends.

199
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,750
I'm not going
to complicate your life.

200
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,630
I know you're married
and have a child.

201
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,790
I know that
you live in the next town,

202
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,310
that you're broke
and that I'd like to help you.

203
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,880
Right now
I'm working on something,

204
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,240
But I'll explain it all
in the patisserie.

205
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,550
I'll wait for you from 6:00 to 7:00.

206
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,190
Do come!

207
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,480
I adore you.

208
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,500
Ignacio.

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,390
Yes?
- I miss you.

210
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,210
Have you unpacked
all the boxes?

211
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,100
Not even half of them.

212
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,190
Do you need a hand?
I don't mind, really.

213
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,100
It's best if you don't. Martin.
Thanks.

214
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,470
Can I call you later?

215
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm reading.
- Oh, do forgive me.

216
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,730
Don't be so fucking touchy!

217
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,910
I'll call you in a while.
- Do that, even if it's late.

218
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,940
We saw Sara's first films here.

219
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,740
And "Breakfast at Tiffany's"

220
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,300
Enrique and I groped each other
for the first time here.

221
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,870
My knees are trembling
just thinking about it.

222
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,550
I'm meeting him at 6:00
in the patisserie.

223
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,510
Don't get your hopes up.
Remember he's married.

224
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,950
If Fr. Manolo
hadn't separated us...

225
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,830
What's he got to do with it?

226
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,120
A lot, everything!

227
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,470
That priest owes me a lot
and it's time for him to pay.

228
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,590
I hate seeing you like this.

229
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,110
You got anyhing left?

230
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,000
What?

231
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,100
Speedball.

232
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,310
C'mon, let's have some!

233
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,780
- Here?
- Of course.

234
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,310
They haven't
rolled out the streets yet.

235
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,010
Oh, fag !

236
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,150
Come on.

237
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,190
A nailful for my gal Paca.

238
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,370
One more
I believe in couples.

239
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,870
Two fucks, two bumps,
two "amigas".

240
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,940
"Two rode together",
"Two For The Road".

241
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,980
You're such a pig!

242
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,470
Right, let's go to school!

243
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,720
*Gee up, girl!

244
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,860
Come on, best foot forward.

245
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,030
This was my school.

246
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,710
I'm worn out.
Have you anything left?

247
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,410
Be quiet.

248
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,540
It's started.

249
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,310
The God of hope who,
by the grace of the Holy Spirit,

250
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,190
fills us with His joy and peace...

251
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,530
That's Fr. Manolo.

252
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,390
- He looks so old!
- Well, he's no chicken.

253
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,030
I guess.

254
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,930
Zahara, this is crazy!

255
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,720
Are you backing out, bitch?

256
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,150
But the chapel is tiny,
there's nowhere to hide.

257
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
When he sees us appear,

258
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,470
he'll do what Christ did
to the buyers in the temple.

259
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,390
He drovee them out with a whip,
and he was Christ!

260
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,190
So this man who, according
to you, is so imperfect...

261
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,750
I confess to god,
the Father Almighty,

262
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,500
and to you, my brethren,

263
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,720
that I have sinned
through thought, word,

264
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
deed and omission.

265
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,780
Through my fault.

266
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,300
- Through my fault.

267
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,230
Through your fault.

268
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,460
Through my most grievious fault.

269
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,230
So I beseech
the Blessed Mary, ever virgin,

270
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,870
the angels, the saints,

271
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,950
and you, my brethren,

272
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,770
to intercede for me
before Our Lord God.

273
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,310
Almighty God,
have mercy on us,

274
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,750
forgive us our sins
and lead us to eternal life.

275
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,130
Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

276
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,930
We'll see.

277
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,740
The Lord be with you.

278
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,130
I could use Him.

279
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,650
May the blessing
of almighty God,

280
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,860
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

281
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,360
descend upon you.

282
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
You may go in peace.

283
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,120
I hope so!

284
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,560
Go back to the dormitory
and sleep a bit more.

285
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,850
Thank you, Father.

286
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,560
If I'm in the sacristy
for too long, don't wait.

287
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,170
We'll meet at the hostel
for lunch,

288
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,030
sweetheart.

289
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,640
Cute.

290
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:47,980
Divine!

291
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,060
Good morning, Fr. Manolo.

292
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,910
What do you want?
You can't come in here!

293
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,710
I'm the sister of an ex-pupil,
Ignacio Rodriguez.

294
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,800
You still can't come in here

295
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,350
Don't you remember him?

296
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,320
We've had a lot of pupils.

297
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,710
But no one like Ignacio,
I'm sure.

298
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,950
I've brought
an important message from him.

299
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,100
He can give it to me himself.

300
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,420
He can't.

301
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
He died in an accident.

302
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,950
Now, please go.

304
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,150
Go away!

305
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,510
- Hide!
- I've got it all!

306
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,850
Hide, he's coming!

307
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,900
Ignacio...

308
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,710
I told you to leave!
What are you doing here?

309
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,350
The same as you,
remembering Ignacio.

310
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,390
Get out!

311
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,980
We have to talk, Father.

312
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,970
It'll only take a minute.

313
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,070
Say what you have to say
and go!

314
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,910
Are we going to talk in the dark?

315
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,790
I don't mind.

316
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,030
I'm used to working
in the dark.

317
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,310
What do you want?

318
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,940
A better life

319
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,410
and a better body.

320
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,180
What do I have to do
with those improvements?

321
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,110
You could help me
finance them.

322
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,550
I don't believe
Ignacio is dead

323
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,470
or that you're his sister.

324
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,400
I don't even believe
you're a woman.

325
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,190
Are you locking me in?

326
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,220
I don't want anyone
coming in by mistake.

327
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,530
And now,
tell me why you're here!

328
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,760
OK. I'll get to the point.

329
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,150
It's a story by Ignacio.

330
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes, he took your advice
and kept on writing.

331
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,760
I've got a friend,
a pig,

332
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,430
who works at "Diario 16".

333
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,550
He  is very interested
in publishing this story.

334
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,790
But first I'd like our opinion.

335
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,750
Apart from being
Ignacio's literature teacher

336
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,250
you're one of the main characters
in this story.

337
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,510
Read this.

338
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,990
Each month the boys
who got on the honors board,

339
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,630
that is, the ones who got
the best grades,

340
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,350
were rewarded
with a day in the country.

341
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,990
We were always accompanied
by our literature teacher,

342
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,810
Fr. Manolo.

343
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,970
Moon River,

344
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,050
always on my mind.

345
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,330
I won't be swept away

346
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,900
by the water,

347
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,420
the muddy water

348
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,970
of that Moon River

349
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,890
as it flows along.

350
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,740
River and moon,

351
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,440
tell me where to find

352
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,950
my God,
and good and ill.

353
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,190
Tell me.

354
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm longing to know

355
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
what is hidden

356
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,220
in the dark

357
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,800
and you'll find it...

358
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,640
No!

359
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,390
A trickle of blood
divided my forehead in two.

360
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,670
I had a feeling the same thing
would happen with my life.

361
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,340
It would always be divided
and I couldn't help it.

362
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,470
Open the door, Father.
It is I.

363
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,310
What is it?
- There's been a robbery.

364
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,130
- Where?
- In the chapel.

365
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,060
I think it was
after our mass.

366
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,930
Were you missing anything?

367
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,030
The chalice, the paten,
the jug, the cruets...

368
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,430
They must be found!

369
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,350
- The boys mustn't hear about it.
- Very well.

370
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,260
And no one is to bother me,
except you.

371
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,250
Was that Fr. Jos,?

372
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
Ignacio hated him.

373
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,760
- Does he still hit the pupils?
- He never laid a hand on Ignacio.

374
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,430
That was
the principal's privilege.

375
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,800
To sum up,
I want a million in cash.

376
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,460
Or else "Diario 16"
will publish the whole story.

377
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,670
I don't have a million pesetas,
much less in cash.

378
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,120
But you can get it.

379
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,870
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm leaving.

380
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,950
I've said all I had to say.

381
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,790
But keep reading,
it gets better.

382
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,140
- The key.
- Wait.

383
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,180
Wait until after break time.

384
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,490
It'll just be a minute.

385
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,790
So you came to blackmail me.

386
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,050
Tell Ignacio he's overrating
these pages. They're garbage!

387
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,340
Garbage is hot!

388
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,930
You and I make
a best-selling couple.

389
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,150
And the editor of "Diario 16"
knows that.

390
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,130
You're in no position
to threaten anyone.

391
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,490
People will believe me,
not you.

392
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,380
No, people have changed.
This is 1977.

393
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,570
The society puts my freedom
above your hypocrisy.

394
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,430
If we treated Ignacio so badly,
why did he come back?

395
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,520
Why didn't he report us
or change schools?

396
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,910
He came back
'cause he'd fallen in love,

397
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,140
with a classmate.

398
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,550
Enrique Serrano.

399
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,330
Remember him?

400
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,110
Yes.

401
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Do you mind if I keep reading?

402
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,230
There were lots of celebrations
at school.

403
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,330
The most important one
was Principal's Day.

404
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,230
That day, there were
sports competitions

405
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,560
and religious acts,
and we had a special meal.

406
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,770
Come with me, Ignacio.

407
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,410
Come along!

408
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,570
- I haven't finished.
- You'll sing better that way.

409
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,830
Do you know the new words?

410
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,870
Yes, I've got the crib
Fr. Manolo gave me.

411
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,810
Call him Reverend Principal.

412
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,710
He's the school principal
from today.

413
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,930
- I know.
- Don't answer back.

414
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,010
When you're singing,
keep looking at him,

415
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,950
as if there were no one else
in the dining room.

416
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,030
- You understand?
- Yes.

417
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,500
- Yes.

418
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,190
Fr. Jos placed me
In the center of the dining room.

419
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,430
I felt odd in front of
all those priests drinking and eating,

420
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,030
and I was a bit scared,

421
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,270
but they all looked at me kindly,
except Fr. Manolo

422
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,960
who looked ready to cry.

423
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,990
And now,

424
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,480
Fr. Jos, Manuel,

425
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,510
as a birthday gift,

426
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,940
Ignacio is going to sing

427
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,960
one of your favorite songs.

428
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,140
"Torna A Sorrento".

429
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,890
The new words, "Gardener",

430
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,520
were written by Fr. Manolo,

431
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
helped by my humble self.

432
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,000
When you're ready, Ignacio.

433
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,730
Gardener, gardener,

434
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,930
night and day
among our flowers,

435
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,500
setting fire to their colors

436
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,330
with the flame of our love.

437
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,150
And you place in every calyx

438
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,760
the smile of your yearning,

439
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,060
with your eyes
turned up to heaven

440
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,580
where all your hopes reside.

441
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,750
And your flowers, gardener,

442
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,400
with their corollas
burning brightly

443
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,930
join together in gratitude

444
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,490
and embalm you
with their scent.

445
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,190
Continue with your labor,

446
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,750
cultivating all the flowers

447
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,850
entrusted to your love

448
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,920
by the Lord.

449
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,430
- I thought you didn't like me.
- No, just the opposite!

450
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,930
But every time I looked at you,
you looked away.

451
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,020
Because you made me nervous.

452
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,730
- And now I don't?
- No.

453
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,430
"THAT WOMAN"

454
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,390
Come in.

455
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,590
May I help you?

456
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,050
Don't you recognize me, Mother?

457
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,160
Has the world
changed me so much?

458
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,050
Mother Soledad!

459
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,900
What are you doing here?

460
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,960
- I've come to stay.
- To stay?

461
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,110
Sara is so beautiful!

462
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,920
In this house?

463
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,400
No.

464
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,140
Never.

465
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,190
It's been a long time.

466
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,360
who can remember if I did something
I shouldn't have?

467
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,200
It's impossible.

468
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,980
It is not God
who rejects you.

469
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,240
It is I,

470
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,110
in the name of my Order.

471
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,220
What's wrong?
- I can't sleep.

472
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,160
Neither can I.

473
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,230
What we did in the cinema
wasn't right.

474
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,150
- I liked it.
- So did I.

475
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,230
But I think it was a sin,
and God's going to punish us.

476
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,580
God?

477
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,210
I don't believe in God.

478
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,550
- What do you believe in?
- I'm a hedonist.

479
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,350
- What's that?
- People who like having fun.

480
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,450
I read it in an encyclopedia.

481
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,330
What's the matter?

482
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,800
You hear that?

483
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,530
Fr. Manolo!

484
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,400
Open the door!
Or must I break it down

485
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,010
and let the whole school
know what you're doing?

486
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,340
Ignacio!

487
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,550
I know you're in there!

488
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,060
I've seen your feet.

489
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
I can hear you breathing.

490
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,180
Ignacio!

491
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,160
We're not doing anything!

492
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,990
Get out!

493
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,430
I'll deal with you later!

494
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,990
I'm not leaving Ignacio
alone with you.

495
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,980
How dare you!

496
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,860
Get out of here immediately!

497
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,630
Enrique, please.

498
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,970
Do as he says.

499
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,310
Come here.

500
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,690
What were you doing in there?

501
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,300
Nothing.

502
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,500
Nothing?

503
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,520
I swear, Father.

504
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,290
Then why was the door locked?

505
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,370
Come along.

506
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,210
Come with me to the chapel.

507
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,770
The bell!

508
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,920
What are you thinking of?

509
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,310
I think I've just lost my faith
at this moment,

510
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,160
so I no longer believe
in God or hell.

511
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,140
As I don't believe in hell
I'm not afraid,

512
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,210
and without fear
I'm capable of anything.

513
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,440
We'll forget this, Ignacio.

514
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,550
Even if I wanted to,
I can't stay angry with you.

515
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,470
But I promise what happened
tonight won't happen again.

516
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,550
And Enrique?

517
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,780
What about him?

518
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,810
Will he be punished?

519
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,830
I should expel him!

520
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,100
I'm sure he was
responsible for it all.

521
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,960
No, I was.

522
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,520
Don't cry.

523
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,350
He's a very bad influence on you.

524
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,980
I want what's best for you.

525
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,370
If you don't expel him
I'll do what you want.

526
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,840
Hush.

527
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,870
I sold myself for the first time
in that sacristy

528
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,990
to avoid Enrique
being expelled.

529
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,860
But Fr. Manolo tricked me.

530
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,730
I swore that one day
I'd make him pay for that.

531
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,780
On your feet!

532
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,410
Hands behind our head!

533
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,370
And, one!

534
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,240
Change!

535
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,420
Hurry up, Enrique!
We'll miss the bus!

536
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,020
I'm happy you came!

537
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,350
- You're better withoutthe beard.
- Thank you.

538
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,600
What are you doing?

539
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,520
I'm re-reading your story.

540
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,270
- Didn't you like it the first time?
- Of course!

541
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,480
Just look at it.

542
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,020
I couldn't help making notes.
Force of habit.

543
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,040
That's OK-
It's your copy.

544
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,800
Thanks.

545
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,300
Right, well...
How can I put this?

546
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,610
I think there's a good film
in this story

547
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,600
and I'd like to direct it.

548
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,760
Really?

549
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,720
You're not kidding me?

550
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,610
I never joke about work.

551
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,410
But firs, tell me how much
you want for the rights.

552
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,100
What rights?

553
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,860
The story is yours!

554
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,310
Do what you fucking want
with it!

555
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,420
So you really liked it?

556
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,980
I admit that when you said
it was based on our childhood

557
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,670
I felt...

558
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,580
a bit apprehensive.

559
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,760
But I was very touched.

560
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,970
I'm so happy, man.

561
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,040
Remember I'm an actor
and I want out of Bumblebee

562
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,290
Yes, I know that.

563
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,240
You'd be perfect
as Enrique Serrano.

564
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,510
Naked on the bed,

565
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,830
with Zahara's letter
on the pillow.

566
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,940
Enrique Serrano?

567
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,660
I think I'd rather play Zahara.

568
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,980
Zahara, you?

569
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,320
You're crazy!

570
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,850
- Why?
- Well...

571
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,210
You're too well-built.
You're not right.

572
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,400
Martin, we've got our story!

573
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,010
I can slim down!
I can get into the part!

574
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,340
I'm used to that in the theater.
Like De Niro...

575
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,560
Make a photocopy.

576
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,190
"The Visit"?

577
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:02,850
Yes.

578
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,590
Ignacio and I are starting
on the script.

579
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,990
If you're going to direct it,
it's best if you write it yourself.

580
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,340
All right, Ignacio.

581
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
Angel!
Start calling me Angel,

582
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,990
or you'll never get used to it.

583
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,170
Do you mind driving?

584
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,060
I'm a bit shaky.

585
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,670
I'm surprised you can even walk,
with all you've taken.

586
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,310
- We had to celebrate, right?

587
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,630
I thought we'd be talking
about the project.

588
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,910
We'll talk later.

589
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,470
We've got time.

590
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,200
Remember?

591
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,470
Remember what?

592
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,820
Nothing.

593
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,950
You're really high.

594
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,350
What should I remember?

595
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,540
Nothing.

596
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,400
Turn off here.

597
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,070
Is all this ours?

598
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,790
No, no way.
I've just rented it.

599
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,750
Don't be too impressed,
it's a mess inside.

600
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,510
How about a swim?

601
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,360
It would do you good.

602
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,930
How's the water?

603
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,120
It's waiting for you.

604
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,130
"THE PEARL"

605
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,290
Will you pass me a cigarette?

606
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,980
You weren't serious about
playing Zahara, were you?

607
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:28,820
Totally.

608
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,340
I don't joke about work either.

609
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,940
Then let's not talk about work.

610
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,830
What are you doing?

611
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,580
Sleeping here
or going back to Madrid?

612
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,650
If you want, I'll stay.

613
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,050
But, talking about bodies,

614
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,800
if I look too manly
I can slim down.

615
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,970
I'm very flexible,
I can do anything.

616
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,670
You disconcert me, Angel.

617
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,880
You told me that already.

618
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,190
And you told me
about slimming down.

619
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,460
Why don't we just talk clearly?

620
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,870
I can't say it
any more clearly!

621
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,910
I'm an actor.

622
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,870
I spent three fucking years
doing shit with Bumblebee.

623
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,710
This is my first chance
to get a terrific part

624
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,910
and I won't let it slip away.

625
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,500
You can't do Zahara.

626
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,290
Not at first sight,
but give me time!

627
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,350
You're a good director,

628
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,920
and I'll do anything!

629
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,870
You just have
to trust both of us.

630
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,220
I've tried.

631
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,630
But I can't trust you.

632
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:32,740
Why?

633
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,020
I just can't recognize
the Ignacio I knew at school.

634
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,230
The one who loved "Cuore Matto",
and so many other things.

635
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,870
My tastes have changed.

636
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,960
Is that what bothers you?

637
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,130
People change with time.

638
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,590
Not you.

639
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,430
Simply, you're not Ignacio.

640
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,270
Who the fuck are you to decide
who I am or who I'm not?

641
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,260
How dare you?

642
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,560
Why am I not Ignacio?

643
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,430
Because I don't remember
a song from years ago?

644
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,290
- Apart from that.
- Because I'm not sucking our dick?

645
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,080
If I'd stayed the kid you knew,
I'd be dead now.

646
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,260
I already am.

647
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,290
Dead tired.

648
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,600
I'm going to bed.

649
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,550
What are you doing?

650
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,870
I don't know.

651
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,880
You tell me.

652
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,760
Tell you what?

653
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,720
If I'm going to play Zahara.

654
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,390
Does your staying
depend on that?

655
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:41,920
No.

656
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,600
But if I don't play Zahara
there's no film.

657
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,730
Then I don't know
why you're here, cockteaser.

658
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,710
Get out!

659
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,170
Why the hell did I decide
to see you again, fucking faggot!

660
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,550
"A woman threw herself
into a pool of hungry crocodiles

661
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,340
in a zoo that was crowded
with visitors at the time.

662
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,670
When the first crocodile attacked,
the woman hugged it,

663
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,150
according to witnesses.

664
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,430
The crocodiles devoured
the body of the woman,

665
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,980
who never complained,

666
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,370
in a few minutes."

667
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,690
What a horrible death!

668
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:47,960
Well...

669
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,820
She didn't even open her mouth.

670
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,540
What's on your mind?

671
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,670
Hungry crocodiles.

672
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,300
Hello, come in.

673
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,570
It's the journalist.

674
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,150
Why are you here?

675
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,560
To interview me?

676
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,260
No.
Well, yes.

677
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,750
Which is it, cutie?

678
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,420
I'm not a journalist,
I'm an actor.

679
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,860
And I'd like you to help me
prepare a character.

680
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,650
What character?

681
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,350
A tranny who imitates
Sara Montiel, among others.

682
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,270
That's me!
Why don't they give me the part?

683
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,820
Well, you're not an actor,
you're just a faggot.

684
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,150
What you have to learn
is how to be polite,

685
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,000
because that's no way
to treat a lady!

686
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,040
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,120
So will you teach me?

688
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,200
And how will you pay me,
honey?

689
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,440
That's what I'm looking for!

690
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,030
Two minutes!

691
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,590
We'll talk later.

692
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,870
I'm on now.

693
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,270
Everything you do
is great for me.

694
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,320
I'm delighted.

695
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,360
See you later.

696
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,610
"THE PEARL"

697
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,560
Ortigueira, 6 miles.

698
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,280
"THE PEARL HOSTEL"

699
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,200
- What can I get you?
- A beer.

700
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,030
Forgive me for asking,
but how did you get that lighter?

701
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,110
- You're not from here.
- I stole it from a friend.

702
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,690
His family lives here.

703
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,350
Maybe you know him.
His name is Angel Andrade.

704
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:23,690
Yes.

705
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,470
- That's his stage name.
- Sure I know him.

706
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,460
- You do?
- Yes, very well.

707
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,540
That's great.

708
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,360
Who is it?

709
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,460
Enrique.
I was at school with Ignacio.

710
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,150
Go away
or I'll call the police!

711
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,390
Excuse me.

712
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,170
Are you Enrique Goded?

713
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:19,820
Yes.

714
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,040
I'm Ignacio's mother.

715
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,190
I'm delighted to meet you.

716
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,890
- Come in.
- Thank you.

717
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,600
Forgive my sister-in-law.

718
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,630
I've got the heart problem
but she's the one gets scared.

719
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,970
It doesn't matter.

720
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,090
Ignacio talked a lot about you.

721
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,180
- We were very good friends.
- I know.

722
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,910
The last time he came to see me
He wrote you a letter.

723
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,610
A letter?

724
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,470
I never got it.

725
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,440
It was three years ago.

726
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:57,590
He didn't know your address.
he sent it to the Ministry of Culture.

727
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,280
Then I'm not surprised.

728
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,540
By the time it was returned,
he was dead.

729
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,480
Let's go into the dining room.

730
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,360
That's my son Juan.

731
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,960
The younger boy.

732
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,350
He's in the theater.

733
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,980
He's changed his name.

734
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,550
He says
there are too many Juans.

735
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,170
He wants even me
to call him Angel.

736
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,950
I'd like to see Ignacio's room.

737
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,030
To be honest,
he didn't really have a room.

738
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,710
But when he came,
he liked to use the attic.

739
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,570
Would you like to see it?

740
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,470
We're going upstairs!

741
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,660
Juan burned everything.

742
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,950
The notebooks, the clothes...

743
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,550
All except those magazines.

744
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,530
There's nothing left
of what Ignacio wrote?

745
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,600
What a pity!

746
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,530
Are you from a publisher too?

747
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,450
What publisher?

748
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,530
Soon after Ignacio died,

749
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,110
a man came who was in charge
of publishing young authors,

750
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,210
or so he said.

751
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,840
He was desparate to get
his hands on Ignacio's stories.

752
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,470
Do you remember his name,
or the publisher's?

753
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,630
No, but he was very insistent.

754
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,630
So I told the truth,
that Juan had burned everything,

755
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,070
and he even asked
for Juan's address.

756
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,630
I gave him a false one,
of course.

757
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,360
I think the man
was half mad.

758
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,840
This is Ignacio's letter.

759
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,950
It didn't get burned

760
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,340
because I never told Juan
it had been returned.

761
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,870
Thank you, ma'am.

762
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,540
Don't judge my Juan.

763
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,280
He's a good son

764
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,450
but his brother's death
really hit him.

765
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,940
He was the one who found him.

766
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,610
Dear Enrique,

767
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,350
At last I've got news of you.

768
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,150
I read it in the papers.

769
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,750
You've directed
your first film, man.

770
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,180
Even if it was underground.
And to think I was the film buff!

771
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,070
You'll be pleased to hear
I'm still writing.

772
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,150
I'm enclosing a story
that would make a divine film.

773
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,790
Fr. Manolo inspired it.

774
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,790
It's incredible, but I ran into him
the other day in Valencia.

775
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,430
I'm visiting my mother now,
but I live in Valencia.

776
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,030
I've checked up,
he isn't a priest anymore.

777
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,250
He calls himself
by his last name, Berenguer.

778
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,360
He works in a publisher's,
he's married and has a son.

779
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,150
I thought: He's crying out
to be blackmailed!

780
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,590
So I wrote "The Visit",
the story I'm sending you.

781
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,760
Read it, please.

782
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,270
At this point in my life,
I need a lot of money

783
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,070
and I'm going to get it
from that fucker!

784
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,400
He owes me a lot,

785
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,710
and it's time for him to pay.

786
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,790
Writ to me and I'll tell you
the rest of the story.

787
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,430
All I'm asking
is to hear from you.

788
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,170
I can only share this story
with you.

789
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,740
I love you.

790
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,650
Your Ignacio.

791
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,210
I'll get it.

792
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,150
What do you want?

793
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,160
I've come to apologize.

794
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,250
I'll give you your shorts.
You left them behind.

795
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,150
Thank you.

796
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,610
I'm very sorry
about what I said.

797
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,320
I take it all back.

798
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,350
If you're still interested.
"The Visit" is yours.

799
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,270
Do it with whoever
and however you want.

800
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,030
Have you lost weight?

801
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,620
Yes.
I'm really working at it.

802
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,880
I want to lose even more.
And I'm taking classes.

803
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,200
- Classes in what?
- In how to be a queen.

804
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,070
I'm working with the best
Sara Montiel impersonator.

805
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,230
She performs at "Bambola",
a gay club.

806
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,830
I'm working as a waiter there

807
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,690
so I can study the queens
more closely.

808
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,080
Then you're still
thinking about Zahara.

809
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,420
Yes.

810
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,930
Just let me do an audition.

811
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,310
Thank you.

812
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,580
- You had it!
- Yes you left that behind too.

813
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,670
Ignacio,
I'd like to talk...

814
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,430
Until you call me Angel, I wont
believe you're taking me seriously.

815
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,160
Angel,
I'm sure you're a good actor,

816
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,870
now more than ever.

817
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,350
So you'll let me audition?

818
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,430
The audition worked
for several months,

819
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,310
long enough for me to throw myself
into the shooting of "The Visit",

820
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,990
like the woman who
threw herself to the crocodiles

821
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,380
and hugged them
as they ate her.

822
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,340
You've changed the ending.

823
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,130
Yes.

824
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,030
"The Visit" cant end happily,
like your story.

825
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:33,380
Why?

826
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,750
Zahara can't just
walk out of the school.

827
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,960
She's a danger to the priests.

828
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,790
And we know
what the Church is capable of.

829
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,480
But this ending
is really heavy, man.

830
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,790
For you, as an actor,
it's much more interesting.

831
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,840
- You think so?
- Of course.

832
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,830
I shot "The Visit"
as a homage to Ignacio.

833
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,950
In his letter, he said
he'd love to see it on the screen.

834
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,870
And also to discover
the enigma of Juan.

835
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,240
He allowed me
to penetrate him frequently,

836
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,640
but only physically.

837
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:09,960
We were about to finish shooting
and my mystery was still intact.

838
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:12,670
But on the last day

839
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,310
we had a visit.

840
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:16,070
Silence!

841
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,560
And... roll camera!

842
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,440
Rolling!

843
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,590
"The Visit"
91, 1, 1, first take.

844
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,650
Zahara, darling!

845
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:26,570
Action!

846
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,000
The boys are in class
and I'm sick of arguing.

847
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,860
Let me out!

848
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,060
Do you want to kidnap me?

849
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,870
Open the door!

850
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,330
I have to take a piss,
buy cigarettes, get a fix!

851
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,390
Even if I got the money,

852
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,050
how can I be sure
you won't blackmail me again?

853
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,470
You'll never be sure.

854
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,800
That's my revenge.

855
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,080
Let me out or I'll scream.

856
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,240
I loved Ignacio.

857
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,270
You don't love a boy of ten.
You harass him, you abuse him!

858
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,480
I loved him.

859
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,640
Please, let me out!

860
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:17,900
I'm locked in!

861
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,550
She's threatening
to denounce us.

862
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,920
She wants a million pesetas
to keep quiet.

863
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,370
If you give her a single peseta,
you'll never stop paying.

864
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,380
I knew we'd meet again,
scum!

865
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:58,600
You know her?

866
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,950
You knew him
much better than I did.

867
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,590
It's Ignacio Rodriguez.

868
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:06,090
Ignacio!

869
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:10,640
It can't be!

870
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:14,150
We have to finish him off.

871
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,060
He's a danger to the
whole congregation!

872
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,500
He wants to say something.

873
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,350
Yes, that we let him go.

874
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,540
If you're going to kill me,

875
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,350
I'd like to confess first.

876
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,730
Confess what?

877
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,620
Thanks to you
we've got no way out.

878
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,060
You have to stay calm.

879
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,700
I'll get rid of the body.

880
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,300
How?

881
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,400
It's best if you know nothing.

882
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,170
It was self-defense.

883
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,430
He'd have made
our lives impossible.

884
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:07,780
Yes,

885
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,700
I guess so.

886
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,280
And there are no witnesses.

887
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,180
God.

888
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:17,350
Yes,

889
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,090
But He's on our side.

890
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,300
Cut!

891
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,810
We've cut, guys!

892
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,000
This one's good.
What about the other one?

893
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,870
Give me No. 1 as well.

894
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,440
Well done, guys.

895
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,270
No, it was great.

896
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,840
Is anything wrong?

897
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,360
I'll see you later.

898
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,850
It went really well.

899
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,230
Put that down!
Who are you?

900
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,360
The villain in your film.

901
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,770
Fr. Manolo!

902
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,270
Mr. Berenguer.

903
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,330
I'm even a father
To my own son now.

904
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:12,990
Get out!

905
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,240
I read in a magazine
that you were here.

906
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,190
Go and drink some hot milk
with honey, and an aspirin,

907
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,590
and leave me alone.

908
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,770
I've got a lot to do,
I can't waste time on you.

909
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,230
Not even to find out
how Ignacio died?

910
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,610
Or who killed him?

911
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,560
And if it coincides
with your film?

912
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,990
Say what you have to say
and go.

913
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,360
I was living in Valencia.

914
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,180
I worked for a publisher
that promoted young writers.

915
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,270
Three years ago, I received
a story called "The Visit",

916
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,290
signed by Ignacio Rodriguez.

917
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,710
Ignacio Rodriguez is calling
about the new writers anthology.

918
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,710
Didn't you tell him
he was rejected?

919
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,310
Yes, but he insists
on speaking to you.

920
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,700
He's on your line.

921
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,270
- Mr. Jos, Manuel Berenguer?
- Yes.

922
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,970
- I preferred Fr. Manolo.
- Excuse me?

923
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,510
- Are you the author of "The Visit"?
- Yes.

924
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,870
We decided not to include it
in "Short Stories of the 80s"

925
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,720
- I'm sorry.
- You and I have to talk.

926
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,190
I think not.
I've got nothing more to say.

927
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:37,940
But I do.

928
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,320
I went to St. John's School.

929
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,960
You were my literature teacher,

930
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,970
and you were
madly in love with me.

931
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,630
I remember how
you'd embrace me from behind

932
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,680
while you declared your love.

933
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,860
I can't believe you've forgotten.

934
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,430
I remember the buttons
on your soutane

935
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,190
digging into my backbone.

936
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,230
Have you realy forgotten?

937
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,430
I'll expect you
at my house at 7:00.

938
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,340
My address is on the back
of the envelope, Fr. Manolo.

939
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,040
Push the door.

940
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,730
It's just stuck.

941
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,230
That wasn't the Ignacio
you and I loved.

942
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,700
Hello, Mr. Berenguer.

943
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,240
I'm Ignacio.

944
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,680
Please, come in.

945
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,460
Yes I'm a junkie

946
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,050
but I want to quit
and I thought you could help me.

947
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,820
Well, I know a clinic.

948
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,590
So do I, but first I want
to fix my self up a bit.

949
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,270
I know I've got divine tits,
but everything else...

950
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,670
Anyway, I won't get into that.

951
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,120
Looking pretty
costs a lot of money, Fr. Manolo.

952
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,720
I think a million would do it.

953
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,190
A million?

954
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,750
Yes, in cash, and my lips
are sealed. I won't say a word.

955
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,490
You're out of our mind!

956
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,950
Sexual harassment
is frowned upon, Fr. Manolo.

957
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,930
What would your wife think,
or your boss?

958
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,830
You're in no position
to blackmail anyone.

959
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,290
I could have you
arrested tonight.

960
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:48,790
Very well.

961
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,350
You call the police,
I'll call our wife and the media.

962
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,870
A blackmailer can't be
as defenseless as you are.

963
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,490
Believe me,
I know what I'm saying.

964
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,630
Juan, go back to your room.

965
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,080
I want to watch TV.

966
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,200
Watch it later,
We're talking business.

967
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,470
I don't mind if he stays.

968
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,970
I'm sure you don't.

969
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,350
He's my brother,
he's looking after me.

970
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,230
Or that's my mother's idea.

971
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,570
I'm Mr. Berenguer.

972
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,580
One million, end of story.

973
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,030
Do you want me
to call him Juan,

974
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,370
or Angel?

975
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,900
The blackmail
became an investment for me.

976
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,500
I visited the brothers frequently
so I could keep seeing Juan.

977
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,790
Remember Don Narciso,
The Nazi?

978
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,830
He loved my illustrations.
Look at this one.

979
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,460
And there's another one...
Look, this is beautiful.

980
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,980
And this one...

981
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,670
- "Children of Spain".
- I brought you this.

982
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,180
I kept Ignacio happy
with small amounts of money.

983
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,260
And I kept stalling him.

984
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,820
I desired Juan,

985
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,030
more and more everyday.

986
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:38,580
Hello.

987
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,530
You brought the dough?

988
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,260
I can only give you 50,000.

989
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,000
You said
you'd bring the million!

990
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,350
I said they'd tell me today
If I'd get the loan.

991
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,400
They said yes,

992
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,400
but they have
to check my guarantees.

993
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,440
I need another three weeks.

994
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,200
Another three weeks!

995
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,630
I'm a junkie.
Haven't you noticed?

996
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,900
I could be dead in three weeks.

997
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,160
- Are you going away?
- Obviously!

998
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,270
I want to see my mother
before I check in.

999
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,710
She has to see me with these teeth
and this face, and it's your fault!

1000
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,200
Don't be unfair, Ignacio,
I'm doing what I can.

1001
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,420
Then do more!

1002
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,510
I'll be gone for a week.

1003
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,510
When I come back
I want that million.

1004
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,510
If you don't have it, you'll be sorry.
I'm sick of being put off!

1005
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,830
I'll try to hurry them up, but...

1006
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:43,600
Father!

1007
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,210
Come along.

1008
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,070
Shall I help you?

1009
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,690
Sure, take the Olivetti,
it's the heaviest.

1010
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,550
While you're at it,
take this too.

1011
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,020
Stop that taxi.

1012
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,550
- Bye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1013
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,190
Open the trunk, please.

1014
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:51,930
My scarf!

1015
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,030
Excuse me.

1016
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,370
I've come for my scarf.
I must have left it here.

1017
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,290
- Fuck, it's really soft!
- Silk

1018
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,100
It's yours.

1019
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,220
To be honest,
I left it here for you.

1020
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,980
Cut it out,
I'm not Ignacio!

1021
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,260
Fortunately.

1022
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,410
What time is it?

1023
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:42,990
12:30.

1024
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,710
Did he give you anything
for me?

1025
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:48,590
Ignacio? No.

1026
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:49,720
Fuck!

1027
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,830
I had to pay
my school fees today.

1028
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,060
Are you studying?

1029
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,130
Yes. Drama.

1030
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,710
I'm an actor.

1031
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,670
Selfish bastard!

1032
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,150
He knew I had to pay today
and he didn't give me anything.

1033
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,080
Obviously, I paid his fees.

1034
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,020
I hadn't told Ignacio,

1035
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,370
but the bank granted me
a loan of two million.

1036
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,680
I withdrew the first million.

1037
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,420
I told my wife I was going
to a conference abroad.

1038
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,140
She didn't believe me.

1039
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,340
I guess
that doesn't interest you.

1040
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,190
Not in the least.

1041
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,050
How did Ignacio die?

1042
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,920
The week Juan and I
spent alone

1043
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,310
was the happiest in my life.

1044
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,350
Every day
I bought him something.

1045
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,040
Clothes, a walkman,
a Super-8 camera.

1046
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,450
I enjoyed the gifts
more than he did.

1047
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,530
Take off your shirt.

1048
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,280
Take it off.

1049
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,480
Now it's my turn!

1050
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,730
Now take that off.

1051
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,290
Show me your cock.

1052
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,470
If you're going to shoot my dick,

1053
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,120
don't show my face!

1054
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,450
Too late.

1055
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,380
I can't...!

1056
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,590
You!
Give me some dough!

1057
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,230
I've got the fucking sweats.

1058
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,190
- How's mom?
- She had another heart attack.

1059
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,840
But she's all right now.
I'm the one who's sick.

1060
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,630
The dough!

1061
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,550
- More!
- That's all I have.

1062
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,530
I want that million now!
No more excuses!

1063
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,560
No more stalling
and no more gifts.

1064
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:39,700
Mom!

1065
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,080
How are you, Juan?
Has Ignacio arrived?

1066
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,460
Yes.

1067
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,190
What happened this time?

1068
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,180
The usual thing, son, but...

1069
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,530
He stole my pension,
and I'd just gotten it!

1070
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,360
- Is that true?
- Yes, love, it is.

1071
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,990
Tell auntie
I'll send her some money.

1072
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,080
He promised me
he was going into a clinic.

1073
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,230
And you believed him?

1074
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:06,070
Yes, this time he really means it
He's going to try.

1075
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,730
- You have to help him.
- How?

1076
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,670
By being with him.
Don't leave him.

1077
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,490
Promise me.

1078
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,150
I promise.

1079
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,960
Listen, did he give you

1080
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,710
the cheese and the chorizos?

1081
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,420
Delicious!

1082
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,350
Why did you bother?

1083
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,310
There's food in Valencia.
Don't spend your money.

1084
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,230
They're your favorites.
I'd kept them for you.

1085
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,350
You can't get them in Valencia
- All right, thanks.

1086
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,790
- Lots of love, son.
- Yes, call me if anything happens.

1087
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,300
Don't worry, I will.

1088
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:35,700
Bye.

1089
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,680
Where's Ignacio?

1090
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,190
I'm going to kill him!

1091
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,040
It was Juan's idea.

1092
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,550
Or mine, I don't know.

1093
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,860
Thhe only solution
was to get rid of him.

1094
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,050
More or less
what you've just shot.

1095
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,630
But not as violent.

1096
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,630
How did you think of it?

1097
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,150
Ignacio's story
doesn't end like that.

1098
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:11,330
While I was adapting it,
I found out that Ignacio was dead.

1099
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,610
Did Juan tell you?

1100
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,140
I found out my self.

1101
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,050
Willl you just tell me
how it happened?

1102
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,950
I arranged to meet Juan
at the Museum of Giant Figures.

1103
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,870
He had it all planned out.

1104
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,020
Much more than
it seemed at first.

1105
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,590
I'll buy the junk
and you give it to him.

1106
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,170
Why me?

1107
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,900
Fuck, he's my brother!

1108
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,980
I'm not a monster.

1109
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,830
Do you think
this doesn't hurt me?

1110
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,980
But he's ruining all our lives.

1111
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,200
What will we do afterwards?

1112
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,520
We won't meet for a while.

1113
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:58,660
Why?

1114
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,070
You said
there'd be no investigation.

1115
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,060
Just in case.

1116
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,980
It's best
not to arouse suspicion.

1117
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,790
I'll go and look after my mother,
she'll need it.

1118
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,860
When things calm down,
I'll call you and we'll go away.

1119
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,610
- Have you got the money?
- Yes.

1120
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,910
What will I do
while I'm waiting?

1121
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,300
Work, earn money.
We'll need it.

1122
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,650
The situation at home
is unbearable.

1123
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,750
Apologize to your wife
and enjoy your son.

1124
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,430
- Tell her the truth,
- What?

1125
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,940
Say you've been
with someone else,

1126
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,190
a woman.

1127
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,630
Give me your mother's address.

1128
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,300
It's best if I don't.

1129
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,710
Then you won't be tempted
to come see me.

1130
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,860
What are they laughing at?

1131
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,040
They're laughing at us.

1132
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,570
At me, at least.

1133
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,920
Juan bought deadly pure heroin.

1134
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:01,780
He gave it to me

1135
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,030
and I went to Ignacio's.

1136
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:04,540
Alone.

1137
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,170
Dear Enrique:

1138
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,400
I think I've succeeded...

1139
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,460
This is my last fix.

1140
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,670
What do you mean?

1141
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,300
I'm quitting.

1142
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,060
This time I really am.

1143
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,230
Before I get my face
and all the rest done,

1144
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,680
I'm checking
into a detox clinic.

1145
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,270
I've already applied.

1146
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,240
Good.

1147
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,670
You'll have the money tomorrow.

1148
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,480
I hope so.

1149
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,640
Before noon, OK?

1150
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,110
Just in case,
I wrote two letters,

1151
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,150
one for the publisher
and the other for your wife,

1152
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,470
telling all you've hidden from them
in the past and present.

1153
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,470
- That's unnecessary. Give them to me!
- When I get the money.

1154
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,350
Before noon.

1155
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,450
Pretty, aren't they?

1156
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,320
What?

1157
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:26,790
My tits.

1158
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,110
Yes, they're wonderful.

1159
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,470
Thank you.

1160
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,150
Shall I help you?

1161
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,430
Go away.

1162
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,360
I don't like fixing
in front of you.

1163
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,680
It's done.

1164
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,820
Pull in here.

1165
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,750
We'll go to the cinema
to kill time.

1166
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,920
"FILM NOIR WEEK"

1167
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,710
It's as if all films
were talking about us.

1168
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:27,610
Now what?

1169
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,470
I'm going home.

1170
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,250
- You want me to go with you?
- No, you'd better not.

1171
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,370
Remember to get
those two letters.

1172
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,310
If you don't
we'll be in trouble.

1173
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,760
I'll get everything,
don't worry.

1174
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,320
If we won't be seeing
each other for a while,

1175
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,660
give me some of the Super-8s.

1176
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,370
It would console me
to see us screwing.

1177
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:04,960
You're nuts!

1178
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,290
What if your wife saw them?

1179
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,560
We have to burn them.
I'll take care of that.

1180
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,540
Let's go.

1181
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,580
Get in for a minute.

1182
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,860
No, I'm going to take a taxi

1183
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:30,590
Then,

1184
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,340
I won't see you again...

1185
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:36,330
It's just for a few days.

1186
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,570
Call me as soon as you can.

1187
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:49,910
Yes.

1188
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,860
What's wrong?

1189
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:02,870
You!

1190
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:04,530
At last!

1191
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:07,870
I read in this film magazine
that you were here.

1192
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,500
What did you tell him?

1193
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:10,550
Everything.

1194
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:15,450
- Now you only have me, darling.
- You're crazy.

1195
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,350
Remember I've got
my brother's letters,

1196
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,830
accusing you of his death.

1197
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:23,970
- We both did it, my love.
- The letters only mention you.

1198
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:25,210
Wait.

1199
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,020
- Are you all right?
- Leave me alone!

1200
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,490
If I ever see you again,
I swear I'll kill you!

1201
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,590
Now that I've found you,
I won't let you go.

1202
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,160
Get used to the idea.

1203
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,360
Monica!

1204
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,080
- Can you give me a lift?
- Sure.

1205
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,550
Get in the front.

1206
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,100
- Who was that?
- Someone looking for Enrique.

1207
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,200
Who is it?

1208
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:37,560
It's me.

1209
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,900
Give me back the keys.

1210
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,680
Your things are in the hall.
Take them away.

1211
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,730
The taxi's gone.

1212
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,930
You'll have to lend me the car
or drive me back to Madrid.

1213
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,010
I want to order a taxi.

1214
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,150
11, Avenida del Agua.

1215
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,200
Enrique Goded, yes.

1216
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,510
Thank you.

1217
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,710
I was going to tell you
after the shoot.

1218
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,700
Tell me what?

1219
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,520
That my name is Juan.

1220
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:59,230
That I'm Ignacio's brother
and Ignacio died four years ago.

1221
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,690
I knew that already.

1222
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,680
I know that you knew.

1223
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,630
What do you mean?

1224
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,310
My mother rang to tell me
you'd been to the house.

1225
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,830
I guessed
you'd learned everything.

1226
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,040
When you asked for the audition,
you knew that I knew?

1227
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,380
Yes.

1228
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,100
And you still kept pretending?

1229
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,720
What else could I do?

1230
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,830
I didn't lie,
you knew everyhing.

1231
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,800
No, I didn't, far from it.

1232
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:27,150
I knew that you'd taken Ignacio's place
and that he was dead,

1233
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,230
but I never imagined
that you'd killed him!

1234
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,190
That's the taxi.

1235
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,750
I didn't kill him, Berenguer did!
Ignacio was blackmailing him.

1236
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,620
And you were hustling him!

1237
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,430
The taxi's waiting.

1238
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,590
You don't know what it is
to have a brother like that

1239
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,450
and live in a small town.

1240
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,160
Juan,

1241
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,410
the taxi is waiting.

1242
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,500
Why did you choose me?

1243
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,210
You still don't see me
as Zahara.

1244
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,210
Was it just to fuck me?

1245
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,180
It was curiosity.

1246
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,400
I wanted to see
how far you would go

1247
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,870
and how much I could take.

1248
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,970
I would go a lot further.

1249
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:35,930
I bet you would.

1250
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,300
You needn't explain anymore.

1251
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,810
It's not mine.
It's from Ignacio.

1252
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,960
Dear Enrique:
I think I've succeeded...

1253
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,150
"After the release of "The Visit"

1254
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,470
Angel Andrade
became the top heart throb.

1255
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,830
His reign
lasted for ten years.

1256
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,990
In the '90s, his career
suffered ups and downs.

1257
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,150
He married Monica,
the wardrobe girl.

1258
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,190
At present,
he works solely on TV series."

1259
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,230
"Mr. Berenguer
(formerly Fr. Manolo)

1260
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,350
didn't vanish from the life
of Angel Andrade (Juan).

1261
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,710
He started asking for money
and blackmailing him.

1262
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,870
One night, he was run down
and killed by a car that didn't stop.

1263
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,560
The car was driven
By Angel Andrade."

1264
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:52,250
"Enrique Goded is still making films
With the same passion."
