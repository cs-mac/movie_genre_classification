1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,477
- Good afternoon.
- Sir.

3
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:35,618
If the telephone rings from Austria,

4
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:41,145
nobody can talk to the king
except the emperor. Understood?

5
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:45,561
If anybody telephones from Russia, find me.

6
00:01:56,511 --> 00:02:00,473
- Who'll make the first move?
- Got any money?

7
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,878
Of course. How much do you want?

8
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,739
- Is this a bet?
- No, I never bet.

9
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,989
Four will do.

10
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:17,659
If you've lost your heir
to the throne, as Austria has,

11
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:21,100
you feel you have to do something.

12
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:26,811
So you declare war on who you imagine
is responsible. Serbia.

13
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,675
- But you don't really mean it.
- How come?

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,281
The Austrian generals and the German generals
are on holiday.

15
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,308
- So are we.
- Absolutely.

16
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:42,849
You don't declare war
when everyone's on holiday

17
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:44,902
and not have them return.

18
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,821
It's show. That's how it will stay,

19
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:52,795
so long as Russia
doesn't get everybody excited

20
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,231
and decide to mobilise its army

21
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:58,783
to come to the aid of Serbia.

22
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,649
Germany would feel it had to make a move,

23
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:13,638
and we wouldn't approve of that.

24
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,808
Who knows what we would do?

25
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,649
But there's no chance
of any of this happening

26
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,863
because the Russian emperor
finds it hard to make decisions.

27
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,033
The end of Sandringham time in London.

28
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:47,595
All clocks will show the same time
as everywhere else.

29
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,390
Don't look so worried.

30
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:55,173
Germany will back down by the end of the day.

31
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,994
Your Majesty.

32
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,907
- He hasn't rung yet?
- No, Your Majesty.

33
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,920
I like small rooms.
It reminds me of my time at sea.

34
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,604
- You don't mind me staying?
- No, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:37,002
Georgie!

36
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:44,585
You gave me such a start!
I thought it might be news.

37
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:49,912
I'm afraid I've no news,
except I must speak to Papa.

38
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:57,288
- I cannot go to naval college.
- I cannot change Papa's mind.

39
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,290
And neither will you. Today is not the day.

40
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:05,569
Today is certainly not the day.

41
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:11,757
I'm ensuring every piece
of furniture in the collection

42
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,650
has the correct label,

43
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,751
the correct date

44
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,129
- and its place of origin.
- There'll be good news.

45
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:28,035
We'll hear from the Germans.
Everybody expects good news.

46
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:31,694
There are only a few hours left. It's possible.

47
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:36,070
Johnnie!

48
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:42,824
Johnnie, quickly,
it's Georgie on the telephone.

49
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:52,920
- I can hear you.
- I haven't said anything yet!

50
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:57,223
- I hear you very well.
- I'm ringing you

51
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,157
because there's extraordinary business.

52
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:05,932
We might be about to go to war.
Did you hear that?

53
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,512
- When?
- When? Well, now!

54
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:12,751
I see. When will the foreigners come?

55
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,794
I hate looking at that machine,
waiting for it to ring.

56
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:42,948
Good evening, gentlemen.

57
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:49,246
Good evening, gentlemen.
What a business, eh?

58
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,055
Every time the telephone rang today,

59
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,672
I thought it was them backing down.

60
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,519
Three times it was the Portuguese ambassador.

61
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:01,179
I was saying, "Don't put him through!"

62
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:05,034
He's probably talking to His Majesty right now!

63
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:09,596
But it's to the wire, gentlemen.
Right to the wire.

64
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:13,382
Everybody's completely worn out.

65
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:25,426
I'm still not at all sure you're going to win.

66
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:28,726
- The bet.
- I never did make a bet.

67
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:32,351
I don't know what needs
to happen to make me win.

68
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,606
We thought it would be over by 9:00.

69
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,539
It's 11:30 and we still don't know.

70
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:42,023
Why are they making so much noise?

71
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:45,607
The military want to show what they can do.

72
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,948
They want to give the Germans
a short, sharp shock.

73
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:54,203
Very little time to go, gentlemen.

74
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:05,327
Come in, gentlemen.

75
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:11,698
So that's it.

76
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,898
I Just lost.

77
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,331
Dear Lord, make this war...

78
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:44,049
- a very short war.

79
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,785
- Do something for your country!
- Be a soldier!

80
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:06,109
He's too fat!

81
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,206
- Johnnie.
- Let me get on the train.

82
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:38,787
This is the way to travel!

83
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,467
My brother! My brother is here!

84
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:48,560
He's a sailor now.

85
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,649
Lalla!

86
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,493
When we knew we were seeing you off,

87
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:02,891
we went on a great shopping trip.

88
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:06,169
We've got our marching orders too.

89
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:10,792
We're moving to a new home, not far away.

90
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:15,906
- I wish I was staying with you.
- It's a big adventure for us.

91
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:19,039
A trip to the railway station

92
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:22,585
and then to actually sit on a train!

93
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:24,984
It's the highlight of the year.

94
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,392
Except we're not going anywhere.

95
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:34,344
It's already gone on longer than they said.

96
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,363
Johnnie. Johnnie!

97
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:44,743
Come away from there. Come away at once!

98
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,809
We haven't travelled
all that way to look at that!

99
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,351
Talk to your brother.

100
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,234
Talk to your brother.

101
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:57,724
Don't stay long at your new school.
Say you've had enough.

102
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:01,488
I'll get away as soon as I'm able.

103
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,974
Please shine a little bit first, Georgie.

104
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:10,422
I'll dazzle them, but in a way
that shows I don't fit in.

105
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,866
Georgie, you'll behave yourself.

106
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:18,771
It will be tremendous. It will be exciting.

107
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,666
Come on.

108
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,103
Johnnie, there's a present for you at home.

109
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,133
It was too big for me to carry.

110
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:40,380
What on earth is...

111
00:11:56,111 --> 00:12:00,630
- A music machine!
- Oh, dear!

112
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,284
Why are we moving, Mr Hansell?

113
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:15,975
So Lalla can look after you better.

114
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,212
And nobody need see us.

115
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:23,456
We'll be shut away
in purdah from everything.

116
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:32,328
- What's the matter with you?
- We had to do it in a rush.

117
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:35,694
You have had days to do this!

118
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,168
I've no patience with their complaining.

119
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:41,575
I insisted on taking a full household with Johnnie.

120
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,740
Look at you!

121
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:49,479
You have all become so idle
with your moaning and your grumbling.

122
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:52,254
Perhaps we should start from scratch.

123
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,104
So, this is it.

124
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:48,514
It's smaller than I expected.

125
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:15,972
There's certainly a lot to do here.

126
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,661
What a place to end up in!

127
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:38,478
Remember, at the double!

128
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:42,372
At the double! At the double!

129
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,539
Aghh!

130
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:37,172
Today will be marvellous,
for we are doing the Armada.

131
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:40,269
What more could we want?

132
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,880
We will be on the deck of those ships.

133
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:46,047
We will be on those cliffs too.

134
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:52,583
We'll be as close to Sir Francis Drake
as one of his bowls.

135
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:58,364
We will be Queen Elizabeth
as she knights Sir Francis.

136
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,359
We will feel the fire
and excitement of those times.

137
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:06,017
They will impress themselves
so deeply on all of us

138
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:12,695
that we will find inspiration
for what we have to do now.

139
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,990
Why are you dressed like that?

140
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,641
Isn't it obvious?

141
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:39,516
- Aren't you too old?
- Absolutely not.

142
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,466
Anyway...

143
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,031
- I think my precise age
is rather hard to guess.

144
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:06,278
Come on, Johnnie.

145
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:09,644
Come on, help me. Help me.

146
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:15,703
You have to drink now. Drink. Drink!

147
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:22,238
It's horrible, but they said
to give you this if one came on.

148
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:27,773
That's it. It's mustard water.
That's why it's yellow.

149
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,437
Oh, no.

150
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:47,018
That's it. I'm never using that again. Never.

151
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,626
Never, never.

152
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:55,327
That's a terrible, terrible treatment.

153
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,383
I shall never use that again.

154
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:06,049
I'm sorry, leaving you
with the boy at such a time.

155
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,823
Don't say anything.

156
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,042
- Well...
- No! Don't bother to explain.

157
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:19,684
You've never wanted to go
to the war before. But there we are.

158
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,604
I will manage.

159
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:25,420
I assure you, I will manage.

160
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:30,013
And when you come to visit us, goodness...

161
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:38,650
- you will not believe what progress
we will have achieved.

162
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,958
See you soon.

163
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,987
Au revoir!

164
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes, a little better.

165
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:51,467
Very good.

166
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:55,257
Really good.

167
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,628
Very good.

168
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:05,706
Stop! Johnnie...

169
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:10,719
Look, it's your mother!

170
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,321
- What are they doing?
- Wait here.

171
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:31,628
Your Majesty.

172
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:42,628
We were passing, ma'am.
What a surprise to see you.

173
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:48,439
Indeed. I didn't know
you came this far on your walks.

174
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:55,639
We're collecting food.
Food for munitions workers.

175
00:21:55,816 --> 00:22:00,229
Chestnuts. Something
additional for them to eat.

176
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:06,594
I'm also collecting metal.
Spare metal objects, scrap metal.

177
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:10,416
It's useful for the war effort, anything metal.

178
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:16,095
If you have any at the farmhouse,
collect it together.

179
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:19,393
Yes, ma'am, I will do that.

180
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:24,821
Johnnie is here, ma'am. I could
have him brought down for you.

181
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:29,419
Just for a moment.
It's a while since he saw you.

182
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,719
He's made such progress.

183
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:40,166
I will see you tomorrow.

184
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:45,320
We will be there tomorrow
at three o'clock exactly.

185
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:01,075
She's never late.

186
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:08,210
There she is!

187
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:11,618
How could we ever have doubted?

188
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,484
Your Majesty.

189
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,795
I'm glad there's a little sun for you, ma'am.

190
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,772
As you see, it's quite light and pleasant.

191
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:42,518
- Why is ivy growing there?
- Sorry?

192
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,862
I don't understand.

193
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:54,211
You shouldn't let ivy grow.
It's chaotic. Makes things untidy.

194
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,271
Thank you.

195
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,889
That's a reasonable amount.

196
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,795
Well done.

197
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:18,519
You have grown, Johnnie. I had no idea.

198
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:22,033
You have grown so quickly.

199
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:28,828
I thought you would like to see
what Johnnie's been doing.

200
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:33,002
That's why I put his maps and drawings up.

201
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:43,436
Is that really how you see your cousin Nicholas?

202
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:50,116
We must make sure no Russian ever sees that.

203
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:55,613
And your father wearing a giant crown.

204
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:02,191
So much bigger than his head. How very odd.

205
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,530
Johnnie?

206
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:14,610
I have been trying to teach him a little.

207
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,774
Johnnie?

208
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:31,972
I visited two factories today.
I don't mind the noise and heat.

209
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:35,342
I would do five in a day if I could.

210
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:40,602
It is extraordinary how few people
are good at organisation

211
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,362
at a time when we need it most, above all.

212
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:46,304
Johnnie...

213
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:57,165
Why have you not included that
with the metal?

214
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:03,104
That is Johnnie's gramophone.
His brother gave it to him.

215
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,667
Everybody is making sacrifices.
He will not miss it.

216
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:10,694
We will add it to the other things.

217
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:13,828
Johnnie, ask your mother.

218
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:21,197
Ask her not to take it.

219
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,397
Go on!

220
00:26:28,235 --> 00:26:31,260
Johnnie, please ask her.

221
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:35,990
Ma'am... Ma'am!

222
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:40,794
I implore you not to take
Johnnie's gramophone.

223
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:46,212
It will, with respect, make no difference
to the war at all.

224
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:51,604
But for Johnnie it is of such importance.

225
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:54,779
Please listen, ma'am.

226
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:57,766
He gets such Joy from it.

227
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:12,000
Of course, Lalla, if it means
that much to the child.

228
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,891
You may have it, Johnnie.

229
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,272
I shouldn't have taken it.

230
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,063
Clearly, I shouldn't have.

231
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:56,387
God willing, when next we meet,

232
00:27:56,572 --> 00:28:00,569
there will have been
some real military results

233
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:03,736
for us to cheer.

234
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:06,652
Johnnie, wave to your mother.

235
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,638
Wave!

236
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:32,917
At the double, gentlemen!

237
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:45,792
You can open the blinds now.

238
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:54,662
Where are we? I thought
we were at the big house.

239
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:58,181
We are at the big house, Johnnie.

240
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:38,853
Come in, my little one.

241
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:41,950
Oh, here you are.

242
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:45,189
Come and kiss your grandmama.

243
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,999
It's so long since I've seen the tiny one.

244
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:55,790
Your Majesty, he is so pleased to be here.

245
00:29:57,473 --> 00:30:00,284
It's very dark.

246
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:04,628
Yes, it is. I keep the curtains drawn.

247
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,483
I hate what they have done to the garden.

248
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:21,472
Your Majesty, he's Just done these.

249
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:26,413
They are for you.

250
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:30,627
- The family.
- Charming.

251
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,750
Delightful.

252
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:37,647
And a good likeness, after a fashion.

253
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:44,440
There they are, the real pictures of them.

254
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:50,419
I remember when they did that photograph.

255
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,411
It took ages to get it right.

256
00:30:56,618 --> 00:31:00,023
My sister brought him up so very well.

257
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,449
Nicholas's behaviour
has always been excellent.

258
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:10,077
It's a pity Vicky didn't
do the same with Wilhelm.

259
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:15,811
But if only, don't you think, my tiny one?

260
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,580
If only we could get the family together.

261
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:25,769
Get your papa, Cousin Wilhelm and Nicholas

262
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:29,067
all together in a room.

263
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:36,101
We could have it all sorted out.
There'd be no need for fighting.

264
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:40,693
That would be very good.
We should do it soon.

265
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:47,057
Now, we must get a ball.

266
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:51,238
All boys must kick a ball, mustn't they?

267
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:55,650
- I will ring.
- Ma'am, I will go

268
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:59,309
because time is so short, I know.

269
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:11,131
Oh, my dear.

270
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:14,162
What times these are.

271
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:19,907
But we have a plan, don't we?

272
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:24,770
Now you can open the curtain.

273
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:30,796
Open that one, Johnnie.
That will do no harm.

274
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:35,903
Pull it all the way back, my little one.

275
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:40,014
Your father is having a shooting party.

276
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:43,835
He hasn't had one for so long.

277
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,081
Some guests have already arrived.

278
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:12,194
Please bring some news.

279
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,411
Bring some news.
Please bring some news.

280
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:36,029
Oh, God, bring some news.
Please bring some news.

281
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,710
Bring some news.

282
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,962
Johnnie!

283
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:47,095
Oh, it's you.

284
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:50,324
Hello, stranger.

285
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:56,379
Forgive me. You've caught me
talking to myself.

286
00:33:57,153 --> 00:33:59,264
Johnnie!

287
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:04,032
I talk to myself quite a lot.

288
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:08,623
It's not bad is it, talking to yourself?

289
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:10,920
Johnnie!

290
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:16,311
One doesn't do it, no,
if one can possibly help it.

291
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,043
I'm Just waiting for some news.

292
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:26,128
Some very important news about somebody.

293
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:30,376
It must come. It surely must come.

294
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,180
It will come, I'm sure.

295
00:34:36,363 --> 00:34:38,130
Johnnie...

296
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:44,119
There you are.
This is no time to go wandering.

297
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:47,320
- I'm taking you home.
- No.

298
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:50,485
Absolutely at once.

299
00:34:57,482 --> 00:34:59,284
Johnnie.

300
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:10,177
Ah.

301
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:16,262
- My other tiny little one.
- Mama. What a Journey!

302
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:22,635
I couldn't get away from London.
So many cables from the front.

303
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,728
I'm going there myself very soon.

304
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:29,417
My God,
we'd better make some headway.

305
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:36,131
These are Johnnie's things.
He was here half an hour ago.

306
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:39,191
Johnnie was here?

307
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:44,265
Poor little fellow.

308
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,332
Not able to do much.

309
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,682
Ah, you're looking at that.

310
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:57,735
Does look like me, doesn't he, in that picture?

311
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,191
The funny thing is, Just this week

312
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:06,365
I've made Nicky a field marshal
of the British army.

313
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:11,785
I've given him that rank to encourage both of us.

314
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,814
My brother William left for France last week.

315
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,835
He should be at the front by now.

316
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:51,560
It can't be any worse than being here.

317
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:56,079
The Spanish Inquisition. The ultimate tyranny.

318
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,681
The rack stretching
everybody that opposed them.

319
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,008
Who does that remind you of?

320
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:05,722
Does it not remind you

321
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:09,895
of the foe we are confronted with today?

322
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:14,141
Of the extraordinary barbarity
the Germans have been reduced to

323
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,128
in order to bolster their losing position?

324
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:20,784
The mutilation of Belgian women we know about.

325
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:25,826
The cutting off of the hands
of Belgian babies for trophies,

326
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:29,897
sometimes nailed to the barrack room walls.

327
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:34,941
And now, when we thought
things could not get worse,

328
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,961
we hear about the Germans

329
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,897
inoculating French prisoners with tuberculosis.

330
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,279
Deliberately contaminating those gallant men

331
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,833
with this deadly disease.

332
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:55,256
Ah, we're hearing from the back
for the first time in months.

333
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,358
Can I ask, sir, how you know about this?

334
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:03,365
I am surprised that you
above all need to ask that.

335
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:06,952
The authorities have found this out.

336
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,392
It is now published in the newspapers

337
00:38:10,576 --> 00:38:14,988
for the nation to read...
Ah, there's more, is there?

338
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,809
These stories have been verified
by witnesses?

339
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:21,841
Famous personages have verified them.

340
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:24,275
That is why they are published.

341
00:38:24,457 --> 00:38:28,206
That is why there is such a strength of feeling

342
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:34,581
taking hold against the Germans
and all manner of German things.

343
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:37,293
Run!

344
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:41,147
If you don't run,
you will not reach anywhere.

345
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:50,889
I have to get out of here.

346
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,160
- Your Majesty.
- We commend you.

347
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,771
Your Majesty.

348
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:39,387
There's a misunderstanding
with the driver. He isn't here.

349
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:43,701
I think he's doing something with the motor car.

350
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:48,335
We will wait here, then. He will not be long.

351
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,576
Germans are keen on keeping time, aren't they,
Your Majesty?

352
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:15,855
I believe that is said to be the case.

353
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:21,764
Being German yourself, I expect
you knew that very well indeed.

354
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:26,919
Love to keep all sorts of clocks, I'm sure,
Your Majesty.

355
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:32,518
Being German, can you tell us
why we're still fighting a war?

356
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,960
Can you tell us that, Your Majesty?

357
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:41,636
- Why are we still fighting?
- Forgive us. He is not well.

358
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,268
I am English, from tip to toe, from toe to tip.

359
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,705
I am English, from tip to toe, from toe to tip.

360
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:07,065
I am English, from tip to toe.

361
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:22,624
Georgie!

362
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,176
I didn't hear you come in.
You gave me such a start.

363
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:32,599
Forgive me, Mama. I have
a few days' break from college.

364
00:41:32,785 --> 00:41:37,897
Yes, I remember. I was Just somewhere else

365
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:41,371
for a very brief moment.

366
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:52,083
I noticed these lovely things
which weren't here before.

367
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:59,254
Yes. I've worked hard to
recover them for the collection.

368
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:03,813
They had been given away
to all sorts of people.

369
00:42:03,993 --> 00:42:07,219
This is Derby, isn't it? About 1830.

370
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:12,123
Very good, Georgie. Its date is 1823.

371
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:15,508
It's very beautiful.

372
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:21,485
- You've labelled everything.
- Yes.

373
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,849
Of course, your father was not brought up

374
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:27,224
to find solace in such things.

375
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:33,042
He doesn't find everything
modern hideous, like I do.

376
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:37,287
So I have to appreciate this all on my own.

377
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,169
Sir.

378
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:50,884
For some reason, they've turned the heating off.

379
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:54,364
The king thinks it will help win the war.

380
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:57,356
It sums up his knowledge of naval warfare!

381
00:42:57,537 --> 00:43:01,120
I've never been so freezing indoors!

382
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:06,160
And only water to drink.

383
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:14,162
Ah! Naval life is obviously
suiting you, young man.

384
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:19,241
You'll have a ship of your own
before the year is out.

385
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:27,341
My teeth have never chattered like this.

386
00:43:27,528 --> 00:43:30,932
I'd have given anything not to come today.

387
00:43:33,095 --> 00:43:35,312
You look well, young man.

388
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:38,970
You'll be a rear admiral
by Christmas, no doubt.

389
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:47,249
Young man, you look remarkably well.

390
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:51,806
Running circles round them at naval college?

391
00:43:51,986 --> 00:43:56,221
I'm much impressed by what I see here too.

392
00:43:56,404 --> 00:44:00,603
A leaking ceiling, but it has not been mended.

393
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:05,414
Every penny has been spent where it matters.

394
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:14,139
Young man,

395
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:17,063
your father setting an example

396
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:21,587
by switching off the heating isn't popular.

397
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:24,235
No, they hate it.

398
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:27,851
Don't ask me how I am, please.

399
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,622
I will do no such thing
and you will return the compliment.

400
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:37,245
- You won't ask me either.
- No, I will not, sir.

401
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:42,076
Is it true? The stories about the Germans?

402
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:45,938
The French prisoners being given tuberculosis.

403
00:44:46,122 --> 00:44:50,428
The Belgian babies. The corpse factories.

404
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:55,853
The Germans distilling glycerine
from the corpses. Is it true?

405
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:59,063
You're the only one who will tell me.

406
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,273
Let us Just say...

407
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:08,448
- some of it is true.

408
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:12,067
We will know more at the end of the war.

409
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,371
Just so long as we win it, of course!

410
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:19,938
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

411
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:22,545
Your Majesty.

412
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,435
I have some news for you, young man.

413
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,270
Your cousin, the Tsar, has Just abdicated.

414
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:37,126
The Emperor? He's abdicated?
What will happen to them?

415
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:41,085
We've agreed they can live in England.

416
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:55,312
Two courses.
We only serve two courses.

417
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:58,794
And no alcohol, as you can see.

418
00:45:58,976 --> 00:46:05,928
The fish is an attempt at
my favourite dish, Bombay duck.

419
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:12,011
We can't get the ingredients,
so they've used kippers.

420
00:46:12,196 --> 00:46:16,680
It's pretty disgusting, I think you'll agree.

421
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:22,622
It's refreshing to have
small portions. So appropriate!

422
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:32,931
I heard the most stupid remark
I've ever heard last week.

423
00:46:33,107 --> 00:46:36,511
The most stupid remark?

424
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,572
That is quite a claim.

425
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:43,709
What was it and where did you hear it?

426
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:48,443
Well, I forget exactly where,

427
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:51,849
but I heard the most foolish comment.

428
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:54,606
That there are rumours going round,

429
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:57,035
amongst the people and so forth,

430
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,435
that the royal family must be pro... German

431
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:02,156
because you have a German name!

432
00:47:02,332 --> 00:47:06,222
What's that? What are you talking about?

433
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:09,629
There are rumours circulating

434
00:47:09,812 --> 00:47:13,323
that we are supporting the Germans

435
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:16,690
because we have a German name.

436
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:20,457
It's so ridiculous, isn't it?

437
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:23,752
What do they want, for heaven's sake?

438
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:26,712
For us to change our name?

439
00:47:26,895 --> 00:47:28,318
Hm?

440
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:34,507
You're not saying much. What do you think?

441
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:38,437
Do you want us to change our name?

442
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:43,416
If the situation remains the same,

443
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:49,538
it may Just be a possibility
that needs to be considered.

444
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:53,711
In everybody's interests.

445
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:27,985
Never!

446
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:31,711
Never!

447
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,728
Never!

448
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:41,932
Aghh!

449
00:48:56,448 --> 00:49:01,691
We've been having so many more
of these now, Johnnie.

450
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:04,308
That's it.

451
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:12,000
In between, you do so much.

452
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:16,207
You have grown so much.

453
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:25,700
Do you think anybody at all remembers us?

454
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:29,038
- Remembers we're here?
- Of course.

455
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:34,431
The war could end and they'd forget to tell us!

456
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:38,719
You know, I often look at you, Lalla,

457
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:41,848
and I think, "She's still quite young.

458
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:44,244
"She shouldn't give up on a husband.

459
00:49:44,426 --> 00:49:46,822
"Is this how she'll spend her life?"

460
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,191
All the service you've given them!

461
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:53,981
Children, that family.

462
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:57,323
You never will understand, Fred.

463
00:49:58,343 --> 00:49:59,837
I am glad to be here.

464
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:03,073
It's important what we're doing with Johnnie.

465
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:07,554
And at some stage, they will have time for us,

466
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:10,334
to see Johnnie's progress.

467
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,239
You've spoken to that man
from the college of arms?

468
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:18,415
Mr Farnham... Burgh. Yes.

469
00:50:18,591 --> 00:50:21,616
It's been suggested
that since your family's name,

470
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:23,666
Saxe... Coburg... Gotha,

471
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:28,044
belongs to the house of Wettin,
some name derived from that,

472
00:50:28,229 --> 00:50:34,137
like Wippo, Winter or Wetmoor,
would be appropriate.

473
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,244
- We'll be a laughing stock.
- I need a moment, Papa.

474
00:50:38,423 --> 00:50:42,278
- I said in half an hour.
- That was two hours ago, Papa.

475
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:47,015
I have absolutely no time! No time at the moment!

476
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:51,117
Every single moment is taken up all day.

477
00:50:51,296 --> 00:50:53,443
Every minute.

478
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:57,861
Time is running away and nobody will do anything!

479
00:50:58,045 --> 00:51:02,316
I'll talk fast. My real abilities, whatever they are,

480
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:07,327
are not best shown off at naval college.
I love music and art.

481
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:10,913
This is rubbish! You will be a sailor!

482
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:16,098
That's all there is to it. You will be in the navy.

483
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:19,396
You will spend your life in the navy

484
00:51:19,582 --> 00:51:23,401
and there's a good chance
you will die in the navy!

485
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:27,260
I don't want the matter ever raised again!

486
00:51:39,134 --> 00:51:42,254
It was a disaster, Mama.

487
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,295
We are in the middle of such a crisis, Georgie.

488
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:49,737
We are facing such change.

489
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:55,999
Our family name, even. It never occurred to me

490
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:59,208
we would have to change our name.

491
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:02,681
All the family tradition...

492
00:52:02,862 --> 00:52:05,923
I cannot bear
to see that being tampered with.

493
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:10,542
It offends me so much.

494
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:18,301
And the Kaiser is being removed
from his honorary position

495
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:19,978
as head of some British regiments.

496
00:52:20,153 --> 00:52:23,178
That's right. We're fighting him.

497
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:27,554
You don't understand. What about afterwards?

498
00:52:27,738 --> 00:52:33,053
I cannot help thinking about
what will happen afterwards.

499
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:39,843
If the pieces on which it was
built are removed, then what?

500
00:52:41,934 --> 00:52:46,205
The houses of Europe were Joined.

501
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,444
- I have a suggestion.
- Which is?

502
00:52:53,623 --> 00:52:58,036
- Edward III...
- We're going back that far?

503
00:52:58,215 --> 00:53:01,821
My family has nothing in common with him!

504
00:53:02,008 --> 00:53:06,041
Edward III was often known
as Edward of Windsor.

505
00:53:06,218 --> 00:53:09,314
It has never been used as a dukedom.

506
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:14,838
So I suggest the name change
would be the House of Windsor.

507
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:20,856
I don't like it. Something bad
may happen if we do this.

508
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,703
Lalla! Johnnie!

509
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:57,458
- Johnnie!
- He has come back! To see me!

510
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,419
Georgie!

511
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,356
Your Royal Highness.

512
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,279
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

513
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:16,839
- Your Highness.
- Impressive. What a household!

514
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:19,308
This is my estate.

515
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:23,072
We have 15 geese, four horses,

516
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:27,897
13 ducks and some chickens, but I don't like them.

517
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:31,273
You look magnificent in your uniform.

518
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:34,791
Don't say anything, but I've escaped.

519
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:40,706
Now, I have news for everybody.

520
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:45,192
Papa has rechristened the family
the House of Windsor.

521
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,309
The family has changed its name?

522
00:54:51,463 --> 00:54:54,417
I can't believe that, Georgie.

523
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:57,405
Windsor? I think it's quite good.

524
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:03,492
I've got to get this horrible uniform off.

525
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:08,959
- What do you mean, escaped?
- It's all under control.

526
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:13,787
Things are happening so fast
in London. Amazing things.

527
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:16,962
The Tsar... Remember him, Johnnie?

528
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:22,310
The emperor fish with his absurd
swimming has given up his throne

529
00:55:22,497 --> 00:55:26,387
- and will live in this country.
- Where will they live?

530
00:55:26,568 --> 00:55:29,829
The emperor! I will see them, won't I?

531
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:35,256
Of course you'll see them, Johnnie.

532
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:40,442
Mama says I can stay a couple of nights.

533
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,740
Come on, Johnnie!

534
00:56:10,962 --> 00:56:18,092
We agreed the Tsar and his family
could come to Britain?

535
00:56:18,268 --> 00:56:21,388
To live here in exile.

536
00:56:22,618 --> 00:56:25,951
Yes, the invitation
has been sent and accepted.

537
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,322
Many people disapprove of the idea.

538
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:34,618
There are certain articles in various publications.

539
00:56:34,794 --> 00:56:41,924
A rally at the Albert Hall
celebrating the Tsar's fall.

540
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:49,051
It's becoming clear that because
the Romanovs are my family,

541
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:53,052
it's putting me in a very unfair position.

542
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:56,780
Unfair in the sense you are obliged?

543
00:56:56,956 --> 00:57:01,998
Yes, because of our ties.
It may not be the correct course.

544
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:05,852
With things so uncertain...

545
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:11,598
- do you think it's possible
to withdraw the invitation?

546
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:17,757
The government might feel
it would be difficult to do.

547
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:21,092
You must go and see the prime minister.

548
00:57:24,964 --> 00:57:30,041
They will come here from Russia,
the whole family?

549
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:34,286
- To my farm?
- To stay? Here?

550
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:37,761
That's a thought!

551
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:41,872
That would be something to see!

552
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:50,075
That's a wonderful thought,

553
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:53,803
you having the Russian imperial family here.

554
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:29,527
His Majesty also wonders where
they'd stay, how they'd live.

555
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:33,389
I'm sure His Majesty
could make one of his houses

556
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:35,649
available to the Tsar.

557
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:37,257
Hm?

558
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:39,688
None are available except Balmoral,

559
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:43,239
which is hardly appropriate at this time of year.

560
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:49,291
I think the Russian royal family
will think it quite appropriate

561
00:58:49,473 --> 00:58:52,498
compared to some other destinations.

562
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:54,583
His Majesty feels that

563
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:59,661
since the arrival of the Tsar here
will be unpopular,

564
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,307
it puts him in an invidious position

565
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:05,023
because they are his family.

566
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:07,630
The king has always had warm feelings

567
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:10,405
towards his cousin the Tsar.

568
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:16,879
But he feels it would not
be wise for them to settle here.

569
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:22,935
It is being discussed, as you
must know, not Just in the clubs

570
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:27,803
but by working men and Labour
members of the House of Commons.

571
00:59:27,987 --> 00:59:31,142
- I'm not concerned about them.
- His Majesty also feels

572
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:34,103
that the message sent to the Russian premier

573
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:39,396
that "The revolution was
the greatest Russian service

574
00:59:39,573 --> 00:59:44,365
"to the cause we're all
fighting for" a little strong.

575
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:47,573
"A little strong"?

576
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:53,419
We need to be encouraging
to the new Russian government.

577
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:57,034
If the Bolsheviks take control,
they will pull out of the war.

578
00:59:57,212 --> 01:00:01,139
Then the Tsar will face
a more interesting situation.

579
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:07,261
His Majesty wishes me to convey
the urgency of the situation

580
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:10,561
and the strength of his feelings.

581
01:00:10,747 --> 01:00:16,476
I will let His Majesty know,
having consulted colleagues,

582
01:00:16,661 --> 01:00:19,163
whether the government considers it possible

583
01:00:19,339 --> 01:00:22,495
to withdraw the invitation.

584
01:00:24,976 --> 01:00:27,752
And that one, behind.

585
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:32,168
Fat Mary, we used to call her,
your grandmother.

586
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:38,468
Johnnie's caught her likeness,
though he never knew her.

587
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:43,163
She was a great galleon,
coming down a passage.

588
01:00:43,346 --> 01:00:45,042
She squashed everything.

589
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:49,388
Nothing was safe, especially not the crockery!

590
01:00:49,574 --> 01:00:52,207
All these pictures Johnnie has done.

591
01:00:52,392 --> 01:00:54,718
But this place is also full of you, Lalla.

592
01:00:54,897 --> 01:01:01,741
What ridiculous talk, Georgie!
What is there of me here?

593
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:06,028
This is Johnnie's place.

594
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:10,996
And one day, he'll do a recital for your parents

595
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:15,248
- to show how far he's come.
- They'll never have time.

596
01:01:15,424 --> 01:01:19,101
- I'm sure they will.
- They won't.

597
01:01:19,286 --> 01:01:23,070
- You've no idea.
- When they're next here,

598
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:26,099
- they'll make the time.
- Listen to me!

599
01:01:26,279 --> 01:01:30,965
They'll never see him!
They have no time for anything!

600
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,166
They don't know what they're doing.

601
01:01:33,342 --> 01:01:37,126
Not my parents, none of them!

602
01:01:37,308 --> 01:01:40,463
They don't know why they're still fighting.

603
01:01:40,648 --> 01:01:44,467
- Don't talk about them so.
- Why not? It's true.

604
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:47,947
Don't lie to Johnnie
about them having time for him.

605
01:01:48,128 --> 01:01:53,028
Why is he here, in this place?
So nobody can see him!

606
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,284
Nobody wants to see you again!

607
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:59,324
You're not too old for a thrashing.

608
01:01:59,505 --> 01:02:01,522
You spent your life bringing us up

609
01:02:01,697 --> 01:02:04,722
but never got anywhere with any of us!

610
01:02:04,898 --> 01:02:09,097
- Just look at me!
- I will thrash you, young man!

611
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:14,429
You try! You spent your whole life with us.
Your whole life!

612
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,724
- Just you try!
- Georgie!

613
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:20,092
Georgie!

614
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,127
I'm going mad at the naval college.

615
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:30,909
I can't bear how stupid they think we are.

616
01:02:32,383 --> 01:02:35,337
It's them that are the idiots!

617
01:02:35,514 --> 01:02:38,705
Why can't Georgie stay with me?

618
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,949
I don't think the prime minister
will give us any news tonight.

619
01:02:50,127 --> 01:02:55,583
Send him another note and ensure
a delay in the invitation.

620
01:03:10,272 --> 01:03:12,739
Tell me.

621
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:17,115
I want to hear the absolute truth, however bad.

622
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:23,172
The news is not good at all.
You must prepare yourself.

623
01:03:23,354 --> 01:03:30,127
It's possible the Germans
will break through in 24 hours.

624
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:36,705
And that could lead to everything being lost.

625
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:43,072
Today's news will be extremely vital.

626
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:47,174
You must go to the country as we planned.

627
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,515
I will wire as soon as I hear.

628
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,942
I will stay here.

629
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,418
Surely that would be best?

630
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,980
- I should be here with you.
- No.

631
01:04:07,156 --> 01:04:10,833
Please, you must proceed as planned.

632
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:15,086
We must carry on as normal as much as possible.

633
01:04:15,263 --> 01:04:20,933
Otherwise, waiting for the news...
Find it very difficult.

634
01:04:22,116 --> 01:04:26,635
The wire will be waiting for you
when you get there.

635
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,274
I know I don't often say this.

636
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:36,613
I find certain things so difficult to say out loud.

637
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:41,872
But you mean so much to me.

638
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,327
Why are they stopping us?

639
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,305
Who are those people?

640
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:27,872
Your Majesty!

641
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:34,159
Your Majesty, we saw it was you.

642
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:38,341
Johnnie said, "There is Mama coming." It was.

643
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:41,888
Yes, that is a coincidence.

644
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:45,188
But I am in the most fearful rush.

645
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:48,671
There is important news from London.

646
01:05:48,852 --> 01:05:52,850
Johnnie will Just show you something.

647
01:05:53,027 --> 01:05:55,981
He has collected food and flowers.

648
01:05:56,158 --> 01:05:59,420
We saw you doing it that day.

649
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:08,158
- We have to reach York Cottage.
- He'll bring them to you now.

650
01:06:19,573 --> 01:06:24,473
I'm not ready yet, Mama. Don't look yet.

651
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,308
We're preparing something for you.

652
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:32,513
For you to hear.

653
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:37,173
Johnnie will give you a recital
when you have a moment.

654
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:42,179
Yes, we will arrange a date for that later.

655
01:06:43,892 --> 01:06:50,322
Johnnie, I cannot wait a moment longer.
This is taking too long.

656
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,505
I do not have the time! I have to go. I must go.

657
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,755
It is news from the front.

658
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:00,600
The Germans have not
broken through our lines today.

659
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:04,495
The situation is still critically poised.

660
01:08:14,907 --> 01:08:18,383
That is such a fine thing.

661
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,787
Come in, by all means.

662
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:27,258
My apologies for disturbing you so late.

663
01:08:27,432 --> 01:08:32,083
No, Just burying my head in my stamps.

664
01:08:32,268 --> 01:08:35,708
Especially calming before this big war council.

665
01:08:35,887 --> 01:08:39,706
It's much better here in the country. Small rooms.

666
01:08:40,062 --> 01:08:42,529
Always pleased to be in small rooms.

667
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:46,596
What an absurd idea palaces are!

668
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:51,189
- I have some news from Russia.
- Oh, yes?

669
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,994
I keep thinking about them.

670
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:57,247
What's happening to them is on my mind.

671
01:08:57,423 --> 01:09:00,649
All of them shut away in that remote farmhouse.

672
01:09:00,832 --> 01:09:02,256
It is a farmhouse?

673
01:09:02,433 --> 01:09:06,846
Yes, kind of. It is on the edge of a town.

674
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:37,012
Can't help wondering how Alex is coping,

675
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:40,214
shut up in a farmhouse of all places.

676
01:09:40,391 --> 01:09:43,546
For her that would be so difficult.

677
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:53,289
Sir, something has happened to the family.

678
01:09:53,472 --> 01:09:57,363
They were awoken in the night by their guards.

679
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:03,413
They were probably told they had
to be moved for their safety.

680
01:10:09,651 --> 01:10:12,842
Somewhere in the farmhouse...

681
01:10:24,264 --> 01:10:28,914
Somewhere in the farmhouse
they were grouped together...

682
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,219
and they were all shot.

683
01:10:50,844 --> 01:10:53,834
Not all of them?

684
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,857
- All of them were shot?
- Yes.

685
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,542
All of them.

686
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:43,281
Did we have a choice?

687
01:12:46,665 --> 01:12:51,316
Do you think we had a choice
about letting them in?

688
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:53,648
We didn't know how it would develop.

689
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:56,822
Did we have a choice?

690
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:01,684
For the stability of the country,
I don't think we did.

691
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:07,113
We must remember it was
the government's decision.

692
01:13:09,906 --> 01:13:13,761
Maybe that's what the public will be told.

693
01:13:13,942 --> 01:13:17,726
But we know. Hm?

694
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:23,987
Would you please tell Her Majesty?

695
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:54,087
- That is too horrible.
- Yes, ma'am.

696
01:13:56,597 --> 01:13:59,372
The children too.

697
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:05,363
What unimaginable cruelty.

698
01:14:06,826 --> 01:14:09,458
- If there's something...
- Thank you.

699
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,000
You will Just leave me.

700
01:14:33,755 --> 01:14:39,449
I think, Just for a moment, I will go in alone.

701
01:14:44,923 --> 01:14:48,185
What do I pray?

702
01:14:48,367 --> 01:14:51,593
I have nothing to say to the Lord.

703
01:15:53,184 --> 01:15:55,093
Ma'am.

704
01:15:57,324 --> 01:16:00,171
It is tomorrow.

705
01:16:01,499 --> 01:16:04,524
I can't have got the days muddled.

706
01:16:17,538 --> 01:16:23,411
We walked all the way on foot,
which is considered a good idea.

707
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:27,652
Her Majesty is expecting us.

708
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:40,561
- Your Majesty.
- Lalla, there's some confusion.

709
01:16:40,744 --> 01:16:46,059
Today is the day of the war council.
It is most unfortunate.

710
01:16:48,747 --> 01:16:53,859
But it may be possible
to do Just a very few minutes

711
01:16:54,034 --> 01:16:56,810
for myself, Johnnie's grandmother

712
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,759
and the other children,

713
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:04,053
because they have not seen him
for a long time.

714
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:13,125
Do not stray out of the back corridors
while you are here.

715
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:17,935
There will be a great many
visitors here today, so...

716
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,920
Yes. Yes, of course, ma'am.
We will be very careful.

717
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:36,927
- Johnnie is here.
- Johnnie is here?

718
01:17:37,106 --> 01:17:39,573
Now, Johnnie.

719
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:46,180
What are you going to do
when you stand before them?

720
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:48,722
Hm?

721
01:17:49,527 --> 01:17:53,168
You're going to try to stay still.

722
01:18:04,348 --> 01:18:05,842
Johnnie.

723
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:10,707
We are here for the shortest of moments.

724
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:14,364
I have the business of war to conduct.

725
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:21,741
Good day, my fine fellows. I will start...

726
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:26,712
I will start... I forget.

727
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:30,049
"I will start with some lines
from Alfred Lord Tennyson."

728
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:35,513
I will start with some lines
from Old Lord Alfred.

729
01:18:35,696 --> 01:18:38,270
To me, methought,
who waited with the crowd,

730
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,805
there came a bark...

731
01:18:51,804 --> 01:18:55,552
They're here already. Infernally early.

732
01:18:55,736 --> 01:19:00,078
They must think we still
keep the clock fast. Idiots!

733
01:19:00,259 --> 01:19:04,292
They can't even tell the time. We must stop!

734
01:19:04,469 --> 01:19:09,546
Lalla, take Johnnie through the back corridors
to the kitchen,

735
01:19:09,722 --> 01:19:15,072
- where they will find...
- No! Certainly not!

736
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:18,374
I have not finished!

737
01:19:18,559 --> 01:19:23,707
Everybody must wait. Nobody can leave early.

738
01:21:48,894 --> 01:21:52,050
Why is everybody so sad?

739
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:55,188
Everybody looks so old.

740
01:21:56,201 --> 01:22:00,056
You've been fighting at the war too much.

741
01:22:00,236 --> 01:22:06,974
What are you so sad about?
You're still here, funny things!

742
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:35,019
Who is that boy we're waiting for?

743
01:22:46,265 --> 01:22:49,219
Johnnie got to give his recital.

744
01:22:58,303 --> 01:23:01,328
And now, for the next part.

745
01:23:04,462 --> 01:23:06,858
I will kick a football.

746
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:22,304
That's the way, Johnnie! Give them a blast!

747
01:23:38,662 --> 01:23:43,834
My dearest brother. I've been
inspired by your recital.

748
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,752
I'll follow my artistic temperament.

749
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:47,321
Good!

750
01:23:47,499 --> 01:23:50,311
If Johnnie can do it, I can do it.

751
01:24:00,477 --> 01:24:05,198
Now the war has finished,
will anyone come to stay with me?

752
01:24:05,382 --> 01:24:09,023
Not the Russians, clearly.

753
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,056
Because they're dead.

754
01:24:12,236 --> 01:24:15,355
There are others that can come.

755
01:24:21,038 --> 01:24:25,273
The Kaiser and the Austrian emperor are in exile.

756
01:24:25,457 --> 01:24:28,719
They could stay with you, Johnnie.

757
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:39,154
See if you can catch me.

758
01:25:00,388 --> 01:25:02,084
Johnnie?

759
01:25:12,286 --> 01:25:14,504
Lalla!

760
01:25:17,401 --> 01:25:19,689
Lalla!

761
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:31,066
My darling boy.

762
01:25:33,265 --> 01:25:36,492
My darling clever boy.

763
01:25:51,427 --> 01:25:54,547
I have telephoned your mother.

764
01:25:56,124 --> 01:26:01,652
It is possible the Journey
from London may take too long.

765
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,632
He has gone, hasn't he?

766
01:26:57,079 --> 01:27:02,643
My eldest sons came back safely from the war.

767
01:27:03,133 --> 01:27:06,716
Who'd have thought it would be Johnnie?

768
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,966
Yes, ma'am.

769
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:17,214
Everything has changed so utterly.

770
01:27:19,415 --> 01:27:21,740
And now this.

771
01:27:24,251 --> 01:27:28,285
You did remove the ivy after all, Lalla.

772
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:31,236
The ivy, ma'am?

773
01:27:31,419 --> 01:27:33,115
Yes.

774
01:27:44,395 --> 01:27:46,993
I loved him.

775
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,441
I loved him so very much.

776
01:28:08,402 --> 01:28:12,079
There was never a child like him, ma'am.

777
01:28:12,264 --> 01:28:17,471
- I'm so sorry.
- No, Lalla, you mustn't worry.

778
01:28:19,744 --> 01:28:23,327
Because he was... different...

779
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:28,685
I don't know how to say this.

780
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:33,268
He made you... He made me feel...

781
01:28:33,452 --> 01:28:36,227
- Not confined.
- Yes.

782
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:40,858
- Is that how he made you feel?
- Yes, ma'am.

783
01:28:41,036 --> 01:28:45,592
- Not that I felt confined...
- I know what you mean.

784
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:52,511
I shall miss him so very much myself.

785
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:56,894
I do already.

786
01:28:59,545 --> 01:29:03,092
- Does that surprise you?
- No.

787
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:05,980
No.

788
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:12,303
Please excuse me.

789
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:21,594
I am so sorry, ma'am.

790
01:29:23,205 --> 01:29:26,360
I'm all to pieces today.

791
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:33,256
My mother was always doing that,

792
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:36,103
breaking things.

793
01:29:38,095 --> 01:29:41,085
Yes, I remember.

794
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:56,280
"...who also has taught us not to
be sorry, as men without hope,

795
01:29:56,465 --> 01:29:59,763
"for them that sleep in him.

796
01:29:59,944 --> 01:30:03,455
"We most meekly beseech thee, Father,

797
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:05,577
"to raise us from the death of sin

798
01:30:05,754 --> 01:30:08,387
"unto the life of righteousness,

799
01:30:08,573 --> 01:30:12,844
"that when we shall depart
this life we may rest in him,

800
01:30:13,026 --> 01:30:17,818
"as our hope is for this, thy child John,

801
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:22,651
"and that at the general
resurrection on the last day

802
01:30:22,837 --> 01:30:27,214
"we may be found acceptable in thy sight..."

803
01:30:45,313 --> 01:30:48,717
"Grant this, we beseech thee, merciful Father,

804
01:30:48,896 --> 01:30:54,317
"through Jesus Christ, our
mediator and redeemer. Amen."

805
01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:56,680
Amen.

806
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:55,797
I don't think a day will go by
for the rest of my life

807
01:31:55,975 --> 01:31:58,786
where I won't think about Johnnie.

808
01:31:59,315 --> 01:32:00,939
Yes.

809
01:32:03,664 --> 01:32:07,827
Lalla, I was thinking during the service.

810
01:32:08,883 --> 01:32:11,587
I was thinking he was the only one of us

811
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:15,031
who was able to be himself.
