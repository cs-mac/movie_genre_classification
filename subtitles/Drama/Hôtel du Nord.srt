1
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,396
Mind your dress, Lucette.

2
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,991
Emile!

3
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,508
- Give her some wine.
- There you go.

4
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,996
- Trimault?
- No, I've told you.

5
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,157
- One glass for the girl.
- Ginette, tell him.

6
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,350
It's bad for him.

7
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,278
Not exactly for me, but for my work.

8
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,437
His work... Weird sort of work, it is.

9
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,710
We can't all be cops.

10
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,872
Too bad, the world would be a safer place.

11
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,036
But we'd all go hungry.

12
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,629
Isn't Prosper awful?
He's a real terror sometimes.

13
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,399
- One more, Jeanne.
- You forget my blood?

14
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,910
You sound like you're
the only one who has any.

15
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,477
Give it to me.
Opening a wine bottle is an art.

16
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,433
But I sell mine.
And who would buy unhealthy blood?

17
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,994
Drink poisons the bloodstream.

18
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,237
My word! You do overload yourself.

19
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,352
Lock-keeper and blood donor.
Two jobs, one man!

20
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,790
Donating blood is no job, it's an honor.

21
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,278
My blood's clean, but I wouldn't sell it
for all the gold in China.

22
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,274
If you got 400 francs for a liter like he does,
anyone here would.

23
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,518
To think people had my blood
in their veins. How indecent!

24
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,552
I shouldn't mind. Blood is blood, after all.

25
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,591
Dear, you're not fussy.

26
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,474
I wouldn't sell mine.
I like to keep it with me. Sorry.

27
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,389
Can't we find a better subject
for a first communion party?

28
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,192
More cheese, Lucette?

29
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,313
I've eaten enough. Dad, I'd like some cake.

30
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,351
Here, you do the honors.

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,310
- Another dry storm.
- What's wrong with him?

32
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,430
Manolo, darling. Don't worry.

33
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,710
He's all right, don't mind him.

34
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,955
If you ask me, he's scared.

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,514
Takes more than this to scare him.

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,597
He was two years in Barcelona,
he's used to it.

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,153
Then what is it?

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,873
It isn't fear, but memories.

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,832
Stay with me. No one will hurt you.

40
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,952
- A rum idea of yours!
- What do you mean?

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,312
Adopting the boy. Who is he?
Where's he from? Nobody knows.

42
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,828
I know his entire family is dead.

43
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,512
- A foreigner.
- He's not a foreigner, he's an orphan.

44
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,439
- Hello, everyone...
- Jeanne, do the service.

45
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,755
Where's that cake, Mme Ginette?

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,593
Lucette, take this to Mme Raymonde.
She must be lonely up there.

47
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,359
Hello, Raymonde.

48
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,271
Hello, darling.

49
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,949
Wow! Is it your wedding day?

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,194
For you.

51
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,630
You remembered me?
You yourself, in your pretty dress?

52
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,477
Isn't she cute?

53
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,717
Put it down.

54
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,194
Whose idea was it to send the cake?

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,231
- Mine.
- Liar.

56
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,397
- I swear, M. Edmond.
- Fancy lying on such a day.

57
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,476
Don't spoil her party.

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,395
- Why didn't you bring me any?
- There was none left.

59
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,399
You could've done this.
Then I'd have a slice.

60
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,752
They love to make me see
they can't bear the sight of me.

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,472
Thank them all the same.

62
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,035
Stop it. You're such a wet blanket.

63
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,799
- You don't like cakes.
- I'd like that one.

64
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,071
All right, like it and shut up.

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,351
It's not even a pie,
it's just a sponge cake.

66
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,992
Let me give you a kiss.

67
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,713
- How touching...
- Respect religion!

68
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,276
Thank everyone, will you?
Especially Mme Lecouvreur.

69
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,594
It's not bad cake.

70
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,792
Shame on you, making a scene
in front of a harmless child.

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,070
Your throat's better, I see.

72
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,918
Luckily, after one hour inhaling.

73
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,718
You've already had enough of it.

74
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,069
- Not there!
- What?

75
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,792
Not near the comb.

76
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,389
Besides, you shouldn't put
the comb next to the jam.

77
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,715
Or the jam next to curling tongs.

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,275
Or your toothbrush
next to your rice powder.

79
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,835
- Something else's wrong here.
- What then?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,198
- A woman like me next to you!
- Tough!

81
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,676
Tough? What are you getting at?

82
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,157
I'm learning English
and photography. Tough!

83
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,829
- Tough what? Tough who?
- Forget it.

84
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,475
Even a freelance photographer
needs a license.

85
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,476
That means getting up early.

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,750
You'll wake me up.

87
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,554
You stopped loving me?
Is that why you want to work?

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,512
I want to be able to buy my own food.

89
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,710
I'm no photographer's mistress.

90
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,753
It's getting dodgy for me here.
The signs are in the air.

91
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,472
You're getting out?

92
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,511
I need a change of scenery.

93
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,710
My life isn't an existence.

94
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,150
You think my existence is a life?

95
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,668
Your throat's obviously better.

96
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,149
I understand.

97
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,191
You couldn't make it plainer.

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,231
You want me to go out.

99
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,556
Will you stay put?

100
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,591
I'll wait for you.

101
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,351
How does my kisser look?

102
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,472
- Fine.
- Hands-on inspection.

103
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,990
Two men in one,
a lock-keeper and a blood donor.

104
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,830
The former would love some plaster,
the latter won't give him any.

105
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,797
You're lucky, Mme Ginette.
Two husbands in one.

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,071
- In bed, I'm all alone.
- Rubbish.

107
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,078
I'm telling you, I find myself dangling.

108
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,591
Let me console you.

109
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,956
- How's your throat, Mme Raymonde?
- Much better.

110
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,396
- Come and have a drink.
- I can't refuse.

111
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,156
I wanted to thank you for the delicious cake.

112
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,760
A bit too filling, I'm afraid.

113
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,872
We couldn't have angel food cake
at a first communion.

114
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,509
Jeanne, go see what they want.

115
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,269
A nice room for the night.
I'll give them number 16.

116
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,790
Isn't it beautiful?

117
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,270
The canal... the sound of the water...

118
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,431
What time is it?

119
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,635
Ten o'clock, half past ten...

120
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,591
Do you love me?

121
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,751
That's an odd question.

122
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,958
Without your love, Pierre, I'd be nothing.

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,991
I'd be alone in this world.

124
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,198
Perhaps they'll work all night because of us.

125
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,274
They may be the ones who'll handle it.

126
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,639
But right now you can show me our gift.

127
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,351
What's there to lose?

128
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,036
It won't jam, will it?

129
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,191
Renée, my love...

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,991
we can still back out.

131
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,473
Then we'd have to face life again.
Too much hassle.

132
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,751
Too complicated.

133
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,790
You'll leave everything?

134
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,308
I've nothing to leave.

135
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,309
Do you fully realize
what will happen here tonight?

136
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,351
Absolutely.

137
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,516
I've often thought about it.

138
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,238
I will lie down next to you,

139
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,510
lay my head on your shoulder

140
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,838
and you'll kiss me gently,
just like the first time.

141
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,871
I'll shut my eyes,

142
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,276
I'll hear your watch ticking by my ear.

143
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,709
You'll whisper my name

144
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,116
and you'll fire a shot here, into my heart.

145
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,150
Do it carefully.

146
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,954
I'm wearing the brooch you gave me,
so you can't miss the spot.

147
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,711
Then you'll shut your eyes.

148
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,876
I don't want you to see me die.

149
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,631
Then it'll be your turn.

150
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,118
This is where

151
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,791
you must aim

152
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,513
to join me.

153
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,551
Renée, my sweet...

154
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,757
I've never loved you this much before.

155
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,155
I can't love you more deeply.

156
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,431
As life has nothing to offer us,
we'd better put an end to it.

157
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,914
Yes, you're right.

158
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,076
We've tried everything, haven't we?

159
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,232
But the world rejected us.

160
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,475
Everything always went wrong for us.

161
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,232
We'll quit it all with no regrets.

162
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,795
No regrets. We've had our love.

163
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,473
In fact, I deserve to die. I'm a coward.

164
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,079
Given our situation,
I should be ready to kill for money.

165
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,156
To risk everything.

166
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,314
I'd never do that. Not even for you.

167
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,671
How ugly I am!

168
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,194
Tell me, would you want to kill yourself
even if we hadn't met?

169
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,189
I wouldn't have hoped for happiness.

170
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,397
We have nothing else
but our love in this world.

171
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,718
The others have no love,
but they have everything else.

172
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,311
Only, that's useless.

173
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,954
It doesn't justify a miserable life.

174
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,317
You'll see, it'll be wonderful. We'll be free.

175
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,079
Out there, it's amazing.

176
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,792
- Out there...
- Yes.

177
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,149
Nothing will matter any more.

178
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,792
We'll be happy.

179
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,278
We'll be...

180
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,754
Yes, our death will be blessed.

181
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,070
Have you ever made a trip?

182
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,519
- No.
- No.

183
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,358
Imagine we're going on our honeymoon.

184
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,834
In an hour, we'll be far away,

185
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,314
and we'll never come back.

186
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,873
Think about it.

187
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,436
Never again will we see
the hotel maid who showed us up here.

188
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,075
Or hear our landlady
on rue du Caire again.

189
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,999
We'll never prowl the night until dawn again.

190
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,397
Your boss smiling, the sausage man
who refused us credit,

191
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,635
that will all die for us.

192
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,871
The happiest day of my life?

193
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,712
When I bought the Hotel du Nord,
two years ago.

194
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,513
I was a cabinet-maker, working for others.

195
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,838
I came in here and saw the bar
and all the bottles,

196
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,112
and thought, "It all belongs to you alone,
like your watch."

197
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,516
I felt I could cry. Remember, Louise?

198
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,319
Fancy crying over a café! How sad!

199
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,794
My happiest day was a boat trip.

200
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,991
- You've been on a boat?
- Only to Charenton.

201
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,600
I was eleven and had a new dress on.

202
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,437
And yet, it rained.

203
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,955
Renée, my love! Answer me!

204
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,549
Open up.

205
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,199
Come on, beat it.

206
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,750
All right, stand back, please.

207
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,713
There's nothing to see. She's dead.

208
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,751
You, get back inside!

209
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,950
- But Dad...
- You want this?

210
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,031
Taking her to Lariboisière?

211
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,232
I'll go along. They might need me.
I can use the money.

212
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,316
And I'm always ready to help.

213
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,351
Her coat.

214
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,316
You called the landlord?

215
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,999
Yes, I even forced the door open.

216
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,795
I was in my room when I heard a shot
from a 6.35 pistol.

217
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,914
A 6.35 for sure. I have a good ear.
So I forced the door down.

218
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,918
Was the victim alone in the room?

219
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,474
- Alone.
- No one else was there?

220
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,832
I only saw the girl.

221
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,791
- Funny...
- What?

222
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,389
Never mind. May I see your papers?

223
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,468
There you are, all in order.

224
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,914
It's funny that you saw no one else.

225
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,633
- Still, I didn't.
- How about the gun?

226
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,069
- I didn't look.
- We found nothing.

227
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,511
- Maybe...
- You didn't pick it up, I imagine?

228
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,630
I'm not in charge of the enquiry.

229
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,279
- All the same, it's odd...
- What's odd?

230
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,835
- That he saw no one.
- He's not an observer!

231
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,034
Why weren't you with everyone else?

232
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,719
Wasn't invited, was doing photos.

233
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,309
- At eleven at night?
- When would you develop a film?

234
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't answer him. He has it in for you.

235
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,997
Your throat's still sore.
Why are you still here?

236
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,397
- The wine I had.
- I invited her to sit with us.

237
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,715
- That any of your business?
- Pardon?

238
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,149
Is that any of your business?

239
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,471
- Papers, please.
- You what?

240
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,796
- I said papers.
- Who does he think he is?

241
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,356
He gets here too late
and wants to see my papers. There.

242
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,909
- Not in order.
- Excuse me?

243
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,952
- Not in order. Come along.
- You can't run her in.

244
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,309
You want to bet? Come along.

245
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,876
Why didn't you listen to me?
Here, take some cigarettes.

246
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,751
Fantastic...

247
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,588
I'm dipping a cookie in wine,
a woman dies and I cop it.

248
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,235
- Unbelievable! You live and learn.
- Hurry up!

249
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,316
At least let me fetch my fur.

250
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,269
Don't worry, you'll be back tomorrow.

251
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,550
In four days, more like.

252
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,558
Be seeing you. Don't worry about me.

253
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,960
- Where's Edmond?
- He must've gone to bed.

254
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,991
What is he like?

255
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,356
This is something to crow over!
I'm quite a catch.

256
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,232
- Feeling better now? Is it over?
- Why are you here?

257
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,149
And yourself? I listened to you all night.
Most interesting delirium.

258
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,079
Patients often mumble
a lot of nonsense after an operation.

259
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,714
Strangely enough, you didn't.

260
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,115
Don't move.

261
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,391
- Was I operated on?
- Two transfusions.

262
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,273
From quite a rum donor, by the way.

263
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,159
How about Pierre?

264
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,829
Actually, who's that Pierre
who's always in your ravings?

265
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,794
He's dead, isn't he?

266
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,035
No one mentioned a second corpse.

267
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,711
He's dead.

268
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,355
Poor Pierre... He didn't miss on himself.

269
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,752
Why did you save me?
I won't miss next time.

270
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:23,554
A suicide, eh? You little idiot!
After a day here, you'd be put off dying.

271
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,672
- I'll try again.
- Be quiet! You'll get worse!

272
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,077
Out there, we'll be free.

273
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,275
It'll be wonderful.

274
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,635
- How's the survivor?
- Better. Says she'll try again.

275
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,240
Well, well...

276
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,430
Do it a bit earlier next time.

277
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,438
Die in the daytime, I hate the night shift.

278
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,797
- Feed her.
- What if she refuses?

279
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,549
She won't. She'll want to live now.

280
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,115
It wasn't a suicide.
The murderer's in custody.

281
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,271
It's pointless to be silly now.
He's made a full confession.

282
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,909
He's here, surrounded by cops.

283
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,190
Treat him as he deserves.

284
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,912
I won't see him!

285
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,988
He said so himself.
That chap would slide out of anything.

286
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,917
Now brace yourself.

287
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,032
Face him with strength and dignity.

288
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,591
Gentlemen, come in.

289
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,951
Excuse us.

290
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,793
I won't make this last
any longer than it should.

291
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,913
I only wish to clarify a few facts.

292
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,511
Let me see.
You met your murderer a year ago.

293
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,390
I met Pierre a year ago,
on the 3rd of January.

294
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,590
What were you doing at the time?

295
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,871
I was alone in Paris,
I'd just left the orphanage.

296
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,753
I was placed in a baker's shop.

297
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,156
Did you earn an honest living?

298
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,795
I was given board and lodging.

299
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,149
And I got 75 francs a month.

300
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,953
Not a bad start.

301
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,798
I'd have gone up to 150 francs.

302
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,913
Your work wasn't too exacting, then?

303
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,396
I got up at six in the morning
and went to bed at nine at night.

304
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,070
What was he doing when you met?

305
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,190
A draughtsman.

306
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,913
Was that his sole livelihood?

307
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,269
Did you become his mistress at once?

308
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,115
I was smitten.

309
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,996
You didn't waste any time.

310
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,191
I did, I was locked away till the age of 21.

311
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,038
Life in an orphanage is hard and so sad.

312
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,799
They took you in and enabled you to live.

313
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,592
Yes, enabled me to live.

314
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,633
You left your employment soon afterwards?

315
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,832
- Three months later.
- Yes. And then?

316
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,236
We lived as best we could.

317
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,919
He sold his drawings, I sat for artists.

318
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,715
- And then?
- And then... this.

319
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,911
Money ran out,
so he suggested a suicide pact.

320
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,635
Under his spell,
you went to the Hotel du Nord.

321
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,274
There he murdered you and ran.

322
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,794
Yes, I murdered her and I ran.

323
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,276
- He's lying. I shot myself.
- With his gun?

324
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,909
Yes, because I wouldn't dare
buy one myself.

325
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,633
- He confessed.
- He's a child.

326
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,433
Stop it.

327
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,598
It's over between us,
we may as well tell the truth.

328
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,279
I shot you and ran.

329
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,598
I threw the gun into the canal gardens.
You'll find it easily.

330
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,108
It's no use denying the facts.

331
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,355
You know I'm the one who fired.

332
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,517
I missed it, that should prove it.

333
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,596
I've always been so clumsy.

334
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,595
I must ask you to suspend
your interrogation.

335
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,029
It's obviously futile to continue.

336
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,990
One moment.

337
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,031
Nothing to say to her?

338
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,271
Nothing.

339
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,912
Are you crazy or what?

340
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,633
If someone found that in your pocket...

341
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,351
Look, here's 50 sous.

342
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,310
I'm not taking it, I'm buying it.

343
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,558
All right?

344
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,511
All right.

345
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,999
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

346
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,870
I've a chicken needs killing.

347
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,151
- Show me to it.
- I'll show you.

348
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,191
After you.

349
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,234
Trust Edmond to be in on a killing.

350
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,272
Some give blood,
some shed other people's blood.

351
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,835
He's got a nasty mind, whatever you say.

352
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,395
He tortured a mouse
for four hours last Saturday.

353
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,954
The devil finds work for idle hands.

354
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,956
And Mimar's dog. Remember?

355
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,718
- Hunchback?
- Right.

356
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,196
Dumped in the canal
with a stone round its neck.

357
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,832
What did Mimar say?

358
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,838
Nothing. He'd asked Edmond to do it.

359
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,314
Mimar's so soft-hearted.

360
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,794
While Edmond drowned Hunchback,

361
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,118
Mimar locked himself up
in his room so he wouldn't see it.

362
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,549
With Jeanne, by the way.

363
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,591
Isn't that disgusting?

364
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,870
- With Jeanne?
- With Jeanne. Why?

365
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,753
- Come on...
- Want to bet?

366
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,268
How do you know?

367
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,151
Mme Raymonde. Back already?

368
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,351
Already? Four days is long enough, isn't it?

369
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,359
How did it end the other night?
She snuffed it?

370
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,678
- She got a transfusion.
- Trust you to cash in on a drama!

371
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,953
- Back already!
- You too!

372
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,594
- What do you mean?
- Drop it, it's OK.

373
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,757
- How did it go?
- I waited for it to go.

374
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,234
Four days inside is like eight on the outside.

375
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,271
I look so scraggy!

376
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,837
Any news of that woman?

377
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,872
Trimault said she got a transfusion.

378
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,354
She'll be fine.

379
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,949
- Who topped her?
- A poor sort of type.

380
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,388
He gave himself up the following day.

381
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,951
- What's that?
- Don't touch it.

382
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,912
- Been shopping?
- Don't touch it, I said.

383
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,711
It's just a souvenir.

384
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,714
- Do you know Gina? Ernest's girl?
- Vaguely.

385
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,110
She also got run in.

386
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,471
We had a chat.

387
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,875
Nazarède came out a month ago.

388
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,674
He did his whole five years.

389
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,351
And now he's in Paris.

390
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,631
Looking for you.

391
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,153
He means business.

392
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,829
Paris is small, but France is big.

393
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,238
Meaning?

394
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,070
Do you like the Riviera?

395
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,079
The coast? How funny!

396
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,317
Whenever I'm in the mill, I long for the sun.

397
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,271
We'll pack our bags then.

398
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,675
You're really sweet.

399
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,030
Sometimes you're more like a brother
than a chum.

400
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,991
Improve your vocabulary!

401
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,156
Vocabulary?

402
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,555
Vocabulary... Funny...

403
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,678
It's the only bit of slang I don't get.

404
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,711
A side comb.

405
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,999
- What are you after?
- I've got to give her something back.

406
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,638
- Hello, Mme Raymonde. Back already?
- Yes, already.

407
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,195
You left this when
you were cleaning for Edmond.

408
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,196
He likes order.

409
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,312
Combs should go on heads, not in saucers.

410
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,349
- What's the date?
- The 5th of June.

411
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,676
Two affairs to settle,
then we're off to Toulon.

412
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,674
On the 10th, we'll be having an aperitif
at a sunny table at the Arsenal.

413
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,471
- All right?
- Almost done it.

414
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,835
That's it.

415
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,919
- When's your train?
- 10:50 tonight.

416
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,839
Won't be walking the metro arches
as usual.

417
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,953
Funny kind of job when you think about it.

418
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,834
Sometimes 25 trains go by
before I find a client.

419
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,395
When I'm bored I count the trains
up above me.

420
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,749
One day, I broke my own record.

421
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,669
For 57 trains, I didn't go with anyone.
And it's a busy station.

422
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,190
- M. Edmond woke up early.
- Up and shaved by seven.

423
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,471
He's gone to the station to get our tickets.

424
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,195
- Such planning!
- He always has it all figured out.

425
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,074
A perfect traveling partner,
so unlike his usual self.

426
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,236
He's so kind and thoughtful.

427
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,158
He buys oranges and peels them for you.

428
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,350
Lights your cigarette himself...

429
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,190
A perfect gentleman.
He tells you the history of all the places.

430
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,674
"Here Big Charles did his big heist.

431
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,517
"This is ex-con land.

432
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,553
"Here Alphonse bumped off Dédé."
What a geographer!

433
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,878
The closer we get to the sea,
the more tender he becomes.

434
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,990
The way he behaves on a train...

435
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,793
He makes third class feel like first class.

436
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,913
- You often travel together?
- It's the first time.

437
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,192
- For you.
- For me?

438
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,879
To show I don't bear grudges.

439
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,276
That's Kenel come for Trimault's wife.
They have a good time.

440
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,829
I'm off to Charonne. If she wants
to unwind a bit, she can come along.

441
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,393
You have quite a nerve.

442
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,715
Oh, what could we do in a car?

443
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,036
I'm not into complicated stuff.

444
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,911
Is she coming or not?

445
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,870
She's coming.

446
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,629
Is the lock-keeper blind
or does he do it on purpose?

447
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,798
We're friends. He trusts me. Don't you?

448
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,038
Sure, pal. She's coming.

449
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,236
I know the score.

450
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,157
Sorry, I didn't see you.

451
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,316
That's what we thought.

452
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,993
Bye, now.
And not a word to the Queen Mother.

453
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,037
- Here, Manolo. I remembered you.
- Thank you.

454
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,835
You're late today, M. Adrien.

455
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,509
I was up at six
to clean out my room with carbolic.

456
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,438
I could have got Jeanne to help you.

457
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,029
She's a muddler
and I'm expecting a visitor tonight.

458
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,832
Your lady friend?

459
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,155
No, actually, a mate.

460
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,077
Tell me, Mme Lecouvreur,

461
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,554
those chaps playing cards yesterday...

462
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,273
New tenants, metro workers.
Aren't they nice?

463
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,311
Yes, very nice indeed.

464
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,275
I'm off. Have a nice day.

465
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,840
So house-proud, with his carbolic acid!

466
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,952
He's always very spruce.
Has to be, in his line.

467
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,752
What's his job?

468
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,597
Confectionery.

469
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,709
Excuse me.

470
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,876
Oh, my word... Emile.

471
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,831
Don't you recognize her?

472
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,189
Can't remember where I saw her.

473
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,879
- Number 16.
- Number 16?

474
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,473
Sit down, you must be tired
after all that commotion.

475
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,511
Thank you.

476
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,357
- Have a drink.
- A good drink. That'll do you good.

477
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,756
You came for your clothes?

478
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,873
I wanted to thank you
for all your gifts at the hospital.

479
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,592
So she spoiled you.

480
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,997
I wanted to come and see you,
but I kept putting it off.

481
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,315
To be honest, I was scared.

482
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,399
You see, you weren't an ordinary patient.

483
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,715
And the papers made such a fuss.

484
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,194
Did you see them? I've saved them.

485
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,437
I'd rather not see them.
You've been so kind.

486
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,677
Yes, you were. You didn't know me.

487
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,359
I caused you nothing but trouble.

488
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,870
And you took an interest in me,
uninteresting as I am.

489
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,832
- That's no way to talk.
- A packet of cigarettes.

490
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,871
I've a barge waiting.

491
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,874
What a surprise! Remember me?
Prosper Trimault.

492
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,672
- Hello.
- Hello, but...

493
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,950
If I hadn't been there, you wouldn't be here.

494
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,437
I gave you the transfusion.
It's my blood in your veins.

495
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,277
Thank you so very much.

496
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,836
With a Trimault transfusion,
you'll have a long life for sure.

497
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,677
My cigarettes.

498
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,635
We're more or less related now.

499
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,996
See you later, cousin.

500
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,990
You must never do it again.

501
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,271
- I'm over that. Plus I know he's alive.
- Who?

502
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,038
- Pierre.
- Oh, him.

503
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,188
- I wonder how he felt.
- Do me a favor. Forget him!

504
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,231
I'm trying.

505
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,477
I keep telling myself, "You must forget him!"

506
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,670
But that's also thinking about him.

507
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,471
I'm sure you'll scold me,

508
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,272
but before I say goodbye,

509
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,630
I'd like to see the room.

510
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,955
- Number 16?
- Yes.

511
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,390
Not much of a shrine.
It's a room like any other.

512
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,078
- No.
- Yes.

513
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,635
Still, if you really want to,
I can hardly refuse.

514
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,830
But you're making a mistake.

515
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,437
You see? Not very thrilling.

516
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,950
It's clean. That's about all you can say.

517
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,111
Just like the first time.

518
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,671
I lay down here.

519
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,559
He kissed me.
And when he fired, it didn't hurt.

520
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,550
- Poor Pierre...
- There you are! Your things.

521
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,558
Hat, coat, purse. Did I forget something?

522
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,075
That's all I possess.

523
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,159
You've youth and good looks.
That's something.

524
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,318
Being pretty is no help.
See how it complicated her life.

525
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,920
What will you do when you go away?

526
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,190
What will happen to her now?

527
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,470
It's no fun to be alone.

528
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,478
That's true, it isn't fun to be alone.

529
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,159
- I can't offer much...
- Good idea.

530
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,758
- What idea?
- Say it.

531
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,271
- Say what?
- Your idea's mine. Say it for me.

532
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,074
Amazing!
He's always stealing my decisions.

533
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,032
I've not much to offer you...

534
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,674
- You said that.
- Damn you!

535
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,748
If you want to stay here till something
comes along, you can help Jeanne.

536
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,110
She's overloaded,
and it's better than nothing.

537
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,280
I'll show you what to do.
The customers don't expect fancy service.

538
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,117
Do you like my idea?

539
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,197
Didn't I tell you? He always steals my ideas.

540
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,951
Where in the world is she?

541
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,591
I'm excited.

542
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,275
- We're not going.
- What?

543
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,959
Go get a refund, we're not leaving.

544
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,956
Why? What's happened?

545
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,993
You know you shouldn't stay here.
Nazarède may kill you.

546
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,031
We're not going!

547
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,277
- Have you any salami?
- Yes.

548
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,629
Give me a tomato salad then.

549
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,559
She's learned quickly.
All that going back and forth...

550
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,310
- Renée.
- Yes?

551
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,351
A bottle of water.

552
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,991
Did you see that?

553
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,031
With the bottle.

554
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,469
M. Edmond is so attentive with Renée.

555
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,750
What's he playing at?

556
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,075
I've never seen him like that with a woman.

557
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,510
Did you enjoy your lesson this morning?

558
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,632
I've made her take up hairdressing,
in case...

559
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,274
Better than the piano and not noisy.

560
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,359
Isn't my wife a poppet?
I'm a lucky man or what?

561
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,391
Shut up.

562
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,749
You'll make me blush.

563
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,153
Thank you, M. Edmond.

564
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,828
Did you see that?

565
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,759
Don't be so nosy.
He's not the only one after Renée.

566
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,439
- He has competition?
- Ask Kenel.

567
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,550
Kenel? You must be joking.

568
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,319
It was to be expected. He has no girl.

569
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,875
No girl! How do you know that?

570
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,797
A packet of Gauloises.

571
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,033
I've run out.

572
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,231
Go get six packs
and a box of Voltigeurs. Quick.

573
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,830
He won't believe she was the suicide girl.

574
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,634
- She's a smasher.
- Just because she was shot.

575
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,036
You're a smasher too,
it's a question of taste.

576
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,277
If she beckoned to me, I'd be at her heels.

577
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,436
You're all the same!

578
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,517
When push comes to shove, you hit the run.

579
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,870
We might as well call
the Missing Persons Bureau.

580
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:16,311
- What brings you here now?
- A delivery to make to Lecouvreur.

581
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,796
Don't let that stop you pouring me a drink.

582
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,839
- A string, please.
- It's you! I should have known.

583
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,599
That knot's to remind you of me?

584
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,552
- Do you still see him in prison?
- Yes, and afterwards.

585
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,477
Couldn't be bettered.

586
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,798
- I don't see how you got permission.
- We lived together.

587
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,310
He's right under her skin, like a silver bullet.

588
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,354
Whether he shot me or I shot myself,
what difference does it make?

589
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,030
We wanted to die together, we failed.
You can't always win.

590
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,435
When I'm with a woman, I make love.

591
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,233
But everyone's unique.

592
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,152
You finished? Tell me, you finished?

593
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,431
- Who's asking?
- Because I'm about to start.

594
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,675
I'm talking to Renée, not you.

595
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,359
I can do without slime in a conversation.

596
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,834
For my part, I don't care for lard.

597
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,599
You've been heaving far too long.

598
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,279
A loudmouth should only judge others

599
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,276
if he's been in the mill.

600
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,072
- You've got a nerve.
- Not here.

601
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,712
Get him out, then!

602
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,832
Why go out?
He doesn't go out with just anyone!

603
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,269
- Let's talk outside.
- No scenes here.

604
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,675
Mind your own business, M. Edmond.

605
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,553
That's right. Don't wreak havoc in my bar.

606
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,591
Fine. To your good health.

607
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,433
Come to gawp at a bungling murderer?
Vicious curiosity.

608
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,274
- Pierre.
- It's funny.

609
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,517
No one calls me by my name now.

610
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,473
Yet, God knows how informal
these people are with me.

611
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,319
Most call me "swine" or "scumbag".

612
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,036
And I don't blame them.

613
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,671
Why did you come?

614
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,389
For us.

615
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,395
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

616
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,635
I was actually very apprehensive.

617
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,150
I had no faith in myself. I kept thinking,

618
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,760
"When I see him there next to me,

619
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,677
"I may get over him instantly."

620
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,156
I was afraid. Terribly afraid of myself.

621
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,433
But I'm not afraid any more. It's like before.

622
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,037
I didn't see myself as a piece of shit.

623
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,878
We thought we were brave, we were wrong.

624
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,112
You must despise me
for having let you down.

625
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,879
If it had been the other way round,

626
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,354
if I'd shot you and then myself,

627
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,595
I might have run at the last minute.

628
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,439
You've no idea how easy it is
to be killed by someone.

629
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,710
I can never talk to you like before.
Shame will always keep us apart.

630
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,912
But I've forgotten.

631
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,349
It takes two to forget.

632
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,315
No, no, no. You witnessed my cowardice.
We'll never be free.

633
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,592
- Look at me.
- I don't want pity. I'm a coward. Go away!

634
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,551
I don't blame you.

635
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,276
You want to hear the truth?

636
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,754
I had it all premeditated that night.

637
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,597
I'm a murderer.

638
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,995
Death didn't scare me, as you think.

639
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,951
Freedom did.

640
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,676
And that's why,
when I saw the sun rise like any other day,

641
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,393
I gave myself up to the police.

642
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,470
I wanted to kill you. I wanted to kill you!

643
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,479
No. That's wrong.
I was there when the truth happened.

644
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,159
Go away! Get out of here!

645
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,875
We're not victim and culprit.
We're accomplices.

646
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,596
Accomplices. You want to make me
forget whose crime this is.

647
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,870
No, thank you. I don't need your generosity.

648
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,512
My poor Pierre...

649
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,236
You're wasting your time on me.
It was all a big mistake.

650
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,396
You'll find someone else.

651
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,393
Occasionally,
your scar will remind you of me.

652
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,316
- That's horrible!
- Get out, or I'll get more horrible still.

653
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,238
Are you mad at me?

654
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,068
It's my specialty
not to bear a grudge, remember?

655
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,588
You don't take me seriously.

656
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,438
Yet, if I were serious, you'd laugh at me.

657
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,870
- Make me laugh then.
- I've not eaten for three days.

658
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,469
- Not hungry?
- I can't stop thinking about you.

659
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,149
You must have heard only lies about me.

660
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,555
I've had enough of Ginette.

661
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,197
That has to stop.
Sleeping with a pal's wife isn't my line.

662
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,515
- You're not being serious.
- I am.

663
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,439
Take me and I'll make a home for you.

664
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,835
- I'd end up like Ginette.
- Not at all.

665
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,758
Ginette knew it was only a fun ride.

666
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,793
With you, it's the real thing.
We'll live somewhere else.

667
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,196
I realized love's like money.

668
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,832
You put it by.

669
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,476
It only happens once in a lifetime,
and this is it for me.

670
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,918
No, you can't put love by. It's not like that.

671
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,999
Believe me.
But it comes only once all right.

672
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,598
Renée, my sweetheart.

673
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,519
- Leave me alone.
- Renée, let me explain.

674
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,632
- Here's a snack.
- I haven't the heart to eat.

675
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,468
So what? Cry with your tear ducts,
eat with your mouth.

676
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,954
- Get your organs right.
- You're very kind.

677
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,433
Should I call you Mme Edmond
or Mlle Raymonde?

678
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,755
Depends on your point of view.

679
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,034
You're cheering up.

680
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,310
You know men.

681
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,158
Tell me why Ginette left.

682
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,751
I loved her like a mother,
paid her hairdressing lessons.

683
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,872
- It's a down phase.
- It didn't start yesterday.

684
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,993
- Sometimes it's long.
- It's ages since she and Kenel...

685
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,920
Last year, when I took my holiday,

686
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,916
we'd decided to go to Dieppe.

687
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,954
I'd arranged everything,
got the tickets myself...

688
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,470
I remember I was so happy! More fool me!

689
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,274
I gave her the tickets like flowers.
What did she say?

690
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,354
"We're not going."

691
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,872
- You knew it?
- It was a random guess.

692
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,191
Oh, dear.

693
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,112
You still think I've got my eye on Renée?

694
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,468
- No!
- No yes? Or no no?

695
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,431
No no!

696
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,756
Look at me. Can't see out of my left eye.

697
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,951
- It's like losing a limb.
- Are you ready?

698
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,160
- Yes!
- Yes yes? Or yes no?

699
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,431
Yes, crap. I'd say more, but it's Sunday.

700
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,357
I can go alone to Varenne.

701
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,791
All this fuss over fishing!
I hunt every night but I don't swank.

702
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,354
Going to Varenne
when we should be in Toulon...

703
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,477
Why don't we go to Toulon?

704
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,512
You're so stubborn,
you'll come to a sticky end.

705
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,233
- So what?
- You were never fatalitarian.

706
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,590
- Fatalistic.
- The result is the same.

707
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,437
Why do you have a crush on her?

708
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,277
- Aren't we happy?
- No.

709
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,197
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

710
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,754
- Don't you like our life?
- Do you?

711
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,950
I have to, I got used to it.

712
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,992
Despite my black eye, you're a good bloke.

713
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,272
We may quarrel, but we get along fine
when we hit the sheets.

714
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,312
I'm sick of it. I feel suffocated.

715
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,952
You get it? Suffocated.

716
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,753
In the sea air, you'd breathe better.

717
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,598
It'll smell fishy anywhere we go.

718
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,757
- Let's go to the colonies.
- With you?

719
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,028
Why not?

720
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,517
I need a change of atmosphere
and you are my atmosphere.

721
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,199
I've never been called
an atmosphere before.

722
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,913
I'm an atmosphere, you're a weird village.

723
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,238
You claim to be what you aren't
and brag of what you've been.

724
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,637
Atmosphere? Atmosphere?
Do I look like an atmosphere?

725
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,719
Go on your own!
Enjoy your fishing and your atmosphere!

726
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,839
- What are you doing?
- Killing your bugs. You'll sleep better.

727
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,599
- With a blowtorch?
- That's what does it.

728
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,792
Bugs or no bugs,
this room's making me sick.

729
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,831
Now now, take it easy.

730
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,232
- That's why the neighbors complained.
- Because of my eye?

731
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,478
- Because of the noise.
- They'll stop complaining soon enough.

732
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,431
Hurry up, Renée.

733
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,956
You heard him. Hurry up.

734
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,114
- Going to the jail today?
- No, why?

735
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,311
It's Sunday,
everybody needs their own cinema.

736
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,157
I'll pass the cinema.

737
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,839
Leave my bed. It's no use making it.

738
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,110
- I'm leaving.
- Your bed?

739
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,390
No. Edmond.

740
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,556
- He'll be upset.
- You shouldn't have infected him.

741
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,352
I've infected M. Edmond?

742
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,949
You gave him your suicide bug.

743
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,833
- He'll recover.
- No, there's no cure for it.

744
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,716
Since you came, Edmond's been brooding.

745
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,716
His language has changed.

746
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,035
Your death ruined his life.

747
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,038
He wasn't a thinker.
Now he's one and hates it.

748
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,389
What proves I infected him?

749
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,557
Everything.
He takes no pleasure in anything,

750
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,637
we're not going to the seaside any more...

751
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,796
You're an unusual atmosphere.

752
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,389
Thanks, I'll have enough bait.

753
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,751
Two mineral waters.

754
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,712
- It's quiet here today.
- It's Sunday.

755
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,719
- No café-going on Sundays?
- Ours is a weekday trade.

756
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,433
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I never smoke.

757
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,197
Here.

758
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,879
Keep the change.

759
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,354
- Eight francs?
- You heard him.

760
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,631
- Thank you.
- Perhaps she doesn't accept tips.

761
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,271
- This is a hotel?
- Yes.

762
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,475
Could we rent a room if we wanted to?

763
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,476
- Is that the entrance to the hotel?
- Yes.

764
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,037
- What's the hotel called?
- Hotel du Nord.

765
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,877
- This is where she lives.
- Who?

766
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,434
- Raymonde.
- What a coincidence!

767
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,392
- You know her?
- A bit. She's well, is she?

768
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,113
- Very well, thank you.
- Still with Paulo?

769
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,310
- Paulo?
- Her friend.

770
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,477
We've no M. Paulo living here.

771
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,717
- What's her friend's name then?
- M. Edmond.

772
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,832
Isn't he tall with a moustache?

773
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,678
- Help me with my suitcases, Renée.
- Yes.

774
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,553
Oh my word! If it isn't Nazarède!

775
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,034
Hello, Marcel.

776
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,877
- Oh, my!
- Quite a surprise, eh?

777
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,150
I was just thinking of you.

778
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,839
- Fancy a drink?
- No. A marc, please.

779
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,676
- We were talking about Paulo.
- Oh, yes?

780
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,678
They don't believe
I don't know any M. Paulo.

781
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,712
- She's never met him.
- Only Edmond?

782
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,990
What's become of Paulo then?

783
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,759
- How would I know?
- I'll bet she knows.

784
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,390
- Why would I lie?
- Because you respect us.

785
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,477
- Ask Renée, she'll tell you.
- Come this way.

786
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,750
- This Paulo, or M. Edmond, is a tall bloke?
- Yes.

787
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,190
- And he plays the guitar?
- No, he hates music.

788
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,789
Runs from fights and hates
the sight of blood, right?

789
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,389
On the contrary.
He kills all our rabbits and chickens.

790
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,831
His clothes are spotty
and he leaves cigarette ash everywhere?

791
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,871
M. Edmond couldn't be neater.

792
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,036
What's the conclusion?

793
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,516
Edmond's the complete opposite of Paulo.

794
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,997
Of course. I was so disappointed
in Paulo I took his opposite.

795
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,271
Never mind. Goodbye.

796
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,592
If we run across Paulo...

797
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,996
You never know.
We'll give him your regards.

798
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,713
- Just don't give him my address.
- All right.

799
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,557
Goodbye.

800
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,471
Don't try to understand. This is beyond you.

801
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,112
I'll fetch your cases.

802
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:19,119
No. I'm not leaving any more.
I can also be capricious.

803
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,949
You don't really enjoy going out with me.

804
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,389
Why do you say that?

805
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,954
I've never seen you with a woman.

806
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,670
I've never had the chance to.

807
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,873
I've always wanted to tell you...

808
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,956
I approve.

809
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,276
- You approve?
- Of your attitude to Pierre.

810
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,555
A friend of mine was arrested.

811
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,036
In a rash act, he stole a bicycle.

812
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,753
I always wrote to him in prison

813
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,439
and kept seeing him when he came out.

814
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,793
- Very good of you.
- And yet, I don't like cycling.

815
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,350
Hello, Fernand.

816
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,790
- I wanted to see you.
- Didn't you recognize me?

817
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,150
I didn't even look at you
when I saw you with a girl.

818
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,039
- I mustn't spoil your evening.
- Not at all.

819
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,993
Honestly, I'm very sleepy.
Thanks for your concern.

820
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,991
Don't worry about me.

821
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,358
- Someone mentioned me to you today.
- No.

822
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,834
Yes. Two men in the hotel.

823
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,472
- Indeed. Did Raymonde tell you?
- Yes.

824
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,590
- He mistook you for someone else.
- No.

825
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,791
Yes. They wanted a guitarist called Paulo.

826
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,035
That's me.

827
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,390
- You?
- Yes, I was that man before.

828
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,233
- Before what?
- Before all the rest.

829
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,272
I must seem odd to you.
We've only exchanged empty phrases.

830
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,435
Today it's different.

831
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,155
You don't know it,
but we've shared experiences.

832
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,354
- It was I who found you that fateful evening.
- I knew it.

833
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,710
And I told your friend to run.
You knew that?

834
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:10,473
No. When they questioned you,
you said I was alone. Why?

835
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,829
Just a hunch.

836
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,917
I thought you might prefer it that way.

837
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,155
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

838
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,638
They took you away

839
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,671
and later you came back.

840
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,389
The day I was meant to leave.

841
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,431
So I stayed on.

842
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,791
Don't say anything.

843
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,395
I've never felt shy before.

844
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,314
The bohemian who played the guitar,

845
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:49,239
who was careless
and hated the sight of blood.

846
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,271
That was me.

847
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,798
Today I'm called Edmond, I was Paulo then.

848
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,876
But my real name's Robert.

849
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,718
I funked facing the police once too.

850
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:09,277
One day, to save my own skin,
I ratted on an accomplice.

851
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,630
I was let off, they got five years.

852
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,956
They've served the sentence
and they're after me now.

853
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,397
So I've become a different person.

854
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,954
I've changed identity.

855
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,471
I like to be clean and neat,
my tie is always pressed.

856
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,036
I hate music
and the sight of blood no longer affects me.

857
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,269
It's hard to slough yourself off.

858
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,513
But I wasn't supposed to become
either Edmond or Paulo.

859
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,675
And the proof is,
Robert is talking to you tonight.

860
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,190
You can listen to him.
He's not soiled, almost brand new.

861
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,311
That's all.

862
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,592
What I've told you may not look
much of a present,

863
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,511
but it cost me dear.

864
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,035
Thank you very much, M. Robert.

865
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,196
I imagined I'd confide in you in the
morning...

866
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,512
after our first night.

867
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,633
But I realize there will be
no first night for us.

868
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,319
Now it's as if we've had it already,

869
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,749
as I've given myself to you.

870
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,157
I'd like to give you something too,

871
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,071
to even things out,

872
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,150
but I've no secrets.

873
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,714
You've listened. That's enough.

874
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,672
It can't have been easy for you.

875
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,917
Happiness hasn't really come to you.

876
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,552
My past next to yours...

877
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,431
- My past is over and done with.
- Over?

878
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,715
Yes.

879
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,911
Yet, somehow, I can't leave it behind.

880
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,149
I can't forget and start over.

881
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,509
It has nothing to do with Pierre.

882
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,996
It's only me. I can't give in.

883
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,870
I had such hopes.
Such confidence in myself. I lived for love.

884
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,318
You can't bring yourself
to stop believing in it.

885
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,069
You don't want to change. That's foolish.

886
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,589
You need someone to force you to get out.

887
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,710
Like at a cemetery or a theatre,

888
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,751
when they shout at you,

889
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,473
"Go away, we're closing up."

890
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,958
Take me away with you. Let's go away.

891
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,834
Everything else has gone wrong,
but this won't.

892
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,190
Let's run off somewhere.

893
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,232
It'll be all right, now I have no expectations.

894
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,874
From our unhappiness will spring...

895
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,478
A huge catastrophe.

896
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,876
Take me away. You have to go anyway.

897
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,990
Take me away.

898
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,439
It would be too good.

899
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,870
- Just got in?
- No, leaving.

900
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,956
- Up to Paris?
- No, down south.

901
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,753
- Beyond Marseille?
- Further down. One stop below.

902
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,872
There's nothing below Marseille.

903
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,550
Here, Madame.
Try my sea urchins. Try this one.

904
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,476
- A bit off.
- What?

905
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,239
- I've just opened it.
- It needed airing.

906
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,715
Here's fresh money, get some ice.

907
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,832
Why do you look at me all the time?

908
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,112
I don't want you out of my sight.
Haven't done this in ages.

909
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,152
Hands in my pocket, not a worry, peaceful.

910
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,919
Someone steps on my feet, I smile.

911
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,191
- Are you happy?
- I feel I don't exist.

912
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,879
- It's pleasant.
- Our last walk in France.

913
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,559
- With you, I feel in Paris.
- Even now?

914
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,798
Rue de la Gaîté here, Bobino there,
the Montparnasse theatre

915
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,230
and a bit further ahead, the metro,
Edgar Quinet Station.

916
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,669
Shall we have our shoes polished?

917
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,596
- Where are our cases?
- I took them to our cabin.

918
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,274
We'll sleep on board tonight.

919
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,390
Would you prefer a hotel?

920
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,079
Whether at a hotel or in the cabin...

921
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,918
Tomorrow, La Josyane will cast off.

922
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,793
Port Said is incredible, I'll find work there.

923
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,912
No one will know me
so I won't mind working.

924
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,475
When you like someone,
working doesn't bother you.

925
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,431
We'll be far away.

926
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,994
- Do you like me?
- I swear.

927
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,951
- Do you love me?
- Obviously.

928
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,638
- Say it to my face.
- What?

929
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,477
- That you love me.
- I've told you.

930
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,317
- No.
- I said I liked you.

931
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,032
- It's not the same.
- Yes, it is.

932
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,071
- It's the same?
- That's what I said.

933
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,190
- Say it, then.
- That I like you?

934
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,152
- No, that you love me.
- I can't.

935
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,838
When you say that...

936
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,917
- Coward.
- What? You think I'm intimidated?

937
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,554
We won't go to Port Said.

938
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,591
I love you.

939
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,839
I must love you,
if you can make me say that.

940
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,556
- Do you love me too?
- I will, in Port Said.

941
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,151
- You won't love me here or in Paris?
- No more love in Paris.

942
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,634
Fair enough. What about Châtellerault?

943
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,672
- Don't know it.
- Nor Port Said either!

944
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,475
- I can imagine it. There we'll start afresh.
- Real life.

945
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,075
Quite a nice cabin.

946
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,079
But you can't really tell till you're out at sea.

947
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,514
This time tomorrow, we'll be leaving.

948
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,671
You don't regret it?

949
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,076
No, as it was your idea to go to Port Said.

950
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,355
- Won't you change your mind?
- No.

951
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,109
But I'm not sure
I should have listened to you.

952
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,995
We must go quickly. Believe me.

953
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,077
You'll see, it's nice in Port Said.

954
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,635
We'll be free out there. It'll be wonderful.

955
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:05,755
- Out there...
- We'll be happy, dead to all but ourselves.

956
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,078
In two days, we'll be far away
and we'll never come back.

957
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,432
Think about it.
The Hotel du Nord, Trimaults face,

958
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,311
we'll not see them again.

959
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,794
We'll never again hear
the sounds of the canal.

960
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,195
Why are you holding me so tight?

961
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,751
You're holding on to me like a lifeline.
Renée, can you hear me?

962
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,519
I'm sorry, I'm crazy.

963
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,755
What was the matter?

964
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,759
You were hanging on for grim death.

965
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,473
- It's over.
- How bizarre.

966
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,318
You kept saying we had to go,
but the more you talked,

967
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,193
the sadder you seemed to leave.

968
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,232
The more you wanted to convince me,

969
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,750
the less sure you became yourself.

970
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,115
You wanted to get away,

971
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,628
in spite of yourself.

972
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,274
You were quite an impressive sight.

973
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,272
It's over, I'm all right now.

974
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,232
All women have moments of despair.

975
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,474
A kind of down feeling.

976
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,080
Their own little whirlwinds.

977
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,759
It's funny. You're a different man now.

978
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,509
You'll see, in Port Said,
there'll only be you and me.

979
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,231
The man you're thinking about...

980
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,714
I'm not thinking about him.

981
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:33,073
Would you go so far away
if you knew you could forget him?

982
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,917
You're thinking about him.

983
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,475
Your whole body thinks about him.
That brooch...

984
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,993
You say "Edmond" and think "Pierre".

985
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,953
I only wear the brooch
because of room 16.

986
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,434
This brooch reminds me he shot me.

987
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,550
I'm not angry with you.

988
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,751
That man must have mattered to you once.

989
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,559
Here, take his brooch.

990
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,399
I'm just going to ask something.

991
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,439
Good morning, my little queen.
Not too tired?

992
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,596
Get to work or you'll be fired.

993
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,394
I miss you out there.
You should come to the lock.

994
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,477
- Who do you think I am?
- My little queen.

995
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,080
Your little queen knows the score.

996
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,556
I'm not after a miniature Edmond.
Go back to work.

997
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,874
My little queen.

998
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,275
- What's the time?
- Two o'clock.

999
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,278
- Disentangler.
- There.

1000
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,794
- Dressing gown.
- There, my little queen.

1001
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,358
- Slippers.
- There, my little queen.

1002
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,394
Tell Renée she can do the room at three.

1003
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,431
Yes, my little queen.

1004
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,756
How rude to barge in like that.
Who dragged you up?

1005
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,112
- Out of here, jackass.
- Didn't I say get back to work?

1006
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,869
I want to have a word
with this man in private.

1007
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,195
Unfinished business.

1008
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,791
What a killer...

1009
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,751
Anyway, he's a good man.

1010
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,069
I'm done with killer men.

1011
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,112
They're afraid work will kill them.

1012
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,958
I'm done sweating it out to get their steak.

1013
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,752
You're getting old.

1014
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,519
- Growing up, that's all.
- I see.

1015
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,677
- Edmond really disgusted you.
- Indeed.

1016
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,190
- Is it true he left?
- Didn't I say so?

1017
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:11,437
Renée double-crossed me. The tart!

1018
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,471
He fell like a ripe plum.

1019
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,318
Be frank. Wasn't Edmond?

1020
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,751
- Yes, I lied. Edmond was Paulo all right.
- Now he's gone.

1021
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,916
- He'll be back.
- How do you know?

1022
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,951
I know him.

1023
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,673
He left with Renée on a slow train.

1024
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,837
She came back yesterday. Express train.

1025
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,031
He's not used to losing parcels en route.

1026
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,389
He'll come to claim his parcel back.

1027
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,396
You think he'll come here?

1028
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,910
Sure of it. If I were you,

1029
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,713
I'd rent a pad here and keep watch.

1030
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,672
When he comes, just stoop to pick him up.

1031
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,995
That I will.

1032
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,352
What about that girl? Any good tackling her?

1033
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,915
- Leave her. Plus, she's gone out.
- Where is she?

1034
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,359
Visiting.

1035
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,670
My courage failed at the last moment.

1036
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,471
La Josyane left without me.

1037
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,589
How about him?

1038
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,511
He must have gone on alone.

1039
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,672
At first, I was sincere. I believed in it.

1040
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:24,912
I saw myself living in Port Said,
starting a new life.

1041
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,437
I didn't go because I simply couldn't.

1042
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,836
Something stronger than me
held me back. You.

1043
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,394
Not much of a thing, it wasn't.

1044
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:43,275
What difference does that make?
I tried to hate you, but I couldn't.

1045
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,317
And what's more,
I understand you better now.

1046
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:53,275
Yes. To persuade him to go away,
leaving everything,

1047
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,118
I used the words you did
at the Hotel du Nord.

1048
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,311
I realize that now.

1049
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,511
I used your words to convince him.

1050
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,794
But when I had to let it go,

1051
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,229
when it was almost too late,

1052
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,231
I was frightened too.

1053
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,072
You see,

1054
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,112
we've both jumped ship once, we're quits.

1055
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,517
No...

1056
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,916
You didn't wish him dead.

1057
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,555
It was worse. I gave him hope.

1058
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:52,232
In two days, you're free. Where will you go?

1059
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,553
I've held out and refused to stop loving you.
Maybe I'm selfish.

1060
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,998
Pierre, I need you.

1061
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,231
Do you think...

1062
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,236
we could live together again?

1063
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,311
- And be happy?
- I'm sure we can.

1064
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,316
- Like before?
- Like before.

1065
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,189
Do you feel any remorse? Well, I don't.

1066
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,231
I'm not sorry you ran away.

1067
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,999
I'm not sorry I'm alive.

1068
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:35,273
You wouldn't dare say
you're sorry you missed it. Say it!

1069
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,594
Of course, we can be happy together.

1070
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,474
Lecouvreur, my friend, it's two o'clock.

1071
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,476
Tell them to wrap it up.

1072
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,910
Madame and I can't sleep.

1073
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,350
If they don't stop their racket, I'll move out.

1074
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,473
A hotel with man-snatching tarts,
where you can't sleep!

1075
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,717
Calm down, my little queen.
It's the 14th July.

1076
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,990
I know, the Fall of the Bastille.

1077
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,555
So what good was that?
There are Black Marias now.

1078
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,558
Leave your past behind, my little queen.

1079
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,751
It's either the 14th July or the bugs. I give up.

1080
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,152
Now we'll do the "danse du tapis".

1081
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,152
You're really leaving us tonight, Renée?

1082
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,034
- Are you angry?
- I just wish you weren't going with that boy.

1083
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,435
- I'll come see you.
- That's different.

1084
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,471
You've been so kind.

1085
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,072
- What time do you meet?
- After the dance. I wouldn't let you down.

1086
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,076
I understand.

1087
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,715
No coming back to kill yourself in room 16.

1088
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,957
You say you're getting married.

1089
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,389
Better a good wedding than a bad suicide.

1090
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:07,399
- What are you on about?
- 14th July talk. Right, Renée?

1091
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,716
- Two beers and a soda.
- See? She agrees with me.

1092
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,719
Don't say goodbye when you go.
Pretend you're going shopping.

1093
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:20,076
Then we can imagine
you're coming back any time.

1094
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,999
We enjoyed having you around.
We got used to it.

1095
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:28,272
That's true. If I came down tomorrow
to find the bar gone,

1096
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,117
I'd miss it.

1097
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,031
And I'll miss you too.

1098
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,910
Why didn't you say goodbye?

1099
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,555
I wouldn't have kept you.
I deserved a goodbye.

1100
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,797
- I wanted to say...
- Don't. I understand.

1101
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,070
I've come back a long way.

1102
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,839
Back from Port Said not having been there.

1103
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,791
How beautiful.
There's music for our reunion.

1104
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,798
Don't worry, I bear no grudge.

1105
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,195
I only want to say goodbye properly.

1106
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,995
He's out, isn't he?

1107
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,998
He's been freed. That's it, isn't it?

1108
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,678
He left.

1109
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,154
- Today.
- Have you seen him?

1110
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,555
- Will you see him again?
- Later.

1111
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,875
- After what?
- After the dance.

1112
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,480
- Is he waiting for you?
- Yes.

1113
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,919
He's lucky.

1114
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,910
Thank you for giving me
three days of your life.

1115
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,474
You must believe me,

1116
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,875
I did want you to take me away.

1117
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,717
I intended to go with you.

1118
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,675
I'm sure you did.

1119
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:28,430
We didn't get far,
but at least I traveled a bit. Let's forget it.

1120
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,676
Don't go to your room.

1121
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,109
- Why not?
- Two men are waiting.

1122
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,431
- Oh, yes?
Raymonde told them who you were.

1123
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,072
Oh, yes.

1124
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,874
- Goodbye, Renée.
- Goodbye.

1125
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,396
- I told you my name's Robert.
- Goodbye, Robert.

1126
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,317
Those brats with their firecrackers...

1127
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,352
The sun's rising.

1128
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,391
It'll be a lovely day.

1129
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,433
- Let's go, this is the end.
- Of what?

1130
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,072
Of the Hotel du Nord.

1131
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,355
