1
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:46,306
I remember those cheers,

2
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,504
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:51,447
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,881
'cause one night,

5
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,044
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:57,281
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,958
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:06,225
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,629
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,469
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,802
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve--

12
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:17,876
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,740
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,814
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

15
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,454
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:35,152
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,093
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:41,598
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,669
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,328
That's entertainment.

21
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:54,378
That's entertainment.

22
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,107
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

23
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,682
in the Cleveland Arena.

24
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,809
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

25
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,013
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

26
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:07,388
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

27
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:10,792
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,022
to get beaten by a mulignane?

29
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,031
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,294
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:19,029
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,299
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:23,237
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,310
Just like home--
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,208
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,577
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,746
Help!

38
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,320
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,391
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,188
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

41
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:45,320
La Motta fighting
out of a half crouch.

42
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,421
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

43
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,501
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

44
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:53,162
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

45
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,763
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

46
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,774
The crowd is urging Jake on.

47
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:03,777
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

48
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:06,510
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

49
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:09,519
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

50
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:12,055
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

51
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:15,388
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

52
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:16,961
here in the tenth round.

53
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:21,127
Reeves is up again.
La Motta comes at him.

54
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,396
A left hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

55
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:27,131
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

56
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,231
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

57
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,333
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

58
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,708
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

59
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,804
Two... three...

60
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:38,405
four... five...

61
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:41,008
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

62
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,144
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

63
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,722
...and there is the bell.

64
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:48,915
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

65
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,927
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

66
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,462
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:55,431
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,866
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,837
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,099
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:09,641
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

72
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,383
after ten rounds,

73
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:17,044
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

74
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:21,021
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

75
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:24,152
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

76
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,397
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

77
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:32,868
Jake won that fight!

78
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,906
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

79
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:38,841
You won-- let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:41,640
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

81
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:44,045
but La Motta still lost the fight.

82
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,087
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

83
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,263
Help!

84
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,655
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

85
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:37,257
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:40,304
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:43,636
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:45,676
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

89
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:47,005
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:50,570
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,582
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:55,312
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,751
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,755
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

95
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,688
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,760
He just wants to do
things for himself.

97
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,761
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,763
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,958
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,864
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,869
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:14,632
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,701
They knew.

104
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,243
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:26,710
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

106
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:28,617
The people knew.

107
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:33,054
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,127
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:38,162
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,426
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,991
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,064
Is it done?

113
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,539
No, it's not done.

114
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:54,339
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,574
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,414
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,582
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,750
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,985
Bring it over!

120
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,190
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,699
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,464
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:22,039
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,131
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:25,800
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:27,776
That's-- there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,477
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,552
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:37,486
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,386
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

131
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,981
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:42,617
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,024
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,324
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:48,797
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,402
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,233
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,637
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:58,732
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

140
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,744
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:01,835
Yeah?

142
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,743
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

143
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:09,753
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,686
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,485
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,287
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:19,261
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:21,924
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,331
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:27,030
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,039
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,166
What's the matter with you,
you animals?

153
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:32,834
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:34,935
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:37,173
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,682
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:42,446
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,988
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,287
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:50,861
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:52,827
You son of a bitch!

162
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,991
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,568
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,728
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:01,396
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,406
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:06,306
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,878
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,146
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,153
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,314
What'd I do?

172
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:21,492
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

173
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,992
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:27,597
You can't, I'm telling you--

175
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:30,463
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:32,833
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

177
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:35,202
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:39,073
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:41,145
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:43,873
What's wrong?

181
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,179
Something's the matter,
what's up?

182
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:58,659
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:01,624
My hands.

184
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,298
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:10,801
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,036
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,647
Know what that means?

188
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,908
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:23,476
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:26,820
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,289
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,159
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,199
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,496
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,873
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:47,001
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:50,878
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:52,108
It's not normal.

199
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,951
Do me a favor.

200
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,854
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,424
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,427
Forget about it.

203
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,658
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

204
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,759
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,304
We have fights all the time--
are you worried now?

206
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:15,532
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,971
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,064
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,474
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

210
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,414
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:27,747
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,921
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,484
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,493
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,392
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,167
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,836
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,765
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,569
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,373
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,608
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:02,949
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,783
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:06,186
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,385
with everything you got. I want you
to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:10,461
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:11,824
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,023
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,794
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,562
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,467
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:21,834
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:24,339
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:25,704
- That's enough with that--
- Take it off.

235
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,936
Come on.

236
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,171
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,871
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,608
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:32,808
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,714
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,481
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:40,115
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:57,736
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,280
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,615
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,184
How you doin'?

247
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,923
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:18,988
Joey.

249
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:20,990
Come here.

250
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:27,498
Looks mad.

252
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:30,039
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,075
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:34,437
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,343
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:39,643
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,844
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

258
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:42,920
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,158
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:06,269
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,708
Hey, Jake, watch you
don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,546
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:19,054
Anybody bothers you,
let me know, okay?

264
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:21,022
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

265
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,253
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:27,490
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:30,534
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:34,297
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,399
Is that what youse talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:39,602
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,609
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, you hear me?

272
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:43,772
What are ya,

273
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:46,442
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

274
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,917
What the fuck

275
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,011
Yeah, yeah,

276
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,919
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,365
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,448
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:24,381
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,049
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:35,765
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:36,834
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

283
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:38,402
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:44,473
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:46,635
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,678
What's her last name?

287
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,272
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,645
She knows them?

289
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:59,723
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:02,486
Everybody knows each other--
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:04,721
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,195
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:09,061
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,262
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

295
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,429
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

296
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,271
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,072
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:22,408
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,947
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,539
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,176
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:32,120
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,851
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's--

304
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,928
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about-- she's not like that.

305
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,623
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

306
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:41,960
You know, it's...

307
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,299
D'you bang her?

308
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,462
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:50,006
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,076
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:55,270
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,711
I took her out
a couple of times.

313
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:01,182
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:03,344
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:05,752
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,518
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,855
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:11,619
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:13,697
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:15,595
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,502
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,537
- That's--
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,367
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,462
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:24,871
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:27,376
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,776
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,873
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,943
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:38,648
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:43,191
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,130
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,595
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:51,961
Big shot.

335
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,302
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot--

336
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:57,704
without his gun.

337
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,641
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:06,483
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:10,145
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:14,156
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:19,655
Big shot.

342
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,330
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:28,564
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:30,900
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,999
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,170
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,906
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:37,981
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,845
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:41,077
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:42,652
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:44,779
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:47,119
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,455
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,996
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

356
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:55,463
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,693
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

358
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,235
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:01,100
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:02,797
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:05,307
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,207
You and your fuckin' ass--
you, too ya-- go out!

363
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:10,940
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:12,413
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:15,418
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,181
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:26,789
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:29,992
Jack.

369
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,309
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:41,935
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,707
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:45,442
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,780
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:50,285
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,789
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,058
- Hello, Joe, how you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:05,157
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,601
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:10,970
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:13,475
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:15,910
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:17,776
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,316
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,046
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:25,881
D'you put money
in the basket this week?

386
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,673
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,074
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:55,376
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:56,453
Go ahead.

390
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,597
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:47,170
Get out! Get out!

392
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,568
You, too, get out.

393
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:51,369
Get outta here,
ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,875
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:58,274
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:09,182
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:12,228
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,424
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,125
D'you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:20,032
- No, Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:23,468
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:26,969
There.

403
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,748
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:39,982
Hi.

405
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:41,817
How you doin'?

406
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:45,488
Nice to meet you.

407
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:52,267
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:54,236
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:05,441
Where you from?

410
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,077
Around here.

411
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:12,149
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,959
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:21,290
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:22,923
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:24,160
Okay.

416
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,636
Move over.

417
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:48,585
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:52,150
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:56,031
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:57,259
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:59,029
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,535
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,110
You see it?

424
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,147
No.

425
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:35,471
What does that mean?

426
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:38,474
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,807
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:45,145
Daddy?

429
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,921
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,894
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

431
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:11,797
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

432
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,615
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:20,513
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:32,459
Salute.

435
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:51,906
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:56,082
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:17,167
Come here,
come here.

438
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,242
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,106
Come on,
come up from there.

440
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,041
That's better.

441
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,652
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,156
Some water?

443
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,334
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

444
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:50,665
All right.

445
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:53,242
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:54,470
Oh, yeah?

447
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:58,911
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:01,577
What else?

449
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:11,090
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:14,764
That's a bird.

451
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:17,333
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,107
The restroom.

453
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:41,813
Sit down.

454
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:05,474
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:06,879
I know.

456
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:09,683
You look good, though.

457
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:17,660
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:19,655
I don't know.

459
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:28,000
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,837
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:33,705
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

462
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:13,748
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

463
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,079
for their second fight.

464
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:17,153
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

465
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:19,814
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

466
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:22,492
You can see the contrast
in their styles--

467
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:25,756
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

468
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:28,889
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

469
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,796
Now he's hurt Robinson.

470
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:34,161
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

471
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,364
both hands to the head,
a left and a right to the jaw.

472
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:39,203
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

473
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:43,075
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point. 10-rounder.

474
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,240
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

475
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,841
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

476
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:51,286
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose.

477
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:54,516
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

478
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,526
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

479
00:31:57,628 --> 00:31:59,687
for the first knockdown of his career.

480
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,926
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

481
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:16,744
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

482
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:20,146
The undefeated Sugar Ray--
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

483
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,378
La Motta coming at him again.
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

484
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,421
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:38,399
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

486
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:43,400
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

487
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,177
La Motta has won the fight!

488
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:49,108
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull.

489
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:51,738
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

490
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:55,546
his first loss as a professional,
and Robinson doesn't like it.

491
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:58,815
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

492
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:01,857
the impossible--
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

493
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,120
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

494
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,753
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

495
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:13,800
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:15,729
Come here.

497
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,307
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:22,641
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:25,146
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,142
Come here.

501
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:38,654
Come here.

502
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:48,702
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:33:56,046 --> 00:33:57,138
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:33:57,247 --> 00:34:00,114
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:02,114
Make it better.

506
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:19,658
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,968
You know how to
take off my pants?

508
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,555
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:46,629
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,856
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:06,775
Take off your panties.

512
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,065
I like the gym smell.

513
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,423
What?

514
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:02,836
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:32,627
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,971
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:40,636
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:14,167
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:14,277 --> 00:37:16,404
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:55,013
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

521
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:56,449
meet for the third time.

522
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:59,954
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

523
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:02,684
These two men--
fierce, powerful fighters,

524
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:06,126
dangerous-- so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

525
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:09,164
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

526
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:10,597
They've each won one,

527
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,931
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

528
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:17,002
They go to close quarters at the bell.

529
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,540
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points,

530
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:26,445
La Motta may need a knockout.

531
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:29,379
The left hook to the jaw,

532
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:32,478
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

533
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,784
He was down
in the last fight, too.

534
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:38,156
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

535
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,923
- Robinson trying to get up.
- ...six... seven...

536
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:43,261
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

537
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:46,358
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

538
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:49,127
La Motta comes at him.

539
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,572
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

540
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:56,373
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

541
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,745
Your attention, fans.

542
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,511
Judge Joe Lanahan

543
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:05,418
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

544
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:08,082
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

545
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,419
Boo! Boo!

546
00:39:09,526 --> 00:39:12,427
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

547
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:15,760
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

548
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:19,302
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

549
00:39:19,402 --> 00:39:22,894
Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:25,474
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'--

551
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:32,645
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,208
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:37,912
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

554
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,785
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

555
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:43,416
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:45,892
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

557
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:47,520
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:52,935
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:57,071
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:59,435
Forget about all that shit--
this was your shot.

561
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,171
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:05,510
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:09,951
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:18,324
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

565
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:19,588
You sure?

566
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:22,221
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

567
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:49,596
Yeah, child. I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

568
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,835
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,000
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,044
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:43:56,146 --> 00:43:58,376
Look at that-- 168 pounds.

572
00:43:58,481 --> 00:44:00,676
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:02,944
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:04,144
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:04,254 --> 00:44:07,155
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:07,257 --> 00:44:09,122
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:11,056
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:13,220
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:15,695
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:18,790
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:21,063
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:22,695
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:25,706
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you--

584
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:27,400
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,570
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,205
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

587
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:35,580
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:39,985
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:42,489
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:45,117
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:46,490
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:49,929
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:51,694
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:53,666
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,670
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:44:55,772 --> 00:44:58,138
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:44:58,241 --> 00:44:59,936
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:01,772
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:01,878 --> 00:45:03,607
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:05,476
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

601
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:08,710
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:11,912
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,045
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:13,156 --> 00:45:15,215
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:16,292
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:18,656
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:22,026
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:24,656
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:27,463
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

610
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,798
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:29,963
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:30,073 --> 00:45:32,371
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:33,999
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,305
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:37,777
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,075
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:41,775
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:44,648
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:47,314
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:50,915
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

621
00:45:51,027 --> 00:45:54,656
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:56,664
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:45:56,766 --> 00:45:58,996
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:45:59,102 --> 00:46:00,660
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,738
- You beat him now--
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:04,773
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:07,274
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win--
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:08,867
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:12,175
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:14,079
- Nothin'--
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:17,209
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:20,816
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:23,858
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

634
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,188
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:28,097 --> 00:46:29,564
Who asked you?

636
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:31,327
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,402
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:37,132
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,605
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:41,302
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:41,411 --> 00:46:44,744
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,407
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:50,281
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:54,311
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:00,492
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds--

646
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:02,530
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:02,632 --> 00:47:05,931
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:08,833
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:11,600
- your usual diet--
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,609
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:16,440
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:16,546 --> 00:47:17,877
Like what?

653
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,948
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:20,817 --> 00:47:23,115
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:25,278
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

656
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:27,356
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:27,457 --> 00:47:30,255
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,295
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:34,727
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:34,831 --> 00:47:37,493
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

661
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,467
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,061
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:44,400
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:47,840
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:47:47,944 --> 00:47:49,571
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,240
and you tell her, "What are you--?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:55,817
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,010
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:47:59,122 --> 00:48:01,317
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't--

670
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:04,393
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:04,494 --> 00:48:05,552
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:05,661 --> 00:48:07,356
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:08,725
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:09,798
All right.

675
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,269
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,928
Make up with her.

677
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:18,131
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

678
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:20,004
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

679
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:21,508
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:22,600
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:25,010
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:25,114 --> 00:48:26,081
All right?

683
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:29,210
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,878
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

685
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:35,287
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:37,552
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,651
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:39,762 --> 00:48:41,923
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:44,864
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:50,598
Come here.

691
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:17,866
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,094
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:20,203 --> 00:49:21,534
What a great audience.

694
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:24,606
Come on, lady, laugh it up--
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:29,536
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:33,547
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:36,345
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

698
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:39,944
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:47,160
What's your name again?

700
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,754
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:52,663
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,768
He hits me with a left hook--
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:02,307
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:08,114
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:09,878
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:11,146
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:12,721
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:14,551
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:16,147
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:17,749
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,986
See ya later.

712
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:24,723
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:26,392
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:30,165
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:32,503
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

716
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:33,734
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:35,037
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:37,704
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:39,371
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:41,143
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:47,080
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:50:47,723 --> 00:50:50,351
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:55,925
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,967
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:04,539
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,766
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,173
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:11,144
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:13,340
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:17,180
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:21,086
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,055
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:29,895
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:33,230
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:37,166
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:40,742
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:43,812
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

738
00:51:43,913 --> 00:51:46,006
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:46,716 --> 00:51:48,946
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:52,179
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:55,016
Are you interested in him?

742
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:57,115
No, why would I be
interested in him?

743
00:51:57,226 --> 00:51:59,126
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:00,195
Yeah.

745
00:52:01,564 --> 00:52:04,192
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

746
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,667
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,898
What do you gotta--? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:12,702
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:12,808 --> 00:52:15,436
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,512
Shall I take the...?

751
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,942
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:24,952
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:27,614
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:27,723 --> 00:52:31,716
I tell ya the truth, it's so--
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:37,995
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,727
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:41,598
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:41,704 --> 00:52:44,104
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:49,869
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:54,372
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:56,383
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:52:56,485 --> 00:52:59,784
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:03,381
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:05,925
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

765
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:09,293
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:12,128
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,464
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,538
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes.

769
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:19,107
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

770
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,438
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:24,274
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,644
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:28,541
I think he should.

774
00:53:29,018 --> 00:53:31,316
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,479
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,682
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,816
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:40,529 --> 00:53:42,929
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:43,032 --> 00:53:45,762
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

780
00:53:45,868 --> 00:53:47,631
Right off, right off.

781
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:53,205
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:57,109
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:53:57,213 --> 00:53:59,579
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:53:59,682 --> 00:54:00,808
Yeah?

785
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:04,786
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,855
I would say
bet everything you got.

787
00:54:07,389 --> 00:54:09,186
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:11,956
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

789
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:13,688
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:17,698
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,963
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,470
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:23,572 --> 00:54:26,507
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:28,167
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:31,405
I don't know, I got a problem--
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:36,550
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,917
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:40,022 --> 00:54:41,580
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,749
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:44,883
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:44,994 --> 00:54:47,622
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:48,697
How you gonna do that?

803
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:50,993
I'll get youse both in the ring
and give youse both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,658
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,861
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,241
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,004
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

808
00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:05,737
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:44,610
Hey, Vick.

810
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:50,856
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:52,986
No.

812
00:55:55,464 --> 00:55:58,399
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,770
You ever think
of anybody else...

814
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,107
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:12,705
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:14,316 --> 00:56:16,375
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:18,254 --> 00:56:20,552
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

818
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:24,956
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:26,161 --> 00:56:27,924
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:31,132
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:32,835 --> 00:56:36,464
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:38,636
Go to sleep.

823
00:57:55,006 --> 00:57:58,464
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:01,346 --> 00:58:04,838
And the winner
by unanimous decision

825
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,613
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:33,445 --> 00:58:36,744
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:40,147
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,749
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:44,656 --> 00:58:46,055
Four pounds.

830
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,151
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:58,960
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it--

832
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,163
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:03,570
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:06,303
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:08,572
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,409
I don't know.
You never know these things--

837
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:13,245
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,279
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:16,718
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:18,721
Pleasure-- heard a lot
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:18,823 --> 00:59:20,154
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

842
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:23,125
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:24,923
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,260
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:29,061
Whatever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:31,795
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:33,393
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:34,802
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:36,601
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,005
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:40,270
He's workin' downtown,
big building-- workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:40,378 --> 00:59:41,709
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:41,813 --> 00:59:44,247
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:46,078
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:46,184 --> 00:59:48,209
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,877
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

857
00:59:49,988 --> 00:59:52,923
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

858
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:54,048
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:55,683
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
00:59:55,794 --> 00:59:57,819
Come on back. Okay.

861
00:59:59,831 --> 01:00:01,298
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:02,593
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:06,068
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:08,401
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:08,506 --> 01:00:12,101
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,973
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of youse are the same.

867
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,068
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,172
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:19,017 --> 01:00:20,814
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:22,318
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,149
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:24,255 --> 01:00:26,348
and havin' both of youse
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:29,223
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:29,327 --> 01:00:30,794
- Don't make me--
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:33,955
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:35,191
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,494
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:39,365
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:41,132
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:44,208
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:46,934
He's just been
a contender too long.

882
01:00:47,045 --> 01:00:50,173
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:52,943
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:55,417
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,045
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,954
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:07,125
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:07,232 --> 01:01:08,221
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,301
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,629
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:13,431
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

892
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:16,132
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:16,241 --> 01:01:18,141
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:18,243 --> 01:01:20,370
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:23,908
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:27,382
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:27,485 --> 01:01:28,577
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:31,280
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:32,378
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:33,787
We're friends,
we can straighten this--

901
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:36,555
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:39,789
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:46,531
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:46,638 --> 01:01:49,801
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:52,809
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:55,513
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:01:55,613 --> 01:01:57,376
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:00,430
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:02,762
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,168
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:11,201
Hey, you fuckin'--
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,335
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:14,504
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:16,445
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,574
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,119
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

917
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:29,923
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:30,897 --> 01:02:32,626
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:37,131
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

920
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:57,749
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

921
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,882
and you've done
a lot of things together.

922
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,587
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:03,463
But you don't raise your hands,

924
01:03:03,498 --> 01:03:04,293
But you don't raise your hands,

925
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:07,729
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

926
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,564
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

927
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,831
and we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:16,397
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

929
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,169
Right?

930
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:20,337
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

931
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:23,541
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

932
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,174
and no grudges.

933
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:28,083
That's the most important thing--
no grudges.

934
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,852
Now, come on, shake hands.

935
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,030
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

936
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:39,257
All right?

937
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:42,293
I only wish this thing
never happened.

938
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,233
We all wish it never happened.

939
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:47,465
Right?
You'll get over it.

940
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:50,702
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

941
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:51,936
Yeah, all right.

942
01:03:54,113 --> 01:03:56,411
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

943
01:03:56,516 --> 01:03:58,541
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

944
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,883
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

945
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:09,660
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

946
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,526
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

947
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,328
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

948
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,962
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

949
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:23,338
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

950
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:27,506
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

951
01:04:28,715 --> 01:04:30,774
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

952
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:32,249
No, it's nothin' like that.

953
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:35,253
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

954
01:04:35,822 --> 01:04:37,289
all the fights and all.

955
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:41,492
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

956
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:45,022
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

957
01:04:45,732 --> 01:04:48,860
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

958
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,232
and I'm lookin' very bad.

959
01:04:51,905 --> 01:04:55,204
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

960
01:04:55,742 --> 01:04:56,800
What is it with him?

961
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,879
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

962
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,607
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

963
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:07,712
The man's got a head of rock.

964
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:15,156
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

965
01:05:15,862 --> 01:05:17,159
Jack respects you.

966
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:19,731
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

967
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,130
You he talks to, he likes you.

968
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:26,230
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

969
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,331
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

970
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:31,808
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

971
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:34,345
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

972
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:37,473
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

973
01:05:37,584 --> 01:05:38,881
Make it on his own.

974
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:44,048
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

975
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:47,624
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

976
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:51,128
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

977
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:52,527
That's not crazy.

978
01:05:52,632 --> 01:05:56,033
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

979
01:05:56,135 --> 01:05:58,262
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

980
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:03,570
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

981
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:05,303
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

982
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:07,436
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

983
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:11,108
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

984
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:14,044
Now, you're a smart kid.

985
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,547
You go to him, you tell him...

986
01:06:21,694 --> 01:06:22,991
Son of a bitch.

987
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,657
Twenty dollar shoe here.

988
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:34,840
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

989
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:40,171
What's the matter?

990
01:06:42,882 --> 01:06:45,510
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

991
01:06:46,552 --> 01:06:48,679
- Who?
- Vickie.

992
01:06:51,724 --> 01:06:54,693
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

993
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:00,966
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

994
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:02,193
Just once.

995
01:07:05,805 --> 01:07:08,774
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

996
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:11,538
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

997
01:07:12,078 --> 01:07:14,638
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

998
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:16,544
'cause that's what's happenin'.

999
01:07:19,352 --> 01:07:22,321
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

1000
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:33,756
So, what'd that guy say?

1001
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:37,329
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1002
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,928
The good news is

1003
01:07:39,038 --> 01:07:41,165
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

1004
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:45,506
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

1005
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:48,603
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1006
01:07:48,715 --> 01:07:50,148
You didn't know that was comin'?

1007
01:07:51,217 --> 01:07:52,878
You win some,
you lose some.

1008
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,452
This one, we're losin'.

1009
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:57,915
Billy Fox.

1010
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:02,258
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1011
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:09,131
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1012
01:08:09,235 --> 01:08:12,500
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

1013
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,338
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1014
01:08:16,442 --> 01:08:18,808
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1015
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:20,902
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1016
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,811
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1017
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:24,974
and It's not good.

1018
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:27,052
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1019
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:28,984
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1020
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:32,922
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1021
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,220
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1022
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,492
You got any money
you wanna bet?

1023
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:39,155
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1024
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:42,063
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1025
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,500
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1026
01:08:44,604 --> 01:08:46,401
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1027
01:08:46,506 --> 01:08:47,973
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1028
01:08:48,074 --> 01:08:49,564
Okay, that's it.

1029
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:51,006
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

1030
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,805
- That was it?
- That was it.

1031
01:09:03,256 --> 01:09:04,848
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:07,858
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

1033
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,053
feature attraction.

1034
01:09:10,163 --> 01:09:14,725
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1035
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:16,631
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

1036
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:20,536
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

1037
01:09:24,343 --> 01:09:26,402
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

1038
01:09:26,512 --> 01:09:29,504
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1039
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:33,785
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1040
01:09:35,188 --> 01:09:37,884
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1041
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,423
It's all right, yeah.

1042
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:41,186
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

1043
01:09:41,294 --> 01:09:43,091
Five seconds, Alex.

1044
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:58,404
Come on, stand--
come on, stand up!

1045
01:09:58,511 --> 01:10:01,207
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1046
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:03,007
Come on.

1047
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:07,050
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1048
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:18,693
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

1049
01:10:19,232 --> 01:10:21,291
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1050
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,697
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1051
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,362
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1052
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,634
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1053
01:10:28,741 --> 01:10:32,302
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1054
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:34,641
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1055
01:10:35,248 --> 01:10:37,409
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1056
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:38,813
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1057
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:42,687
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1058
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,315
Pocket your dirty money!

1059
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,488
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1060
01:10:50,596 --> 01:10:52,154
We're stoppin' the fight!

1061
01:10:52,732 --> 01:10:56,031
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1062
01:10:56,602 --> 01:10:57,660
And you standin' there.

1063
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:00,762
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1064
01:11:00,873 --> 01:11:05,572
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1065
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:09,079
The winner
by technical knockout,

1066
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,342
and still undefeated,

1067
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,442
Billy Fox!

1068
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:17,689
What'd I do?!

1069
01:11:29,902 --> 01:11:30,960
Don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,868
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1071
01:11:35,241 --> 01:11:39,041
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1072
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,577
What'd I do?

1073
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:54,559
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview--

1074
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:59,564
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1075
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,068
Why did I do it? Why?

1076
01:12:09,675 --> 01:12:11,973
They got some balls,
some balls.

1077
01:12:13,212 --> 01:12:15,339
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1078
01:12:15,881 --> 01:12:17,439
They want me
to go down, too?

1079
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,018
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1080
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:22,747
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1081
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:25,153
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1082
01:12:26,392 --> 01:12:30,192
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1083
01:12:31,297 --> 01:12:33,857
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1084
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:36,867
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1085
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:38,596
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1086
01:12:38,704 --> 01:12:40,797
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

1087
01:12:40,906 --> 01:12:42,601
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1088
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:44,938
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1089
01:12:45,745 --> 01:12:47,269
I don't know.

1090
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,406
"Purse was withheld--" look at this--
"Purse was withheld pending

1091
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:52,575
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1092
01:12:52,685 --> 01:12:55,279
Look how they make me look.

1093
01:12:55,388 --> 01:12:57,413
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

1094
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,057
A what?

1095
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:01,422
Like the mammalucco of the year.

1096
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:03,154
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1097
01:13:03,996 --> 01:13:06,556
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1098
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:09,758
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1099
01:13:09,869 --> 01:13:11,427
What are you talkin' about?

1100
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:13,437
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1101
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:14,767
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1102
01:13:14,874 --> 01:13:16,933
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1103
01:13:17,043 --> 01:13:18,943
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

1104
01:13:19,045 --> 01:13:20,808
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1105
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:22,847
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1106
01:13:22,948 --> 01:13:25,849
- is if he dies, he won't be able to--
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1107
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:36,117
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1108
01:13:36,228 --> 01:13:39,026
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

1109
01:13:39,131 --> 01:13:40,723
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1110
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,868
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1111
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:47,029
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1112
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,800
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1113
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:52,468
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

1114
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:54,876
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1115
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:57,141
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

1116
01:13:57,249 --> 01:13:59,809
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1117
01:13:59,919 --> 01:14:03,218
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1118
01:14:03,322 --> 01:14:05,313
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1119
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:08,052
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1120
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,060
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1121
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:12,289
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:13,958
I don't want nothin'.

1123
01:14:14,066 --> 01:14:16,034
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1124
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,672
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1125
01:14:20,773 --> 01:14:23,674
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1126
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,809
You're worried about that?

1127
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,345
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1128
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,349
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1129
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:34,885
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1130
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:37,452
Order me a piece of cake.

1131
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,456
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

1132
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:43,187
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

1133
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:45,286
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1134
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,864
That's good,
order me one of those.

1135
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:48,900
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

1136
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:51,231
Since when did you
order one of those?

1137
01:14:52,004 --> 01:14:53,733
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1138
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:55,966
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1139
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,202
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1140
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:00,244
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1141
01:15:00,346 --> 01:15:03,474
I'm not tellin' her-- personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1142
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,210
What were you tellin' her that for?

1143
01:15:06,318 --> 01:15:08,218
Order me a cheeseburger.

1144
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:13,784
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

1145
01:15:14,994 --> 01:15:16,222
What the f--?

1146
01:15:16,328 --> 01:15:19,422
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1147
01:15:19,532 --> 01:15:20,499
Forty seconds.

1148
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,159
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1149
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,396
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1150
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,001
Ya up?

1151
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:34,012
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1152
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:36,512
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1153
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,912
How are you?

1154
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:45,353
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1155
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:48,085
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1156
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:49,924
Thank you.

1157
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:53,998
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1158
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:57,193
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,771
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1160
01:15:59,872 --> 01:16:02,966
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1161
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:04,542
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1162
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,008
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1163
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:07,078
No, thank you, Tommy.

1164
01:16:07,179 --> 01:16:09,238
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1165
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:11,043
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1166
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,448
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1167
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:15,515
See you later, everybody.

1168
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:17,486
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1169
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:20,058
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1170
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,320
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1171
01:16:22,428 --> 01:16:25,295
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1172
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:27,695
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1173
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,633
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

1174
01:16:30,736 --> 01:16:33,000
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1175
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:35,835
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1176
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:36,930
Good-bye, honey.

1177
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:40,576
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1178
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,340
Can you believe that girl?

1179
01:16:42,448 --> 01:16:44,780
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1180
01:16:44,883 --> 01:16:47,078
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1181
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,644
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1182
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:02,029
Hey! Come here.

1183
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:04,098
Come here a minute.

1184
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,137
What was all that about?

1185
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:14,870
All what?

1186
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,743
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1187
01:17:18,517 --> 01:17:21,486
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1188
01:17:21,587 --> 01:17:23,680
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

1189
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:25,484
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1190
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:27,957
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1191
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,527
- I hear.
- Hey!

1192
01:17:30,129 --> 01:17:32,757
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

1193
01:17:32,865 --> 01:17:34,492
You hear what I said?

1194
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,866
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

1195
01:17:39,772 --> 01:17:41,740
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1196
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,467
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1197
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,009
Shut up! I'll fuckin'
take care of you later!

1198
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,237
Shut up!

1199
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:58,122
Disgusted with the two of youse.

1200
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:04,060
Get to youse later.

1201
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,669
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1202
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:16,003
Hit the fuckin' thing, come on!

1203
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:19,340
All right, let's go.

1204
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:51,869
Good luck, Jake!

1205
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:36,283
For the Middleweight Championship
of the World, 15 rounds.

1206
01:19:36,388 --> 01:19:39,949
In this corner,
the very worthy challenger,

1207
01:19:40,058 --> 01:19:43,494
weighing in at 158 1/4 pounds,

1208
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:47,895

1209
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:56,373
Shake hands,

1210
01:20:18,263 --> 01:20:19,594
Kill him!

1211
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,029
Pressure, pressure, pressure!

1212
01:20:38,717 --> 01:20:42,175
Now finish him off.
He's all stupiada. you got him.

1213
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:43,847
Come on, Jake!

1214
01:20:45,557 --> 01:20:47,991
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall
right over for ya.

1215
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,755
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

1216
01:20:53,565 --> 01:20:55,396
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

1217
01:20:56,068 --> 01:20:58,866
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1218
01:20:58,971 --> 01:21:00,438
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

1219
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:15,646
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1220
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:20,257
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

1221
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,589
And the winner by
a technical knockout

1222
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:24,093
in the tenth round,

1223
01:21:24,196 --> 01:21:26,960
and the new
Middleweight Champion of the World,

1224
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,828
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

1225
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:37,408
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1226
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:58,023
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

1227
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,825
It's the worst thing you could do.

1228
01:22:05,237 --> 01:22:06,534
Oh, you're home.

1229
01:22:07,573 --> 01:22:09,973
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

1230
01:22:12,744 --> 01:22:15,144
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

1231
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:18,148
I went out.
What's the matter?

1232
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,717
Television won't work.

1233
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:22,076
Where'd you go?

1234
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:26,487
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1235
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:41,396
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1236
01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:43,565
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1237
01:22:43,675 --> 01:22:45,199
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

1238
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,277
Come on, huh?

1239
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,936
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1240
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,638
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

1241
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:51,682
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

1242
01:22:51,783 --> 01:22:53,410
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1243
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,656
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1244
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,790
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1245
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:10,992
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

1246
01:23:13,839 --> 01:23:16,637
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1247
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,539
That's it, go ahead--
forget how long it took you

1248
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:20,737
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1249
01:23:20,846 --> 01:23:23,576
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1250
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:26,977
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1251
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:33,150
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1252
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:36,250
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1253
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:39,190
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

1254
01:23:39,297 --> 01:23:41,527
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1255
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:43,567
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1256
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:45,669
- Didn't I?
- No.

1257
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,171
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1258
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:49,604
It was no big thing, anyway.

1259
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:52,506
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1260
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,806
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1261
01:23:54,913 --> 01:23:56,904
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1262
01:23:57,015 --> 01:23:59,108
How come you
never told me about it?

1263
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:01,447
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

1264
01:24:03,055 --> 01:24:04,920
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1265
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:08,754
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with-- Vickie?

1266
01:24:09,394 --> 01:24:12,295
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1267
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,388
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1268
01:24:14,499 --> 01:24:17,900
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1269
01:24:21,173 --> 01:24:22,800
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1270
01:24:22,908 --> 01:24:24,398
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1271
01:24:24,509 --> 01:24:26,477
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1272
01:24:26,578 --> 01:24:28,136
I heard some things.

1273
01:24:28,847 --> 01:24:31,441
- You heard about me and Salvy--
- I heard things, Joey.

1274
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:34,075
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

1275
01:24:34,186 --> 01:24:36,086
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1276
01:24:36,188 --> 01:24:37,280
I heard some things.

1277
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:39,880
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1278
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,424
You know what
you should worry about?

1279
01:24:41,526 --> 01:24:44,586
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1280
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,623
Do that.

1281
01:24:50,402 --> 01:24:51,528
Christ!

1282
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:58,808
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1283
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:00,502
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1284
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:04,881
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

1285
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:06,951
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1286
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:10,112
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1287
01:25:10,222 --> 01:25:11,655
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

1288
01:25:11,757 --> 01:25:14,055
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1289
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,786
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1290
01:25:15,894 --> 01:25:18,829
- He thinks he's a wiseguy--
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1291
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:20,955
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1292
01:25:21,066 --> 01:25:22,624
Hey, I'm your brother.

1293
01:25:22,734 --> 01:25:24,793
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1294
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:26,393
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1295
01:25:26,505 --> 01:25:29,440
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1296
01:25:30,442 --> 01:25:34,640
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1297
01:25:34,746 --> 01:25:37,180
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1298
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:40,046
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1299
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:47,855
You give me
that look, Joey.

1300
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,527
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

1301
01:25:53,632 --> 01:25:55,600
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1302
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:58,362
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1303
01:25:59,371 --> 01:26:02,738
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1304
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:04,274
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

1305
01:26:04,376 --> 01:26:06,674
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1306
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:08,643
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1307
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:11,580
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1308
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:13,583
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1309
01:26:13,685 --> 01:26:15,585
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1310
01:26:15,687 --> 01:26:19,783
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1311
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:21,916
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1312
01:26:22,027 --> 01:26:24,962
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1313
01:26:25,063 --> 01:26:27,293
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

1314
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:30,232
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1315
01:26:30,335 --> 01:26:32,769
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1316
01:26:32,871 --> 01:26:35,396
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1317
01:26:35,507 --> 01:26:37,907
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you--

1318
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:39,442
you included you with them.

1319
01:26:39,978 --> 01:26:42,970
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1320
01:26:44,015 --> 01:26:46,483
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

1321
01:26:46,585 --> 01:26:49,486
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1322
01:26:49,588 --> 01:26:52,113
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:26:52,257 --> 01:26:54,191
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1324
01:26:57,863 --> 01:26:59,626
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1325
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:01,631
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1326
01:27:01,733 --> 01:27:03,701
You ask me that?

1327
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:07,367
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

1328
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,439
Just tell me.

1329
01:27:17,382 --> 01:27:19,145
I'm not answerin' that.

1330
01:27:19,251 --> 01:27:21,412
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1331
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,219
You're very smart, Joey.

1332
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,793
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1333
01:27:35,734 --> 01:27:37,258
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1334
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,768
Did you or did you not?

1335
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:44,374
I'm not gonna answer.

1336
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:46,410
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1337
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,570
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1338
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,978
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1339
01:27:51,082 --> 01:27:54,051
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1340
01:27:54,152 --> 01:27:56,279
You're a sick bastard--
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1341
01:27:56,388 --> 01:27:57,446
You know what you should do?

1342
01:27:57,555 --> 01:28:00,149
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1343
01:28:00,258 --> 01:28:02,419
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

1344
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,654
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

1345
01:28:04,763 --> 01:28:07,857
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1346
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,669
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1347
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,807
Where were ya?

1348
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:58,280
I was at my sister's.

1349
01:28:58,383 --> 01:29:00,044
Where'd you go after that?

1350
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:04,115
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1351
01:29:06,191 --> 01:29:07,783
Father of the Bride.

1352
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:16,166
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

1353
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:21,171
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1354
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:23,898
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

1355
01:29:25,143 --> 01:29:27,270
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

1356
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:29,347
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1357
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:33,716
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1358
01:29:33,818 --> 01:29:36,252
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1359
01:29:36,354 --> 01:29:37,651
- Huh?
- No!

1360
01:29:44,562 --> 01:29:45,586
Open the door.

1361
01:29:45,697 --> 01:29:47,324
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1362
01:29:47,432 --> 01:29:49,832
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1363
01:29:49,934 --> 01:29:52,494
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1364
01:29:52,604 --> 01:29:53,901
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1365
01:29:54,005 --> 01:29:55,131
No.

1366
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:00,705
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1367
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:02,477
I didn't do anything!

1368
01:30:04,682 --> 01:30:07,651
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1369
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:08,741
I fucked all of 'em!

1370
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:10,980
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1371
01:30:11,089 --> 01:30:13,649
I fucked all of 'em-- Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1372
01:30:13,758 --> 01:30:16,420
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1373
01:30:17,529 --> 01:30:19,326
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1374
01:30:19,431 --> 01:30:21,262
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

1375
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:24,426
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1376
01:30:26,037 --> 01:30:27,504
Forget fuckin' with you!

1377
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:35,308
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

1378
01:30:36,714 --> 01:30:38,375
Where you goin'?

1379
01:30:38,483 --> 01:30:41,043
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

1380
01:30:41,152 --> 01:30:43,017
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1381
01:30:43,121 --> 01:30:47,023
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

1382
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:49,616
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1383
01:30:49,727 --> 01:30:51,627
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

1384
01:30:51,729 --> 01:30:54,357
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1385
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:58,500
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

1386
01:30:58,603 --> 01:31:00,537
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like--

1387
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:03,869
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1388
01:31:03,975 --> 01:31:05,408
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1389
01:31:09,347 --> 01:31:10,541
Get off of him!

1390
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:16,914
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1391
01:31:19,357 --> 01:31:21,086
Call the police!

1392
01:31:23,661 --> 01:31:25,128
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1393
01:31:27,332 --> 01:31:28,458
Get out!

1394
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,511
Don't leave, honey, please.

1395
01:32:56,888 --> 01:33:00,756
Honey, look-- I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

1396
01:33:18,876 --> 01:33:19,968
Just...

1397
01:33:41,132 --> 01:33:43,692
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

1398
01:33:43,801 --> 01:33:46,031
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1399
01:33:46,137 --> 01:33:49,038
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life.

1400
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:52,041
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1401
01:33:52,143 --> 01:33:55,044
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

1402
01:33:55,146 --> 01:33:57,774
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

1403
01:33:58,483 --> 01:34:01,919
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

1404
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:05,421
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

1405
01:34:05,523 --> 01:34:08,014
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

1406
01:34:08,126 --> 01:34:10,788
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

1407
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:13,659
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

1408
01:34:13,765 --> 01:34:16,063
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

1409
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,431
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

1410
01:34:22,106 --> 01:34:25,303
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

1411
01:34:25,843 --> 01:34:28,641
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

1412
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:31,806
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

1413
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,611
Six... seven...

1414
01:34:33,718 --> 01:34:37,210
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

1415
01:34:37,322 --> 01:34:38,346
You're out!

1416
01:34:38,456 --> 01:34:39,787
It is all over!

1417
01:34:39,891 --> 01:34:42,018
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

1418
01:34:42,126 --> 01:34:44,822
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

1419
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:47,397
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

1420
01:34:47,498 --> 01:34:50,160
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

1421
01:34:55,373 --> 01:34:56,499
Come on.

1422
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:59,506
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1423
01:35:04,549 --> 01:35:07,677
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

1424
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:17,559
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1425
01:35:17,662 --> 01:35:20,529
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1426
01:35:33,845 --> 01:35:34,971
Go ahead.

1427
01:35:46,357 --> 01:35:48,325
Hey, champ-- like to ask
you a few questions.

1428
01:35:48,426 --> 01:35:50,826
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1429
01:35:50,928 --> 01:35:53,556
- Excuse me, my wife is--
- There's a great angle here...

1430
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:56,326
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1431
01:35:56,434 --> 01:35:57,662
Come on. All right, champ?

1432
01:35:57,769 --> 01:36:00,499
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya--?

1433
01:36:11,482 --> 01:36:12,608
Hello?

1434
01:36:19,323 --> 01:36:22,121
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

1435
01:36:22,226 --> 01:36:23,284
Is that you?

1436
01:36:23,394 --> 01:36:26,295
I know somebody's there.
I can hear you breathin'.

1437
01:36:26,831 --> 01:36:28,128
You listenin'?

1438
01:36:28,266 --> 01:36:33,033
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

1439
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:34,604
You got that?

1440
01:37:23,221 --> 01:37:24,779
The fight of the year.

1441
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:28,154
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

1442
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,228
give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1443
01:37:34,665 --> 01:37:37,566
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1444
01:37:37,668 --> 01:37:40,899
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1445
01:37:41,005 --> 01:37:45,840
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

1446
01:37:46,511 --> 01:37:49,878
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

1447
01:37:49,981 --> 01:37:52,108
That's it,
that was his last shot.

1448
01:37:54,352 --> 01:37:57,219
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

1449
01:37:57,321 --> 01:37:58,913
There's the buzzer,

1450
01:37:59,023 --> 01:38:01,014
and I think you know
both the boys.

1451
01:38:11,536 --> 01:38:14,198
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

1452
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:20,200
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

1453
01:38:20,878 --> 01:38:23,574
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

1454
01:38:23,681 --> 01:38:26,514
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

1455
01:38:26,617 --> 01:38:28,346
Come on! Come on.

1456
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:37,287
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

1457
01:38:37,395 --> 01:38:40,296
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

1458
01:38:40,398 --> 01:38:42,059
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1459
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:50,831
These are clean, whistling shots.

1460
01:39:50,935 --> 01:39:53,631
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

1461
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,968
No man can endure this pummeling!

1462
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,837
The fight is stopped on...

1463
01:39:58,943 --> 01:40:01,673
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

1464
01:40:01,812 --> 01:40:04,747
Row after row after row
from the ring,

1465
01:40:04,849 --> 01:40:06,373
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1466
01:40:06,484 --> 01:40:09,510
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

1467
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,646
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

1468
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:15,851
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1469
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,087
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

1470
01:40:19,697 --> 01:40:21,221
Never went down, Ray.

1471
01:40:22,366 --> 01:40:24,334
You never got me down, Ray.

1472
01:40:25,202 --> 01:40:26,328
Ya hear me?

1473
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:29,029
Never got me down.

1474
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,574
Yeah? See, look?

1475
01:40:31,676 --> 01:40:34,372
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

1476
01:40:34,478 --> 01:40:37,345
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

1477
01:40:38,215 --> 01:40:39,239
And there you see it...

1478
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:42,519
a champion gone down to defeat.

1479
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,652
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

1480
01:40:45,756 --> 01:40:49,692
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

1481
01:40:50,394 --> 01:40:52,828
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

1482
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:54,363
throughout the world,

1483
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:57,025
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

1484
01:40:57,735 --> 01:41:00,727
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

1485
01:41:00,838 --> 01:41:03,807
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

1486
01:41:03,908 --> 01:41:06,240
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner--

1487
01:41:06,343 --> 01:41:08,311
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1488
01:41:08,412 --> 01:41:12,246
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1489
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:14,249
of the thirteenth round,

1490
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:17,252
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1491
01:41:17,354 --> 01:41:18,753
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1492
01:41:26,931 --> 01:41:28,296
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1493
01:41:28,933 --> 01:41:31,163
It's over for me--
boxing's over for me.

1494
01:41:31,936 --> 01:41:33,028
I'm through.

1495
01:41:34,371 --> 01:41:35,998
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1496
01:41:36,107 --> 01:41:39,167
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1497
01:41:39,276 --> 01:41:41,710
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1498
01:41:41,812 --> 01:41:44,212
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1499
01:41:44,315 --> 01:41:46,715
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1500
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:50,679
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1501
01:41:52,389 --> 01:41:54,880
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1502
01:41:54,992 --> 01:41:56,186
Take a picture, Bob.

1503
01:41:56,727 --> 01:41:58,957
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey-- for us.

1504
01:41:59,063 --> 01:42:00,690
Go ahead, smile.

1505
01:42:02,933 --> 01:42:04,127
Thank you, Bob.

1506
01:42:04,235 --> 01:42:07,033
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1507
01:42:11,308 --> 01:42:13,606
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1508
01:42:16,313 --> 01:42:18,679
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1509
01:42:18,783 --> 01:42:20,011
I think it's great.

1510
01:42:20,117 --> 01:42:22,449
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

1511
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:24,350
He's home with us
all the time now.

1512
01:42:24,488 --> 01:42:26,581
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1513
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:29,250
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1514
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,521
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

1515
01:42:31,629 --> 01:42:34,860
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1516
01:42:34,965 --> 01:42:35,932
I don't know.

1517
01:42:36,033 --> 01:42:37,830
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1518
01:42:50,548 --> 01:42:52,345
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1519
01:42:54,385 --> 01:42:55,374
Thank you.

1520
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:03,753
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

1521
01:43:03,861 --> 01:43:06,227
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1522
01:43:13,671 --> 01:43:14,968
See how that sounds.

1523
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,507
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1524
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:19,769
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1525
01:43:19,877 --> 01:43:21,344
at Madison Square Garden.

1526
01:43:24,014 --> 01:43:25,481
Okay, honey.

1527
01:43:26,684 --> 01:43:28,151
Thank you, doll.

1528
01:43:29,019 --> 01:43:31,146
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1529
01:43:31,255 --> 01:43:32,882
- Salute.
- Salute.

1530
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,225
Look at this terrific girl.

1531
01:43:37,328 --> 01:43:39,660
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

1532
01:43:39,763 --> 01:43:42,061
especially if he's a degenerate.

1533
01:43:43,367 --> 01:43:44,493
Did I say that?

1534
01:43:46,837 --> 01:43:49,897
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1535
01:43:50,007 --> 01:43:52,737
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

1536
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:55,141
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

1537
01:43:57,715 --> 01:44:00,741
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1538
01:44:00,851 --> 01:44:02,045
you're all full of shit.

1539
01:44:05,556 --> 01:44:07,922
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

1540
01:44:08,025 --> 01:44:10,255
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1541
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:14,930
Is she here?
She's not here.

1542
01:44:15,032 --> 01:44:16,863
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1543
01:44:16,967 --> 01:44:19,629
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate--

1544
01:44:19,737 --> 01:44:22,205
it's a little different--
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1545
01:44:22,907 --> 01:44:24,534
Thank you.

1546
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,871
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

1547
01:44:27,978 --> 01:44:29,878
One was married,
one was single.

1548
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:32,380
The married guy
tells the single guy,

1549
01:44:32,483 --> 01:44:34,212
"What's the matter with you?

1550
01:44:34,385 --> 01:44:36,478
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1551
01:44:36,587 --> 01:44:39,385
And look at me,
and look at you."

1552
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:43,826
Let me get on with it.

1553
01:44:44,461 --> 01:44:46,520
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1554
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:48,063
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1555
01:44:48,165 --> 01:44:50,292
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

1556
01:44:50,401 --> 01:44:52,392
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

1557
01:44:52,503 --> 01:44:54,403
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

1558
01:44:54,505 --> 01:44:56,234
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

1559
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,900
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1560
01:44:59,009 --> 01:45:01,534
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1561
01:45:01,645 --> 01:45:03,112
What time does
your wife get home?"

1562
01:45:08,218 --> 01:45:11,449
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1563
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:13,113
he would say

1564
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:16,351
that the thing ain't the ring,

1565
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,360
it's the play.

1566
01:45:19,163 --> 01:45:20,960
So give me a stage

1567
01:45:21,065 --> 01:45:23,363
where this bull here can rage,

1568
01:45:23,467 --> 01:45:25,367
and though I can fight,

1569
01:45:25,469 --> 01:45:27,869
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

1570
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:35,472
That's entertainment!

1571
01:45:59,503 --> 01:46:01,300
Jake, how have you been?

1572
01:46:03,374 --> 01:46:06,434
Hey!
You were just great.

1573
01:46:06,577 --> 01:46:09,102
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1574
01:46:09,213 --> 01:46:12,205
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1575
01:46:12,316 --> 01:46:14,784
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1576
01:46:15,586 --> 01:46:17,884
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1577
01:46:17,988 --> 01:46:20,115
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1578
01:46:20,224 --> 01:46:21,657
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1579
01:46:21,759 --> 01:46:25,160
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1580
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,761
It's good seein' you.

1581
01:46:28,899 --> 01:46:30,127
That is a joke, right?

1582
01:46:30,234 --> 01:46:32,464
It's a joke--
only you know if it's a joke.

1583
01:46:32,569 --> 01:46:34,196
He's just kidding, right?

1584
01:46:34,738 --> 01:46:36,171
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

1585
01:46:36,907 --> 01:46:39,034
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1586
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,940
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1587
01:46:41,045 --> 01:46:42,910
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1588
01:46:43,013 --> 01:46:45,311
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1589
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:49,112
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1590
01:46:50,954 --> 01:46:53,980
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1591
01:46:54,858 --> 01:46:57,656
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1592
01:46:58,695 --> 01:47:01,255
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1593
01:47:01,365 --> 01:47:02,662
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1594
01:47:02,766 --> 01:47:04,324
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

1595
01:47:04,435 --> 01:47:07,461
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1596
01:47:07,571 --> 01:47:09,801
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

1597
01:47:09,907 --> 01:47:12,205
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

1598
01:47:12,309 --> 01:47:13,867
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1599
01:47:13,977 --> 01:47:15,945
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1600
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,608
What's the problem?

1601
01:47:17,714 --> 01:47:18,738
There's really not a problem.

1602
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:21,716
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1603
01:47:22,252 --> 01:47:23,879
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1604
01:47:23,987 --> 01:47:25,284
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1605
01:47:25,823 --> 01:47:27,654
Can you prove
that you're 21?

1606
01:47:27,758 --> 01:47:29,726
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1607
01:47:35,332 --> 01:47:38,733
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1608
01:47:38,836 --> 01:47:40,133
What about you?
How old are you?

1609
01:47:40,237 --> 01:47:42,637
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1610
01:47:42,739 --> 01:47:44,707
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1611
01:47:44,808 --> 01:47:46,105
Come here.

1612
01:47:58,188 --> 01:47:59,314
She's 21, too?

1613
01:48:00,357 --> 01:48:03,326
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

1614
01:48:19,476 --> 01:48:21,808
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1615
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,380
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1616
01:48:38,228 --> 01:48:39,525
There.

1617
01:48:45,002 --> 01:48:46,128
Come on, Jake.

1618
01:48:52,509 --> 01:48:54,443
Lonely nights

1619
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:58,445
I'm so lonely

1620
01:48:58,982 --> 01:49:01,280
Please come home

1621
01:49:01,385 --> 01:49:05,685
You great big
lump of sugar

1622
01:49:06,223 --> 01:49:08,384
I miss you so much

1623
01:49:08,492 --> 01:49:10,323
Please come home

1624
01:49:10,427 --> 01:49:13,396
Lonely nights

1625
01:49:28,045 --> 01:49:30,513
It was a busy night last night.

1626
01:49:31,715 --> 01:49:34,343
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1627
01:49:35,385 --> 01:49:37,876
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1628
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,286
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1629
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:44,084
- Move over.
- Why?

1630
01:49:44,194 --> 01:49:46,685
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1631
01:49:46,797 --> 01:49:48,264
Come on, honey,
open the door.

1632
01:49:48,365 --> 01:49:49,889
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1633
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,934
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

1634
01:49:52,035 --> 01:49:55,061
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1635
01:49:55,606 --> 01:49:57,164
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1636
01:49:57,274 --> 01:49:59,902
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1637
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,307
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1638
01:50:01,411 --> 01:50:03,845
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1639
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,103
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1640
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:33,301
Wake up, champ.

1641
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:37,904
What's up?

1642
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:42,617
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1643
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,017
- They wanna talk with you.
- Youse all look the same to me.

1644
01:50:45,122 --> 01:50:47,522
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1645
01:50:47,624 --> 01:50:49,592
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1646
01:50:49,693 --> 01:50:52,093
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do youse want?

1647
01:50:52,195 --> 01:50:53,321
For what?

1648
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,099
Do you recognize this girl?

1649
01:51:00,871 --> 01:51:02,168
She been in the club?

1650
01:51:05,676 --> 01:51:07,974
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1651
01:51:09,613 --> 01:51:11,376
Nah, I don't know her.

1652
01:51:11,481 --> 01:51:13,642
She says you introduced
her to some men.

1653
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,345
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

1654
01:51:17,454 --> 01:51:21,754
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1655
01:51:22,292 --> 01:51:23,919
But I don't say nothin'.

1656
01:51:24,027 --> 01:51:26,928
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

1657
01:51:28,031 --> 01:51:29,862
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1658
01:51:29,966 --> 01:51:31,934
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1659
01:51:38,675 --> 01:51:40,199
Let me ask you somethin'.

1660
01:51:41,812 --> 01:51:44,440
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

1661
01:51:44,548 --> 01:51:46,675
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1662
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:49,911
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1663
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:52,386
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1664
01:51:53,056 --> 01:51:55,024
For what,
because of this girl?

1665
01:51:57,561 --> 01:51:59,688
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1666
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:02,629
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1667
01:52:02,733 --> 01:52:04,428
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1668
01:52:04,534 --> 01:52:06,161
Let me just get somethin'.

1669
01:52:07,070 --> 01:52:08,901
All right, don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:09,005 --> 01:52:09,994
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1671
01:52:10,107 --> 01:52:12,234
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

1672
01:52:15,011 --> 01:52:17,172
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1673
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,180
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

1674
01:52:19,282 --> 01:52:21,512
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1675
01:52:21,618 --> 01:52:22,915
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1676
01:52:23,019 --> 01:52:25,317
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

1677
01:52:27,858 --> 01:52:30,850
You saw the papers--
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1678
01:52:30,961 --> 01:52:33,293
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1679
01:52:34,464 --> 01:52:36,125
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1680
01:52:36,233 --> 01:52:37,700
Yeah, what friends?

1681
01:52:38,402 --> 01:52:40,996
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1682
01:52:41,104 --> 01:52:43,470
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

1683
01:52:50,881 --> 01:52:51,870
What's the matter with you?

1684
01:52:51,982 --> 01:52:54,473
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1685
01:52:54,584 --> 01:52:56,677
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

1686
01:52:57,387 --> 01:52:59,617
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

1687
01:52:59,723 --> 01:53:02,692
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1688
01:53:02,793 --> 01:53:05,887
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1689
01:53:05,996 --> 01:53:08,897
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1690
01:53:08,999 --> 01:53:10,364
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together--

1691
01:53:10,467 --> 01:53:11,900
Give me 2,000 for them.

1692
01:53:12,002 --> 01:53:14,300
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all--

1693
01:53:14,404 --> 01:53:17,305
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1694
01:53:17,407 --> 01:53:20,308
- I'm sorry. I'd lose--
- Give me them.

1695
01:53:20,844 --> 01:53:22,812
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

1696
01:53:22,913 --> 01:53:26,781
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1697
01:53:28,185 --> 01:53:30,312
I can't raise the 10,000.

1698
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:34,979
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1699
01:53:35,692 --> 01:53:37,159
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1700
01:53:38,195 --> 01:53:41,164
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1701
01:53:42,699 --> 01:53:45,463
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1702
01:53:47,704 --> 01:53:50,332
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1703
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:54,035
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1704
01:53:55,879 --> 01:53:58,439
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

1705
01:53:58,548 --> 01:54:00,846
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1706
01:54:00,951 --> 01:54:05,285
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1707
01:54:05,388 --> 01:54:08,516
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

1708
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,616
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1709
01:54:10,727 --> 01:54:13,457
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1710
01:54:13,563 --> 01:54:15,030
See it? See it?!

1711
01:54:15,565 --> 01:54:18,193
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1712
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:20,862
Go on, boy, live in it!

1713
01:54:20,971 --> 01:54:23,769
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

1714
01:54:23,874 --> 01:54:25,000
Your mother's--!

1715
01:54:25,842 --> 01:54:27,901
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

1716
01:54:29,346 --> 01:54:33,305
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

1717
01:54:33,683 --> 01:54:34,911
Fuck you!

1718
01:54:37,354 --> 01:54:38,981
Fuck your mother!

1719
01:55:15,992 --> 01:55:19,120
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

1720
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:27,962
Why? Why? Why?

1721
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:48,923
You motherfucker!

1722
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:02,330
My hands!

1723
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:07,437
Why'd you do it, why?

1724
01:56:07,544 --> 01:56:09,944
You're so stupid,
you're so stupid,

1725
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:12,446
you're so fuckin' stupid!

1726
01:56:12,549 --> 01:56:14,949
You're so stupid.

1727
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,884
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1728
01:56:17,988 --> 01:56:19,387
I'm not an animal.

1729
01:56:19,489 --> 01:56:23,892
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

1730
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,698
I'm not that guy.

1731
01:56:46,683 --> 01:56:50,642
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

1732
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:53,689
"Look who's here-- big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

1733
01:56:55,358 --> 01:56:58,327
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

1734
01:56:59,863 --> 01:57:02,263
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

1735
01:57:02,365 --> 01:57:05,334
I said, "Listen,
where's the toilet?"

1736
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:06,902
He said, "You're in it."

1737
01:57:08,038 --> 01:57:10,029
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1738
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:12,131
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

1739
01:57:12,242 --> 01:57:13,231
Up yours.

1740
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:17,040
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1741
01:57:17,147 --> 01:57:19,775
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

1742
01:57:20,483 --> 01:57:22,280
And the horse you rode in on.

1743
01:57:24,154 --> 01:57:26,281
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

1744
01:57:27,157 --> 01:57:28,283
Funny man.

1745
01:57:28,992 --> 01:57:30,619
That's why I'm here.

1746
01:57:33,329 --> 01:57:34,626
Give him another drink.

1747
01:57:35,165 --> 01:57:36,632
Piss in it for me.

1748
01:57:38,835 --> 01:57:41,736
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

1749
01:57:41,838 --> 01:57:44,807
with top billing and all that
other bullshit where they all hated her.

1750
01:57:45,675 --> 01:57:47,404
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

1751
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:49,671
I know you're all capable of it.

1752
01:57:49,779 --> 01:57:51,747
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1753
01:57:52,682 --> 01:57:55,981
Her name is Emma 48's.

1754
01:57:58,354 --> 01:58:00,982
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

1755
01:58:15,872 --> 01:58:17,066
Taxi!

1756
01:58:28,918 --> 01:58:30,078
Honey...

1757
01:58:31,554 --> 01:58:33,249
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

1758
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:35,881
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

1759
01:58:35,992 --> 01:58:37,687
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

1760
01:58:39,229 --> 01:58:41,026
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

1761
01:58:42,732 --> 01:58:44,029
Be careful.

1762
01:58:58,581 --> 01:58:59,980
Hey, what are you doin'?

1763
01:59:00,083 --> 01:59:01,345
Joey.

1764
01:59:04,821 --> 01:59:07,119
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

1765
01:59:19,469 --> 01:59:21,198
Come on, Joey,
turn around.

1766
01:59:21,304 --> 01:59:23,067
Hey, Joey, come on.

1767
01:59:36,219 --> 01:59:38,346
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

1768
01:59:38,454 --> 01:59:41,548
Come on. What are you
gettin' so angry about?

1769
01:59:41,658 --> 01:59:43,455
Come on, be friends.

1770
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,084
Come on, you're my brother.

1771
01:59:45,195 --> 01:59:46,685
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1772
01:59:46,796 --> 01:59:49,424
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

1773
01:59:49,532 --> 01:59:50,624
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

1774
01:59:50,733 --> 01:59:52,200
Give me a kiss, come on.

1775
01:59:52,735 --> 01:59:55,636
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

1776
01:59:55,738 --> 01:59:59,196
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

1777
01:59:59,309 --> 02:00:00,776
Just give me a kiss, come on.

1778
02:00:01,578 --> 02:00:02,704
Come on.

1779
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:10,477
You're my brother.
Come on.

1780
02:00:12,488 --> 02:00:13,955
Come on, give me a kiss.

1781
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:18,487
- What?
- Come on.

1782
02:00:20,029 --> 02:00:21,929
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

1783
02:00:22,031 --> 02:00:23,999
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

1784
02:00:24,868 --> 02:00:26,836
- Family?
- All right.

1785
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:32,098
Come on.

1786
02:00:32,208 --> 02:00:34,176
You don't wanna
do this here, come on.

1787
02:00:35,211 --> 02:00:37,679
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

1788
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:39,748
- You'll call me?
- I will.

1789
02:00:40,383 --> 02:00:41,850
Don't forget.

1790
02:00:43,052 --> 02:00:45,350
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1791
02:00:56,799 --> 02:00:58,096
...won it legitimately...

1792
02:00:59,736 --> 02:01:03,228
...and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

1793
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:06,399
Some people aren't that lucky.

1794
02:01:07,744 --> 02:01:11,373
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront.

1795
02:01:11,481 --> 02:01:14,143
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

1796
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:16,150
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

1797
02:01:16,252 --> 02:01:18,846
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

1798
02:01:18,955 --> 02:01:20,752
And it went somethin' like this.

1799
02:01:24,193 --> 02:01:26,821
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

1800
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:30,090
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

1801
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:34,761
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

1802
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:37,601
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

1803
02:01:37,707 --> 02:01:39,004
"My night.

1804
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:42,010
"I could've taken
Wilson apart that night.

1805
02:01:42,111 --> 02:01:43,510
"So, what happens?

1806
02:01:43,613 --> 02:01:47,014
"He gets a title shot outdoors
in the ballpark, and what do I get?

1807
02:01:47,116 --> 02:01:49,277
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

1808
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:52,616
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

1809
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:56,556
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

1810
02:01:58,394 --> 02:02:00,021
"It was you, Charley.

1811
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:02,357
"You was my brother.

1812
02:02:02,899 --> 02:02:05,367
"You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

1813
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:08,632
"You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

1814
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:11,798
"You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

1815
02:02:11,908 --> 02:02:15,708
"instead of making me take
them dives for the short-end money.

1816
02:02:16,245 --> 02:02:18,042
"You don't understand.

1817
02:02:18,748 --> 02:02:22,309
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

1818
02:02:22,418 --> 02:02:27,253
"I could've been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

1819
02:02:27,357 --> 02:02:30,986
"Let's face it--
it was you, Charley.

1820
02:02:32,195 --> 02:02:34,823
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

1821
02:02:35,365 --> 02:02:37,333
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1822
02:02:38,034 --> 02:02:39,831
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

1823
02:02:40,703 --> 02:02:42,102
- You need anything?
- No.

1824
02:02:42,205 --> 02:02:43,331
You sure?

1825
02:02:44,374 --> 02:02:45,500
I'm sure.

1826
02:02:49,879 --> 02:02:53,007
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1827
02:03:13,669 --> 02:03:15,296
Go get 'em, champ.

1828
02:03:25,348 --> 02:03:27,316
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...
