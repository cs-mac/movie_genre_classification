00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,166
How are you, Mr Stevens?
Good to see you again.

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,045
Save some of that film for the official opening.

4
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,767
- It's gonna be a real wingding.
- When was the house built, Mr Stevens?

5
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,487
My father started it in 1916.
Took four years to complete it.

6
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,127
Whose idea was it to turn the estate
into a museum?

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,723
Mine. I've always wanted a place
where people could come and visit,

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,446
rest a while and look at beautiful things.

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,405
How long have you been collecting?

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,686
Let's Well, I guess
I've been collecting all my life.

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,566
I started out as a boy collecting stamps
and then I sold them.

12
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,762
Then I started collecting bicycles.

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,282
Then bicycles led to old rs.

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,006
Then one day I saw this painting.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,682
It was a Renoir. I guess that did it.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,726
That led to another
and then to another and to another.

17
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,482
Then after all these years I decided
it was time to share my collection

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,127
with anybody that might enjoy it,
give it to the people.

19

[reporter] Will your prototype
executive aircraft revolutionise

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,928
the private and commercial industry?

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,884
[Stevens] I certainly hope so.

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,323
[reporter] Will we be receiving a list
of the guests you've invited?

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,761
You'll all get a press kit.

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,770
What about the plane
that's bringing your guests?

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,167
You'll see the airplane when it arrives.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,046
I think you'll agree that we brought
these guests down in style.

Dulles Tower, 2-3 Sierra Heavy,

29
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,686
- Off.
- Beacon light off. Radios?

30
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,245
- Orr.
- OK.

31
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,681
All I'ighty, gents. She's all set for tonight.

32

Sony I was late on those boost pumps.

33
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,646
Don't worry about it. See you guys later.

34
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,122
Why did you mention it? He didn't notice.

35
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,722
Are you kidding? Why do you think
Stevens hires a guy like him?

36
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,730
He notices everything.

37
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,608
Well, how did it check out'?

38
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,201
Just beautiful. She behaved perfectly, Stan.

39
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,371
She damn well better.
I spent the best part of a year on this project.

40
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,528
Now Stevens has got his dream machine,

44
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,565
That's true. You're not gonna

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,003
No, I've quit smoking. Well, I'm quitting.

My reviews are never meant personally.

Only a politician could have said that better.

121
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,040
Don't worry, gentlemen.
I declare a truce on all art critics.

But only for the duration of the flight.

- That's your grandpa.
- Have I ever met him?

153
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,008
- Mm-hm. Once, when you were a little boy.
- How little?

154
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,009
About like that.

Cleared for take-off.

161
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,888
[Chambers] We're rolling.

162
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,406
How fast n this plane go, Mommy?

163
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,251
Fast enough.

164
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,686
Grandpa sure has a neat plane,
doesn't he, Mom?

165
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,123

Excuse me.

- He loves it.

Do you know how oonoemed he is about you?

207

I'm more oonoemed about him than you are.

You're the one
who seduced his wife, you know.

Yes, I know.

I'm lonely. I need someone
to be r1ioe to me this week.

Gen you be nice to me this week'?

213
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,127
No, I don't think so.

214
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,887
What would Martin say if he knew about us?

215
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,924
I really don't think he'd mind, do you?

216
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,726
Do you? I'm gonna ask him.

217
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,570
- Karen.
- What'?

218
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,128
- You're blackmailing me.
- Who else have I got to blackmail?

219
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,290
I don't get to fool around that much.

220
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,771
See you on the ground.

221
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,806
We're light on schedule, sir.
I don't think the weatherll be a problem.

222
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,163
Eve Clayton just walked in.
She has a message for you.

223
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,328
It's Mr Stevens.

224
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,331
- Hello, Philip?
- Eve, how are things going?

225
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,921
Everything is fine. Lisa and Benjy are here.

226
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,441
They're there? Well, that's wonderful.

227
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,326
I don't know how you did it,
but I thank you a million times.

228
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,569
You don't have to thank me.
She decided all by herself.

229
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,003
Isn't that wonderful?
I'll see you at the airport. Bye.

230
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,009
Goodbye.

231
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,886
Robert, get the r ready.
We're going to the airport.

232
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,048
And how about this?

233
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,882
Lisa and Benjy are coming home with me.

234
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,964
By the way, Captain,
I've been thinking about what you said.

235
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,162
<i>So have</i> I.

236
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,091
Can we talk about it in Palm Beach tonight?

237
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,886
I think that could be arranged.

238
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,048
Yeah.

239
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,690
We're right on schedule, but we have to
do something about that security guard.

240
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,724
Don't wony. When the time comes,
I'll take re of him.

241
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,405
Champagne on the rocks?

242
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,729
I haven't had that in years.
How did you know'?

243
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,970
"Mr Nicholas St Downs <i>lll."</i>

244
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,128
"London, 1936. "

245
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,447
I don't believe it.

246
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,762
It IS Nicky.

247
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,488
I don't believe it.

248
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,127
After all these years and you turn up here.
Where have you been?

249
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,561
- London, mostly.
- And you know Philip?

250
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,446
Hard to work in the worlds of art and money
and not know him.

251
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,802
- And which world is yours?
- Both.

252
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,685
I arrange financing for a number of museums

253
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,601
and I've acquired
a modest collection of my own.

254
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,327
Would you re to see the present
I am taking to the museum?

255
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,284
I certainly would.

256
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,450
I don't know what I'd do ifyou'd said no.

257
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,689
How beautiful.

258
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,561
Oh, Nicky. It is good to see you.

259
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,084
Captain.

260
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,090
We have a low reading
for the middle cargo hold.

261
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,887
It is low. Maybe one of the sensors is out.

262
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,048
Buchekll take a look at it.

263
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,284
Yeah?

264
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,609
- Mr Buchek, it's for you.
- Yeah?

265
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,406
I hear this is a special day for you, Eddie.

266
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,570
- The doctor said it's gonna be twins.
- I'll check light away.

267
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,001
Twins? You must be nervous.

268
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,851
No... terrified. It's the first time.

269
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,930
I see. Have you seen Mr Stevens' daughter?

270
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,843
She was upstairs in the offioe.
I sent her a drink

271
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,364
- Doyou mind if I <i>ll</i> mywife?
- Please do.

272
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,530
- Larry, would you take over for me?
- Sure thing.

273
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,925
- That's OK.
- You shouldn't be down here, son.

274
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,964
That's all light. Benjy, how are you?

275
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,721
Close that hatch.
We'll check the pressure on this one.

276
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,808
What was that? My ears popped.

277
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,968
That's air pressure.

278
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,164
Each one of these holds
is airtight when it's sealed.

279
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,771
How come?

280
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,760
So we n rry all kinds
of different things in the rgos.

281
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,928
This ship's special.

282
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,126
- Captain Gallagher.
- The dumb indicator light was stuck

283
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,608
- How's the reading now'?
- <i>Good.</i> Thanks, Stan.

284
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,849
- Are you a real policeman, Mr Hunter'?
- Sort of.

285
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,681
- Have you ught a lot of crooks?
- A few, but none lately.

286
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,281
Will you tell me about them?

287
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,849
- Sure. Any time.
- OK, Benjy. Hup, hup, hupl

288
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,724
Lisa, Lisa. What's wrong?

289
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,923
It's the same old story.
My father calls and I come running.

290
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,805
I think it's wonderful that you me.

291
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,607
He's missed you. Two years is a long time.

292
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,601
I know that. And in that time
I've made a life for myself and Benjy.

293
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,644
I'm finally someone
other than Philip Stevens' daughter.

294
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,208
All he ever wanted to do
was to try to help you.

295
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,368
I know that.

296
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,721
My fathers a very powerful man.

297
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,369
I don't think he realises it, but he tends
to dominate everybody around him.

298
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,927
Especially me. But I'm going to tell him

299
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,522
that I'm finally living my own life,
once and for all.

300
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,610
This is a very important time for him.

301
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,041
Don't upset him, please.

302
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,641
I don't intend to upset him,

303
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,801
but I have to tell him how I feel,
whether it upsets him or not.

304
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,521
I don't think you should.

305
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,451
Your fathers very ill.

306
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,689
The doctors say he has a few months,

307
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,848
maybe a little longer.

308
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,567
- That's impossible.
- No, it's true.

309
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,051
I'm sorry, darling.

310
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,965
Oh, my God, Eve.

311
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,087
It's time for me
to stretch my legs, Captain.

312
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,248
Right.

313
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,645
- [woman 1] Tried the caviar'?
- [woman 2] No.

314
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,248
We've got ten minutes. The important thing
is to get Gallagher out of the cockpit.

315
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,408
Leave it to me.

316
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,008
The diving's the best part. You can't
imagine it if you haven't experienced it.

317
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,205
It's like exploling a world hidden from man
since the beginning of time.

318
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,368
It's beautiful, really beautiful.

319
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,006
I couldn't do that. Water terrifies me.

320
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,441
It shouldn't. It's wonderful down there.

321
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,486
In fact, it's about the only time
I ever really feel free.

322
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,887
Excuse me. I don't mean to intrude,

323
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,890
but could you move your ass, dear?

324
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,408
Thank youl

325
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,607
That was very cruel.

326
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,646
If I weren't cruel,
how would people know how kind you are?

327
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,449
If I weren't a sinner, how could you look
like a saint'? isn't that why we're together?

328
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,803
If it isn't, tell me.
I'll stop acting like such an idiot.

329
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,447
Why should I, my dear?
You're so proficient at it.

330
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,250
- Forget it.
- What'?

331
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,011
You hit him too hard. He's dead.

332
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,450
Come on. Let's get him outta here.

333
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,405
Captain Gallagher.

334
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,763
This is the flight steward. I'm in the bedroom.

335
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,486
- You'd better come back here.
- What's your problem?

336
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,570
It's one of the passengers, sir.
He seems very ill.

337
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,728
I'll be right there.

338
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,248
One of the passengers isn't feeling well.

339

There's no time for that.
Get down to the cargo hold.

345
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,846
- How are we doing?
- Fine. Get him outta here.

Flight 2-3 Sierra is about to disappear
into the Bermuda Triangle.

348
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,091
Somethings wrong.

349
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,604
- You having problems with that repeater?
- No, it's just not here.

350
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,282
- I've lost contact with 2-3 Sierra.
- Hang on.

351
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,441
They're in the Bermuda Triangle.
I'll try to contact them by radio.

- Any problem on that end?
- Why should there be?

356
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,081
The airstrip hasn't been used
since World War ll.

357
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,568
We'll have to make the transfer
before those people wake up.

358
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,728
Relax. They'll find themselves

359
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,730
sitting on an empty 747
wondering what happened,

360
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,730
[chuckles] and we'll be halfway
to South Amel'i.

Yes, I'll speak to Mr Stevens.

- You're welcome to join us.

We're monitoring the coastguard search too.

- Who knows?

458
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,202
<i>1'lll</i> the rescue units get here?

459
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,086
- I hope.
. [man groaning]

460
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,681
Somebody... help me.

461
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,562
Christ, Mr Buchek. I'm glad to see you.

462
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,401
My God. Give me a hand with that.

463
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,285
[Buchek] It's gonna hurt a little, Eddie.
Hang on.

464
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,289
- Easy.
- Owl

465
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,927
- You said it was only gonna hurt a little.
- You got a knife?

466
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,566
- [Buchek] Take it easy.
- Hold still.

467
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,287
This won't hurt.
I'm only gonna cut your trouser leg.

468
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,006
But hold still, please.

469
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,008
You got it?

470
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,328
Oh, Jesusl

471
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,887
- Oh, boy.
- That ain't good.

472
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,921
- Just lie still.
- We need some help.

473
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,522
- I'll get somebody to help you.
- See if you can find that doctor.

474
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,007
His pupil dilation's fine.

475
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,363
It's probably a concussion.
He should come around.

476
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,803
He's got a hell of a lot of explaining to do.

477
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,367
Doc, you come with me.

478
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,085
- What's the condition of the fuselage?
-

479
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,203
Eddie is in the communications room.

480
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,609
His leg is smashed to hell.
See if you n help him.

481
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,007
[man] It's not good.

482
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,441
[woman] Why don't we put on the life jackets?

483
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,961
- How is he?
- OK.

484
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,282
- I'm gonna need your help.
- Sure.

485
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,245
Let's see if we n find a bottle of whisky.

486
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,242
Karen, it's going to be all light.

487
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,489
I promise you, it's going to be all light.

488
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,969
Don't leave me just for a minute.
Just don't leave me alone.

489
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,288
But there are injured people who need help.

490
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,008
Well, you're supposed to take re of me.

491
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,330
I mean... What's going to happen to me?

492
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,445
I'm sorry, my dear, but... the doctor needs me.

493
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,167
No, it's back aft here.

494
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,648
There. There we go.

495
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,727
Let's see what we got here, now.

496
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,049
Electric storage cell, no.
Interrupted service. Here we are.

497
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,528
CM-1, CM-2... CD-1. That's it.

498
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,204
[water gurgling]

499
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,846
On, my God.

500
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,684
Oh, bw-

501
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,848
Look at this.

502
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,563
- It's cold all the way to the top.
- Completely flooded.

503
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,525
Better check the near cargo holds.

504
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,162
Do you want some more water?

505
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,840
- Yeah, please.
- OK.

506
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,248
- Julie?
- Yes?

507
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,448
I love you, Julie.

508
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,005
Here.

509
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,328
Steve.

510
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,405
Steve.

511
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,240
- That doesn't seem to be flooded.
- Seem?

512
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,967
Let's hope you're light-

513
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,887
- Looks dry.
- Yeah, for now.

514
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,969
How long n she stand the pressure?

515
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,846
Who the hell knows? I just hope
it doesn't slide down any deeper.

516
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,001
Any increase in pressure'll crush this fuselage
like an empty beer n.

517
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,524
And the lack of a fresh air supply, oxygen,

518
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,441
that could become a very big factor.

519
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,962
Captain,
the oopilofs regained consciousness.

520
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,762
- Mama.
- Yes, darling?

521
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,406
Is Bonnie gonna die?

522
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,762
No, love.

523
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,928
She looks real sick.

524
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,249
I know, but she's gonna be all light.

525
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,807
You'll see. Come here.

526
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,006
LS that all of it?

527
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,409
- Just about.
- Just about.

528
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,400
Coastal radar did have a fix on us
before the crash, didn't they?

529
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,208
No. We were too low for radar interception.

530
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,282
It's fortunate that you are injured,
you miserable son of a bitchl

531
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,848
I'd take you apart... Get him down below.

532
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,088
Come on.

533
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,288
What did you mean about the radar?

534
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,280
Chambers flew us off course.
The search planes'll never look for us here.

535
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,451
- There's no chance they'll find us?
- We're on our own.

536
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,486
And that is the total situation
as of this moment.

537
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,444
I'm glad you came down here.

538
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,440
I'll act as liaison
between my company and the navy.

539
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,211
I'll bring Mr Stevens up to date.

540
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,608
Phil, let's take a walk and get some fresh air.

541
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,365
[Stevens] Do you think there's
a chance, Joe?

542
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,927
<i>Patron“ Between the new
and the coastguard,</i>

543
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,045
there are twenty planes
and six ships out there.

544
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,882
The area where they think the plane went
down is covered. The search is expanding.

545
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,367
[Stevens] So far they've
come up with nothing.

546
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,131
[Patroni] If there are survivors,
they're gonna find 'em.

547
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,846
My daughter and my grandson
are on that plane,

548
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,202
you know that'?

549
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,449
I have a picture of her here.

550
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,851
- She's a beautiful girl.
- She is.

551
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,883
I only hope there'll... there'll be a miracle

552
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,163
and I'll have a chance to see her again.

553
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,601
They'll just keep searching, Phil.

554
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,043
They'll keep searching.

555
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,488
- Go ahead.
- OK, I'm through.

556
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,445
[indistinct chatter]

557
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,968
Would you move, please?

558
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,322
- Please move.
- Hold on.

559
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,320
- Julie, dear, would you move, please?
- Come on.

560
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,205
[Frank] I got him. Let go.

561
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,804
How is he?

562
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,209
It's a bad fracture, but I think he'll be OK.

563
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,448
You don't sound too sure.

564
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,962
Although there are similarities,
this isn't my usual line of work

565
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,084
You see, I'm a doctor of veterinary medicine.

566
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,648
I look after the horses
at Mr Stevens' racing stables.

567
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,923
Maybe we ought to keep that
to ourselves, Anne.

568
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,642
Whatever you say, Doctor.

569
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,486
[Gallagher] This way. Where is it? Right here.

570
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,684
Ah, here we go. Where is the E-15 circuit?

571
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,841
[Buchek] The E-15 circuit breaks
light through the bulkhead light here.

572
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,203
[creaking]

573
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,281
Oh, God.

574
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,447
I'll be right back

575
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,964
- It's started.
- HOW bad?

576
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,846
- Bad. How we doing here?
- Take a look at 57-W.

577
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,285
[woman whimpering]

578
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,767
What's the matter'?

579
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,761
- Listen. Did you hear that'?
- [faint whispering]

580
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,531
No. I don't hear anything.

581
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,091
Everyone be quiet for a second.

582
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,811
Listen.

583
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,163
- What's that sound?
- Quiet. Listen.

584
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,811
[engine running]

585
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,806
- It sounds like a ship.
- They're coming for usl

586
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,767
- [woman 1] Thank Godl
- [woman 2] Thank God, they're coming for usl

587
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,365
[engine fades]

588
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,810
- [sighs] It's gone.
- It can't be.

589
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,571
It just can't be.

590
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,651
How could they leave us like this?
How could they?

591
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,211
- I don't know.
- Lisa...

592
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,563
I know. Because they never even saw us.

593
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,809
It's a passing ship.
They didn't even know we were here.

594
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,764
- That's enough.
- Nobody does.

595
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,885
- I said that's enoughl
- More than enough, Mr Gallagher.

596
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,004
Goddamn mess we're in.

597
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,044
I think it's time we took a crack at this.

598
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,448
Is she any better?

599
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,041
Her temperatures gone even higher.

600
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,846
Isn't there something we could do?

601
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,850
E-15... Here.

602
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,449
Let's see. Yeah, that's E-15 all light.

603
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,281
- Gen that circuit be jumped?
- Well, sure, it n be jumped.

604
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,690
But what worries me is whether
that bulkhead n withstand the pressure.

605
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,522
If we don't get a man up to send
a mayday signal, they'll never find us.

606
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,167
You're light. Some choice we got.

607
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,364
Either we all drown or we all suffocate.

608
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,449
- Come on.
- [roaring crash]

609
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,762
OK, everybody. Quickly, please.

610
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,486
Settle down and listen very closely.

611
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,411
This raft has got a small built-in radio

612
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,683
that activates
when the raft hits the surface of the water.

613
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,611
It's gonna send a distress signal.

614
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,771
On the surface of the water?
A lot of good that does us dovm here.

615
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,962
Well, you're light, aren't you?

616
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,243
We have to get the raft out of the plane.

617
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,649
One door opens in,
in the near cargo section.

618
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,605
- We n open it electrilly.
- Won't that flood the plane?

619
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,964
No. There's a sealed door
between the cargo hold and here.

620
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,323
If the bulkheads don't give way,
that's the only place it'll flood.

621
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,488
I'll be in the hall with this oxygen.

622
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,605
If I n get the raft out,
get that damn thing up and inflated,

623
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,768
the search parties'll hear it.

624
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,167
- That's about it. Let's go.
- Captain.

625
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,761
- [Wallace] I think I should go with you.
- No.

626
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,928
I'm an experienced scuba-diver.

627
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,203
Two men have a better chance
of making it than one.

628
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,210
[Buchek] He's light, Don.

629
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,121
Go up in the cockpit,
get another one of these rigs and join us.

630
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,766
It's in the starboard locker.
Get a couple of life jackets.

631
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,531
[worried chatter]

632
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,926
Put that wire on the blue terminal.

633
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,851
OK.

634
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,806
- How much more?
- Not much. Just one more wire.

635
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,040
Nothing I say will make any difference. Why?

636
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,891
Let the pilot go. Why are you taking a chance?

637
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:44,007
- I'm doing this for all of us.
- We're usl

638
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,806
They're a bunch of strangers.
You think everybody is us.

639
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,482
Oen't you forget about other people
and think about yourself?

640
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,765
Other people thinking about themselves
got us down here in the first place.

641
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,806
You've got a lot of brains, Martin,

642
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,731
but you're not a smart man.

643
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,327
Help me off with this.

644
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,602
Careful with that one.

645
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,690
- You've got it.
- OK. Now...

646
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,606
I touch those together and that should do it?

647
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,044
- That ought to do it.
- Then we do it now.

648
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,402
Look, we have a date tonight in Palm Beach,

649
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,568
so you take re of yourself.

650
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,728
Promise.

651
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,047
There really isn't much more to say.

652
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,641
There's a hell of lot more to say.

653
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,810
There just isn't time enough to say it.

654
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,288
You all set'?

655
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,121
Get up against this bulkhead

656
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,527
and stay as flat as you n.

657
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,484
When that damn door opens,

658
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,526
you're gonna think
the gates of hell me open.

659
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,491
We've only got two minutes of air.

660
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,166
Here we go.

661
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,930

What's wrong?

664
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,010
Must be a short in one of those damn wires.

665
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,850
[creaking]

666
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,408
Don't get too close to the door.

667
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,321
Mrs Wallace, come away from the window.

668
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,285
Lay her back
Get her something to drink

669
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,528
[Emily] Look. He's made it.

670
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,042
Here, have some more. Easy. Here.

671
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,607
Come on, drink it.

672
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,925
- Take it easy.
- [sobbing]

673

OK, Frank

[whispering] There you go. Easy, now.

675

All light. Easy, Mrs Wallace.

- What ships are in that area?
- Agerholm and Cayuga.

- They're not part of our operation.
- They are now.

Get me helos, scuba teams,
compressors, air-hose packages, the works.

an emergency sub-salvage operation.

Get me the plain of Cayuga

- Less than half an hour.

on Cayuga. Do you concur?

722
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,282
- We'll be happy to have him aboard.

No, I'll be of more use here, Admiral.

Get Mr Patroni a direct line to his company.

01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,369
And he'll need to be in constant contact
with Cayuga.

728
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,404
- This way, Mr Patroni.
- We'll get that plane up.

729

- Yes, sir. I'm fine.
- What's the situation?

Most of the passengers are alive,
but that fuselage is gonna give way.

- Air?

Make sure they're secured tightly.

01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,403
Thanks, Joe.

768
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,281
- My daughter and grandson...
- They weren't injured, sir.

769
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,847
We're gonna raise the plane
with salvage pontoons.

770
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,771
Lieutenant Norris will lead the UDT team.

771
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,724
- I'll go with them.
- You a diver?

772
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,082
- Amateur.
- I'm not sure I n permit that.

773
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,329
Your men don't know
the stress points of a 747.

774
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,047
Attach the pontoons in the wrong place,
that ship'll crack wide open.

775
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,130
You need me down there.

776
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,288
Get this man into some scuba gear.

777
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,244
Right this way.

778
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,330
- Grab the stern line.
- I got it.

779
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,284
Stand clear of the airline.

782
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,208
Hook it up.

783
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,682
Easy does it.

784
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,607
The main damage is in the forward cargo hold.

785
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,689
Gen we get air to the passengers?

786
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,248
Too risky. You can't cut through
that thin aluminum.

787
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,408
OK, let's get going-

788
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,728
The captain's gotta be kidding.

789
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,764
He thinks we're gonna attach
some air balloons to that 747

790
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,361
and it's gonna float light up to the surface.

791
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,724
- It's gonna blow up like a bomb going off.
- They gotta try something.

792
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,888
Those people'll die from lack of oxygen.

793
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,084
Don't bet anything on their chances
with this balloon routine.

794
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,002
- All set, sir?
- I'm ready.

795

All light, let's go. Over the side.

796

There's divers out there. They're coming for us.

797
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,602
- What did he say?
- Where? I can't see them. Move over.

798
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,485
There they are.

799
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,368
They're gonna try and raise the plane.

800
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,961
It's gonna be like a tidal wave.

801
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,686
Grab anything solid
you n get your hands on.

802
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,644
Grab that companion-way rail.

803
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,491
Use your belts. Strap yourselves in.

804

Doctor, get that child up here
by the pong table.

- Gallagher says it's now or never.
- What about the weight distribution?

817
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,002
It's gonna come up at a steep angle.

818

- Any way to equalise the load?
- No, sir.
