1
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,997
(woman singing)
(music) All in the merry month of May (music)

2
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:38,060
(music) When green leaves
were a-springing (music)

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:43,269
(music) This young man
on his deathbed lay (music)

4
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:48,975
(music) For the love of Barbara Allen (music)

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,452
(music) He sent his man
unto her then (music)

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,015
(music) To the town
where she was dwelling (music)

7
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,927
(music) "You must come
to my master, dear (music)

8
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:09,458
(music) If your name
be Barbara Allen" (music)

9
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,439
(music) So slowly, slowly
she got up (music)

10
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:19,501
(music) And slowly
she came to him (music)

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,607
(music) And all she said
when she came there (music)

12
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:30,179
(music) "Young man,
I think you're dying" (music)

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,818
(music) He turned his face
unto the wall (music)

14
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:40,196
(music) And death came
creeping to him (music)

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:45,101
(music) Adieu, adieu,
and adieu to all (music)

16
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:51,167
(music) And adieu
to Barbara Allen (music)

17
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:56,272
(music) When he was dead
and laid in his grave (music)

18
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:01,377
(music) Then death came
creeping to her (music)

19
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,221
(music) O mother, mother,
make my bed (music)

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:11,889
(music) For his death
hath quite undone me (music)

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,925
(music) And so this maid
she then did die (music)

22
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:21,997
(music) And desired
to be buried by him (music)

23
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:27,138
(music) And repented she
before she died (music)

24
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:33,709
(music) That e'er she did
deny him. (music)

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,716
Now...

26
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,285
there you have a fine example
of an old English ballad,

27
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,697
a folk song, defined
as that which is created

28
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,600
by the common people,
the unskilled.

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,535
The melodies
are quaint and primitive,

30
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,732
but you must learn
to appreciate

31
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,672
not only
the sociological value,

32
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,871
but the simple purity
of emotion in the song.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,516
(humming)

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,147
Oh.

35
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,951
Good afternoon,
Dean Pembroke.

36
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,652
I wanted to catch you today,
Dr. Penleric.

37
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,354
I wanted to tell you
that the appointment committee

38
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,398
has reviewed your application
for full professor.

39
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,298
And we've concluded
unanimously

40
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,064
that we can not
offer you the position.

41
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,732
However, we hope
you will continue on

42
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,900
as an associate professor

43
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,308
at your current salary level,
of course.

44
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,347
Dr. Penleric: Why, may I ask,
am I being passed over again?

45
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,611
It is not customary
to be asked

46
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,815
to defend our position,
Dr. Penleric.

47
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,652
It appears we have
an opportunity

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,285
to offer the position to
the eminent English musicologist

49
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,091
and ballad collector,
Cyrus Whittle,

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,531
who as you know, has almost
single-handedly created

51
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,968
a revival
of the English folk song.

52
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,664
Oh, Dean Pembroke.
Excuse me.

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,798
What is it, Professor Aldrich?

54
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,741
Nothing, sir, I just stopped by
for a few words with Dr. Penleric.

55
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,144
Well, I was just leaving.
Good day, Dr. Penleric.

56
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,412
(door closes)

57
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,287
I argued for you, Lily,

58
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,654
as emphatically as I dared.

59
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,693
I have waited longer
and published more

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,524
than anyone else
in this department.

61
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,530
Frankly,
I was the only man for you.

62
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,327
Dr. Penleric: Really?

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,528
Dean Pembroke said
the vote was unanimous.

64
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,231
I was afraid someone
would suspect something.

65
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,033
Dr. Whittle is
a brilliant man.

66
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,443
Of course he is,
that's not the point!

67
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,542
Lily,

68
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,709
I've arranged
the family's whole summer

69
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,083
so I can come into town
to see you every week.

70
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,017
I won't be here, Wallace.

71
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,493
Where are you going?

72
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,122
As far away as possible.

73
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,257
Please don't go away.

74
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,997
I know how disappointed
you must be, my darling, but...

75
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,595
Lily, wait.

76
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,834
Why don't I meet you
at your apartment?

77
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,773
My wife won't be home
until quite late.

78
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,012
Are you mad, Lily?
What if someone walked in?

79
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,109
You coward!

80
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,517
Backing my appointment
was the only thing

81
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,077
I ever asked you for.

82
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,656
But...

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,522
(rooster crowing)

84
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,870
You Miss Elna's sister?

85
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,273
Yes, yes, yes, I am.

86
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,043
I'm here to take you
to Clover.

87
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,607
I'm Fate Honeycutt.
What's your name?

88
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,519
Oh, hello,
I'm Dr. Lily Penleric.

89
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,954
A doctor, huh?

90
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,685
That's just fine.

91
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,284
We could sure use
another healer.

92
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,887
Oh, I'm not a medical doctor.

93
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,989
Well, what kind are you?

94
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm a doctor of music,

95
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,370
sort of an expert.

96
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,601
I see.

97
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,741
Thank you.

98
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,815
Well, hop on up, Doc.

99
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,089
Here, just put your foot
on the wheel there.

100
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,286
I'll help you up.

101
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,099
Fate: Giddup.

102
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,792
Fate: Giddup.

103
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,027
What if we meet
another wagon

104
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,629
coming down the mountain?

105
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,675
That would be something.

106
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,410
Oh!

107
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,851
(distant banjo music plays)

108
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,559
Someone's playing music?

109
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,012
- Oh, Lily!
- Eleanor.

110
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,315
It's been so long.

111
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,321
Yes.

112
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,161
I thought you said it was
only five miles to Clover.

113
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,356
Woman: She meant
"mountain miles."

114
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,296
Used to take three days
to get up here.

115
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,632
This is my sister, Lily.

116
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:29,300
Lily, this is my colleague
and friend, Harriet Tolliver.

117
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,536
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

118
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,707
This is Deladis Slocumb.
Deladis has no family,

119
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,373
so we get to keep her here
full time.

120
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,611
How do you do, ma'am?

121
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,278
How do you do?

122
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,347
Elna's told me
so much about you.

123
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,686
"Elna"?

124
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,592
Oh, that's what
everyone here calls me.

125
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,153
It's caught on with me, too.

126
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,722
I suppose it's a lot better
than "Little Elf,"

127
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,233
which is what
I used to call her.

128
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,769
(chuckling)

129
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,998
You must be exhausted.

130
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,700
I am.
Excuse me.

131
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,643
Would you like to rest
before supper?

132
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,577
Uh...

133
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,445
- Could you help me, dearest?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,984
Thank you so much.

135
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,110
It's very hot.

136
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,415
I know.

137
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,911
Along with
the basic curriculum,

138
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,209
we also teach hygiene
and nutrition to the girls.

139
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,476
And music, of course.

140
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,882
Deladis, why don't you
serve the tea?

141
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,184
Deladis,
what a beautiful name.

142
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,918
That's a real pretty fan.

143
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,155
Thank you, dear.
It's from Spain.

144
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,089
(crow cawing)

145
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,466
Thank you, dear.

146
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,069
Aren't you frightened here?

147
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,405
What of?

148
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,577
Oh, savage mountaineers.

149
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,549
Reports of violence
are horrible.

150
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,415
(laughing)

151
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,750
Horribly exaggerated,
that is.

152
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,654
Deladis,
why don't you sing

153
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,716
one of your pretty songs
for my sister?

154
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,752
Oh, please, please do.
I would like that.

155
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:47,571
(music) 'Twas in the merry
month of May (music)

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,744
(music) When all gay flowers
were a-bloomin' (music)

157
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:58,381
(music) Sweet William
on his deathbed lay (music)

158
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:03,156
(music) For the love
of Barbry Allen (music)

159
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:09,863
(music) He sent his servant
to the town (music)

160
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:14,804
(music) He sent him
to her dwelling (music)

161
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,570
(music) Sayin', "Master's sick (music)

162
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,077
(music) and very sick (music)

163
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:25,174
(music) And for your sake
he's a-dyin'." (music)

164
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,242
Deladis, where did you
learn that song?

165
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,723
My granny gave it to me.

166
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,383
Was your grandmother
from England?

167
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,120
You mean, across the ocean?

168
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,556
No, no.

169
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,259
Granny lived and died
right here in the mountains.

170
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,994
Lily: Then where
did she learn it?

171
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,269
Granny said she got
all those love songs

172
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,670
from her mama.

173
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,675
Do you know
any more ballads?

174
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,379
love songs.

175
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,648
Oh. I know lots of them.

176
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,278
I know "Lord Randall,"
uh... uh...

177
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,719
"Jacqueline Is Sailing,"
"Two Sisters."

178
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,654
I know "Young Emily."

179
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,625
Would you sing
"Two Sisters," please?

180
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,093
Harriet: It's all right, dear.

181
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,800
(music) O sister, o sister
come go with me... (music)

182
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,735
Lily... I told you
never to call me here.

183
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,897
I'm calling
as a colleague, Wallace.

184
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,635
- Where are you?
- The southern mountains.

185
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,269
What on earth are you doing
in such a dreadful place?

186
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,540
Lily: Never mind that.
I'm telephoning because I made

187
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,981
a great discovery.
Old English ballads.

188
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,109
What are you talking about?

189
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,483
Lily: The mountain people
brought the ballads here

190
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,148
over 200 years ago.

191
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,691
The same songs
that Cyrus Whittle

192
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,420
has been collecting
in England,

193
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,860
songs which haven't been known
there for at least 100 years!

194
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,363
- What of it, Lily?
- Woman: Wally?

195
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,832
I want you to come home.

196
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,164
Don't you understand?

197
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,832
These may be the purest
versions in existence.

198
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,603
- That's ridiculous.
- It's true!

199
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,234
And I am going to be
the first to collect them

200
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,471
and to publish them.

201
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,639
Nothing I could have said
or done

202
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,649
would have secured
that appointment for you.

203
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,844
Nothing you do now
will, either.

204
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,281
Will you help me,
or not?

205
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,517
I have always
believed in you, Lily.

206
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,459
Lily: Good.
I need supplies.

207
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,124
The collecting must be done
scientifically.

208
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,499
Now, nice and loud.

209
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,331
(music) A holiday, O holy day (music)

210
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,967
(music) The first day of they ear (music)

211
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,477
(music) Little Matthy Groves
to church to goes (music)

212
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,740
(music) Some holy words to hear (music)

213
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,874
(music) Here some holy words
to hear (music)

214
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,613
(play back) (music) He spied some women
dressed in black (music)

215
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,917
(music) As they came into view (music)

216
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,389
(music) Lord Daniel's wife
was gaily clad (music)

217
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,892
(music) The flower of the few (music)

218
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,930
(music) Here the flower
of the few (music)

219
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,727
(music) She stepped up
to Little Matthy Groves (music)

220
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,859
(music) Her eyes cast
on the ground... (music)

221
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:35,032
Deladis: (music) Come all ye fair
and tender ladies (music)

222
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:41,205
(music) Be careful
how you court young men (music)

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,804
- (music) They're like... (music)
- Uh...

224
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,113
Could you sing those two lines again?
Thank you, dear.

225
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,749
Why don't you just make
a cylinder and copy off that?

226
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,259
Because the cylinders
are only for short songs

227
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,294
and they wear out.
Once again, thank you.

228
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:04,360
(music) Come all ye fair
and tender ladies (music)

229
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:09,669
(music) Be careful
how you court young men (music)

230
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,183
(Deladi's singing in distance)

231
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,845
Are you still working
on the child labor piece?

232
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,219
I'm trying,
not very successfully.

233
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,785
I wonder how many times your sister
needs to hear those songs?

234
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,092
No, don't, don't be angry.

235
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,961
It makes her very happy.

236
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,628
She's quite obsessed.

237
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,761
So am I.

238
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,871
Deladis: (music) She cried out
with a thrillin' cry (music)

239
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,038
(music) O Lord, O Lord, I'm ruined. (music)

240
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,683
(sighing)
That's it, Doc.

241
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm worn out
like a cylinder.

242
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,253
Uh, just those last two lines
once again, please, dear.

243
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,861
(music) She cried out
with a thrillin' cry (music)

244
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,264
(music) O Lord, O Lord, I'm ruined. (music)

245
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,505
(sighing)
That's it.

246
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,938
That's the very last ballad
I know.

247
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,498
And what a doozy.

248
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,044
Mm.

249
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,327
(Lily chuckling)

250
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,371
What's this for?

251
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,872
That's for all your hard work.

252
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,137
Just for singing?

253
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,143
Uh-hmm.

254
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,880
- Here.
- (music) Come all ye fair (music)

255
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,184
(music) and tender ladies (music)

256
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:09,284
(music) Be careful
how you court young men (music)

257
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,731
(music) They're like a bright star
of a summer's evening (music)

258
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,170
(music) They'll first appear
and then they're gone. (music)

259
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,074
I'm gonna tie a lover's knot.

260
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,804
If it stays and grows,

261
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,438
all will be well.

262
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,315
Where did you get
that fancy thing?

263
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,789
Doc gave it to me
for singing.

264
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,628
(screaming)

265
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:53,927
(Lily humming)

266
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,667
Hello?

267
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,142
Oh, Eleanor,
this is just fascinating.

268
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,576
It really is.

269
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,773
You see, Deladis sings,
"For The Most Part"

270
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,112
in a Scots-Irish style,

271
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,483
but she employs
such unusual pitches.

272
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,613
And she dwells on notes.
Here.

273
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,886
(music) Tay-ay-ble, here's... (music)

274
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,859
Can you hear that?
That is so unusual.

275
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,896
I have never heard
anything like it before.

276
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,227
Tell me,
is her style of singing,

277
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,493
is that typical?

278
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,467
- Yes, I think it is.
- Is it really?

279
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,332
It's fascinating.

280
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,599
So what do you think
of my school, Lily?

281
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,436
Hmm?

282
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,032
Oh...

283
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,910
- Well, I'm no expert...
- I know.

284
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,973
- I'm sure it's fine.
- I know.

285
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,678
We are trying
to make a difference.

286
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,515
Yes, of course.

287
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,522
(sobbing)
It was mine!

288
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,717
Elna: Oh, Deladis,
what happened?

289
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,587
- Oh, Fate, did you do this?
- That was so cruel.

290
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,927
You give her
that fancy thing

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,831
and a whole dollar
just for singing.

292
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,666
- You ain't give me nothing.
- Fate, you work for the school

293
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,037
and I think we pay you
quite adequately.

294
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,043
Then I'll do nothing for Doc.
Just for the school.

295
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,602
Then I'll have to find
another boy who's more willing...

296
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,409
No, no, Eleanor,
Fate does have a point.

297
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,349
He has had to work a lot harder
since I've been here.

298
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,045
That's right, Doc.

299
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,452
So how's 50¢ a week,
young man?

300
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,093
I don't know.
I'll have to think on it.

301
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,132
While you're thinking, you can
help pack the phonograph machine.

302
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,030
We're going
to Bear Creek tomorrow.

303
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,262
She's going to Viney Butler's.

304
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,861
You can't lug that machine
all the way up a mountain.

305
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,237
We made it this far,
didn't we?

306
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,572
That was nothing compared
to getting up to Bear Creek.

307
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,976
So what am I paying you for?

308
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,251
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whew.

309
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,567
I don't know no ballads.

310
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,338
Why, Mrs. Butler,
they are the most

311
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,573
beautiful songs
there have ever been,

312
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,707
songs like
"Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor,"

313
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,809
"Two Sisters,"
"Matthy Groves."

314
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,514
Can't say I know them.

315
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,558
Deladis calls them
love songs.

316
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,927
No, did you ever hear
any such songs, Fate?

317
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,125
Del knew,
but I can't say as I do.

318
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Deladis can't be the only keeper
of the songs in the mountains.

319
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,904
I can't be
of any help to you, ma'am.

320
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,942
I would be happy
to compensate you...

321
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,170
to pay you, Mrs. Butler.

322
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,337
Good day to you.

323
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,516
Hello, Viney.

324
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,517
Well, look who's here!

325
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,648
- You must be Elna's sister.
- Yes, I am.

326
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,387
I'm so happy to meet you.
I'm Alice Kincaid.

327
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,656
Well, how do you do?
I'm Lily Penleric.

328
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,221
What are you trudging
all the way up here for, child?

329
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,099
I wanted to meet Dr. Penleric.
I have something for you.

330
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,694
Oh. Fate.
Thank you.

331
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:18,004
My family spent summers
in Asheville.

332
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,839
I loved hiking up
into the mountains

333
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,004
and reading poetry.

334
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,412
That's how I met Reese,
my husband.

335
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,748
He wooed me with ballads
and fiddle music.

336
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,344
I've been writing them down
since I came to live here.

337
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,788
You can have them
if you like.

338
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,120
Thank you, thank you.

339
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,423
they are indeed exactly
what I'm looking for, but...

340
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,023
I'm afraid these haven't been
scientifically collected.

341
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,031
Oh.

342
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,068
Well I can't be sure
of your notation, you see,

343
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,372
because of the irregular times
and unusual modes of the tunes.

344
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,641
Of course,
I understand perfectly.

345
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,646
Oh...

346
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,248
that is beautiful.

347
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,180
Come here, child.

348
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,998
Viney: You are weak as water.

349
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,867
Oh, that baby is sucking
the life out of you.

350
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,269
Uh-uh.
You got to eat more.

351
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,433
I can barely
feed the children.

352
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,066
Reese gone again?

353
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,384
- Mrs. Kincaid, thank you.
- Thank you.

354
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,550
Here now, you...

355
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,783
make a potion out of this.
Drink it twice a day,

356
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,759
and do not go dragging
all over the place.

357
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,559
Viney, the ballads
are a precious musical legacy.

358
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,100
Why, they're just songs.

359
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,635
Oh, no, Mrs. Butler,
they're not.

360
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,536
They're ancient ballads
from England and Scotland

361
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,540
and they've been sung
for hundreds of years.

362
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:01,545
they say that my great-granddaddy
come from there.

363
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,174
He came over that mountain
in 1743.

364
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,376
Really?

365
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,214
No one knows that these songs
are being sung

366
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,686
right here in the mountains
of America, no one.

367
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,155
What of it?

368
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,556
Music experts
will want to know.

369
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,357
So I am going to write them down
and publish them in a songbook.

370
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,763
Well, Lord knows I can't
read and write anyhow.

371
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,027
Viney,

372
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,865
I think she's
a very nice lady.

373
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,173
Viney on record:
(music) Is this young Jimmy Scot himself (music)

374
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,080
(music) Or Jimmy Scotland's king? (music)

375
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,779
(music) Or is it the father
of that bastard child (music)

376
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:45,414
(music) From Scotland
just come in? (music)

377
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,324
(music) Or is it the father
of that bastard child (music)

378
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,421
(music) From Scotland
just come in? (music)

379
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:01,830
(music) He took the brown girl
by the hand (music)

380
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:06,310
(music) And lead her
across the hall (music)

381
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,814
(music) He took out his sword (music)

382
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,247
(music) And cut off her head (music)

383
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,878
(music) And kicked it
against the wall (music)

384
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,446
(music) And he kicked it
against the wall. (music)

385
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,250
have you got it?

386
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,522
One more time, Viney.

387
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,359
I thought
you've done this before.

388
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,466
Viney.

389
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,501
Oh, Tom!

390
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,161
Is the day gone already?

391
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,397
Sure is.

392
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,737
Corn is coming up fine
in that back field.

393
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,875
Oh, this is Dr. Lily Penleric.

394
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,039
She's Miss Elna's sister.

395
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,274
Hm.

396
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,613
How do you do?

397
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,651
How do you do?

398
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,292
Viney: Lily is a doctor
of music.

399
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,124
She's catching
my old love songs.

400
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,993
She says they’re important.

401
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,966
Important?
Important to who?

402
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,434
I'm going to publish them
in a songbook.

403
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,997
No, you're not.

404
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,736
Nobody's gonna publish
my granny's songs.

405
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,041
This is my grandson,
Tom Bledsoe.

406
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,205
He's been to the other world

407
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,408
and he thinks he knows
a whole lot.

408
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,281
Mr. Bledsoe,
I am a collector.

409
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,985
My intention is to exalt
the fine music of these mountains.

410
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,117
Exalt?

411
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,589
Yes, it means "to lift up."

412
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:37,157
You mean exploit.
It means "to steal."

413
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,631
I am a musicologist,
not a thief.

414
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,640
My work is to preserve
musical culture.

415
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,142
First it was the coal and lumber
companies coming in here

416
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,736
now they want to take
our music, too.

417
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,280
These songs are
of great interest

418
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,543
to anyone who studies
musical heritage.

419
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,017
You're gonna get paid for it,
ain't you?

420
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,919
- Yes, I am.
- See, Granny, let me handle this.

421
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,253
I can assure you
it will not make me rich.

422
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,587
- Um-hmm.
- And frankly,

423
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,321
I'm the one who's going
to all the trouble

424
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,885
and expense
of collecting the songs

425
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,158
and I'm the one
who has the expertise

426
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,824
to write them down
and categorize them properly

427
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,026
and scientifically.

428
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,899
Oh, you do, do you?
What's in it for my granny?

429
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,807
Her name will appear before
each one of the songs

430
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,070
which I include in the book,

431
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,668
as the source from which
I have collected it.

432
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,578
"By Viney Butler,"
that's what it's gonna say, Tom.

433
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,549
Well, you can't collect
from my granny,

434
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,210
unless you pay her.

435
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,185
I have offered.
She refused.

436
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,518
You refused?

437
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,462
How can I take money
for singing?

438
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,089
My mama used to sing
those songs

439
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,794
rocking the young-uns to sleep
and leading the cows home.

440
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,802
Doctor, I'm asking
you kindly...

441
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,134
to leave.

442
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,037
Viney: Tom!

443
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,941
I can give my songs
to anybody that I want to.

444
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,037
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

445
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,311
Besides, it's supper time
and Lily's joining us.

446
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,478
Uh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Butler.

447
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,852
Really, I should be
heading back to the school.

448
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,686
You're gonna take my songs
and refuse

449
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:10,159
the hospitality of my home?
Well, I never.

450
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,712
My man's father built this place
when he settled here.

451
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,609
I’ve raised nine children
in this cabin,

452
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,814
only two of them still living.

453
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,550
I'm sorry.

454
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,286
Oh, one's working the coal mines
up in Virginia

455
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,725
and one's in Missouri.

456
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,904
(belching)

457
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,306
That was good, Granny,

458
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,105
(tuning)

459
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,012
Tom's a fine musician.

460
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,782
Really?

461
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,153
Um-hmm, he plays the banjo
like nobody.

462
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,158
Oh, Tom!

463
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,057
Tom, what's that thing called?

464
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,494
- That thing?
- It's a guitar, Granny.

465
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,395
How many times
do I got to tell you?

466
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,627
He got it in Cuba,
Tom did,

467
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,397
in the Spanish War.

468
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,301
It's a lovely instrument.

469
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,738
Mmm, he is the only one
in these parts

470
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,276
got one of those things.
He makes up songs on it, too.

471
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,780
Do you play music, Doctor,

472
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,373
or do you just steal
other people's?

473
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,080
I am a pianist, Mr. Bledsoe.

474
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,784
A pianist?

475
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,588
I heard of them!

476
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,791
Tom, come on, play some
banjo tunes for Lily here.

477
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,493
Come on! Come on!

478
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,959
please, I would like that.

479
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,542
(fast picking)

480
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,502
(Viney clapping, laughing)

481
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,867
(door bangs open)

482
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,006
Hilliard, you almost
scared me to death!

483
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,202
Sorry, Viney.

484
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,245
You coming, Tom?!

485
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,040
I'll be right there.

486
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,417
Mr. Bledsoe, where did you
learn to play like that?

487
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,854
I taught him.

488
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,721
I would like to record you
on my phonograph sometime.

489
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,664
No, thank you.
I make music to please myself.

490
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,624
(door slamming shut)

491
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,236
Never mind Tom.

492
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,104
He's like most
of those fellows

493
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,667
who went to the other world
and come back...

494
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,213
he just never seemed
to be the same.

495
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,110
they just can't seem
to settle down

496
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,709
and be happy.

497
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,158
Would you show me
how to play this?

498
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,890
Hmm.

499
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,901
Well, it's all in the picking.

500
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,568
(up tempo tune)

501
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,511
Fate, did you see to Alice
and her young-uns?

502
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,711
Yes, ma'am, I caught them
a couple of rabbits.

503
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,686
- We had a fine supper.
- Good.

504
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,449
Oh, we have all to do
tomorrow,

505
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,185
these old songs
are coming back to me now.

506
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,487
Well, I'm looking
forward to it.

507
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,549
Oh, Lily...

508
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,223
Listen, if you hear
a strange cry,

509
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:13,202
like a woman screaming,
that's the panther cat.

510
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,205
And you're gonna be dead
if it gets you.

511
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:19,642
What you do is pull off
your clothes one piece at a time

512
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,679
and run real hard.

513
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,611
And then the panther cat
will stop

514
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,649
and tear up the clothes
that you dropped in its path

515
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,652
to shreds!
And that will save you!

516
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,981
Viney, that is ridiculous.

517
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,597
Lily: Oops.

518
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,059
(owl hooting)

519
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,573
- What was that?
- Just an owl.

520
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,835
Are you sure?

521
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,173
You'll know the panther cry
when you hear it.

522
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,610
- (rifle cocking)
- Fate!

523
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,308
Damn near got your fool head
blown off.

524
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,816
I didn't know you had
a still going here.

525
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,976
What about her?

526
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,882
What about her?

527
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,128
Go on, get,
both of you.

528
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,900
- Fate.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,079
Eleanor? Eleanor?

530
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,438
Eleanor...

531
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,974
I have had the most
remarkable day.

532
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:35,985
(gasping)

533
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,623
Oh, no.

534
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,207
Lily, I'd like
to talk with you.

535
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,111
I'm very tired.

536
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,849
I don't want to talk.

537
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,054
I think we should talk.

538
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,473
(sighing)

539
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,941
How could you, Eleanor?

540
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,275
You sound so like Father.

541
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,440
I'm not a child.

542
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,450
You're teachers!

543
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,009
What kind of an example
are you setting?

544
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,248
You're disgusting.

545
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,867
She's the finest person
I have ever known.

546
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,385
And I suppose...

547
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,114
Harriet is a lot older and...

548
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,247
more experienced
than you, so...

549
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,224
I suppose it's her fault.

550
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,090
It's nobody's fault.

551
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,703
We're in love.

552
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,867
Viney: (music) She drew
her little pen knife (music)

553
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,036
(music) And stabbed him
through his heart (music)

554
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,012
(music) She cried out
with a very loud cry (music)

555
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,015
(music) There's a dead man
in my house, house (music)

556
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,211
(music) There's a dead man
in my house. (music)

557
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,810
We came to see the machine

558
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,116
that sings the songs
back to you.

559
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,122
I'm not using it
at the moment.

560
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,184
See, you got to save it, Polly,
or it will wear out.

561
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,026
My brother's a songcatcher.

562
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,157
That's very nice, but I'm afraid
he's a bit too little

563
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,360
to be a reliable source.

564
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,164
Come on, Tommy Lee,
you can sing for me.

565
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,704
Girl: Oh, shotgun.
Man: What songs you know?

566
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,706
- (cocking)
- Girl: Come on.

567
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:48,040
Get the hell out of my yard,
Earl Giddens.

568
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,104
I've been hearing this excitement
about the songcatcher,

569
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,615
I came to see for myself.

570
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,344
Tom told you we're not selling.

571
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,716
He also told you
he'd shoot you on the spot

572
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,516
if you came round again.

573
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,649
Viney, it's that kind of talk
gives city folk

574
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,058
a terrible impression
of us hillbillies.

575
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,065
- Isn't that right, miss?
- Doctor Lily Penleric.

576
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,864
Doctor!
Well, Earl Giddens,

577
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,336
McFarland Coal Company.

578
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,272
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, Doctor.

579
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,468
It's fine to see
an outsider appreciating

580
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,910
the charm of our local music.

581
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,708
For myself however,
there is nothing like

582
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,544
the elegant perfection
of the compositions

583
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,176
by Mr. Johann Sebastian Bach.

584
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:34,787
I don't think such comparisons
benefit either tradition.

585
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,985
they are apples and oranges.

586
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,893
Are you a musician?

587
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,226
No, ma'am.

588
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,324
- Oh.
- I've been down the mountain.

589
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,460
I had the privilege
of education.

590
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,868
Bachelor of Sciences,
University of North Carolina.

591
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,873
Really?

592
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,034
I guess I see your point.

593
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,076
Maybe you can
talk some sense

594
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,414
into this stubborn
old woman, Dr. Lily.

595
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,214
Mrs. Butler?

596
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,619
She has no need
of my advice.

597
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,157
Don't you think
she deserves

598
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,251
a nice new house
in Sawyerville?

599
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,558
Time to sing and rest?

600
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,291
She could even learn
to read and write,

601
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,232
instead of working her fingers
to the bone just to get by.

602
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,496
I can make a living on a rock
if I wanted to.

603
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,971
I was born on this mountain
and I'm gonna die on this mountain.

604
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,942
And so are you.
Get going, Giddens.

605
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,412
This place is nothing
but a burden for Tom, Viney.

606
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,712
You know he was made
for other things besides farming.

607
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:37,447
(painful screaming)

608
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,024
Alice: Oh. Oh...

609
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,754
(howling)

610
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,124
Isabel, go to my place.
Take the children to my place,

611
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,000
and tell Tom to bring
the milk cow.

612
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,402
Isabel:
Come on, y'all. Come on.

613
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,505
- I'll take them, Viney.
- No! I want you here.

614
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,784
Alice: Help me, help me, please,
I'm dying.

615
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,753
Oh, I can't stop the bleeding
until I get the baby out.

616
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,820
You gotta help me.

617
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,058
(moaning)

618
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,657
No, no, I couldn't.

619
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,895
She can't do it by herself.

620
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,666
Come here, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

621
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,673
Now put them right here,
like that.

622
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,108
When I tell you to,
you push... hard.

623
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,738
- No. No. No.
- Do it, woman!

624
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,408
Viney: Ready?

625
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:42,951
Now!

626
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,045
Viney: Well, I guess
the good Lord's gonna let us

627
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,707
keep you a little while longer.

628
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,615
And you got yourself here,

629
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,848
another sweet, little
baby girl.

630
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,517
Will she live?

631
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,891
Well, it was a struggle
there for a bit,

632
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,363
but it's in the good Lord's
hands now.

633
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,093
(sighing)

634
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:39,973
Alice, you're gonna have to keep
Reese away from you.

635
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,473
Well, if you
don't want butter,

636
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,075
you got to pull
the dasher out in time.

637
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,421
(snickering)

638
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,331
Oh, sweet baby girl.

639
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,670
I hope you grow up smart
like Lily here

640
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,402
and stay single.

641
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,870
(music) When I was single (music)

642
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,780
(music) When I dressed
mighty fine (music)

643
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,011
(music) Now I am married (music)

644
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,452
(music) Go ragged all the time (music)

645
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,481
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

646
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,924
(music) O, Lord, (music)

647
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:34,363
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

648
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,558
(chuckling)

649
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,931
(music) When I was single (music)

650
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,664
(music) My shoes did squeak (music)

651
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,070
(music) Now I am married (music)

652
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,335
(music) My shoes they do leak (music)

653
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,436
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

654
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,707
(music) O Lord, (music)

655
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:55,878
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

656
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,353
(music) Three little babes (music)

657
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,152
(music) Are crying for bread (music)

658
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,693
(music) With none to give them (music)

659
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,888
(music) I'd rather be dead (music)

660
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,797
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

661
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,266
(music) O Lord, (music)

662
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:15,431
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

663
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,837
(laughing)

664
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,966
(music) When he comes in (music)

665
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,206
(music) It's a curse and a row (music)

666
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,770
(music) knocking down the children (music)

667
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,044
(music) And pulling out my hair (music)

668
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,349
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

669
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,616
(music) O Lord, (music)

670
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,559
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

671
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,960
(music) Dishes to wash... (music)

672
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,464
Reese, where in hell
have you been?

673
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,330
Alice.

674
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,034
You came home.

675
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,705
Lily...

676
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,246
please take the painting.

677
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,091
Tom: Did she live?

678
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,533
Yes.

679
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,313
What about the baby?

680
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,017
Hopefully.

681
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,117
Thank the Lord.

682
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,248
(pops cork)

683
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,587
(sighing)

684
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,727
You're having a real backwoods
experience, ain't you?

685
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,239
Are you drunk?

686
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,779
I'm not drunk,
I'm...

687
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,351
celebrating.

688
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,015
Lily: There's no cause
for celebration, Mr. Bledsoe.

689
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,819
they could still die.

690
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,127
In case it's news to you,
Doctor,

691
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,221
suffering is a woman's lot.

692
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,392
I am perfectly well aware
of that fact, Mr. Bledsoe.

693
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,437
God knows, I wish I weren't.

694
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,028
You really are an ignorant,
drunken lout.

695
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,199
You have absolutely no idea
what that woman

696
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,072
- has just been through!
- Let me tell you something.

697
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,877
My wife died at childbirth

698
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,143
when we were 16 years old.

699
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,319
She bled to death
after I pulled our dead baby out.

700
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,017
So don't you tell me
what I do and don't know!

701
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,404
"Dear Wallace,

702
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,345
Enclosed are 10
of the beautiful ballads

703
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,282
I have collected so far.

704
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,818
I am sure you will realize

705
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,719
what a remarkable
discovery this is.

706
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,916
The songs are virtually
intact,

707
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,516
according to the oldest
known versions,

708
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,563
with wonderful, idiosyncratic
local changes

709
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,827
in a lyric or phrase
here or there.

710
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,198
Best wishes,
Lily."

711
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,531
(banjo strumming)

712
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,137
Whoo! Lord.

713
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,202
Your playing is beautiful.

714
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,707
Actually, that was one of my tunes.
Dexter here just...

715
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:25,619
took it over,
and made it his own.

716
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,351
- Such striking rhythms.
- Thank you, ma'am.

717
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,321
I'm Lily Penleric.

718
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,523
She's a musicologist.

719
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,895
Mister...?

720
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,129
- Dexter Speaks, ma'am.
- Well, how do you do?

721
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,501
Would you look at Del?

722
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,335
(laughing)

723
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,965
She's all bug eyed.

724
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,306
Ain't you ever seen
a colored man before?

725
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,538
Where would I have?

726
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:50,841
(chuckling)

727
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,575
Tom: Where you all headed?

728
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,846
Rose Gentry's.

729
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,114
I'm gonna help Doc here

730
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,748
with writing down
Rose's ballads.

731
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,315
We're going everywhere
the sweet music is.

732
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,826
Rose?

733
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,692
Rose lives way off back
and beyond.

734
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,163
You'll never get there
with that load.

735
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,496
You can't tell
this woman nothing, Tom.

736
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:12,667
Huh.

737
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,436
Well, aren't you lucky?

738
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,702
Sitting around all day
getting drunk, playing music?

739
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,404
- How lovely.
- Yes, I am.

740
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,969
See, that's what you outlanders
don't understand.

741
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,311
Life is for enjoying,

742
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,978
not just getting and working,
and getting and working.

743
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,647
We do indeed have very different
notions of what enjoyment is.

744
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,263
Deladis: Wait...!

745
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,703
Lily: Fate... careful.

746
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,314
(grunting)

747
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,084
Lily: Oh...!

748
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,457
Stop.

749
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,723
(panting)

750
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,867
I told you,

751
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,335
we couldn't get there
with this thing.

752
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,202
Where's your...

753
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,504
pioneer spirit, Fate?

754
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,875
We can't give-up.

755
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,846
Come on, let's keep trying.

756
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,541
No, Del.

757
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,550
She's crazy.
I've been lugging this thing

758
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,176
everywhere it don't belong.

759
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,313
I'm not risking life and limb
for no stupid song.

760
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,323
I need these recordings.

761
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,292
I need them,
right, Deladis?

762
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,852
Doc...

763
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,330
no one's ever tried to...

764
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,594
haul a thing
like this up here.

765
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,896
Until now. Come along.

766
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,304
I'll show you,
Mr. Honeycutt,

767
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,604
what you can achieve
if you don't give-up.

768
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:00,973
- (grunting)
- No!

769
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,981
(panting)

770
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:09,984
You...!

771
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,586
I will not give-up!

772
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,298
Come along.

773
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,234
please, Fate, come with us.

774
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,187
I decided to take
your offer, Earl.

775
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,452
A dollar an acre
and jobs for me and my boys.

776
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,351
Why, if it ain't
the songcatcher.

777
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,624
Earl: Dr. Lily...

778
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,899
you sure do get around,
don't you?

779
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,095
Lily: Nice to see you again,
Mr. Giddens.

780
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,661
Mr. And Mrs. Gentry,

781
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,104
I'm Lily Penleric.

782
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,006
We heard you might be
coming this way.

783
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,443
Viney says Doc's awful nice

784
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,912
and you should sing for her.

785
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:14,246
Doctor, Uncle Cratis
is the one who knows

786
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,013
about every love song
there is.

787
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,954
Except Uncle Cratis got the calling.
He don't hold to singing no more.

788
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,014
I'm sorry, we've seem
to have come at a bad time.

789
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,856
No, we're about finished here.

790
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,793
I said I'd take
a dollar an acre.

791
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,058
Well, now Parley,

792
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,760
that was before I knew
the land was used up.

793
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,065
Well, I wouldn't be
selling it if it weren't.

794
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,729
I appreciate that,

795
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,740
but Mr. McFarland
would have my head

796
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,208
if I gave that much.

797
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,905
The most
I could give is say...

798
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,447
50 ¢ an acre.

799
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,616
What's that come to?

800
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,585
How many acres
you got again?

801
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,449
About 100,
my daddy always said.

802
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,326
- $50?
- That's all?

803
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,056
That's criminal, Mr. Giddens.

804
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,900
Don't butt in
where you don't belong.

805
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,959
Now the only way these folks
are going to better themselves

806
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,368
is to get the hell off
this mountain

807
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,497
and give-up
their backward ways.

808
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,542
Is that what
your education taught you,

809
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,839
to hate your own people?

810
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,536
(grunting)

811
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,670
(Deladi's screaming)

812
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,513
Fate: Damn you, Giddens,
you're as mean as a copperhead.

813
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,848
- Deladis: No!
- And I sleep like a snake, too.

814
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,318
With both eyes open.

815
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,549
(gun cocking)
Leave the boy, Earl.

816
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,559
Get on out of here.
The deal's done.

817
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,094
You got my word.

818
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:40,903
Get.

819
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,639
Good day, Doctor.

820
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,042
Is that any way to settle
anything, you stupid boy?

821
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,138
That man would steal the dime
off a dead man's eye.

822
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,059
I'm really very sorry.

823
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,303
(melancholy mid tempo tune)

824
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:37,858
(music) When I first come
to this country (music)

825
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,331
(music) In 1849 (music)

826
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:47,530
(music) I saw many fair lovers (music)

827
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:52,667
(music) But I never saw mine (music)

828
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:57,304
(music) I viewed it all around me (music)

829
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,180
(music) Saw I was quite alone (music)

830
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,813
(music) Me a poor stranger (music)

831
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:10,417
(music) And a long way from home (music)

832
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:15,761
(music) Fare thee well
to old Mother (music)

833
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:20,496
(music) Fare thee well
to father, too (music)

834
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,473
(music) I'm going for to ramble (music)

835
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:30,741
(music) This wide world all through (music)

836
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:35,615
(music) And when I get weary (music)

837
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:40,213
(music) I'll sit down and cry (music)

838
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,919
(music) Think of my Saro (music)

839
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,124
(music) Pretty Saro, my bride (music)

840
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:54,301
(music) Well, I wished
I was a turtle dove (music)

841
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,467
(music) Had wings and could fly (music)

842
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:03,343
(music) Far away
to my lover's lodgings (music)

843
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:08,077
(music) Tonight I draw nigh (music)

844
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:13,453
(music) And there in her
lily-white arms (music)

845
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:18,119
(music) I'd lay there all night (music)

846
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,325
(music) And watch through them
little windows (music)

847
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:27,803
(music) For the dawning of day. (music)

848
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,680
Man: The missionary board
is convinced

849
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,310
that the schools
would take hold better

850
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,823
in the mountain communities
if they’re led by a man and wife,

851
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,792
who would integrate
more normally into the community

852
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,088
than two women.

853
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,392
Fortunately for us, Reverend,

854
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,694
we're not under
your jurisdiction.

855
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,291
(chuckling)

856
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,735
I'm beginning to understand
your appreciation

857
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,670
of the local crafts,
Mrs. McFarland.

858
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,301
It's a beautifully made piece.
I have several like it.

859
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,538
She'll bankrupt me
with her collecting.

860
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,346
The Clover School is a model,

861
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,649
but the church is better
equipped to educate.

862
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,384
I endorse the English idea,

863
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,120
we must educate by example.

864
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,095
If we teach these ruffians
to serve tea properly,

865
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,596
they would want refinement,

866
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:29,893
seek it out.

867
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,957
I believe we must ask
the mountain people

868
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,900
what they want
and what they need.

869
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,631
That is the enlightened
point of view.

870
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,697
Man #2: Educating these savages
is a waste of money.

871
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,833
If you want to
help these children,

872
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,070
get them out of their hovels
and put them to work.

873
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,669
There's nothing like
a day's wages

874
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,442
to help make
for advancement.

875
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,453
It's a beautiful land,
isn't it, Mr. McFarland?

876
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,818
It's one of the largest,
untapped coal deposits

877
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,221
in the southern mountains,
Miss Tolliver.

878
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,783
And soon,
I'm gonna own it.

879
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,352
And with my coal mines
will come towns,

880
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,298
roads, railroads,
churches,

881
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,392
even a few more schools.

882
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,768
Although I don't share
the lofty ideals of you ladies,

883
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,636
I would like to make
a small donation

884
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,403
to the Clover school,

885
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,502
say, $500.

886
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,645
Thank you, but we couldn't
possibly accept such a gift,

887
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,151
despite our need.

888
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,711
Yes, it's essential we avoid
all political affiliations

889
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,951
to maintain the trust
of the community.

890
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,483
As far as I know, water pumps
don't have political affiliations.

891
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,862
Mr. McFarland, I thought
you supported Christian education.

892
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,766
I support progress,
Rev. Merriweather.

893
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,634
I also appreciate what
these ladies have accomplished.

894
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,971
I think this school
is the loveliest,

895
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,033
the way Miss Tolliver
and Miss Penleric

896
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,603
have used the local crafts
to decorate.

897
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,309
Are you aware
of the folk arts movement

898
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,648
that is sweeping
New York and London?

899
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,950
I'm quite a collector.

900
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,684
Doc's collecting songs.

901
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:04,090
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

902
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,627
Yes, I am.

903
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,963
Um...

904
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,101
(gasping)
Ah, it's beautiful.

905
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:17,128
So refined.
Was this painted by a local?

906
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:22,338
I knew you would
appreciate it.

907
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,142
Do you know I have sent
a dozen of these

908
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,876
to a gallery in New York?

909
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,441
The dealer is very excited.

910
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,816
Harriet:
Oh, look, everybody,

911
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,980
our musical entertainment
is here.

912
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,080
Hi, Will.

913
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,317
Deladis:
Hey, Will.

914
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,156
Harriet:
Everybody, this is Will.

915
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,661
Hello, Will.

916
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,720
Harriet: Why don't you play
"Sally Goodin"?

917
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,498
(up tempo melody)

918
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,875
Oh, Ambrose,
twirl me around the lawn.

919
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,552
Reverend: Miss Tolliver,
may I have the honor?

920
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,179
Harriet: I'd be delighted.

921
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,661
(song continues,
dancers whooping)

922
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:03,469
Whoo!

923
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,175
Ooh...!

924
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,846
Viney: Take a little bit.
Go on.

925
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,655
Viney: Isn't that good?

926
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,491
(cackling laugh)

927
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,258
(music tempo quickens)

928
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,093
Hey, Del.

929
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,994
Where have you been?
Miss Elna's been worried sick.

930
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,329
I ain't her concern no more.
Not hers or nobody's.

931
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,373
Man:
Go on out there, boy.

932
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,875
Woman:
Get on up there.

933
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,933
Miss Elna?

934
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,069
I'd be delighted.

935
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,851
A little space...
It's her chance, now.

936
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,123
Viney: Put out your hands
on your waist.

937
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,098
Come on, let's try it.

938
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,526
Lift them legs!

939
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,284
(laughing and cheering)

940
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,785
Man: Look out in there.

941
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,176
(scoffing)

942
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,075
Hello.

943
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,279
Would you care to...?

944
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,981
Maybe I was speaking a little
too proper to you before.

945
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,422
- Get your long legs out here.
- I don't think so.

946
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,392
Let me show you some
true country spirit.

947
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,019
- Come on.
- No, thank you.

948
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,087
I think perhaps you've had
a little too much to drink.

949
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,655
- Naw.
- No, thank you.

950
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,326
I'll show you right
what you need to know.

951
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,801
No, please, Mr. Bledsoe.

952
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,301
Get on out of here.

953
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,816
(punching and hollering)

954
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,192
(music continues)

955
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,589
(glass breaking)

956
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,200
(waltz tune plays softly)

957
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,484
It's very late.
We should get back.

958
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,679
I'll find my own way home.

959
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,949
I'll see the doctor gets home.

960
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,226
All right.

961
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,490
I'll be fine.
Good night.

962
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:22,895
Good night.

963
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,674
(strums softly)

964
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,621
Tom: Hey, Earl.

965
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,281
How's your head?

966
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,857
(chuckling)

967
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:08,471
(music) O what is this (music)

968
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,843
(music) I cannot see (music)

969
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,940
(music) Whose icy hand (music)

970
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,748
(music) Takes hold on me? (music)

971
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:22,313
(music) O I am Death (music)

972
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:26,521
(music) That none can excel (music)

973
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:30,896
(music) I open the door (music)

974
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:34,562
(music) To Heaven and Hell. (music)

975
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,308
(music) O Death, O Death (music)

976
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,942
(music) How can it be (music)

977
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,885
(music) that I must come (music)

978
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,889
(music) And go with thee? (music)

979
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,324
(music) For Death, O Death (music)

980
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,363
(music) How can it be? (music)

981
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,490
(music) I'm unprepared (music)

982
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,025
(music) For eternity (music)

983
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,972
(music) "O yes, I've come (music)

984
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,636
(music) For to get your soul (music)

985
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,236
(music) Take your body (music)

986
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,681
(music) And leave it cold (music)

987
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,278
(music) I'll drop the flesh (music)

988
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:29,381
(music) From off of your brain (music)

989
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,019
(music) The earth and the worms (music)

990
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:37,156
(music) Both have their claim" (music)

991
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,929
Woman:
(music) O Death, O Death, (music)

992
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,301
(music) please let me see (music)

993
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:47,331
(music) If Christ has turned (music)

994
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,073
(music) His back on me? (music)

995
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,310
(music) "When you were called (music)

996
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,250
(music) And asked to bow (music)

997
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,448
(music) You wouldn't take heed (music)

998
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:04,289
(music) And it's too late now" (music)

999
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,023
(music) Farewell, farewell (music)

1000
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,658
(music) To all farewell (music)

1001
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:15,431
(music) My doom is fixed (music)

1002
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:19,804
(music) I'm summoned to Hell (music)

1003
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:23,402
(music) As long as God (music)

1004
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,040
(music) In Heaven shall dwell (music)

1005
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,882
(music) My soul, my soul (music)

1006
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:35,390
(music) Shall scream in Hell. (music)

1007
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,397
We'll stay on here.

1008
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:53,438
I'm not grateful for your vain
gallantry, Mr. Bledsoe.

1009
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,035
I am perfectly capable
of looking out for myself.

1010
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,548
Oh, don't worry.
I'd beat that snake up for fun

1011
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,982
any day of the week.

1012
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,726
I have never heard such...

1013
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,696
...such singing.

1014
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,210
I never met an outlander
who likes music as much as you do.

1015
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,248
I have never been anywhere

1016
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,011
where the music is as much
a part of life as it is here.

1017
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:39,418
It's like the air
you all breathe.

1018
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,080
It's beautiful.

1019
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,000
I would like to discuss
something with you seriously.

1020
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,438
Serious?
What is it?

1021
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,735
It's about my work.

1022
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,004
Actually, it's about my book.

1023
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,374
I believe...

1024
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,044
that you could win public
sentiment over with your music.

1025
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,485
- Public sentiment?
- Yes.

1026
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,223
Let me tell you something,

1027
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,418
we're not really interested

1028
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,654
in what you people out there
think about us.

1029
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,788
- Well, you should be.
- Oh, yeah?

1030
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,993
What I'm trying to say
is when my book is published,

1031
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,332
I believe the mountain people
will be seen

1032
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,803
in a very different light.

1033
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,705
Oh, what is that light,
may I ask?

1034
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,572
Well, the common view

1035
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:37,009
is that there is
no culture here,

1036
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,570
and that the people
are dirty, ignorant and savage.

1037
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,242
You forgot illiterate
and inbred.

1038
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:45,219
The only way to preserve
our way of life up here

1039
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,688
is to keep your way
of life down there.

1040
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,657
That is the way you kill something,
by shutting it out...

1041
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,751
You know what?
You just don't understand,

1042
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,887
and you never will.

1043
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,923
We just want
to be left alone, see?

1044
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,628
Then the mountain ways
will die.

1045
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,034
We'll see.

1046
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,433
I don't want to fight with you.

1047
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,100
Me neither.

1048
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,644
We just keep getting off
on the wrong foot, don't we?

1049
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,172
Good night.

1050
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,648
Can I take my wrong feet
and walk you home?

1051
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,881
No, I can find my own way.
Thank you.

1052
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,856
I promised... Miss Elna.

1053
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,416
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
I am the big sister...

1054
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,654
not Elna.

1055
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,129
O-ho-ho, I noticed.

1056
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,994
I noticed.

1057
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,559
(singing)

1058
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,247
(piercing shriek)

1059
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,399
(shriek)

1060
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,148
(growling and clothes tearing)

1061
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,024
(shriek)

1062
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,236
(shriek)

1063
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,008
(gasping)

1064
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,017
Tom: Whoa! Whoa!

1065
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,812
- Whoa.
- (Lily laughing)

1066
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,754
Here you go.

1067
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,850
Why won't you admit it was you?
Give me that.

1068
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,554
- It was you.
- But it wasn't me.

1069
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,460
It had to be the panther.

1070
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,931
Either that or maybe you...

1071
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,662
- maybe you imagined it.
- I did not imagine it.

1072
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,228
It was as real
as you and me.

1073
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,331
Ooh...

1074
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,240
Why aren't you married?

1075
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,713
Why aren't you?

1076
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:04,410
I've been married.
Twice.

1077
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,580
My second wife died
of lung fever.

1078
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,456
I'm sorry.

1079
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,655
I'm a jinx for a woman, Lily.

1080
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,999
I'm not your average woman.

1081
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,503
No, you're not, are you?

1082
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,799
Deladis:
(music) O holiday, O holy day (music)

1083
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,104
(music) The first day of they ear (music)

1084
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,701
(music) Little Matthy Groves
to church to goes (music)

1085
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,974
(music) Some holy words to hear (music)

1086
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,176
(music) Hear some holy words
to hear. (music)

1087
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,048
Come on, Doc,
you know this one.

1088
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:15,022
Both: (music) He spied some women
dressed in black (music)

1089
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,115
(music) As they came into view (music)

1090
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,093
(music) Lord Daniel's wife
was gaily clad (music)

1091
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,062
(music) The flower of the few (music)

1092
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,032
(music) Few, the flower of the few (music)

1093
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,762
(music) She stepped up
to Little Matthy Groves (music)

1094
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:30,066
(music) Her eyes cast
on the ground (music)

1095
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,107
(music) "Oh, please,
oh, please come with me (music)

1096
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,438
(music) Stay as you pass
through this town (music)

1097
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,968
(music) Town, as you pass
through this town." (music)

1098
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,741
- Deladis...
- Hmm?

1099
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,806
You are officially
my assistant now,

1100
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,614
and it's going to say so
in my book.

1101
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,177
(music) "O what is this?"
Said Little Matthy Groves (music)

1102
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,588
(music) As he sat up in bed (music)

1103
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,183
(music) "I fear it is
your husband's mad (music)

1104
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,888
(music) And I will soon be dead (music)

1105
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,489
(music) Dead, I will soon be dead" (music)

1106
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:00,126
(music) But Little Matthy Groves
he laid back down (music)

1107
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,033
(music) And soon fell off to sleep (music)

1108
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,664
(music) When he woke up,
Lord Daniel (music)

1109
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,935
(music) Was standing
at his bed feet (music)

1110
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:10,274
(music) Feet, standing
at his bed feet (music)

1111
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,609
(music) Saying, " How do you like
my snow white pillows?" (music)

1112
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,343
(music) Saying, " How do you
like my sheets? (music)

1113
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,079
(music) How do you like my pretty
little woman (music)

1114
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,347
(music) That's a-lying
in your arms asleep? (music)

1115
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:23,050
(music) Sleep, lying
in your arms asleep?" (music)

1116
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,821
(music) The first swing
that Little Matthy made (music)

1117
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,919
(music) It hurt Lord Daniel sore (music)

1118
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,328
(music) The next swing
that Lord Daniel made (music)

1119
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,697
(music) Little Matthy hit the floor (music)

1120
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:33,996
(music) Floor, Little Matthy
hit the floor (music)

1121
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,001
(cocking)

1122
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,470
What do you want?

1123
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:43,708
Uh...

1124
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,111
Parley Gentry sent us.

1125
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,342
My name is Lily Penleric.

1126
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,214
We are looking
for Uncle Cratis.

1127
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:51,877
What for?

1128
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:54,252
I'm a song collector.

1129
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,814
Parley says
Uncle Cratis knows

1130
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,723
about every
love song there is.

1131
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,729
We're making a book.

1132
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,524
Cratis got religion.
He don't do no singing no more.

1133
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,930
Well, perhaps
if I spoke with him...?

1134
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,943
Cratis!

1135
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,546
(music) Uncle Cratis. (music)

1136
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,987
You gonna burn in Hell,
Josie Moore.

1137
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,888
Mr. Kincaid?

1138
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,360
Do I know you, woman?

1139
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:43,737
I'm your wife's friend.

1140
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,799
You all go on.
We got no songs here.

1141
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,806
Your family needs you,
Mr. Kincaid.

1142
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,214
Reese belongs here with me.

1143
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,282
Go on.

1144
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,052
Alice: How can I thank you?

1145
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,958
Alice, you don't have to.

1146
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,657
I've barely been able
to keep body and soul together

1147
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,722
since Reese left again.

1148
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,598
People have been helping out
the best they can, but...

1149
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,331
Lily: Well, now that...

1150
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,635
Clementine McFarland
is collecting your paintings,

1151
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,106
others will as well.

1152
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,335
Maybe I should take the children
down to Asheville.

1153
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,243
I mean, if what you say
is true,

1154
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,942
I could provide for us
in a big town.

1155
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:30,783
Hello, Alice.

1156
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,150
- Daddy?
- Reese?

1157
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,552
Daddy.

1158
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,856
Well, he y, big man.

1159
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,723
Hey, little bit.

1160
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,763
- Hey.
- Hey.

1161
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,133
You look pretty today, Alice.

1162
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:50,967
You remember, Dr. Penleric,
don't you?

1163
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,529
Mr. Kincaid.

1164
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:55,808
(grunting)

1165
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,175
Hey, Del.

1166
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,875
Hey.

1167
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,110
Hey, Del.

1168
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,815
Fate: "It is..."

1169
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:09,888
"It is dep..."

1170
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,791
What are you doing
reading other people's writing?

1171
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,732
"It is deplorable...

1172
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,263
that the literature
of the ballad

1173
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:26,307
has attracted
so much more attention

1174
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,172
than the music.

1175
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:32,612
The two elements
should never be disassociated.

1176
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,148
The music and text

1177
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,117
are one and indivisible,

1178
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,812
and to separate one
from the other

1179
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:42,254
is to remove the processed gem
from its beautiful setting."

1180
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,019
Oh, Lord.

1181
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,491
What are you laughing at?

1182
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,586
She's just saying our songs
are finer than frog hair.

1183
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,256
You're going soft
in the head, Tom.

1184
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,129
- Yeah, maybe.
- (women laughing)

1185
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,770
Tom: Ladies.

1186
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,541
Hello.

1187
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,912
What are you doing here?

1188
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,109
Uh...

1189
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,244
I brought you something.

1190
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:18,985
Come on.

1191
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,829
- You shouldn't have.
- Well, I did.

1192
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,429
- It's warm today, huh?
- Yes.

1193
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,907
Elna: Tom...?

1194
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,742
Why don't you
advise my sister

1195
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,443
to join us at the picnic
this afternoon?

1196
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,350
I haven't had any luck.
Perhaps you might.

1197
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,714
What, and leave her work?

1198
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:54,225
Deladis, are you ready?

1199
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,786
Um...

1200
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:00,100
I ain't going.

1201
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:03,035
It's too hot and muggy
for a picnic.

1202
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,596
All right, suit yourself.

1203
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,877
Let me show you this here.
A noter.

1204
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,005
A what?

1205
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,573
Noter.
Take that in your left hand,

1206
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:18,585
and you play these strings.

1207
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,149
Let's go for a walk.

1208
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,556
Ah, yes.

1209
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,958
We'll leave you two
to your music lesson.

1210
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,469
Tom: You know, it ain't
none of my business...

1211
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,812
Miss Harriet and Miss Elna...

1212
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,081
they’re...

1213
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,176
What?

1214
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,615
Sweethearts,
I guess you call it.

1215
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,021
(women giggling)

1216
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,992
Don't be ridiculous.

1217
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,257
Listen, it don't bother me none.
It would rile most people,

1218
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,161
but it don't bother me none.

1219
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,640
I'm sure it's only because
they’re so isolated.

1220
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,170
Who else would they be with?

1221
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:19,111
Well, certainly not
a mountain man.

1222
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,781
(giggling)

1223
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:08,091
I see you two.
Now you quit that.

1224
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,926
Fate: Hey, Johnson.

1225
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,933
I got a letter here
for the doctor.

1226
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,902
She ain't here right now,
but you can leave it.

1227
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,599
No, no.
You see this here word?

1228
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,334
That means it's important

1229
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,308
and she got to get it
right away.

1230
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,777
Urgent? I can read.

1231
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:28,213
She's gone to Alton's Creek.
I'll take it over.

1232
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:30,251
You'd do that for me,
ol' Fate?

1233
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,252
Sure, Johnson, sure.

1234
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,118
- I'll go with you.
- Naw, you stay here.

1235
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,055
- Why?
- 'Cause I said.

1236
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,116
Uh-uh,
I'm coming with you.

1237
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,128
You deliver it
into her own hands.

1238
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,528
Oh, I will, I will.

1239
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:45,225
Thank you.

1240
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,289
Bye.

1241
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,038
Sure, I'll deliver
the letter, Doc.

1242
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,904
You can't do that.
That's Doc's letter.

1243
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,637
- Give me that.
- Come and get it.

1244
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,077
Del, come back here!

1245
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,136
(Deladi's laughing)

1246
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,981
Oof, shit.

1247
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:43,888
Del?

1248
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,354
Oh, God!

1249
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:18,357
Oh, God.

1250
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:26,366
(sobbing)
Oh, God.

1251
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,698
Elna, we have to get back
to the school.

1252
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,704
Elna!

1253
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,000
Fate!

1254
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,335
Elna!

1255
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,072
Deladis:
Johnson said it was urgent.

1256
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,513
(giggling)

1257
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,830
Wallace's voice:
"Dear Lily,

1258
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,030
It is with great pride
that I write.

1259
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,005
I took the liberty of showing

1260
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,803
the ballads you sent me
to Cyrus Whittle.

1261
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,401
He immediately confirmed
the importance of your discovery

1262
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:13,811
and thinks it imperative
the ballads be collected urgently.

1263
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,077
The dean has secured the funds.

1264
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:17,948
You'll be thrilled to know
Whittle himself

1265
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,884
intends to collect the songs

1266
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,651
and insisted that you continue
as his assistant."

1267
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,386
Assistant!?

1268
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:29,560
"please respond immediately.

1269
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,326
Regards, Wallace."

1270
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,301
Uncle Cratis is preaching
the gospel tomorrow.

1271
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,633
Yes, dear.

1272
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,900
Deladis: Can I wear
my new green calico?

1273
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,587
(screaming)

1274
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,653
No!

1275
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:36,788
It's afire!

1276
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,958
Elna:
Harriet, no! Run!

1277
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:43,427
Oh, no.

1278
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,996
Come on. Come on.

1279
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,439
Oh, my God.

1280
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:51,338
(whooping and laughing)

1281
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,477
- My glasses!
- No, no, no.

1282
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,791
Elna: Lily!

1283
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:17,203
Lily!

1284
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,184
Goodbye, my darling girl.

1285
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:08,565
Tom: Oh, good Lord.

1286
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,210
Go away.

1287
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,722
Elna...?

1288
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:06,166
How am I going to live
without her?

1289
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:14,672
Perhaps you could find her.

1290
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,806
She swore if anyone
ever found out...

1291
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,372
she'd disappear.

1292
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,923
My Harriet.

1293
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,367
I'm sorry.

1294
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:45,934
I'm so sorry.

1295
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,284
Hey, Doc, look.

1296
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:40,559
Deladis: Doc?

1297
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,296
Cratis: You all don't
have to believe me,

1298
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,861
but you got to believe
the word of God.

1299
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,407
I know you believe the Bible,
and the Bible says,

1300
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:58,502
"For her sins
have reached unto Heaven

1301
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:02,606
and God has remembered
her iniquities."

1302
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:06,175
- Amen.
- "Therefore shall her plagues

1303
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,188
come in one day.

1304
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,520
Death, and mourning
and famine

1305
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:15,893
and she shall be utterly
destroyed with fire."

1306
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:17,362
Amen.

1307
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:22,061
"For strong is the Lord God
that judges her."

1308
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,068
Amen.

1309
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:28,571
Where did you get to?
I was looking for you.

1310
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,237
"Thou has polluted the land
with thy whoredoms

1311
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:33,109
and with thy wickedness"!

1312
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,545
Amen.

1313
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:37,616
I'm going to bust you up,
Hilliard!

1314
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:38,913
Tom!

1315
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:41,978
They're the whores
of Babylon come to tempt us, Tom!

1316
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:45,492
That snake right there,
and that little weasel next to him,

1317
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,791
they’re the ones who set fire
to the school!

1318
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:52,390
And all this while women
and children were still inside!

1319
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:54,832
They're evil women!

1320
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,199
Now are you going
to listen to them

1321
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,033
or are you going
to listen to me?

1322
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,471
I am ashamed of you boys.

1323
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:06,039
I ain't seen nothing but good
come out of that school.

1324
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:10,413
Them women were sent
by the devil himself.

1325
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:13,317
Only wickedness comes
of book learning.

1326
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,412
- Amen!
- Cratis...

1327
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:18,083
I ain't never had a chance
to learn nothing.

1328
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,286
And my kids ain't neither

1329
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,989
because they is always
working too hard

1330
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:24,827
keeping food on the table.

1331
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:28,528
But I got grandbabies
as smart as any others!

1332
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,036
And I want them
to have a chance.

1333
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,664
Man: That's the devil
speaking through him.

1334
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,173
- Amen.
- Amen.

1335
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:35,538
Reese Kincaid!

1336
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,444
You said
you'd never leave me.

1337
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,175
Josie...

1338
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:54,057
Tom: (music) A lilac comes (music)

1339
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,892
(music) On a poisoned thorn (music)

1340
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:06,138
(music) It has roots
dirty and torn (music)

1341
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:12,540
(music) Young-uns a-playin' (music)

1342
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,776
(music) As the black crow flies (music)

1343
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:21,453
(music) Mama's weeping (music)

1344
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:23,922
(music) Hear the mountains cry (music)

1345
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:29,627
(music) There was another (music)

1346
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:33,766
(music) A wild dirt flower (music)

1347
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:39,973
(music) Cold was her heart (music)

1348
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,374
(music) And as dark as dire (music)

1349
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:49,173
(music) Tears on the ground (music)

1350
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:52,515
(music) For her love did die (music)

1351
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:57,087
(music) 'Neath the bloody moon (music)

1352
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,950
(music) Hear the mountains cry (music)

1353
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,524
(music) Oh, dig his grave (music)

1354
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:10,503
(music) Narrow and deep (music)

1355
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:16,605
(music) Set a jug of whiskey (music)

1356
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:20,943
(music) By his thirsty feet (music)

1357
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:25,679
(music) And lay two pennies (music)

1358
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:29,052
(music) On his roving eyes (music)

1359
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:34,558
(music) Two women wailing (music)

1360
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:37,995
(music) As the mountains cry. (music)

1361
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:41,725
Thank you, dear.

1362
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:45,404
Elna...

1363
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:49,733
will you be all right
if I leave?

1364
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:51,300
So soon?

1365
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:56,111
Why don't you come with me?

1366
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:58,310
You can live as you please
in a big city.

1367
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,947
I've thought about it.

1368
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,793
I want to reopen the school.

1369
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:15,595
I was thinking about asking you
to stay with me.

1370
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:17,466
It needs another teacher.

1371
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:24,772
I didn't think you would.

1372
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,551
I shall miss you.

1373
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:39,021
- (music) Oh the wind blows weary (music)
- My little elf.

1374
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:42,290
(music) And the willows sigh... (music)

1375
01:36:42,363 --> 01:36:43,762
I'll miss you, too.

1376
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:48,325
(music) Rivers of sorrow (music)

1377
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:52,896
(music) And the mountains cry (music)

1378
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:56,704
(music) Rivers of sorrow... (music)

1379
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:03,580
(music) And the mountains cry. (music)

1380
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,191
I'm sorry.

1381
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:20,264
I'm sorry, too.

1382
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,637
I'm sorry
about that school

1383
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:27,071
and I'm sorry
about your book.

1384
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:34,205
You made most of us
feel real proud.

1385
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,378
Thank you.

1386
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,421
I'm sure someone else will come
and write down all of the songs.

1387
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,288
- Are you giving up?
- Um-hmm.

1388
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:50,592
I realize that it was
the voices singing them

1389
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:52,029
that I wanted everyone to hear.

1390
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:54,124
Are you going back
to your university, then?

1391
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,897
No, no, I don't think so.

1392
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,841
- Where are you going?
- I'm not sure.

1393
01:38:09,783 --> 01:38:11,011
Come with me?

1394
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,817
How will I earn a living
down the mountain?

1395
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,157
With your music.

1396
01:38:24,498 --> 01:38:27,365
I couldn't take care
of you right doing this.

1397
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,397
Then work in a coal mine.

1398
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:32,632
No, I did that once
and I guarantee you

1399
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:34,674
I never ever will again.

1400
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,301
So you're just content
to sit on a mountain

1401
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,142
and hide your head
in a jug, is that it?

1402
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:42,614
A man's meant
to provide for his wife

1403
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:45,015
and his family, Lily.

1404
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:48,179
You were meant
to make music.

1405
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:51,656
Besides which, I don't want you
to take care of me.

1406
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:55,217
- And I do have a plan.
- Oh, of course you do.

1407
01:38:55,296 --> 01:38:57,093
Did you ever have a day
without a plan?

1408
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:00,691
It includes you, Tom.
Do you want to hear it?

1409
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,406
Go on.

1410
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:08,168
Well...

1411
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:12,008
nowadays, phonographs
only cost about $10.

1412
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:14,877
I think that soon everyone
is going to have one.

1413
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:17,975
I was thinking
that we could...

1414
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,282
make cylinders
of mountain music and sell them.

1415
01:39:25,826 --> 01:39:28,294
Who the hell would buy them?

1416
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:30,091
Oh, I think everyone would.

1417
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:31,961
I know they would, Tom.

1418
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:33,226
The way the music
makes you feel,

1419
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,460
of course they would.

1420
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:37,129
You're just about as crazy...

1421
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:38,136
Hey!

1422
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:41,101
What are you doing here?

1423
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:44,874
Go on before I shoot you!

1424
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:46,845
I want to talk to Deladis.

1425
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:57,284
Fate: Del...

1426
01:39:57,358 --> 01:39:59,121
I come to get you
to be my wife.

1427
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,664
I don't want
no part of you.

1428
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:09,327
If you don't take me now,

1429
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:10,893
I'm marrying Polly.

1430
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:15,203
I went to the woods...

1431
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:19,236
and the knot didn't hold.

1432
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:24,812
You're Polly's now.

1433
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:42,935
I love you, child.

1434
01:40:46,907 --> 01:40:48,306
Tom: Hey, Del...

1435
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:52,507
we're going
down the mountain.

1436
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:56,680
Do you want
to come with us?

1437
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:03,613
We're going to make cylinders
of mountain music

1438
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:05,282
to sell to outlanders.

1439
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,190
(laughing)

1440
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:09,896
What?

1441
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:12,555
Isn't that the craziest thing
you ever heard?

1442
01:41:12,633 --> 01:41:14,396
It's the craziest.

1443
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,436
Viney: Of course
she'll come with you.

1444
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,869
Granny?

1445
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:21,737
Tom, I'll be fine.

1446
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:25,973
I'll be right here
when you come back to visit.

1447
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,060
Tom: Why don't you
back up aways,

1448
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,822
until one of us
can pull over?

1449
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:44,523
Perhaps I'd better get out.

1450
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:49,929
Are you Cyrus Whittle?

1451
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:53,666
Yes, I am.
Who are you?

1452
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,264
I'm Lily Penleric.

1453
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:59,005
Lily Penleric?
How remarkable.

1454
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:01,513
I was just on my way
to meet you.

1455
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:03,812
Whittle: Didn't you get
Prof. Aldrich's letter?

1456
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:05,408
Lily: Yes. I did,
but I didn't realize

1457
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:06,919
you were coming
immediately.

1458
01:42:06,987 --> 01:42:11,151
The work is urgent.
Your discovery is too great.

1459
01:42:11,225 --> 01:42:13,318
The collection must be
moved forward

1460
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:15,452
as expeditiously as possible.

1461
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:19,488
That's why I'm here in the hopes
of being able to assist you.

1462
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:21,397
Assisting me?

1463
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:24,767
I told Aldrich
to ask your permission.

1464
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:28,035
I made myself
quite clear to the dean.

1465
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:31,373
I am only here to facilitate
and cooperate

1466
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,345
in the completion
of the collection

1467
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:35,711
of this vast body of songs.

1468
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:38,250
There is no collection

1469
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:41,219
beyond the 10 songs
that I sent Prof. Aldrich.

1470
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:44,314
What?
All this time, you mean...

1471
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:46,655
- It was destroyed in a fire.
- Oh, I can't bear it.

1472
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:49,423
I'm afraid so, along with
my phonograph recordings.

1473
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,589
Oh, my Lord.

1474
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,860
Phonograph, you say?

1475
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,995
You know, I had no idea
it was feasible to lug

1476
01:42:58,071 --> 01:43:00,972
a phonograph
into the wilderness.

1477
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:02,008
It isn't.

1478
01:43:05,078 --> 01:43:07,205
Well, then in that case
it's very fortuitous

1479
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,908
that I'm here, isn't it?

1480
01:43:08,982 --> 01:43:11,075
We can start again,
you and I!

1481
01:43:22,296 --> 01:43:23,661
Thank you, Prof. Whittle,

1482
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,494
but I'm afraid I have
other plans.

1483
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,797
What on earth could be
more important

1484
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,734
than this collection
of songs?

1485
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:33,932
Lily: I bequeath the collection
of the mountain ballads to you.

1486
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:35,565
- To me?
- Mm-hm.

1487
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:37,872
How am I going to work
without you?

1488
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:41,504
Well, when you get
to Bear Creek

1489
01:43:41,582 --> 01:43:43,311
ask for Viney Butler.

1490
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:46,511
Tell Viney, that Tom, Lily
and Deladis said

1491
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:49,317
you are a very nice man,
and she should help you.

1492
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,282
- Who? Deladis?
- Deladis.

1493
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:57,154
Lily: Viney Butler.

1494
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,859
She knows dozens of songs.
She will help you.

1495
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:06,736
Fare thee well, professor,

1496
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:10,766
but I must assure you
I intend to publish these songs

1497
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:14,541
under both our names...
yours first, of course.

1498
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:16,014
It's Penleric.

1499
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,210
That's one "N"
and no "K."

1500
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:27,751
(music) T'was in the merry
month of May (music)

1501
01:44:28,962 --> 01:44:33,058
(music) When all gay flowers

01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:43,475
(music) For the love
of Barbara Allen (music)

1505
01:44:43,543 --> 01:44:49,675
(music) He sent his servant
to the town (music)

1506
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:54,119
(music) To the place
where she was dwelling (music)

1507
01:44:54,187 --> 01:45:00,092
(music) Said, "You must come
to my master's house (music)

1508
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,756
(music) If your name
be Barbara Allen (music)

1509
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:10,701
(music) So slowly, slowly
she gets up (music)

1510
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:14,639
(music) And to his bedside going (music)

1511
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:20,840
(music) She drew the curtains
to one side (music)

1512
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:25,578
(music) and says, "Young man,
you're dying" (music)

1513
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:31,557
(music) "I know I'm sick,
and very sick (music)

1514
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:35,823
(music) And sorrow dwells
within me (music)

1515
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:42,165
(music) No better, no better
I never will be (music)

1516
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:46,638
(music) Till I have
Barbara Allen (music)

1517
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:52,168
(music) " Don't you remember
last Saturday night (music)

1518
01:45:52,245 --> 01:45:56,739
(music) When I was at the tavern? (music)

1519
01:45:56,817 --> 01:46:03,086
(music) You gave your drinks
to the ladies all (music)

1520
01:46:03,156 --> 01:46:07,923
(music) But you slighted
Barbara Allen" (music)

1521
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:13,899
(music) He reached up
his pale white hands (music)

1522
01:46:13,967 --> 01:46:18,336
(music) Intending for to touch her (music)

1523
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:24,344
(music) She turned away
from his bedside (music)

1524
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:28,973
(music) And says, "Young man,
I won't have you (music)

1525
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:34,544
(music) He turned his cheek
unto the wall (music)

1526
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:39,183
(music) And bursted out a-cryin' (music)

1527
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:45,289
(music) Adieu, to thee,
adieu to all (music)

1528
01:46:45,365 --> 01:46:50,064
(music) And adieu
to Barbara Allen (music)

1529
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:16,685
(music) She had not more
than reached the town (music)

1530
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:21,029
(music) She heard the death-bells ringin' (music)

1531
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:27,199
(music) And as they rung,
they seemed to say (music)

1532
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:31,734
(music) "Hard-hearted Barbara Allen" (music)

1533
01:47:31,812 --> 01:47:37,717
(music) O mother, O mother,
go make my bed (music)

1534
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:41,880
(music) Make it both long and narrow (music)

1535
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:48,292
(music) Sweet William died
for me today (music)

1536
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:52,457
(music) I'll die for him tomorrow (music)

1537
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:58,493
(music) Sweet William was buried
in the old churchyard (music)

1538
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:02,906
(music) And Barbara they laid nigh him (music)

1539
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:09,313
(music) And out of his grave
grew a red, red rose (music)

1540
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:13,819
(music) And out of hers, a briar (music)

1541
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:19,985
(music) they grew and grew
to the old church gate (music)

1542
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:24,190
(music) Where they could grow no higher (music)

1543
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:29,827
(music) And there they tied
in a true love knot (music)

1544
01:48:29,903 --> 01:48:34,567
(music) The Rose wrapped
'round the briar. (music)

1545
01:48:47,903 --> 01:48:48,567
{{{ the end }}}



1
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,997
(woman singing)
(music) All in the merry month of May (music)

2
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:38,060
(music) When green leaves
were a-springing (music)

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:43,269
(music) This young man
on his deathbed lay (music)

4
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:48,975
(music) For the love of Barbara Allen (music)

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,452
(music) He sent his man
unto her then (music)

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,015
(music) To the town
where she was dwelling (music)

7
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,927
(music) "You must come
to my master, dear (music)

8
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:09,458
(music) If your name
be Barbara Allen" (music)

9
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,439
(music) So slowly, slowly
she got up (music)

10
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:19,501
(music) And slowly
she came to him (music)

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,607
(music) And all she said
when she came there (music)

12
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:30,179
(music) "Young man,
I think you're dying" (music)

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,818
(music) He turned his face
unto the wall (music)

14
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:40,196
(music) And death came
creeping to him (music)

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:45,101
(music) Adieu, adieu,
and adieu to all (music)

16
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:51,167
(music) And adieu
to Barbara Allen (music)

17
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:56,272
(music) When he was dead
and laid in his grave (music)

18
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:01,377
(music) Then death came
creeping to her (music)

19
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,221
(music) O mother, mother,
make my bed (music)

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:11,889
(music) For his death
hath quite undone me (music)

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,925
(music) And so this maid
she then did die (music)

22
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:21,997
(music) And desired
to be buried by him (music)

23
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:27,138
(music) And repented she
before she died (music)

24
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:33,709
(music) That e'er she did
deny him. (music)

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,716
Now...

26
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,285
there you have a fine example
of an old English ballad,

27
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,697
a folk song, defined
as that which is created

28
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,600
by the common people,
the unskilled.

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,535
The melodies
are quaint and primitive,

30
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,732
but you must learn
to appreciate

31
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,672
not only
the sociological value,

32
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,871
but the simple purity
of emotion in the song.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,516
(humming)

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,147
Oh.

35
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,951
Good afternoon,
Dean Pembroke.

36
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,652
I wanted to catch you today,
Dr. Penleric.

37
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,354
I wanted to tell you
that the appointment committee

38
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,398
has reviewed your application
for full professor.

39
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,298
And we've concluded
unanimously

40
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,064
that we can not
offer you the position.

41
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,732
However, we hope
you will continue on

42
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,900
as an associate professor

43
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,308
at your current salary level,
of course.

44
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,347
Dr. Penleric: Why, may I ask,
am I being passed over again?

45
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,611
It is not customary
to be asked

46
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,815
to defend our position,
Dr. Penleric.

47
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,652
It appears we have
an opportunity

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,285
to offer the position to
the eminent English musicologist

49
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,091
and ballad collector,
Cyrus Whittle,

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,531
who as you know, has almost
single-handedly created

51
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,968
a revival
of the English folk song.

52
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,664
Oh, Dean Pembroke.
Excuse me.

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,798
What is it, Professor Aldrich?

54
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,741
Nothing, sir, I just stopped by
for a few words with Dr. Penleric.

55
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,144
Well, I was just leaving.
Good day, Dr. Penleric.

56
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,412
(door closes)

57
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,287
I argued for you, Lily,

58
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,654
as emphatically as I dared.

59
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,693
I have waited longer
and published more

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,524
than anyone else
in this department.

61
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,530
Frankly,
I was the only man for you.

62
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,327
Dr. Penleric: Really?

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,528
Dean Pembroke said
the vote was unanimous.

64
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,231
I was afraid someone
would suspect something.

65
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,033
Dr. Whittle is
a brilliant man.

66
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,443
Of course he is,
that's not the point!

67
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,542
Lily,

68
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,709
I've arranged
the family's whole summer

69
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,083
so I can come into town
to see you every week.

70
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,017
I won't be here, Wallace.

71
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,493
Where are you going?

72
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,122
As far away as possible.

73
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,257
Please don't go away.

74
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,997
I know how disappointed
you must be, my darling, but...

75
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,595
Lily, wait.

76
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,834
Why don't I meet you
at your apartment?

77
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,773
My wife won't be home
until quite late.

78
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,012
Are you mad, Lily?
What if someone walked in?

79
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,109
You coward!

80
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,517
Backing my appointment
was the only thing

81
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,077
I ever asked you for.

82
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,656
But...

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,522
(rooster crowing)

84
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,870
You Miss Elna's sister?

85
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,273
Yes, yes, yes, I am.

86
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,043
I'm here to take you
to Clover.

87
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,607
I'm Fate Honeycutt.
What's your name?

88
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,519
Oh, hello,
I'm Dr. Lily Penleric.

89
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,954
A doctor, huh?

90
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,685
That's just fine.

91
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,284
We could sure use
another healer.

92
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,887
Oh, I'm not a medical doctor.

93
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,989
Well, what kind are you?

94
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm a doctor of music,

95
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,370
sort of an expert.

96
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,601
I see.

97
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,741
Thank you.

98
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,815
Well, hop on up, Doc.

99
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,089
Here, just put your foot
on the wheel there.

100
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,286
I'll help you up.

101
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,099
Fate: Giddup.

102
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,792
Fate: Giddup.

103
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,027
What if we meet
another wagon

104
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,629
coming down the mountain?

105
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,675
That would be something.

106
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,410
Oh!

107
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,851
(distant banjo music plays)

108
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,559
Someone's playing music?

109
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,012
- Oh, Lily!
- Eleanor.

110
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,315
It's been so long.

111
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,321
Yes.

112
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,161
I thought you said it was
only five miles to Clover.

113
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,356
Woman: She meant
"mountain miles."

114
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,296
Used to take three days
to get up here.

115
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,632
This is my sister, Lily.

116
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:29,300
Lily, this is my colleague
and friend, Harriet Tolliver.

117
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,536
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

118
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,707
This is Deladis Slocumb.
Deladis has no family,

119
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,373
so we get to keep her here
full time.

120
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,611
How do you do, ma'am?

121
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,278
How do you do?

122
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,347
Elna's told me
so much about you.

123
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,686
"Elna"?

124
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,592
Oh, that's what
everyone here calls me.

125
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,153
It's caught on with me, too.

126
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,722
I suppose it's a lot better
than "Little Elf,"

127
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,233
which is what
I used to call her.

128
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,769
(chuckling)

129
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,998
You must be exhausted.

130
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,700
I am.
Excuse me.

131
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,643
Would you like to rest
before supper?

132
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,577
Uh...

133
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,445
- Could you help me, dearest?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,984
Thank you so much.

135
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,110
It's very hot.

136
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,415
I know.

137
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,911
Along with
the basic curriculum,

138
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,209
we also teach hygiene
and nutrition to the girls.

139
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,476
And music, of course.

140
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,882
Deladis, why don't you
serve the tea?

141
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,184
Deladis,
what a beautiful name.

142
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,918
That's a real pretty fan.

143
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,155
Thank you, dear.
It's from Spain.

144
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,089
(crow cawing)

145
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,466
Thank you, dear.

146
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,069
Aren't you frightened here?

147
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,405
What of?

148
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,577
Oh, savage mountaineers.

149
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,549
Reports of violence
are horrible.

150
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,415
(laughing)

151
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,750
Horribly exaggerated,
that is.

152
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,654
Deladis,
why don't you sing

153
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,716
one of your pretty songs
for my sister?

154
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,752
Oh, please, please do.
I would like that.

155
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:47,571
(music) 'Twas in the merry
month of May (music)

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,744
(music) When all gay flowers
were a-bloomin' (music)

157
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:58,381
(music) Sweet William
on his deathbed lay (music)

158
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:03,156
(music) For the love
of Barbry Allen (music)

159
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:09,863
(music) He sent his servant
to the town (music)

160
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:14,804
(music) He sent him
to her dwelling (music)

161
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,570
(music) Sayin', "Master's sick (music)

162
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,077
(music) and very sick (music)

163
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:25,174
(music) And for your sake
he's a-dyin'." (music)

164
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,242
Deladis, where did you
learn that song?

165
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,723
My granny gave it to me.

166
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,383
Was your grandmother
from England?

167
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,120
You mean, across the ocean?

168
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,556
No, no.

169
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,259
Granny lived and died
right here in the mountains.

170
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,994
Lily: Then where
did she learn it?

171
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,269
Granny said she got
all those love songs

172
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,670
from her mama.

173
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,675
Do you know
any more ballads?

174
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,379
love songs.

175
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,648
Oh. I know lots of them.

176
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,278
I know "Lord Randall,"
uh... uh...

177
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,719
"Jacqueline Is Sailing,"
"Two Sisters."

178
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,654
I know "Young Emily."

179
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,625
Would you sing
"Two Sisters," please?

180
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,093
Harriet: It's all right, dear.

181
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,800
(music) O sister, o sister
come go with me... (music)

182
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,735
Lily... I told you
never to call me here.

183
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,897
I'm calling
as a colleague, Wallace.

184
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,635
- Where are you?
- The southern mountains.

185
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,269
What on earth are you doing
in such a dreadful place?

186
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,540
Lily: Never mind that.
I'm telephoning because I made

187
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,981
a great discovery.
Old English ballads.

188
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,109
What are you talking about?

189
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,483
Lily: The mountain people
brought the ballads here

190
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,148
over 200 years ago.

191
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,691
The same songs
that Cyrus Whittle

192
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,420
has been collecting
in England,

193
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,860
songs which haven't been known
there for at least 100 years!

194
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,363
- What of it, Lily?
- Woman: Wally?

195
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,832
I want you to come home.

196
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,164
Don't you understand?

197
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,832
These may be the purest
versions in existence.

198
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,603
- That's ridiculous.
- It's true!

199
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,234
And I am going to be
the first to collect them

200
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,471
and to publish them.

201
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,639
Nothing I could have said
or done

202
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,649
would have secured
that appointment for you.

203
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,844
Nothing you do now
will, either.

204
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,281
Will you help me,
or not?

205
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,517
I have always
believed in you, Lily.

206
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,459
Lily: Good.
I need supplies.

207
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,124
The collecting must be done
scientifically.

208
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,499
Now, nice and loud.

209
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,331
(music) A holiday, O holy day (music)

210
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,967
(music) The first day of they ear (music)

211
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,477
(music) Little Matthy Groves
to church to goes (music)

212
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,740
(music) Some holy words to hear (music)

213
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,874
(music) Here some holy words
to hear (music)

214
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,613
(play back) (music) He spied some women
dressed in black (music)

215
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,917
(music) As they came into view (music)

216
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,389
(music) Lord Daniel's wife
was gaily clad (music)

217
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,892
(music) The flower of the few (music)

218
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,930
(music) Here the flower
of the few (music)

219
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,727
(music) She stepped up
to Little Matthy Groves (music)

220
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,859
(music) Her eyes cast
on the ground... (music)

221
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:35,032
Deladis: (music) Come all ye fair
and tender ladies (music)

222
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:41,205
(music) Be careful
how you court young men (music)

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,804
- (music) They're like... (music)
- Uh...

224
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,113
Could you sing those two lines again?
Thank you, dear.

225
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,749
Why don't you just make
a cylinder and copy off that?

226
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,259
Because the cylinders
are only for short songs

227
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,294
and they wear out.
Once again, thank you.

228
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:04,360
(music) Come all ye fair
and tender ladies (music)

229
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:09,669
(music) Be careful
how you court young men (music)

230
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,183
(Deladi's singing in distance)

231
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,845
Are you still working
on the child labor piece?

232
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,219
I'm trying,
not very successfully.

233
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,785
I wonder how many times your sister
needs to hear those songs?

234
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,092
No, don't, don't be angry.

235
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,961
It makes her very happy.

236
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,628
She's quite obsessed.

237
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,761
So am I.

238
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,871
Deladis: (music) She cried out
with a thrillin' cry (music)

239
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,038
(music) O Lord, O Lord, I'm ruined. (music)

240
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,683
(sighing)
That's it, Doc.

241
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm worn out
like a cylinder.

242
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,253
Uh, just those last two lines
once again, please, dear.

243
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,861
(music) She cried out
with a thrillin' cry (music)

244
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,264
(music) O Lord, O Lord, I'm ruined. (music)

245
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,505
(sighing)
That's it.

246
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,938
That's the very last ballad
I know.

247
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,498
And what a doozy.

248
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,044
Mm.

249
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,327
(Lily chuckling)

250
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,371
What's this for?

251
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,872
That's for all your hard work.

252
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,137
Just for singing?

253
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,143
Uh-hmm.

254
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,880
- Here.
- (music) Come all ye fair (music)

255
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,184
(music) and tender ladies (music)

256
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:09,284
(music) Be careful
how you court young men (music)

257
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,731
(music) They're like a bright star
of a summer's evening (music)

258
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,170
(music) They'll first appear
and then they're gone. (music)

259
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,074
I'm gonna tie a lover's knot.

260
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,804
If it stays and grows,

261
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,438
all will be well.

262
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,315
Where did you get
that fancy thing?

263
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,789
Doc gave it to me
for singing.

264
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,628
(screaming)

265
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:53,927
(Lily humming)

266
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,667
Hello?

267
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,142
Oh, Eleanor,
this is just fascinating.

268
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,576
It really is.

269
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,773
You see, Deladis sings,
"For The Most Part"

270
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,112
in a Scots-Irish style,

271
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,483
but she employs
such unusual pitches.

272
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,613
And she dwells on notes.
Here.

273
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,886
(music) Tay-ay-ble, here's... (music)

274
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,859
Can you hear that?
That is so unusual.

275
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,896
I have never heard
anything like it before.

276
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,227
Tell me,
is her style of singing,

277
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,493
is that typical?

278
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,467
- Yes, I think it is.
- Is it really?

279
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,332
It's fascinating.

280
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,599
So what do you think
of my school, Lily?

281
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,436
Hmm?

282
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,032
Oh...

283
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,910
- Well, I'm no expert...
- I know.

284
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,973
- I'm sure it's fine.
- I know.

285
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,678
We are trying
to make a difference.

286
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,515
Yes, of course.

287
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,522
(sobbing)
It was mine!

288
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,717
Elna: Oh, Deladis,
what happened?

289
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,587
- Oh, Fate, did you do this?
- That was so cruel.

290
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,927
You give her
that fancy thing

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,831
and a whole dollar
just for singing.

292
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,666
- You ain't give me nothing.
- Fate, you work for the school

293
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,037
and I think we pay you
quite adequately.

294
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,043
Then I'll do nothing for Doc.
Just for the school.

295
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,602
Then I'll have to find
another boy who's more willing...

296
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,409
No, no, Eleanor,
Fate does have a point.

297
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,349
He has had to work a lot harder
since I've been here.

298
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,045
That's right, Doc.

299
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,452
So how's 50¢ a week,
young man?

300
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,093
I don't know.
I'll have to think on it.

301
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,132
While you're thinking, you can
help pack the phonograph machine.

302
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,030
We're going
to Bear Creek tomorrow.

303
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,262
She's going to Viney Butler's.

304
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,861
You can't lug that machine
all the way up a mountain.

305
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,237
We made it this far,
didn't we?

306
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,572
That was nothing compared
to getting up to Bear Creek.

307
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,976
So what am I paying you for?

308
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,251
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whew.

309
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,567
I don't know no ballads.

310
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,338
Why, Mrs. Butler,
they are the most

311
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,573
beautiful songs
there have ever been,

312
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,707
songs like
"Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor,"

313
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,809
"Two Sisters,"
"Matthy Groves."

314
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,514
Can't say I know them.

315
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,558
Deladis calls them
love songs.

316
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,927
No, did you ever hear
any such songs, Fate?

317
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,125
Del knew,
but I can't say as I do.

318
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Deladis can't be the only keeper
of the songs in the mountains.

319
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,904
I can't be
of any help to you, ma'am.

320
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,942
I would be happy
to compensate you...

321
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,170
to pay you, Mrs. Butler.

322
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,337
Good day to you.

323
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,516
Hello, Viney.

324
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,517
Well, look who's here!

325
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,648
- You must be Elna's sister.
- Yes, I am.

326
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,387
I'm so happy to meet you.
I'm Alice Kincaid.

327
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,656
Well, how do you do?
I'm Lily Penleric.

328
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,221
What are you trudging
all the way up here for, child?

329
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,099
I wanted to meet Dr. Penleric.
I have something for you.

330
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,694
Oh. Fate.
Thank you.

331
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:18,004
My family spent summers
in Asheville.

332
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,839
I loved hiking up
into the mountains

333
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,004
and reading poetry.

334
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,412
That's how I met Reese,
my husband.

335
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,748
He wooed me with ballads
and fiddle music.

336
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,344
I've been writing them down
since I came to live here.

337
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,788
You can have them
if you like.

338
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,120
Thank you, thank you.

339
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,423
they are indeed exactly
what I'm looking for, but...

340
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,023
I'm afraid these haven't been
scientifically collected.

341
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,031
Oh.

342
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,068
Well I can't be sure
of your notation, you see,

343
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,372
because of the irregular times
and unusual modes of the tunes.

344
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,641
Of course,
I understand perfectly.

345
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,646
Oh...

346
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,248
that is beautiful.

347
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,180
Come here, child.

348
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,998
Viney: You are weak as water.

349
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,867
Oh, that baby is sucking
the life out of you.

350
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,269
Uh-uh.
You got to eat more.

351
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,433
I can barely
feed the children.

352
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,066
Reese gone again?

353
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,384
- Mrs. Kincaid, thank you.
- Thank you.

354
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,550
Here now, you...

355
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,783
make a potion out of this.
Drink it twice a day,

356
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,759
and do not go dragging
all over the place.

357
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,559
Viney, the ballads
are a precious musical legacy.

358
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,100
Why, they're just songs.

359
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,635
Oh, no, Mrs. Butler,
they're not.

360
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,536
They're ancient ballads
from England and Scotland

361
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,540
and they've been sung
for hundreds of years.

362
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:01,545
they say that my great-granddaddy
come from there.

363
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,174
He came over that mountain
in 1743.

364
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,376
Really?

365
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,214
No one knows that these songs
are being sung

366
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,686
right here in the mountains
of America, no one.

367
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,155
What of it?

368
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,556
Music experts
will want to know.

369
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,357
So I am going to write them down
and publish them in a songbook.

370
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,763
Well, Lord knows I can't
read and write anyhow.

371
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,027
Viney,

372
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,865
I think she's
a very nice lady.

373
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,173
Viney on record:
(music) Is this young Jimmy Scot himself (music)

374
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,080
(music) Or Jimmy Scotland's king? (music)

375
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,779
(music) Or is it the father
of that bastard child (music)

376
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:45,414
(music) From Scotland
just come in? (music)

377
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,324
(music) Or is it the father
of that bastard child (music)

378
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,421
(music) From Scotland
just come in? (music)

379
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:01,830
(music) He took the brown girl
by the hand (music)

380
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:06,310
(music) And lead her
across the hall (music)

381
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,814
(music) He took out his sword (music)

382
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,247
(music) And cut off her head (music)

383
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,878
(music) And kicked it
against the wall (music)

384
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,446
(music) And he kicked it
against the wall. (music)

385
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,250
have you got it?

386
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,522
One more time, Viney.

387
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,359
I thought
you've done this before.

388
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,466
Viney.

389
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,501
Oh, Tom!

390
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,161
Is the day gone already?

391
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,397
Sure is.

392
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,737
Corn is coming up fine
in that back field.

393
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,875
Oh, this is Dr. Lily Penleric.

394
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,039
She's Miss Elna's sister.

395
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,274
Hm.

396
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,613
How do you do?

397
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,651
How do you do?

398
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,292
Viney: Lily is a doctor
of music.

399
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,124
She's catching
my old love songs.

400
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,993
She says they’re important.

401
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,966
Important?
Important to who?

402
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,434
I'm going to publish them
in a songbook.

403
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,997
No, you're not.

404
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,736
Nobody's gonna publish
my granny's songs.

405
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,041
This is my grandson,
Tom Bledsoe.

406
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,205
He's been to the other world

407
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,408
and he thinks he knows
a whole lot.

408
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,281
Mr. Bledsoe,
I am a collector.

409
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,985
My intention is to exalt
the fine music of these mountains.

410
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,117
Exalt?

411
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,589
Yes, it means "to lift up."

412
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:37,157
You mean exploit.
It means "to steal."

413
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,631
I am a musicologist,
not a thief.

414
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,640
My work is to preserve
musical culture.

415
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,142
First it was the coal and lumber
companies coming in here

416
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,736
now they want to take
our music, too.

417
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,280
These songs are
of great interest

418
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,543
to anyone who studies
musical heritage.

419
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,017
You're gonna get paid for it,
ain't you?

420
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,919
- Yes, I am.
- See, Granny, let me handle this.

421
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,253
I can assure you
it will not make me rich.

422
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,587
- Um-hmm.
- And frankly,

423
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,321
I'm the one who's going
to all the trouble

424
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,885
and expense
of collecting the songs

425
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,158
and I'm the one
who has the expertise

426
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,824
to write them down
and categorize them properly

427
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,026
and scientifically.

428
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,899
Oh, you do, do you?
What's in it for my granny?

429
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,807
Her name will appear before
each one of the songs

430
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,070
which I include in the book,

431
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,668
as the source from which
I have collected it.

432
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,578
"By Viney Butler,"
that's what it's gonna say, Tom.

433
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,549
Well, you can't collect
from my granny,

434
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,210
unless you pay her.

435
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,185
I have offered.
She refused.

436
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,518
You refused?

437
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,462
How can I take money
for singing?

438
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,089
My mama used to sing
those songs

439
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,794
rocking the young-uns to sleep
and leading the cows home.

440
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,802
Doctor, I'm asking
you kindly...

441
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,134
to leave.

442
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,037
Viney: Tom!

443
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,941
I can give my songs
to anybody that I want to.

444
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,037
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

445
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,311
Besides, it's supper time
and Lily's joining us.

446
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,478
Uh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Butler.

447
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,852
Really, I should be
heading back to the school.

448
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,686
You're gonna take my songs
and refuse

449
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:10,159
the hospitality of my home?
Well, I never.

450
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,712
My man's father built this place
when he settled here.

451
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,609
I’ve raised nine children
in this cabin,

452
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,814
only two of them still living.

453
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,550
I'm sorry.

454
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,286
Oh, one's working the coal mines
up in Virginia

455
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,725
and one's in Missouri.

456
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,904
(belching)

457
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,306
That was good, Granny,

458
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,105
(tuning)

459
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,012
Tom's a fine musician.

460
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,782
Really?

461
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,153
Um-hmm, he plays the banjo
like nobody.

462
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,158
Oh, Tom!

463
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,057
Tom, what's that thing called?

464
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,494
- That thing?
- It's a guitar, Granny.

465
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,395
How many times
do I got to tell you?

466
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,627
He got it in Cuba,
Tom did,

467
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,397
in the Spanish War.

468
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,301
It's a lovely instrument.

469
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,738
Mmm, he is the only one
in these parts

470
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,276
got one of those things.
He makes up songs on it, too.

471
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,780
Do you play music, Doctor,

472
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,373
or do you just steal
other people's?

473
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,080
I am a pianist, Mr. Bledsoe.

474
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,784
A pianist?

475
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,588
I heard of them!

476
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,791
Tom, come on, play some
banjo tunes for Lily here.

477
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,493
Come on! Come on!

478
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,959
please, I would like that.

479
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,542
(fast picking)

480
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,502
(Viney clapping, laughing)

481
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,867
(door bangs open)

482
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,006
Hilliard, you almost
scared me to death!

483
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,202
Sorry, Viney.

484
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,245
You coming, Tom?!

485
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,040
I'll be right there.

486
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,417
Mr. Bledsoe, where did you
learn to play like that?

487
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,854
I taught him.

488
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,721
I would like to record you
on my phonograph sometime.

489
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,664
No, thank you.
I make music to please myself.

490
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,624
(door slamming shut)

491
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,236
Never mind Tom.

492
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,104
He's like most
of those fellows

493
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,667
who went to the other world
and come back...

494
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,213
he just never seemed
to be the same.

495
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,110
they just can't seem
to settle down

496
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,709
and be happy.

497
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,158
Would you show me
how to play this?

498
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,890
H mm.

499
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,901
Well, it's all in the picking.

500
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,568
(up tempo tune)

501
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,511
Fate, did you see to Alice
and her young-uns?

502
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,711
Yes, ma'am, I caught them
a couple of rabbits.

503
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,686
- We had a fine supper.
- Good.

504
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,449
Oh, we have all to do
tomorrow,

505
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,185
these old songs
are coming back to me now.

506
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,487
Well, I'm looking
forward to it.

507
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,549
Oh, Lily...

508
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,223
Listen, if you hear
a strange cry,

509
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:13,202
like a woman screaming,
that's the panther cat.

510
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,205
And you're gonna be dead
if it gets you.

511
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:19,642
What you do is pull off
your clothes one piece at a time

512
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,679
and run real hard.

513
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,611
And then the panther cat
will stop

514
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,649
and tear up the clothes
that you dropped in its path

515
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,652
to shreds!
And that will save you!

516
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,981
Viney, that is ridiculous.

517
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,597
Lily: Oops.

518
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,059
(owl hooting)

519
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,573
- What was that?
- Just an owl.

520
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,835
Are you sure?

521
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,173
You'll know the panther cry
when you hear it.

522
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,610
- (rifle cocking)
- Fate!

523
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,308
Damn near got your fool head
blown off.

524
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,816
I didn't know you had
a still going here.

525
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,976
What about her?

526
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,882
What about her?

527
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,128
Go on, get,
both of you.

528
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,900
- Fate.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,079
Eleanor? Eleanor?

530
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,438
Eleanor...

531
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,974
I have had the most
remarkable day.

532
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:35,985
(gasping)

533
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,623
Oh, no.

534
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,207
Lily, I'd like
to talk with you.

535
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,111
I'm very tired.

536
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,849
I don't want to talk.

537
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,054
I think we should talk.

538
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,473
(sighing)

539
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,941
How could you, Eleanor?

540
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,275
You sound so like Father.

541
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,440
I'm not a child.

542
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,450
You're teachers!

543
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,009
What kind of an example
are you setting?

544
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,248
You're disgusting.

545
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,867
She's the finest person
I have ever known.

546
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,385
And I suppose...

547
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,114
Harriet is a lot older and...

548
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,247
more experienced
than you, so...

549
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,224
I suppose it's her fault.

550
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,090
It's nobody's fault.

551
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,703
We're in love.

552
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,867
Viney: (music) She drew
her little pen knife (music)

553
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,036
(music) And stabbed him
through his heart (music)

554
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,012
(music) She cried out
with a very loud cry (music)

555
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,015
(music) There's a dead man
in my house, house (music)

556
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,211
(music) There's a dead man
in my house. (music)

557
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,810
We came to see the machine

558
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,116
that sings the songs
back to you.

559
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,122
I'm not using it
at the moment.

560
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,184
See, you got to save it, Polly,
or it will wear out.

561
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,026
My brother's a songcatcher.

562
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,157
That's very nice, but I'm afraid
he's a bit too little

563
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,360
to be a reliable source.

564
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,164
Come on, Tommy Lee,
you can sing for me.

565
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,704
Girl: Oh, shotgun.
Man: What songs you know?

566
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,706
- (cocking)
- Girl: Come on.

567
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:48,040
Get the hell out of my yard,
Earl Giddens.

568
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,104
I've been hearing this excitement
about the songcatcher,

569
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,615
I came to see for myself.

570
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,344
Tom told you we're not selling.

571
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,716
He also told you
he'd shoot you on the spot

572
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,516
if you came round again.

573
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,649
Viney, it's that kind of talk
gives city folk

574
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,058
a terrible impression
of us hillbillies.

575
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,065
- Isn't that right, miss?
- Doctor Lily Penleric.

576
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,864
Doctor!
Well, Earl Giddens,

577
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,336
McFarland Coal Company.

578
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,272
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, Doctor.

579
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,468
It's fine to see
an outsider appreciating

580
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,910
the charm of our local music.

581
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,708
For myself however,
there is nothing like

582
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,544
the elegant perfection
of the compositions

583
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,176
by Mr. Johann Sebastian Bach.

584
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:34,787
I don't think such comparisons
benefit either tradition.

585
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,985
they are apples and oranges.

586
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,893
Are you a musician?

587
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,226
No, ma'am.

588
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,324
- Oh.
- I've been down the mountain.

589
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,460
I had the privilege
of education.

590
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,868
Bachelor of Sciences,
University of North Carolina.

591
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,873
Really?

592
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,034
I guess I see your point.

593
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,076
Maybe you can
talk some sense

594
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,414
into this stubborn
old woman, Dr. Lily.

595
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,214
Mrs. Butler?

596
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,619
She has no need
of my advice.

597
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,157
Don't you think
she deserves

598
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,251
a nice new house
in Sawyerville?

599
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,558
Time to sing and rest?

600
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,291
She could even learn
to read and write,

601
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,232
instead of working her fingers
to the bone just to get by.

602
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,496
I can make a living on a rock
if I wanted to.

603
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,971
I was born on this mountain
and I'm gonna die on this mountain.

604
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,942
And so are you.
Get going, Giddens.

605
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,412
This place is nothing
but a burden for Tom, Viney.

606
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,712
You know he was made
for other things besides farming.

607
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:37,447
(painful screaming)

608
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,024
Alice: Oh. Oh...

609
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,754
(howling)

610
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,124
Isabel, go to my place.
Take the children to my place,

611
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,000
and tell Tom to bring
the milk cow.

612
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,402
Isabel:
Come on, y'all. Come on.

613
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,505
- I'll take them, Viney.
- No! I want you here.

614
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,784
Alice: Help me, help me, please,
I'm dying.

615
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,753
Oh, I can't stop the bleeding
until I get the baby out.

616
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,820
You gotta help me.

617
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,058
(moaning)

618
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,657
No, no, I couldn't.

619
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,895
She can't do it by herself.

620
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,666
Come here, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

621
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,673
Now put them right here,
like that.

622
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,108
When I tell you to,
you push... hard.

623
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,738
- No. No. No.
- Do it, woman!

624
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,408
Viney: Ready?

625
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:42,951
Now!

626
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,045
Viney: Well, I guess
the good Lord's gonna let us

627
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,707
keep you a little while longer.

628
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,615
And you got yourself here,

629
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,848
another sweet, little
baby girl.

630
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,517
Will she live?

631
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,891
Well, it was a struggle
there for a bit,

632
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,363
but it's in the good Lord's
hands now.

633
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,093
(sighing)

634
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:39,973
Alice, you're gonna have to keep
Reese away from you.

635
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,473
Well, if you
don't want butter,

636
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,075
you got to pull
the dasher out in time.

637
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,421
(snickering)

638
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,331
Oh, sweet baby girl.

639
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,670
I hope you grow up smart
like Lily here

640
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,402
and stay single.

641
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,870
(music) When I was single (music)

642
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,780
(music) When I dress ed
mighty fine (music)

643
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,011
(music) Now I am married (music)

644
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,452
(music) Go ragged all the time (music)

645
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,481
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

646
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,924
(music) O, Lord, (music)

647
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:34,363
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

648
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,558
(chuckling)

649
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,931
(music) When I was single (music)

650
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,664
(music) My shoes did squeak (music)

651
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,070
(music) Now I am married (music)

652
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,335
(music) My shoes they do leak (music)

653
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,436
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

654
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,707
(music) O Lord, (music)

655
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:55,878
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

656
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,353
(music) Three little babes (music)

657
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,152
(music) Are crying for bread (music)

658
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,693
(music) With none to give them (music)

659
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,888
(music) I'd rather be dead (music)

660
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,797
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

661
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,266
(music) O Lord, (music)

662
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:15,431
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

663
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,837
(laughing)

664
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,966
(music) When he comes in (music)

665
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,206
(music) It's a curse and a row (music)

666
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,770
(music) knocking down the children (music)

667
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,044
(music) And pulling out my hair (music)

668
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,349
(music) I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

669
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,616
(music) O Lord, (music)

670
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,559
(music) Don't I wish I was
a single girl again (music)

671
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,960
(music) Dishes to wash... (music)

672
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,464
Reese, where in hell
have you been?

673
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,330
Alice.

674
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,034
You came home.

675
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,705
Lily...

676
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,246
please take the painting.

677
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,091
Tom: Did she live?

678
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,533
Yes.

679
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,313
What about the baby?

680
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,017
Hopefully.

681
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,117
Thank the Lord.

682
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,248
(pops cork)

683
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,587
(sighing)

684
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,727
You're having a real backwoods
experience, ain't you?

685
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,239
Are you drunk?

686
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,779
I'm not drunk,
I'm...

687
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,351
celebrating.

688
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,015
Lily: There's no cause
for celebration, Mr. Bledsoe.

689
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,819
they could still die.

690
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,127
In case it's news to you,
Doctor,

691
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,221
suffering is a woman's lot.

692
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,392
I am perfectly well aware
of that fact, Mr. Bledsoe.

693
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,437
God knows, I wish I weren't.

694
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,028
You really are an ignorant,
drunken lout.

695
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,199
You have absolutely no idea
what that woman

696
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,072
- has just been through!
- Let me tell you something.

697
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,877
My wife died at childbirth

698
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,143
when we were 16 years old.

699
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,319
She bled to death
after I pulled our dead baby out.

700
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,017
So don't you tell me
what I do and don't know!

701
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,404
"Dear Wallace,

702
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,345
Enclosed are 10
of the beautiful ballads

703
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,282
I have collected so far.

704
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,818
I am sure you will realize

705
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,719
what a remarkable
discovery this is.

706
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,916
The songs are virtually
intact,

707
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,516
according to the oldest
known versions,

708
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,563
with wonderful, idiosyncratic
local changes

709
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,827
in a lyric or phrase
here or there.

710
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,198
Best wishes,
Lily."

711
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,531
(banjo strumming)

712
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,137
Whoo! Lord.

713
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,202
Your playing is beautiful.

714
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,707
Actually, that was one of my tunes.
Dexter here just...

715
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:25,619
took it over,
and made it his own.

716
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,351
- Such striking rhythms.
- Thank you, ma'am.

717
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,321
I'm Lily Penleric.

718
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,523
She's a musicologist.

719
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,895
Mister...?

720
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,129
- Dexter Speaks, ma'am.
- Well, how do you do?

721
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,501
Would you look at Del?

722
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,335
(laughing)

723
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,965
She's all bug eyed.

724
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,306
Ain't you ever seen
a colored man before?

725
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,538
Where would I have?

726
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:50,841
(chuckling)

727
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,575
Tom: Where you all headed?

728
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,846
Rose Gentry's.

729
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,114
I'm gonna help Doc here

730
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,748
with writing down
Rose's ballads.

731
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,315
We're going everywhere
the sweet music is.

732
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,826
Rose?

733
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,692
Rose lives way off back
and beyond.

734
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,163
You'll never get there
with that load.

735
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,496
You can't tell
this woman nothing, Tom.

736
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:12,667
Huh.

737
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,436
Well, aren't you lucky?

738
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,702
Sitting around all day
getting drunk, playing music?

739
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,404
- How lovely.
- Yes, I am.

740
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,969
See, that's what you outlanders
don't understand.

741
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,311
Life is for enjoying,

742
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,978
not just getting and working,
and getting and working.

743
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,647
We do indeed have very different
notions of what enjoyment is.

744
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,263
Deladis: Wait...!

745
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,703
Lily: Fate... careful.

746
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,314
(grunting)

747
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,084
Lily: Oh...!

748
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,457
Stop.

749
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,723
(panting)

750
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,867
I told you,

751
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,335
we couldn't get there
with this thing.

752
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,202
Where's your...

753
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,504
pioneer spirit, Fate?

754
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,875
We can't give-up.

755
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,846
Come on, let's keep trying.

756
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,541
No, Del.

757
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,550
She's crazy.
I've been lugging this thing

758
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,176
everywhere it don't belong.

759
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,313
I'm not risking life and limb
for no stupid song.

760
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,323
I need these recordings.

761
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,292
I need them,
right, Deladis?

762
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,852
Doc...

763
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,330
no one's ever tried to...

764
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,594
haul a thing
like this up here.

765
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,896
Until now. Come along.

766
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,304
I'll show you,
Mr. Honeycutt,

767
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,604
what you can achieve
if you don't give-up.

768
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:00,973
- (grunting)
- No!

769
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,981
(panting)

770
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:09,984
You...!

771
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,586
I will not give-up!

772
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,298
Come along.

773
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,234
please, Fate, come with us.

774
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,187
I decided to take
your offer, Earl.

775
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,452
A dollar an acre
and jobs for me and my boys.

776
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,351
Why, if it ain't
the songcatcher.

777
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,624
Earl: Dr. Lily...

778
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,899
you sure do get around,
don't you?

779
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,095
Lily: Nice to see you again,
Mr. Giddens.

780
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,661
Mr. And Mrs. Gentry,

781
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,104
I'm Lily Penleric.

782
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,006
We heard you might be
coming this way.

783
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,443
Viney says Doc's awful nice

784
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,912
and you should sing for her.

785
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:14,246
Doctor, Uncle Cratis
is the one who knows

786
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,013
about every love song
there is.

787
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,954
Except Uncle Cratis got the calling.
He don't hold to singing no more.

788
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,014
I'm sorry, we've seem
to have come at a bad time.

789
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,856
No, we're about finished here.

790
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,793
I said I'd take
a dollar an acre.

791
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,058
Well, now Parley,

792
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,760
that was before I knew
the land was used up.

793
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,065
Well, I wouldn't be
selling it if it weren't.

794
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,729
I appreciate that,

795
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,740
but Mr. McFarland
would have my head

796
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,208
if I gave that much.

797
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,905
The most
I could give is say...

798
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,447
50 ¢ an acre.

799
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,616
What's that come to?

800
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,585
How many acres
you got again?

801
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,449
About 100,
my daddy always said.

802
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,326
- $50?
- That's all?

803
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,056
That's criminal, Mr. Giddens.

804
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,900
Don't butt in
where you don't belong.

805
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,959
Now the only way these folks
are going to better themselves

806
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,368
is to get the hell off
this mountain

807
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,497
and give-up
their backward ways.

808
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,542
Is that what
your education taught you,

809
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,839
to hate your own people?

810
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,536
(grunting)

811
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,670
(Deladi's screaming)

812
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,513
Fate: Damn you, Giddens,
you're as mean as a copperhead.

813
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,848
- Deladis: No!
- And I sleep like a snake, too.

814
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,318
With both eyes open.

815
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,549
(gun cocking)
Leave the boy, Earl.

816
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,559
Get on out of here.
The deal's done.

817
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,094
You got my word.

818
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:40,903
Get.

819
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,639
Good day, Doctor.

820
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,042
Is that any way to settle
anything, you stupid boy?

821
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,138
That man would steal the dime
off a dead man's eye.

822
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,059
I'm really very sorry.

823
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,303
(melancholy mid tempo tune)

824
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:37,858
(music) When I first come
to this country (music)

825
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,331
(music) In 1849 (music)

826
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:47,530
(music) I saw many fair lovers (music)

827
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:52,667
(music) But I never saw mine (music)

828
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:57,304
(music) I viewed it all around me (music)

829
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,180
(music) Saw I was quite alone (music)

830
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,813
(music) Me a poor stranger (music)

831
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:10,417
(music) And a long way from home (music)

832
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:15,761
(music) Fare thee well
to old Mother (music)

833
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:20,496
(music) Fare thee well
to father, too (music)

834
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,473
(music) I'm going for to ramble (music)

835
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:30,741
(music) This wide world all through (music)

836
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:35,615
(music) And when I get weary (music)

837
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:40,213
(music) I'll sit down and cry (music)

838
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,919
(music) Think of my Saro (music)

839
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,124
(music) Pretty Saro, my bride (music)

840
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:54,301
(music) Well, I wished
I was a turtle dove (music)

841
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,467
(music) Had wings and could fly (music)

842
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:03,343
(music) Far away
to my lover's lodgings (music)

843
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:08,077
(music) Tonight I draw nigh (music)

844
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:13,453
(music) And there in her
lily-white arms (music)

845
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:18,119
(music) I'd lay there all night (music)

846
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,325
(music) And watch through them
little windows (music)

847
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:27,803
(music) For the dawning of day. (music)

848
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,680
Man: The missionary board
is convinced

849
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,310
that the schools
would take hold better

850
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,823
in the mountain communities
if they’re led by a man and wife,

851
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,792
who would integrate
more normally into the community

852
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,088
than two women.

853
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,392
Fortunately for us, Reverend,

854
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,694
we're not under
your jurisdiction.

855
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,291
(chuckling)

856
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,735
I'm beginning to understand
your appreciation

857
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,670
of the local crafts,
Mrs. McFarland.

858
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,301
It's a beautifully made piece.
I have several like it.

859
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,538
She'll bankrupt me
with her collecting.

860
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,346
The Clover School is a model,

861
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,649
but the church is better
equipped to educate.

862
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,384
I endorse the English idea,

863
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,120
we must educate by example.

864
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,095
If we teach these ruffians
to serve tea properly,

865
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,596
they would want refinement,

866
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:29,893
seek it out.

867
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,957
I believe we must ask
the mountain people

868
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,900
what they want
and what they need.

869
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,631
That is the enlightened
point of view.

870
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,697
Man #2: Educating these savages
is a waste of money.

871
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,833
If you want to
help these children,

872
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,070
get them out of their hovels
and put them to work.

873
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,669
There's nothing like
a day's wages

874
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,442
to help make
for advancement.

875
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,453
It's a beautiful land,
isn't it, Mr. McFarland?

876
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,818
It's one of the largest,
untapped coal deposits

877
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,221
in the southern mountains,
Miss Tolliver.

878
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,783
And soon,
I'm gonna own it.

879
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,352
And with my coal mines
will come towns,

880
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,298
roads, railroads,
churches,

881
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,392
even a few more schools.

882
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,768
Although I don't share
the lofty ideals of you ladies,

883
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,636
I would like to make
a small donation

884
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,403
to the Clover school,

885
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,502
say, $500.

886
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,645
Thank you, but we couldn't
possibly accept such a gift,

887
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,151
despite our need.

888
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,711
Yes, it's essential we avoid
all political affiliations

889
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,951
to maintain the trust
of the community.

890
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,483
As far as I know, water pumps
don't have political affiliations.

891
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,862
Mr. McFarland, I thought
you supported Christian education.

892
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,766
I support progress,
Rev. Merriweather.

893
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,634
I also appreciate what
these ladies have accomplished.

894
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,971
I think this school
is the loveliest,

895
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,033
the way Miss Tolliver
and Miss Penleric

896
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,603
have used the local crafts
to decorate.

897
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,309
Are you aware
of the folk arts movement

898
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,648
that is sweeping
New York and London?

899
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,950
I'm quite a collector.

900
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,684
Doc's collecting songs.

901
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:04,090
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

902
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,627
Yes, I am.

903
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,963
Um...

904
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,101
(gasping)
Ah, it's beautiful.

905
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:17,128
So refined.
Was this painted by a local?

906
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:22,338
I knew you would
appreciate it.

907
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,142
Do you know I have sent
a dozen of these

908
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,876
to a gallery in New York?

909
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,441
The dealer is very excited.

910
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,816
Harriet:
Oh, look, everybody,

911
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,980
our musical entertainment
is here.

912
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,080
Hi, Will.

913
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,317
Deladis:
Hey, Will.

914
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,156
Harriet:
Everybody, this is Will.

915
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,661
Hello, Will.

916
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,720
Harriet: Why don't you play
"Sally Goodin"?

917
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,498
(up tempo melody)

918
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,875
Oh, Ambrose,
twirl me around the lawn.

919
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,552
Reverend: Miss Tolliver,
may I have the honor?

920
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,179
Harriet: I'd be delighted.

921
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,661
(song continues,
dancers whooping)

922
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:03,469
Whoo!

923
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,175
Ooh...!

924
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,846
Viney: Take a little bit.
Go on.

925
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,655
Viney: Isn't that good?

926
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,491
(cackling laugh)

927
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,258
(music tempo quickens)

928
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,093
Hey, Del.

929
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,994
Where have you been?
Miss Elna's been worried sick.

930
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,329
I ain't her concern no more.
Not hers or nobody's.

931
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,373
Man:
Go on out there, boy.

932
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,875
Woman:
Get on up there.

933
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,933
Miss Elna?

934
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,069
I'd be delighted.

935
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,851
A little space...
It's her chance, now.

936
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,123
Viney: Put out your hands
on your waist.

937
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,098
Come on, let's try it.

938
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,526
Lift them legs!

939
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,284
(laughing and cheering)

940
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,785
Man: Look out in there.

941
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,176
(scoffing)

942
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,075
Hello.

943
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,279
Would you care to...?

944
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,981
Maybe I was speaking a little
too proper to you before.

945
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,422
- Get your long legs out here.
- I don't think so.

946
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,392
Let me show you some
true country spirit.

947
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,019
- Come on.
- No, thank you.

948
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,087
I think perhaps you've had
a little too much to drink.

949
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,655
- Naw.
- No, thank you.

950
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,326
I'll show you right
what you need to know.

951
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,801
No, please, Mr. Bledsoe.

952
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,301
Get on out of here.

953
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,816
(punching and hollering)

954
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,192
(music continues)

955
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,589
(glass breaking)

956
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,200
(waltz tune plays softly)

957
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,484
It's very late.
We should get back.

958
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,679
I'll find my own way home.

959
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,949
I'll see the doctor gets home.

960
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,226
All right.

961
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,490
I'll be fine.
Good night.

962
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:22,895
Good night.

963
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,674
(strums softly)

964
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,621
Tom: Hey, Earl.

965
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,281
How's your head?

966
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,857
(o m chuckling)

967
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:08,471
(music) O what is this (music)

968
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,843
(music) I cannot see (music)

969
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,940
(music) Whose icy hand (music)

970
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,748
(music) Takes hold on me? (music)

971
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:22,313
(music) O I am Death (music)

972
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:26,521
(music) That none can excel (music)

973
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:30,896
(music) I open the door (music)

974
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:34,562
(music) To Heaven and Hell. (music)

975
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,308
(music) O Death, O Death (music)

976
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,942
(music) How can it be (music)

977
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,885
(music) that I must come (music)

978
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,889
(music) And go with thee? (music)

979
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,324
(music) For Death, O Death (music)

980
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,363
(music) How can it be? (music)

981
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,490
(music) I'm unprepared (music)

982
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,025
(music) For eternity (music)

983
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,972
(music) "O yes, I've come (music)

01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,636
(music) For to get your soul (music)

985
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,236
(music) Take your body (music)

986
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,681
(music) And leave it cold (music)

987
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,278
(music) I'll drop the flesh (music)

988
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:29,381
(music) From off of your brain (music)

989
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,019
(music) The earth and the worms (music)

990
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:37,156
(music) Both have their claim" (music)

991
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,929
Woman:
(music) O Death, O Death, (music)

992
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,301
(music) please let me see (music)

993
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:47,331
(music) If Christ has turned (music)

994
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,073
(music) His back on me? (music)

995
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,310
(music) "When you were called (music)

996
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,250
(music) And asked to bow (music)

997
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,448
(music) You wouldn't take heed (music)

998
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:04,289
(music) And it's too late now" (music)

999
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,023
(music) Farewell, farewell (music)

1000
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,658
(music) To all farewell (music)

1001
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:15,431
(music) My doom is fixed (music)

1002
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:19,804
(music) I'm summoned to Hell (music)

1003
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:23,402
(music) As long as God (music)

1004
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,040
(music) In Heaven shall dwell (music)

1005
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,882
(music) My soul, my soul (music)

1006
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:35,390
(music) Shall scream in Hell. (music)

1007
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,397
We'll stay on here.

1008
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:53,438
I'm not grateful for your vain
gallantry, Mr. Bledsoe.

1009
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,035
I am perfectly capable
of looking out for myself.

1010
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,548
Oh, don't worry.
I'd beat that snake up for fun

1011
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,982
any day of the week.

1012
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,726
I have never heard such...

1013
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,696
...such singing.

1014
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,210
I never met an outlander
who likes music as much as you do.

1015
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,248
I have never been anywhere

1016
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,011
where the music is as much
a part of life as it is here.

1017
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:39,418
It's like the air
you all breathe.

1018
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,080
It's beautiful.

1019
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,000
I would like to discuss
something with you seriously.

1020
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,438
Serious?
What is it?

1021
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,735
It's about my work.

1022
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,004
Actually, it's about my book.

1023
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,374
I believe...

1024
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,044
that you could win public
sentiment over with your music.

1025
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,485
- Public sentiment?
- Yes.

1026
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,223
Let me tell you something,

1027
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,418
we're not really interested

1028
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,654
in what you people out there
think about us.

1029
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,788
- Well, you should be.
- Oh, yeah?

1030
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,993
What I'm trying to say
is when my book is published,

1031
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,332
I believe the mountain people
will be seen

1032
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,803
in a very different light.

1033
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,705
Oh, what is that light,
may I ask?

1034
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,572
Well, the common view

1035
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:37,009
is that there is
no culture here,

1036
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,570
and that the people
are dirty, ignorant and savage.

1037
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,242
You forgot illiterate
and inbred.

1038
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:45,219
The only way to preserve
our way of life up here

1039
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,688
is to keep your way
of life down there.

1040
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,657
That is the way you kill something,
by shutting it out...

1041
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,751
You know what?
You just don't understand,

1042
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,887
and you never will.

1043
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,923
We just want
to be left alone, see?

1044
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,628
Then the mountain ways
will die.

1045
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,034
We'll see.

1046
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,433
I don't want to fight with you.

1047
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,100
Me neither.

1048
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,644
We just keep getting off
on the wrong foot, don't we?

1049
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,172
Good night.

1050
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,648
Can I take my wrong feet
and walk you home?

1051
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,881
No, I can find my own way.
Thank you.

1052
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,856
I promised... Miss Elna.

1053
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,416
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
I am the big sister...

1054
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,654
not Elna.

1055
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,129
O-ho-ho, I noticed.

1056
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,994
I noticed.

1057
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,559
(singing)

1058
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,247
(piercing shriek)

1059
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,399
(shriek)

1060
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,148
(growling and clothes tearing)

1061
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,024
(shriek)

1062
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,236
(shriek)

1063
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,008
(gasping)

1064
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,017
Tom: Whoa! Whoa!

1065
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,812
- Whoa.
- (Lily laughing)

1066
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,754
Here you go.

1067
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,850
Why won't you admit it was you?
Give me that.

1068
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,554
- It was you.
- But it wasn't me.

1069
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,460
It had to be the panther.

1070
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,931
Either that or maybe you...

1071
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,662
- maybe you imagined it.
- I did not imagine it.

1072
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,228
It was as real
as you and me.

1073
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,331
Ooh...

1074
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,240
Why aren't you married?

1075
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,713
Why aren't you?

1076
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:04,410
I've been married.
Twice.

1077
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,580
My second wife died
of lung fever.

1078
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,456
I'm sorry.

1079
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,655
I'm a jinx for a woman, Lily.

1080
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,999
I'm not your average woman.

1081
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,503
No, you're not, are you?

1082
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,799
Deladis:
(music) O holiday, O holy day (music)

1083
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,104
(music) The first day of they ear (music)

1084
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,701
(music) Little Matthy Groves
to church to goes (music)

1085
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,974
(music) Some holy words to hear (music)

1086
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,176
(music) Hear some holy words
to hear. (music)

1087
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,048
Come on, Doc,
you know this one.

1088
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:15,022
Both: (music) He spied some women
dressed in black (music)

1089
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,115
(music) As they came into view (music)

1090
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,093
(music) Lord Daniel's wife
was gaily clad (music)

1091
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,062
(music) The flower of the few (music)

1092
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,032
(music) Few, the flower of the few (music)

1093
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,762
(music) She stepped up
to Little Matthy Groves (music)

1094
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:30,066
(music) Her eyes cast
on the ground (music)

1095
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,107
(music) "Oh, please,
oh, please come with me (music)

1096
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,438
(music) Stay as you pass
through this town (music)

1097
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,968
(music) Town, as you pass
through this town." (music)

1098
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,741
- Deladis...
- Hmm?

1099
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,806
You are officially
my assistant now,

1100
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,614
and it's going to say so
in my book.

1101
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,177
(music) "O what is this?"
Said Little Matthy Groves (music)

1102
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,588
(music) As he sat up in bed (music)

1103
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,183
(music) "I fear it is
your husband's mad (music)

1104
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,888
(music) And I will soon be dead (music)

1105
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,489
(music) Dead, I will soon be dead" (music)

1106
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:00,126
(music) But Little Matthy Groves
he laid back down (music)

1107
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,033
(music) And soon fell off to sleep (music)

1108
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,664
(music) When he woke up,
Lord Daniel (music)

1109
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,935
(music) Was standing
at his bed feet (music)

1110
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:10,274
(music) Feet, standing
at his bed feet (music)

1111
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,609
(music) Saying, " How do you like
my snow white pillows?" (music)

1112
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,343
(music) Saying, " How do you
like my sheets? (music)

1113
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,079
(music) How do you like my pretty
little woman (music)

1114
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,347
(music) That's a-lying
in your arms asleep? (music)

1115
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:23,050
(music) Sleep, lying
in your arms asleep?" (music)

1116
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,821
(music) The first swing
that Little Matthy made (music)

1117
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,919
(music) It hurt Lord Daniel sore (music)

1118
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,328
(music) The next swing
that Lord Daniel made (music)

1119
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,697
(music) Little Matthy hit the floor (music)

1120
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:33,996
(music) Floor, Little Matthy
hit the floor (music)

1121
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,001
(cocking)

1122
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,470
What do you want?

1123
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:43,708
Uh...

1124
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,111
Parley Gentry sent us.

1125
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,342
My name is Lily Penleric.

1126
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,214
We are looking
for Uncle Cratis.

1127
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:51,877
What for?

1128
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:54,252
I'm a song collector.

1129
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,814
Parley says
Uncle Cratis knows

1130
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,723
about every
love song there is.

1131
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,729
We're making a book.

1132
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,524
Cratis got religion.
He don't do no singing no more.

1133
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,930
Well, perhaps
if I spoke with him...?

1134
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,943
Cratis!

1135
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,546
(music) Uncle Cratis. (music)

1136
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,987
You gonna burn in Hell,
Josie Moore.

1137
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,888
Mr. Kincaid?

1138
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,360
Do I know you, woman?

1139
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:43,737
I'm your wife's friend.

1140
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,799
You all go on.
We got no songs here.

1141
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,806
Your family needs you,
Mr. Kincaid.

1142
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,214
Reese belongs here with me.

1143
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,282
Go on.

1144
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,052
Alice: How can I thank you?

1145
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,958
Alice, you don't have to.

1146
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,657
I've barely been able
to keep body and soul together

1147
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,722
since Reese left again.

1148
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,598
People have been helping out
the best they can, but...

1149
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,331
Lily: Well, now that...

1150
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,635
Clementine McFarland
is collecting your paintings,

1151
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,106
others will as well.

1152
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,335
Maybe I should take the children
down to Asheville.

1153
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,243
I mean, if what you say
is true,

1154
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,942
I could provide for us
in a big town.

1155
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:30,783
Hello, Alice.

1156
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,150
- Daddy?
- Reese?

1157
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,552
Daddy.

1158
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,856
Well, he y, big man.

1159
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,723
Hey, little bit.

1160
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,763
- Hey.
- Hey.

1161
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,133
You look pretty today, Alice.

1162
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:50,967
You remember, Dr. Penleric,
don't you?

1163
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,529
Mr. Kincaid.

1164
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:55,808
(grunting)

1165
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,175
Hey, Del.

1166
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,875
Hey.

1167
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,110
Hey, Del.

1168
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,815
Fate: "It is..."

1169
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:09,888
"It is dep..."

1170
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,791
What are you doing
reading other people's writing?

1171
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,732
"It is deplorable...

1172
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,263
that the literature
of the ballad

1173
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:26,307
has attracted
so much more attention

1174
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,172
than the music.

1175
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:32,612
The two elements
should never be disassociated.

1176
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,148
The music and text

1177
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,117
are one and indivisible,

1178
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,812
and to separate one
from the other

1179
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:42,254
is to remove the processed gem
from its beautiful setting."

1180
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,019
Oh, Lord.

1181
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,491
What are you laughing at?

1182
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,586
She's just saying our songs
are finer than frog hair.

1183
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,256
You're going soft
in the head, Tom.

1184
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,129
- Yeah, maybe.
- (women laughing)

1185
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,770
Tom: Ladies.

1186
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,541
Hello.

1187
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,912
What are you doing here?

1188
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,109
Uh...

1189
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,244
I brought you something.

1190
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:18,985
Come on.

1191
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,829
- You shouldn't have.
- Well, I did.

1192
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,429
- It's warm today, huh?
- Yes.

1193
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,907
Elna: Tom...?

1194
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,742
Why don't you
advise my sister

1195
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,443
to join us at the picnic
this afternoon?

1196
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,350
I haven't had any luck.
Perhaps you might.

1197
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,714
What, and leave her work?

1198
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:54,225
Deladis, are you ready?

1199
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,786
Um...

1200
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:00,100
I ain't going.

1201
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:03,035
It's too hot and muggy
for a picnic.

1202
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,596
All right, suit yourself.

1203
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,877
Let me show you this here.
A noter.

1204
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,005
A what?

1205
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,573
Noter.
Take that in your left hand,

1206
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:18,585
and you play these strings.

1207
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,149
Let's go for a walk.

1208
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,556
Ah, yes.

1209
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,958
We'll leave you two
to your music lesson.

1210
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,469
Tom: You know, it ain't
none of my business...

1211
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,812
Miss Harriet and Miss Elna...

1212
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,081
they’re...

1213
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,176
What?

1214
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,615
Sweethearts,
I guess you call it.

1215
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,021
(women giggling)

1216
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,992
Don't be ridiculous.

1217
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,257
Listen, it don't bother me none.
It would rile most people,

1218
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,161
but it don't bother me none.

1219
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,640
I'm sure it's only because
they’re so isolated.

1220
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,170
Who else would they be with?

1221
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:19,111
Well, certainly not
a mountain man.

1222
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,781
(giggling)

1223
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:08,091
I see you two.
Now you quit that.

1224
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,926
Fate: Hey, Johnson.

1225
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,933
I got a letter here
for the doctor.

1226
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,902
She ain't here right now,
but you can leave it.

1227
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,599
No, no.
You see this here word?

1228
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,334
That means it's important

1229
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,308
and she got to get it
right away.

1230
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,777
Urgent? I can read.

1231
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:28,213
She's gone to Alton's Creek.
I'll take it over.

1232
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:30,251
You'd do that for me,
ol' Fate?

1233
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,252
Sure, Johnson, sure.

1234
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,118
- I'll go with you.
- Naw, you stay here.

1235
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,055
- Why?
- 'Cause I said.

1236
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,116
Uh-uh,
I'm coming with you.

1237
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,128
You deliver it
into her own hands.

1238
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,528
Oh, I will, I will.

1239
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:45,225
Thank you.

1240
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,289
By e.

1241
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,038
Sure, I'll deliver
the letter, Doc.

1242
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,904
You can't do that.
That's Doc's letter.

1243
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,637
- Give me that.
- Come and get it.

1244
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,077
Del, come back here!

1245
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,136
(Deladi's laughing)

1246
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,981
Oof, shit.

1247
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:43,888
Del?

1248
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,354
Oh, God!

1249
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:18,357
Oh, God.

1250
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:26,366
(sobbing)
Oh, God.

1251
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,698
Elna, we have to get back
to the school.

1252
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,704
Elna!

1253
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,000
Fate!

1254
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,335
Elna!

1255
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,072
Deladis:
Johnson said it was urgent.

1256
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,513
(giggling)

1257
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,830
Wallace's voice:
"Dear Lily,

1258
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,030
It is with great pride
that I write.

1259
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,005
I took the liberty of showing

1260
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,803
the ballads you sent me
to Cyrus Whittle.

1261
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,401
He immediately confirmed
the importance of your discovery

1262
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:13,811
and thinks it imperative
the ballads be collected urgently.

1263
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,077
The dean has s e cured the funds.

1264
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:17,948
You'll be thrilled to know
Whittle himself

1265
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,884
intends to collect the songs

1266
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,651
and insisted that you continue
as his assistant."

1267
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,386
Assistant!?

1268
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:29,560
"please respond immediately.

1269
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,326
Regards, Wallace."

1270
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,301
Uncle Cratis is preaching
the gospel tomorrow.

1271
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,633
Yes, dear.

1272
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,900
Deladis: Can I wear
my new green calico?

1273
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,587
(screaming)

1274
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,653
No!

1275
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:36,788
It's afire!

1276
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,958
Elna:
Harriet, no! Run!

1277
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:43,427
Oh, no.

1278
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,996
Come on. Come on.

1279
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,439
Oh, my God.

1280
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:51,338
(whooping and laughing)

1281
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,477
- My glasses!
- No, no, no.

1282
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,791
Elna: Lily!

1283
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:17,203
Lily!

1284
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,184
Goodbye, my darling girl.

1285
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:08,565
Tom: Oh, good Lord.

1286
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,210
Go away.

1287
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,722
Elna...?

1288
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:06,166
How am I going to live
without her?

1289
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:14,672
Perhaps you could find her.

1290
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,806
She swore if anyone
ever found out...

1291
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,372
she'd disappear.

1292
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,923
My Harriet.

1293
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,367
I'm sorry.

1294
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:45,934
I'm so sorry.

1295
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,284
Hey, Doc, look.

1296
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:40,559
Deladis: Doc?

1297
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,296
Cratis: You all don't
have to believe me,

1298
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,861
but you got to believe
the word of God.

1299
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,407
I know you believe the Bible,
and the Bible says,

1300
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:58,502
"For her sins
have reached unto Heaven

1301
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:02,606
and God has remembered
her iniquities."

1302
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:06,175
- Amen.
- "Therefore shall her plagues

1303
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,188
come in one day.

1304
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,520
Death, and mourning
and famine

1305
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:15,893
and she shall be utterly
destroyed with fire."

1306
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:17,362
Amen.

1307
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:22,061
"For strong is the Lord God
that judges her."

1308
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,068
Amen.

1309
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:28,571
Where did you get to?
I was looking for you.

1310
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,237
"Thou has polluted the land
with thy whoredoms

1311
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:33,109
and with thy wickedness"!

1312
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,545
Amen.

1313
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:37,616
I'm going to bust you up,
Hilliard!

1314
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:38,913
Tom!

1315
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:41,978
They're the whores
of Babylon come to tempt us, Tom!

1316
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:45,492
That snake right there,
and that little weasel next to him,

1317
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,791
they’re the ones who set fire
to the school!

1318
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:52,390
And all this while women
and children were still inside!

1319
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:54,832
They're evil women!

1320
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,199
Now are you going
to listen to them

1321
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,033
or are you going
to listen to me?

1322
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,471
I am ashamed of you boys.

1323
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:06,039
I ain't seen nothing but good
come out of that school.

1324
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:10,413
Them women were sent
by the devil himself.

1325
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:13,317
Only wickedness comes
of book learning.

1326
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,412
- Amen!
- Cratis...

1327
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:18,083
I ain't never had a chance
to learn nothing.

1328
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,286
And my kids ain't neither

1329
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,989
because they is always
working too hard

1330
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:24,827
keeping food on the table.

1331
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:28,528
But I got grandbabies
as smart as any others!

1332
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,036
And I want them
to have a chance.

1333
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,664
Man: That's the devil
speaking through him.

1334
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,173
- Amen.
- Amen.

1335
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:35,538
Reese Kincaid!

1336
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,444
You said
you'd never leave me.

1337
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,175
Josie...

1338
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:54,057
Tom: (music) A lilac comes (music)

1339
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,892
(music) On a poisoned thorn (music)

1340
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:06,138

1341
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:12,540

1342
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,776
(music) As the black crow flies (music)

1343
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:21,453
(music) Mama's weeping (music)

1344
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:23,922
(music) Hear the mountains cry (music)

1345
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:29,627
(music) There was another (music)

1346
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:33,766
(music) A wild dirt flower (music)

1347
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:39,973
(music) Cold was her heart (music)

1348
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,374
(music) And as dark as dire (music)

1349
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:49,173
(music) Tears on the ground (music)

1350
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:52,515
(music) For her love did die (music)

1351
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:57,087
(music) 'Neath the bloody moon (music)

1352
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,950
(music) Hear the mountains cry (music)

1353
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,524
(music) Oh, dig his grave (music)

1354
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:10,503
(music) Narrow and deep (music)

1355
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:16,605
(music) Set a jug of whiskey (music)

1356
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:20,943
(music) By his thirsty feet (music)

1357
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:25,679
(music) And lay two pennies (music)

1358
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:29,052
(music) On his roving eyes (music)

1359
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:34,558
(music) Two women wailing (music)

1360
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:37,995
(music) As the mountains cry. (music)

1361
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:41,725
Thank you, dear.

1362
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:45,404
Elna...

1363
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:49,733
will you be all right
if I leave?

1364
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:51,300
So soon?

1365
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:56,111
Why don't you come with me?

1366
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:58,310
You can live as you please
in a big city.

1367
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,947
I've thought about it.

1368
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,793
I want to reopen the school.

1369
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:15,595
I was thinking about asking you
to stay with me.

1370
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:17,466
It needs another teacher.

1371
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:24,772
I didn't think you would.

1372
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,551
I shall miss you.

1373
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:39,021
- (music) Oh the wind blows weary (music)
- My littleelf.

1374
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:42,290
(music) And the willows sigh... (music)

1375
01:36:42,363 --> 01:36:43,762
I'll miss you, too.

1376
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:48,325
(music) Rivers of sorrow (music)

1377
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:52,896
(music) And the mountains cry (music)

1378
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:56,704
(music) Rivers of sorrow... (music)

1379
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:03,580
(music) And the mountains cry. (music)

1380
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,191
I'm sorry.

1381
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:20,264
I'm sorry, too.

1382
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,637
I'm sorry
about that school

1383
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:27,071
and I'm sorry
about your book.

1384
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:34,205
You made most of us
feel real proud.

1385
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,378
Thank you.

1386
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,421
I'm sure someone else will come
and write down all of the songs.

1387
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,288
- Are you giving up?
- Um-hmm.

1388
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:50,592
I realize that it was
the voices singing them

1389
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:52,029
that I wanted everyone to hear.

1390
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:54,124
Are you going back
to your university, then?

1391
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,897
No, no, I don't think so.

1392
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,841
- Where are you going?
- I'm not sure.

1393
01:38:09,783 --> 01:38:11,011
Come with me?

1394
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,817
How will I earn a living
down the mountain?

1395
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,157
With your music.

1396
01:38:24,498 --> 01:38:27,365
I couldn't take care
of you right doing this.

1397
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,397
Then work in a coal mine.

1398
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:32,632
No, I did that once
and I guarantee you

1399
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:34,674
I never ever will again.

1400
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,301
So you're just content
to sit on a mountain

1401
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,142
and hide your head
in a jug, is that it?

1402
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:42,614
A man's meant
to provide for his wife

1403
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:45,015
and his family, Lily.

1404
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:48,179
You were meant
to make music.

1405
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:51,656
Besides which, I don't want you
to take care of me.

1406
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:55,217
- And I do have a plan.
- Oh, of course you do.

1407
01:38:55,296 --> 01:38:57,093
Did you ever have a day
without a plan?

1408
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:00,691
It includes you, Tom.
Do you want to hear it?

1409
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,406
Go on.

1410
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:08,168
Well...

1411
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:12,008
nowadays, phonographs
only cost about $ 10.

1412
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:14,877
I think that soon everyone
is going to have one.

1413
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:17,975
I was thinking
that we could...

1414
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,282
make cylinders
of mountain music and s ell them.

1415
01:39:25,826 --> 01:39:28,294
Who the hell would buy them?

1416
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:30,091
Oh, I think everyone would.

1417
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:31,961
I know they would, Tom.

1418
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:33,226
The way the music
makes you feel,

1419
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,460
of course they would.

1420
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:37,129
You're just about as crazy...

1421
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:38,136
Hey!

1422
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:41,101
What are you doing here?

1423
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:44,874
Go on before I shoot you!

1424
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:46,845
I want to talk to Deladis.

1425
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:57,284
Fate: Del...

1426
01:39:57,358 --> 01:39:59,121
I come to get you
to be my wife.

1427
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,664
I don't want
no part of you.

1428
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:09,327
If you don't take me now,

1429
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:10,893
I'm marrying Polly.

1430
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:15,203
I went to the woods...

1431
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:19,236
and the knot didn't hold.

1432
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:24,812
You're Polly's now.

1433
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:42,935
I love you, child.

1434
01:40:46,907 --> 01:40:48,306
Tom: Hey, Del...

1435
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:52,507
we're going
down the mountain.

1436
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:56,680
Do you want
to come with us?

1437
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:03,613
We're going to make cylinders
of mountain music

1438
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:05,282
to s ell to outlanders.

1439
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,190
(laughing)

1440
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:09,896
What?

1441
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:12,555
Isn't that the craziest thing
you ever heard?

1442
01:41:12,633 --> 01:41:14,396
It's the craziest.

1443
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,436
Viney: Of course
she'll come with you.

1444
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,869
Granny?

1445
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:21,737
Tom, I'll be fine.

1446
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:25,973
I'll be right here
when you come back to visit.

1447
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,060
Tom: Why don't you
back up aways,

1448
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,822
until one of us
can pull over?

1449
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:44,523
Perhaps I'd better get out.

1450
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:49,929
Are you Cyrus Whittle?

1451
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:53,666
Yes, I am.
Who are you?

1452
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,264
I'm Lily Penleric.

1453
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:59,005
Lily Penleric?
How remarkable.

1454
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:01,513
I was just on my way
to meet you.

1455
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:03,812
Whittle: Didn't you get
Prof. Aldrich's letter?

1456
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:05,408
Lily: Yes. I did,
but I didn't realize

1457
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:06,919
you were coming
immediately.

1458
01:42:06,987 --> 01:42:11,151
The work is urgent.
Your discovery is too great.

1459
01:42:11,225 --> 01:42:13,318
The collection must be
moved forward

1460
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:15,452
as expeditiously as possible.

1461
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:19,488
That's why I'm here in the hopes
of being able to assist you.

1462
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:21,397
Assisting me?

1463
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:24,767
I told Aldrich
to ask your permission.

1464
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:28,035
I made myself
quite clear to the dean.

1465
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:31,373
I am only here to facilitate
and cooperate

1466
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,345
in the completion
of the collection

1467
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:35,711
of this vast body of songs.

1468
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:38,250
There is no collection

1469
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:41,219
be yond the 10 songs
that I sent Prof. Aldrich.

1470
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:44,314
What?
All this time, you mean...

1471
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:46,655
- It was destroyed in a fire.
- Oh, I can't bear it.

1472
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:49,423
I'm afraid so, along with
my phonograph recordings.

1473
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,589
Oh, my Lord.

1474
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,860
Phonograph, you say?

1475
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,995
You know, I had no idea
it was feasible to lug

1476
01:42:58,071 --> 01:43:00,972
a phonograph
into the wilderness.

1477
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:02,008
It isn't.

1478
01:43:05,078 --> 01:43:07,205
Well, then in that case
it's very fortuitous

1479
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,908
that I'm here, isn't it?

1480
01:43:08,982 --> 01:43:11,075
We can start again,
you and I!

1481
01:43:22,296 --> 01:43:23,661
Thank you, Prof. Whittle,

1482
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,494
but I'm afraid I have
other plans.

1483
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,797
What on earth could be
more important

1484
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,734
than this collection
of songs?

1485
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:33,932
Lily: I bequeath the collection
of the mountain ballads to you.

1486
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:35,565
- To me?
- Mm-hm.

1487
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:37,872
How am I going to work
without you?

1488
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:41,504
Well, when you get
to Bear Creek

1489
01:43:41,582 --> 01:43:43,311
ask for Viney Butler.

1490
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:46,511
Tell Viney, that Tom, Lily
and Deladis said

1491
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:49,317
you are a very nice man,
and she should help you.

1492
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,282
- Who? Deladis?
- Deladis.

1493
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:57,154
Lily: Viney Butler.

1494
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,859
She knows dozens of songs.
She will help you.

1495
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:06,736
Fare thee well, professor,

1496
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:10,766
but I must assure you
I intend to publish these songs

1497
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:14,541
under both our names...
yours first, of course.

1498
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:16,014
It's Penleric.

1499
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,210
That's one "N"
and no "K."

1500
