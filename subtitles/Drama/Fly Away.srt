What am I working on?

2
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,361
Something that will
change the world...

3
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:06,245
...and human life as we know it.

4
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:10,003
Change it a lot or just a bit?
Be more specific.

5
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:13,041
You want me to be more
specific here with...

6
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:16,529
...half the scientific
community eavesdropping?

7
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:18,208
Where else?

8
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,686
You could come back to my lab.

9
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,126
I'll make cappuccino.

10

I have a Faema of my own.

11

It's not the dilettante's
plastic model.

12
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:34,566
It's a restaurant espresso machine
with an eagle on top.

13
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,001
Somehow I get the feeling
you don't get out much.

14
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,405
- You can tell that?
- Yes.

15
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:54,085
You're making a mistake.
I think you really want to talk to me.

16
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:57,171
Sorry. I have three other interviews
before this party is over.

17
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:59,927
But they don't have something
that will change the world.

18

They say they do.

19
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,286
Yeah but they're lying.

20
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:05,842
I'm not.

21

Are you sick?

22
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:16,207
No... Sure.

23
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,883
You're not a very good drunk.

24
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,083
No, I'm always like this.
It's the...

25
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:27,523
...motion sickness. When I was a kid,
I puked on my tricycle.

26
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:30,571
I hate vehicles.

27
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,286
Should I drive slowly?

28
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,967
No. Turn left.
We're almost there.

29
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:52,842
This is it?

30
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:56,483
It's cleaner on the inside.

31

Please.

32
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:39,246
Listen.
Maybe this is a bad idea.

33
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,971
Too late.

34
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,003
You've already seen them.
You can't leave here alive.

35
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,127
I haven't seen anything.

36
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:52,762

38
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:02,564
Very cute.

39
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:06,645
I bet you have a really neat
jukebox in here too.

No.

43

...prototype of those.
The first one I had made.

44
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,767
It works, but it's clunky.

45
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,531
I call them telepods.

46
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,171
They're controlled by this.

47
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,690
Thank God for that.

48
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,091
So, what do they do?
The phones booths?

49
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:48,282
Telepods.

50
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,970
Okay, I need an object. Um.

51
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:00,528
Do you have something that is...

52
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:04,165
...personal I can use?
Something uniquely you?

53
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,451
An item of clothing or jewelry?

54
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,528

What?

166
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:39,411
I can only teleport inanimate objects.

167
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,323
What happens when you
teleport living things?

168
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,048
Not while we're eating.

169
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,769
Can't be worse than this.

170
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,653
You're not doing
a good job of convincing me.

171
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:59,368
I think I should tell
the world about this now.

172
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,565
You should tell it...

173
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,922
...but not yet.
What do you have so far?

174
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,166
Enough to make you nervous.

175
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:11,729
Why not get more? Make me
your major project, a book.

176
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,810
Not a magazine article.

177
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:17,164
Follow me and my work,
day by day in detail.

178
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:21,692
I have no life, so there's nothing
for you to interfere with.

179

"The complete record of the most
earth-shattering invention ever.

all concepts of transport...

...of borders and frontiers,
of time and space."

183
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,532
The book will end with me...

184
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:45,043
...transporting myself
from one telepod to another.

185
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:46,481
That's what's missing.

186

00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:01,728
You gave it to me.

196
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,652
I should've changed the lock.

197
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:05,923
You didn't.

198
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,411
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

199
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:13,243
That's because unconsciously...

200
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,084
...you still want me to come back,
move in again.

No.

202
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:24,445
That's because, consciously,
I'm lazy and disorganized.

203

Your new playmate's interesting.

205

- Yeah.

I was wrong.
He's really quite brilliant.

209
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,368
He led the F32 team.
Remember that?

An inch away from the
Nobel Prize for physics.

211

Why?

It can't deal with the flesh,
only inanimate objects.

the same clothes.

No, these are clean.
I change my clothes every day.

The computer is giving us
its interpretation...

...of a steak. It's translating it,
rethinking it...

...rather than reproducing it.

281

Something gets lost
in the translation.

The flesh.

284
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:04,323
It should make the computer crazy.
Like old ladies pinching babies.

285
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,487
But it doesn't yet.

286
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:11,005
I haven't taught the computer
to be made crazy by the flesh.

287
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:12,885
The poetry of the steak.

288
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:15,643
So I'll teach it now.

Send the baboon out for tests,
see if he's okay.

Yeah, why?

318
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:30,531
Well, I was thinking that
we could take a holiday.

319
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,403
We could?

320
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,809
Yeah.
Like an old married couple.

a couple weeks off, so...

322
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,288
...they go to Florida, someplace warm.

323
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,122
Just you and me?

324
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:45,532
Is there someone else
you want to bring along?

325
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,963
No, no, I just...

326
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:51,243

00:46:18,453 --> 00:46:20,921
You're afraid to be destroyed
and re-created.

487
00:46:21,173 --> 00:46:23,129
Think you woke me up about the flesh?

488
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:26,490
You only know society's
straight line about the flesh.

489
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:31,284
You can't penetrate society's
sick gray fear of the flesh.

490
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:36,084
Drink deep, or taste not the plasma
spring. See what I'm saying?

491
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,285
This is not just sex and penetration,
but penetration...

492
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:41,484
...beyond the veil of the flesh.

493
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:45,163
A deep, penetrating dive
into the plasma pool.

494
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:27,885
I'll have a scotch.

495
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:31,892
Who's winning?

496
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:35,081
I don't know.

497
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,686
I hope it's Marky.

498
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:42,009
- How come?
- Because.

499
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:43,972
I like Marky tonight.

500
00:47:45,173 --> 00:47:46,162
I like you tonight.

501
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,484
Maybe I'd better get involved.

502
00:47:52,773 --> 00:47:55,333
Hey, pal, you're disturbing us.

503
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,564
$ 100 says I can beat either of you.

504
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:02,686
Take a hike, asshole.

505
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:03,882
Here.

506
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:07,886
Here's my hundred.

507
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:11,049
I get to take her home if I win.

508
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:12,886
Says who?

509
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:14,522
Do I look like a hooker?

510
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:18,484
Tawny, it's an easy hundred.
Let's get it over with.

511
00:48:22,373 --> 00:48:25,888
- Watch out. He eats chocolate bars.
- So I noticed.

512
00:49:12,893 --> 00:49:14,611
TAWNY:
Are you a bodybuilder?

513
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:18,926
BRUNDLE: I build bodies. I take them
apart and put them back together.

514
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:21,209
TAWNY:
Well, you sure took Marky apart.

515
00:49:21,453 --> 00:49:24,331
- Let's go to my place.
- Your place?

516
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:27,690
Well, okay.
I live with my mother anyway.

517
00:49:27,893 --> 00:49:31,329
But could we go
to a few more bars first?

518
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:34,371
- It's too early to quit.
- Sure, a few more bars.

519
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:00,889
Great place.

520
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:10,691
There's no elevator.

521
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:13,888
- I can't make it.
- There's an elevator.

522
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,890
There, don't you feel elevated?

523
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:22,723
Whoa.

524
00:50:58,293 --> 00:50:59,282
Wow.

525
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:09,566
Are you a magician?

526
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:15,692
Yes.

527
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:45,085
So, are we going to breakfast or not?

528
00:51:47,573 --> 00:51:49,086
It's your turn.

529
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,684
- To do what?
- To go through.

530
00:51:51,893 --> 00:51:53,963
No. I don't want to try that.

531
00:51:54,213 --> 00:51:55,885
It'll make you feel sexy.

532
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:58,283
I already feel sexy.

533
00:51:59,613 --> 00:52:01,285
How about...

534
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:03,691
...a nice...

535
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:07,284
...alcohol rub?
- Don't do that! It hurts.

536
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:11,089
Sorry, hon.

537
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:14,286
I didn't know you had
the skin of a princess.

538
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,612
- You're sensitive.
- Okay!

539
00:52:16,853 --> 00:52:18,923
That's it. You're going to like it.

540
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:21,687
- I don't want to. I'm afraid.
- Don't be afraid.

541
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:22,922
No.

542
00:52:23,653 --> 00:52:26,486
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

543
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:28,692
Who's this?

544
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,524
Oh, I live with my mother too.

545
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,401
Mom, meet Tawny.

546
00:52:35,293 --> 00:52:36,692
I gotta go.

547
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,290
Thanks for a wonderful time.

548
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:55,765
Why'd you scare her off? Jealous?

549
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,202
You're changing.

550
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:02,283
Everything about you is changing.

551
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:04,285
You look bad.

552
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:05,882
You smell bad.

553
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,372
I've never bathed much.

554
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:15,483
Those weird hairs that grew out
of your back, I took them to a lab.

555
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,490
I had them analyzed.

556
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:22,291
The hairs?

557
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,290
The hairs?

558
00:53:25,693 --> 00:53:28,685
Oh, yeah.
That's a strange thing to do.

559
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:31,088
Not as strange as the results.

560
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:34,093
The guy had trouble identifying them.

561
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:38,362
He finally concluded that they
were definitely not human.

562
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:43,287
- Very good.
- Not human, Seth.

563
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:47,452
In fact, very likely insect hairs.

564
00:53:48,093 --> 00:53:49,526
That's ridiculous.

565
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:50,922
Look.

566
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:53,603
There's more. Look at your face.

567
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:56,325
Something happened.

568
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:59,087
You need help. You must be sick.

569
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:00,885
You're jealous!

570
00:54:03,733 --> 00:54:06,372
I've become free
and you can't stand it.

571
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:08,683
You'll do anything to bring me down.

572
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:13,053
Does this look like a sick man to you?

573
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:16,486
No, stop it!

574
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:18,291
Can a sick man do that?

575
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:21,687
The deal is off.
I don't need you anymore.

576
00:54:23,253 --> 00:54:25,244
Seth, please, wait. Seth!

577
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:26,562
Don't come back.

578
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:29,285
Oh, God...

579
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,207
(CRIES)

580
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:38,292
Oh, no.

581
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:42,482
What's happening to me? Am I dying?

582
00:56:44,773 --> 00:56:46,889
Is this how it starts? Am I dying?

583
00:56:50,293 --> 00:56:51,885
Brundle, Seth.

584
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:54,691
Give me a disc.

585
00:56:55,573 --> 00:56:58,087
I need the first
teleportation: S. Brundle.

586
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:34,046
Run sequence.

587
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:19,835
(PHONE RINGS)

588
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:24,036
Hello.

589
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:25,470
(HEAVY BREATHING)

590
00:59:27,562 --> 00:59:28,836
Seth.

591
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:34,836
Seth, I've been trying to reach you.
Where are you?

592
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,873
BRUNDLE:
<i>I've been afraid to see you.</i>

593
00:59:37,122 --> 00:59:41,479
<i>Now I'm afraid not to.</i>

594
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:43,041
Are you at home?

595
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:45,233
<i>You don 't know how right you were.</i>

596
00:59:45,442 --> 00:59:47,034
<i>I've gotten...</i>

597
00:59:47,482 --> 00:59:49,950
<i>... much, much worse.</i>

598
00:59:50,202 --> 00:59:52,432
<i>Please come see me.</i>

599
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:54,434
<i>Please come now.</i>

600
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:19,441
Seth?

601
01:00:20,082 --> 01:00:21,071
I'm here.

602
01:00:21,322 --> 01:00:22,437
BRUNDLE:
Stop!

603
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:24,996
Seth!

604
01:00:28,922 --> 01:00:30,640
You were right.

605
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:32,838
I'm diseased...

606
01:00:33,722 --> 01:00:36,031
...and it might be contagious somehow.

607
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:39,438
I wouldn't want to infect you.

608
01:00:41,682 --> 01:00:43,832
And it's been accelerating.

609
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:47,838
It's unrelenting.
Every day there are changes.

610
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:51,432
Every time I look in the mirror,
I'm someone different, repulsive.

611
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:52,558
What happened?

612
01:00:52,842 --> 01:00:56,630
<i>I know an old lady who swallowed a fly</i>
<i>Perhaps she'll die</i>

613
01:00:57,442 --> 01:01:00,036
Seth, please.

614
01:01:01,082 --> 01:01:05,041
I was not pure. The teleporter
insists on purity. I was not pure.

615
01:01:06,922 --> 01:01:08,594
I don't know what you mean.

616
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:13,040
A fly...

617
01:01:13,602 --> 01:01:18,471
...got into the transmitter pod with
me that first time when I was alone.

618
01:01:21,922 --> 01:01:24,436
The computer got confused.

619
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,759
There weren't supposed
to be two genetic patterns.

620
01:01:27,962 --> 01:01:31,272
And it decided to splice us together.

621
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:33,674
It mated us, me and the fly.

622
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:35,838
We hadn't been properly introduced.

623
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:43,430
My teleporter turned
into a gene splicer.

624
01:01:44,202 --> 01:01:47,433
A very good one.
I'm not Seth Brundle anymore.

625
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:51,993
I'm the offspring
of Brundle and a housefly.

626
01:01:53,802 --> 01:01:56,874
Oh, God. Oh, God, Seth!

627
01:01:57,122 --> 01:01:58,840
You look so pretty.

628
01:01:59,402 --> 01:02:01,040
What will happen?

629
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:04,639
I think it's showing itself
as a bizarre form of cancer.

630
01:02:05,242 --> 01:02:09,838
General cellular chaos and revolution.
I'm just gonna disintegrate.

631
01:02:10,082 --> 01:02:12,038
In a novel way, no doubt.

632
01:02:12,922 --> 01:02:13,957
Then I'll die.

633
01:02:14,642 --> 01:02:18,271
- And then it will be over.
- No, I don't accept that.

634
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:22,071
There must be something we can do,
someone to go to, tests to be done.

635
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:26,639
No! I won't be
just another tumorous bore...

636
01:02:26,882 --> 01:02:30,841
...talking about his hair falling out
and his lost lymph nodes.

637
01:02:31,802 --> 01:02:34,077
What do you want me to do?
Why did you call me?

638
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:46,111
Oh!

639
01:02:49,482 --> 01:02:50,517
Oh.

640
01:02:50,722 --> 01:02:51,996
That's disgusting.

641
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,031
My...

642
01:03:03,802 --> 01:03:05,554
...ear. No!

643
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:08,440
I'm scared.

644
01:03:11,682 --> 01:03:12,876
Help me.

645
01:03:14,202 --> 01:03:17,239
Please, please, help me.

646
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:28,558
- Don't go back to him.
- That's it?

647
01:03:28,802 --> 01:03:29,837
That's your advice?

648
01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:33,034
It could be contagious.
It could become an epidemic.

649
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,880
I have to go back to him.

650
01:03:35,442 --> 01:03:38,832
- I don't believe this.
- Lf you saw him, Stathis...

651
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:42,472
If you saw how scared and angry
and desperate he is...

652
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:45,475
I'm sure Typhoid Mary was nice
when you saw her socially.

653

- I do not want...
- I don't care!

All right, fine, okay.

Do I have permission to claim
your body when this is over?

Oh, God...

Look, how about this?

658
01:04:15,322 --> 01:04:18,234
You say, if only I saw him.

659
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,075
Show me.

660
01:04:20,882 --> 01:04:22,201
Tape him. Show me.

661
01:04:23,002 --> 01:04:24,640
Let me think about it.

662
01:04:26,522 --> 01:04:28,240
I'll come up with something.

663
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:55,636
Seth?

664
01:05:02,122 --> 01:05:03,077
Seth?

No, no, no. Up here.

Yeah, it's almost second nature.

I don't know.

671
01:05:29,322 --> 01:05:32,632
I seem to be stricken by a disease
with a purpose, wouldn't you say?

672
01:05:37,122 --> 01:05:40,432
Maybe not such a bad disease
after all.

673
01:05:41,042 --> 01:05:42,077
I can't stay.

674

No, no, no.

Why not? Why can't you?

676
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,880
I can't take it. It's too much.

677
01:05:49,122 --> 01:05:51,590
Why? The disease
has revealed its purpose.

678
01:05:51,802 --> 01:05:56,000
We don't have to worry about
contagion. I know what it wants.

679
01:05:56,522 --> 01:05:57,796
What does it want?

680
01:05:58,402 --> 01:06:02,236
It wants to turn me
into something else.

681
01:06:02,802 --> 01:06:05,635
Most people would give anything
to be something else.

682
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:07,235
Turned into what?

683
01:06:07,442 --> 01:06:11,401
What do you think, a fly?
Am I becoming a 185-pound fly?

684
01:06:12,282 --> 01:06:14,750
No, I'm becoming something
that never existed.

685
01:06:15,002 --> 01:06:17,357
I'm becoming "Brundlefly."

686
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,439
That's worth a Nobel Prize.

688
01:06:23,922 --> 01:06:27,039

01:06:27,242 --> 01:06:32,157
...that I think you'll want
to record for posterity.

690
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:34,912
I think you must chronicle...

691
01:06:35,122 --> 01:06:38,000
...the life and times of Brundlefly,
don't you?

692
01:06:38,642 --> 01:06:42,635
At the very least, it should make
a fabulous children's book.

How does Brundlefly eat?

696
01:06:55,202 --> 01:06:58,035
He found out the hard way
that he eats like a fly eats.

697
01:06:58,242 --> 01:06:59,880
His teeth are now useless.

698
01:07:00,122 --> 01:07:03,432
Although he can chew up
solid food, he can't digest it.

699
01:07:03,682 --> 01:07:06,913
Solid food hurts. So, like a fly...

<i>He regurgitates on his food.</i>
<i>It liquefies.</i>

I'm saying I'm an insect...

No.

It's the child of a man

...but I detect a certain
uncertainty here.

805

There are tests we can do
to determine whether...

Tests can't guarantee anything.

01:17:54,922 --> 01:17:58,631
If you'll slip into that,
we'll be on our way in no time.

811
01:18:24,442 --> 01:18:25,431
No.

812
01:18:28,922 --> 01:18:30,799
Wait, Seth, no.

813
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,632
Why did you want to kill Brundle?

814
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:03,637
The baby might be all that's left
of the real me.

815
01:19:06,322 --> 01:19:07,675
Please don't kill me.

816
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:12,399
I can't have it. I'm afraid.

817
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:16,271
Please, have the baby.

818
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:17,991
I can't.

819
01:19:18,522 --> 01:19:20,240
I can't.

820
01:19:22,122 --> 01:19:23,635
Too bad.

821
01:19:28,322 --> 01:19:29,835
Too bad.

Help me.

828
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,031
Help me be human.

829
01:23:24,802 --> 01:23:26,030
How?

830
01:23:33,522 --> 01:23:34,841
Well...

831
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:39,640
I go there...

832
01:23:42,082 --> 01:23:43,515
...and you go there.

833
01:23:47,842 --> 01:23:50,436
We come apart...

834
01:23:50,802 --> 01:23:55,159
...and then we come together there.

835
01:23:57,722 --> 01:24:00,361
You, me and the baby.

836
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:02,631
Together.

837

No...

838
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,438
We'll be the ultimate family.

839
01:24:23,922 --> 01:24:28,120
A family of three,
joined together in one body.

840
01:24:29,442 --> 01:24:31,433
More human than I am alone.

841
01:24:32,842 --> 01:24:35,037
No, no!
