1
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,536
Hear me, Satan.

2
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,051
Sarah?

3
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,559
Oh, God! No!

4
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,309
Take my soul, Satan.

5
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,142
Hear me, please.

6
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,791
Jeremy!

7
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,540
Oh, God.

8
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,620
- The Conversation.
- Gene Hackman.

9
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,519
BonnieandClyde.

10
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,390
Regina, name another actor
in BonnieandClyde.

11
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,297
I have no idea.

12
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,833
That´s a good movie.
You should see that.

13
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,401
- Faye Dunaway.
- Chinatown.

14
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,630
-Jack Nicholson.
- Witches ofEastwick.

15
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,139
Cher. Thereyou go.
What else has Cher been in?

16
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,709
BeavisandButthead?

17
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,177
No fair. That´s TV.
It´s the movie game.

18
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,078
No other Cher?

19
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,151
What about anotherJack Nicholson?

20
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,447
I know. TheShining.

21
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,284
Scary movie.
Redrum.

22
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,626
I´ll be on the pier puking.

23
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,448
So, are we still gonna
go back tomorrow night?

24
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,917
- Yeah.
- Cool.

25
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,715
Why?

26
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,952
´Cause Linda got these cool tickets to
this new rave, and they´re hard to get.

27
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,926
No, no.
I´m not keen on the rave scene.

28
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,691
What scene?
It´sjust a concert, right?

29
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,929
From what I hear, everybody´s up
all night getting blasted.

30
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,937
It´s not cool.

31
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,234
- You have no idea.
- What are they like?

32
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,708
Dad, I´m going! I´m almost 1 6.

33
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,609
Regina! You´re not going.

34
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,110
This is ridiculous.
You never let me do anything.

35
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,879
That´s not true.

36
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,510
Forget it!

37
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,421
Honey, honey.

38
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,959
You´ve got to lighten up on her.
She´s almost an adult.

39
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,074
But we don´t wanna lose another kid.

40
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,610
I can´t do it.

41
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,081
I know.

42
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,983
We´re gonna beat this.

43
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,286
Maybe not this lifetime, but--

44
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,884
But we will.

45
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,594
Not that song again!

46
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,336
Maybe we should drive back tonight.

47
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,436
- Really?
- Well--

48
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,544
Hatch, look out!

49
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,051
- Regina, areyou all right?
- You okay?

50
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,461
- Don´t move.
-Jesus.

51
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,464
My God, it´s so far down.

52
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,903
Jesus.

53
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,967
- What´ll we do?
- Open the door. You guys out fiirst.

54
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,613
It´s stuck.

55
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,588
Regina, climb over me.

56
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,887
- I can´t.
- Yes, you can. Here.

57
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,686
- Give meyour hand.
- Come on.

58
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,288
- I won´t letyou get hurt.
- Come on.

59
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,425
Here we go.

60
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,800
Be careful.

61
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,675
Mom!

62
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,684
Help! Get some help!

63
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,966
Hatch! Wake up!

64
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,938
Wake up!

65
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,174
Oh, my God!

66
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,630
Come on.

67
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,678
I gotyou.

68
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,591
Down there. See them?

69
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,638
Get some light down there.
Go get the basket.

70
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,450
Still fiixed and dilated.

71
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,681
No change.

72
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,189
Crash cart ready?
Good. We need vasodialators.

73
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,590
Get an I.V.

74
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,530
Type and cross match, fiive units.

75
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,859
Cut.

76
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,264
No change.

77
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,868
Deader than Elvis.

78
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,672
Let´s bring him back.

79
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,112
- Give me some prep.
- Drops in.

80
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,708
Areyou sureyou want to revive him
after 1 20 minutes down.

81
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,810
Records are made to be broken.

82
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,390
We both rememberwhat happened
last time.

83
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,730
The cardiac adrenaline.

84
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,799
- He´s at 89 degrees.
- Bring him up to 99.

85
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:44,034
Bring him up to 99 slowly.

86
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,135
Come on, Harrison, help me out here.

87
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,227
He´s responding to the adrenaline.
Defiib.

88
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,958
- Do it.
- Pads.

89
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,906
Daddy.

90
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,578
Charge to 200.

91
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,417
Come with me, Daddy.

92
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,224
I loveyou.

93
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,561
Moving up to 1 30.

94
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,134
Charged.

95
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,761
Clear!

96
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,944
Charge to 360.

97
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,450
- Charged.
- Clear.

98
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,207
There he is.

99
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,747
Congratulations, Doctor.

100
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,688
He´s got decent vitals.

101
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,961
Good morning, Mrs. Harrison.
My name is Dr. Nyebern.

102
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,344
We´ve given your daughter
a mild sedative, but she´ll be fiine.

103
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,625
My husband is dead.

104
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,489
No, Mrs. Harrison.
Your husband is stable.

105
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,025
I saw him die.

106
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,864
Mrs. Harrison...

107
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,201
I have a very special Resuscitative
Medicine program here.

108
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,403
We were able
to bring your husband back.

109
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,474
Mrs. Harrison, please.

110
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,346
- Where is he?
- He´s in ICU.

111
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,593
He may seem different toyou.

112
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,171
Was I supposed to turn
into the skid?

113
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,314
I don´t know.

114
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,951
Poor baby.

115
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,425
Oh, thesunandthe--

116
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,560
Ican tellasunnybreeze

117
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,834

118
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,310
Foryou, dear

119
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,640
- Is there meat in that?
- Never.

120
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,981
You don´t have time to eat.

121
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,317
In seven minutes,
Linda´s meeting you here.

122
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,720
What?

123
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,792
PearlJam?

124
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,554
Tonight? Oh, my God!

125
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,892
Thankyou, thankyou!

126
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,727
So excited.
And be home by 1 :00.

127
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,995
- Honey, midnight.
- I know.

128
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,806
I have to tell you a couple things.
Wait.

129
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,742
Oh, yeah.
I´ve been meaning to talk about that.

130
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,728
- You know who I think I saw?
- Who?

131
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,734
Sam.

132
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,806
- Samantha?
- Yeah.

133
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,602
What doyou mean?

134
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:23,110
You know, after the accident
when I was out...

135
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,116
I don´t remember anything.

136
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,244
But I guess a few wires
got crossed...

137
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,881
or I was dreaming or hallucinating
or something...

138
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,619
´cause I feel like I saw her.

139
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,994
She was trying
to tell me something, or--

140
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,034
I don´t know.

141
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,036
What´d she say?

142
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,599
I don´t know.

143
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,672
How´s she doing?

144
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,377
She was happy.

145
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,921
I wanted to go to her.

146
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,124
Oh, honey, don´t. Please.

147
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,594
No, no. I´m okay.

148
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,557
Hatch?

149
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:59,026
Oh, my God.
Hatch, what´s wrong?

150
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,662
Hatch, honey, wake up.

151
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,766
Areyou okay?

152
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,470
What happened? You´re cut.

153
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,809
I killed her.

154
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,314
Come inside.

155
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,976
Come on, let´s go inside.

156
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,677
- Blood!
- It´s okay.

157
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,780
- I killed her.
- No, you didn´t. It was a nightmare.

158
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:25,322
Come on, honey. Oh, my God.
Let´s wash this off.

159
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,422
Come here. It´s okay.

160
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,000
Come on.

161
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:34,231
You cutyourselfdeep, babe.
You´ll need some stitches.

162
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,068
- Where?
- Here.

163
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,578
What happened?

164
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,683
- I was making a sandwich.
- What´s going on?

165
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,082
Honey, it´s okay. Daddy cut himself.

166
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,019
I´m fiine. Go on up. We got it.

167
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,091
- Sorrywe wokeyou.
- You´re bleeding.

168
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,752
Please, Regina. Please.

169
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,263
Go on.
Let me get a towel.

170
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,166
Fuck.

171
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,863
Let me see.

172
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,034
Wow. It´s not as deep
as I thought. Huh?

173
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,715
What was that?

174
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,047
I gotta see Dr. Nyebern.

175
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,551
Oh, babe.

176
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,788
So?

177
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,992
So, ifthere´s anything wrong with you,
it´s not physical.

178
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,624
So what was it?

179
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,566
An acid flashback?

180
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,969
Yeah, yeah. Trippy. Bad!

181
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,667
Afterwhatyou´ve been through, I´d be
surprised ifyou didn´t have nightmares.

182
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,438
Wait. He´s never had
nightmares like this.

183
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,275
I wasn´t asleep.

184
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,248
Has this happened to other people
you resuscitated?

185
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,409
I can´t compare Hatch
to other patients.

186
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,111
Why not?

187
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,985
Only one otherwas down
as long as he was.

188
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,583
Was there anything like this?

189
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,993
Maybe I should talk
to that other patient.

190
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,527
I´m afraid that´s not possible.

191
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,761
Why not?

192
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:17,504
- He´s dead.
- Oh, well, that´s encouraging.

193
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,443
No, not from having been dead?

194
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,538
No, no! Ofcourse not.

195
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,583
You shocked mywife.

196
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,947
Hatch, look...

197
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,284
God´s given you
a second chance at life.

198
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,052
Enjoy it. I´ll prescribe something
to helpyou sleep.

199
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,991
Really?

200
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,637
Ifanything else happens, call me.

201
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,207
- We´ll run more tests.
- Thankyou.

202
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,173
Thanks.

203
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,208
- So it´s good news.
- Good news.

204
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,177
Nothing´s wrong with me.

205
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,234
Daddy.

206
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,068
- Bye, honey. Looking good.
- Bye, Mom.

207
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,763
Bye, Dad.

208
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,175
Stylish.

209
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,932
What´s up?

210
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,435
That´s her.

211
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,471
Who?

212
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,600
The girl.
The one I saw in that--

213
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,008
Monday night.

214
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:13,141
Oh, well, you probably saw her
on TV or something.

215
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,477
I haven´t been watching TV.

216
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,580
Then maybe on the radio
or on a milk carton.

217
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,023
It´s a missing girl.

218
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,459
Honey...

219
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,621
this girl isn´t missing.

220
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,359
She´s dead.

221
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,866
She´s--

222
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,368
Sweetie...

223
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,371
the other night...

224
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,569
how long was I...

225
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,736
out there on the lawn?

226
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,781
I don´t know. Why?

227
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:54,354
Hey, don´t spookyourselfso much,
okay?

228
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,710
- Good morning, Marion.
- Lindsey, hi.

229
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,210
Good morning.

230
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,942
Honey, could you please
go through these?

231
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,825
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he´s fiine.

232
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,328
He´s teething.

233
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,707
Thereyou go.

234
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,675
You made the papers.
Nice picture ofyou.

235
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,805
Though Satan´s looked better.

236
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,716
Something else, Marion, dear?

237
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,417
Well, now thatyou mention it...

238
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,823
I wondered...

239
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,027
what it was like
to be on the other side.

240
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,629
Whatyou saw there.

241
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,367
Just...

242
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,337
chemical brain--

243
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,710
It´s really scientifiic.

244
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,511
Scientifiic?

245
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,416
I think there´s a lot more
to it than that.

246
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,183
- What´s this?
- It´s a friend ofmine.

247
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,125
She´s a very special person.

248
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,128
She sees things.

249
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,132
She can helpyou remember things
ifyou want.

250
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,067
You know I´m not into that kind
ofstuff, sweetie.

251
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,038
Well, maybe it´s time
you reconsidered, Hatch.

252
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,699
Thankyou.

- Bye. Where areyou going?
- To hang out with Linda.

265
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,557
Where?

266
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,631
I won´t get raped or anything, okay?

267
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,927
Good-bye. Have fun.

268
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,962
She´s gonna be okay.

269

Let´s rent a movie tonight, okay?

270
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,639
- I´ll go.
- No, no. I want to.

271
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,509
No, stay. I´ll be right back.

272
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,148
Hurry.

273
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,519
I thought we were going downtown.

274
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,240
Regina.

277
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,659
Have a light?

278
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,563
Excuse me.
I called in the report.

279
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,230
Really? What´s your name?

280
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,571
- Arcadia Street. Phone number?
- 555-1 643.

281
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,083
What´s going on?

282
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,982
Look...

283
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,079
next timeyou have a gut feeling...

284
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,181
I suggestyou tryAlka-Seltzer.

285
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,726
Okay, let´s wrap this up.

286
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:14,025
Wait a minute.
You didn´t fiind the girl?

287
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,793
There is no girl out there.

288
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,426
This is all in your imagination.

289
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,165
Isn´t it, Mr. Harrison?

290
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,673
At least, I hope so.

291
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,305
What´s happening?

292
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,008
What´s going on?

293
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:37,110
Come on, honey, this is scaring
the shit out ofme.

294
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,848
I´m scared.

295
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,485
Come here, tell me.

296
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,829
I´m in it.

297
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,493
It feels like I´m doing it.

298
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,766
But like it´s not me.

299
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,308
And when I see light,
it hurts my eyes.

300
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,178
And I feel all this...

301
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,677
rage.

302
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:17,858
We had another daughter, Samantha,
killed in a hit-and-run a year ago.

303
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,132
When I was dead,
I think I saw her.

304
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,663
Maybe I reallywent someplace.

305
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,102
Because I feel like...

306
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,678
maybe she´s trying to warn me...

307
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,941
or trying to help me
save people´s lives.

308
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,252
It´s the hardest thing
to lose a child.

309
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,853
I´d like to schedule
another PET scan.

310
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,161
But...

311
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,629
could my situation be--

312
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,604
You mean, could it be
more spiritual in nature?

313
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,869
I don´t know.

314
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,813
It´s not my fiield.

315
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,855
I reallywant to go, but...

316
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,584
I don´t think it´s a good idea.

317
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,922
He´s really on edge.

318
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,121
Dying and all, you know.

319
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,962
Okay, okay, yeah.

320
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:36,062
Come pick me up in 30 minutes. Bye.

321
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,187
Kinda cute.

322
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,325
- What?
- He´s kind ofcute.

323
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,067
Yeah.

324
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:41,986
- I´ve seen you.
- No, I don´t think so.

325
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,653
Oh, yes, I have seen you.

326
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,993
It was...

327
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:52,159
like a flash forward in time.

328
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,702
You´re beautiful.

329
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,938
Perfect.

330
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,837
My name´s Vassago.

331
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,448
- That´s different.
- Different.

332
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,044
- I´m Regina.
- I know!

333
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,347
You know?

334
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,420
Yes, Regina.

335
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,628
You don´t look likeyou belong here.

336
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,658
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

337
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:31,130
- Maybeyou´re right.
- No, not maybe. I am right.

338
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,700
I´m so right...

339
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,905
that I know whereyou do belong.

340
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,413
Let me takeyou somewhere.

341
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,486
Makeyou feel--

342
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,655
Make us both feel...

343
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,888
something.

344
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,398
We´re waiting for people.

345
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,164
Why don´tyou let Regina
make her own decisions?

346
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,603
Why don´tyou piss off?

347
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,057
I´ll seeyou again.

348
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,906
What´s the deal?
You said he was cute.

349
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,209
He´s a creep.

350
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,910
God, Regina, get some sense.

351
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,918
Let´s get outta here. Let´s go.

352
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,947
No luck, huh?

353
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,389
Not always.

354
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,826
I´m Zoe.

355
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,497
You have beautiful eyes.

356
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,797
What?

357
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,906
Nothing. I wasjust...

358
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,941
imagining the two ofus together.

359
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,709
I made it myself.

360
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,951
I like this.

361
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,758
I use bones in mywork.

362
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,828
You´re an artist, too?

363
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,520
Yes, ofsorts.

364
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,894
I´m making a sculpture.

365
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,526
Would you like to see it?

366
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,743
So, where is this piece ofart?

367
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,350
At my hideaway.

368
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,887
What areyou hiding?

369
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,334
You hear me? What´s wrong, baby?
Come here.

370
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,635
Fucker!

371
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,905
You bastard!

372
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:53,061
Oh, God.
I gotta get outta here.

373
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,241
Oh, my God.

374
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,740
Where areyou going?

375
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,245
You haven´t seen my sculptureyet.

376
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,547
You see, it´s my monument to hell.

377
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,686
Shit!

378
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,491
There´s only one way out!

379
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,092
Honey, wake up.

380
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,563
Oh, my God, no!

381
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,568
Come on, wake up.
What´s wrong?

382
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:45,739
What´s wrong?

383
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,908
You sick fuck!

384
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,993
Keepyour head very still.

385
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,033
It was scary.
I couldn´t wake him up.

386
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,441
He doesn´t remember any ofit?

387
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,739
No, no.

388
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,315
It´s probably the sleeping pills.

389
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:27,118
- Can´t fiind it?
- Sorry, once more.

390
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,244
What?

391
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,938
What?

392
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,740
You were in a club last night.

393
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,236
I was not.

394
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,282
You´re lying, goddamn it!

395
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,850
Doyou have any fucking idea
what he was going to do?

396
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,016
Doyou know what
you´re playing around with?

397
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,924
Doyou know what he does
to these girls? He butchers them!

398
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,361
Slaughters them.

399
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,160
You hear me?

400
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,235
Come on. Areyou all right?

401
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,360
Youokay?

402
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,132
I´m fiine.

403
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,831
He´s crazy!

404
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:01,536
I got it.
Now, wait a minute here.

405
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:05,081
It´s not me.
He´s doing it.

406
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:09,084
Jesus Christ, am I seeing...

407
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,245
through...

408
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,844
him?

409
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,391
He was with Regina.

410
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,422
We´re connected somehow.

411
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,462
I know him. I know what he looks like.
I should call the police.

412
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,834
No, I should call the police.

413
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,534
I should call the police now
and have them lockyou in a loony bin.

414
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,076
Or maybe I should call an exorcist.

415
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,646
- I know it sounds crazy.
- It is crazy.

416
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:42,582
You need help. Rememberwhat Nyebern
said? You might have a brain tumor.

417
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,677
You know...

418
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,655
you won´t see a psychiatrist
and you scared our daughter!

419
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,418
She´s gotta know.

420
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,016
Tell me what I should do.

421
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,690
Believe me.

422
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,501
Damn it!

423
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,998
I´ll go see how Regina is.

424
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,542
I´m Vassago.

425
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,449
Vassago.

426
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:31,460
You know, I don´t know her last name.
Zoe something.

427
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,868
Okay, so no missing person report.
Thankyou. Bye.

428
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,808
I got it.
Hello?

429
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,885
Hi,Jenny, how areyou doing?

430
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,981
Listen, can you hang on?
Where areyou going?

431
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,583
- I´ll be back.
- When?

432
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,760
Soon.

433
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,996
Is this a bad time?

434
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,765
No, no. I didn´t want Hatch
to know it was you.

435
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,239
He won´t come in for more tests.

436
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,105
He´s completely paranoid.

437
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,442
Now he´s convinced he´s
psychically connected to somebody.

438
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,243
We must get him in.

439
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,319
Ifitisan organicbrainanomaly...

440
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,322
his condition coulddeteriorate
unless we dosomethingnow.

441
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,993
Dr. Nyebern, is it...

442
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,862
at all possible he really
is seeing things?

443
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:40,902
Like this is all somehow real,
what he´s been saying?

444
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,904
Is that whatyou think?

445
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,772
I don´t know.
I don´t know what to think anymore.

446
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,275
Ifitis...

447
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:52,678
psychological, then Dr. Martin
couldhelp with this.

448
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,310
Anything specifiic I could tell them
about this...

449
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,479
connection he´s imagining?

450
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,853
Here´s something.

451
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:13,628
It probably doesn´t mean anything.
Call me ifthere´s anything else.

452
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,086
Redlow...

453
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,060
it´sJonas Nyebern.

454
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,597
I know.

455
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,593
I think I may have a lead.

456
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,357
Lousy fuck!

457
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:25,828
There are no bullets in them,
butyou assume weapons are loaded.

458
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,267
We gotta have a gun in the bedroom.

459
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:32,034
- I´m putting it here.
- I don´t believe this.

460
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:36,009
We´ll hid the shotgun downstairs,
and getyou and Regina lessons.

461
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,513
I don´t believeyou bought these
without talking to me.Jesus Christ!

462
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:43,552
- I feel we need protection.
- No! I won´t have guns here!

463
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,644
No, I won´t!

464
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,710
- Mr. Harrison?
- That´s right. That´s my name.

465
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:49,410
Oh, no. Marion told meyou might come.

466
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,714
Please, come in.

467
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,906
Give meyour hand.

468
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,487
Why haveyou lostyour trust?

469
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,663
I see a child´s bicycle.

470
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:26,378
Some souls choose to live
for only a short time, Hatch.

471
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,092
Hold these.

472
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:40,952
Think oftwo questions.

473
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:44,192
Keep one toyourself,
and tell me the other one.

474
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,747
Why am I having these visions?

475
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:07,355
You´re tied to them
by a coincidence offate.

476
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,186
You crossed over.

477
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:18,227
- You brought something backwith you.
- What?

478
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,428
Something very powerful.

479
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,605
The one from yourvisions?

480
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,616
He knows you watch him.

481
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,242
He does?

482
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,623
Yeah.

483
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:48,425
Now for the second question.

484
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,567
Someone close toyou is in danger.

485
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,905
Doyou have another daughter?

486
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,065
Regina.

487
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,973
This is Regina.

488
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,472
But there is a puritywithin you.

489
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,279
And you must surrender to it.

490
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,720
Yourweakness...

491
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,424
would bring about her death.

492
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,938
What´s that supposed to mean?
Myweakness? Never!

493
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,610
Never Regina!

494
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:47,015
You tell me to surrender, and then say
my daughter might die? Bullshit!

495
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,318
There´s another energy around you.

496
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,451
That´s irresponsible bullshit!

497
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,032
He´s here.

498
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,042
No, no.Just go.

499
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,200
Larson Place.

500
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,707
Okay, fuckhead, here I come.

501
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,924
Hatch, what areyou doing?

502
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,959
Hatch, come on!

503
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:40,297
Let me in.
What areyou doing?

504
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,601
Goddamnit!

505
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,566
Skies.

506
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,808
Open the door, please.

507
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,352
Open the door! Let me in!

508
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,785
What areyou doing? Please.

509
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,422
What the hell areyou doing?

510
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:12,495
- DirectoryAssistance. Whatcity?
- In Sinclair. Skies Motel.

511
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,828
- Nolisting, sir.
- Skies. S-K-I-E-S.

512
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,339
Nolisting.

513
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,444
Pain. I can induce the visions.

514
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,815
Gotcha.

515
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,385
Motherfucker.

516
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,786
- Yes?
- Yes. I came for a reading.

517
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:13,555
- It´s late. I take appointments.
- I know. I´m very sorry.

518
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,061
Wait, I--

519
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:20,500
I´m very sorry.
I really need your advice.

520
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,206
Well, I--

521
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,242
Please.

522
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:31,643
- Well--
- Oh, please.

523
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,749
I´m sorry.
Who recommended me toyou?

524
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,762
Come now.

525
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,904
Tell me about Regina.

526
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,843
Oh. Vassago.

527
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,730
You don´t have to do this anymore.

528
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,365
You can stop.

529
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,536
I can´t.

530
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,940
91 1. What´syouremergency?

531
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:49,108
Yeah. There´s been a murder...

532
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,619
at 576 Larson Place.

533
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:56,248
I´mgoing toneedyourmobilenumber
andyourloca--

534
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,634
Wait a second.

535
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,905
" Blue Skies."

536
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,828
" Morton Redlow."

537
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,448
Hatch, what areyou doing?

538
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,426
He killed somebody again.

539
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,429
This time because ofme.

540
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,724
He sees through me.

541
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,538
Oh,Jesus!

542
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:13,214
Come in. It´s not locked.

543
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,895
Put that on the table.

544
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,655
Sorry.

545
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:28,033
You got a permit for that?

546
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,770
Yeah.

547
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,541
What can I do foryou?

548
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,739
Well, somebody phoned in
a murder report.

549
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:43,580
So I checked it out. There was evidence
offoul play, but no body.

550
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:48,019
- So, I thought ofyou.
- Maybe he took the bodies with him.

551
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,558
Another gut feeling?

552
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:58,728
Look, Detective, I know
you´ll think this is crazy...

553
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,766
but I know
who´s killing these girls.

554
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:08,070
He´s young, dark hair.
He always wears sunglasses.

555
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,270
His name is Vassago.

556
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:13,143
He´s been staying
at the Blue Skies Motel.

557
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:18,919
And, where wereyou tonight?

558
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,513
He´s been here all night
with me.

559
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:29,222
Maybeyou´re one ofthose clairvoyants
that sees crimes, bodies and stuff.

560
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,730
What do I know?

561
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,428
Just don´t leave town, okay?

562
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,970
If Rose Orwetto doesn´t turn up...

563
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,633
then I´ll have to come back
and askyou some questions.

564
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,975
I´ll let myselfout.

565
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,048
You be careful with that thing.

566
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:59,155
- How doyou know these things?
- I´ve been sucked into this evil fuck.

567
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,695
-Whyyou?
-I don´t know. I know who he wants next.

568
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,856
- Who?
- He´s coming after Regina.

569
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,025
Don´t say that! It´s not true!

570
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:09,365
- Trust me!
- Nobody´s trying to kill Regina.

571
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,031
I´m the one who´s got
to stop this guy.

572
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,303
- Don´tyou see whatyou´re doing?
- I´m trying to save our daughter.

573
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:19,244
Our daughter Samantha,
not our daughter Regina.

574
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,374
Samantha, Hatch. Remember Sam?

575
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:25,385
It´s notyour fault.

576
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,786
You didn´t kill her, okay?
Fate killed her.

577
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:31,621
The goddamn car killed her.
You didn´t.

578
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,321
- Please.
- Don´tyou get it?

579
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:39,457
You´re making this up soyou can be
the big hero and save our daughter.

580
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:40,967
Just listen!

581
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:46,198
Whetheryou believe or not,
this is what´s going to happen.

582
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,809
Tonight I´m up and on guard.

583
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,677
Regina´s safe in the day,
but by tomorrow night...

584
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,546
you and she have to go someplace,
and I can´t know where it is.

585
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,416
You´ve got to stay there
till this is over. Can you do that?

586
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,989
Is that clear?
Can you do that?

587
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,887
Yes, I can leave.

588
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,421
Because I can´t helpyou
with this anymore.

589
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,004
I loveyou.

590
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,948
- Afternoon, Hatch.
- Marion.

591
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,458
Be right back.

592
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,039
" Detective."

593
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:16,125
Themostinteresting aspectofthis case
ishis vision.

594
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,358
Closeronhis face.

595
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:23,665
Themuscles thatcause thepupils
to dilatehavebeen destroyed.

596
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:27,936
Theslightestamountoflightcan cause
extreme discomfort, ifnotpain.

597
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:31,740
-Specialcontactlenses filterlight.
- That´s you.

598
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:35,146
With these, he´sable to withstand
lowlevels oftungsten.

599
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,310
Doyouhaveanything toadd, Doctor?

600
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,851
Jeremy´s violentbehavior--

601
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,359
Nyebern.

602
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:56,067
Hispsychosishas increased.

Hehas escapedintoa delusional world--

604
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,468
Son ofa bitch!

605
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,822
Hatch, what´s wrong?

606
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,932
Jonas!

607
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,838
Nyebern!

608
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,073
- What areyou doing here?
- Who´sJeremy?

609
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:51,722
I wasjust thinking aboutyou.
Would you like some tea?

610
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,195
I´ve got to fiind him.
Who´sJeremy?

611
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:01,030
- Where did you get that tape?
- You tell me.

612
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:06,436
Tell me what´s going on.

613
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,255
Sorry.

614
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:26,286
- May I helpyou?
- Yes. I wondered ifanyone was here.

615
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,886
- Are the Harrisons in?
- No, they´re not.

616
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:34,799
Where can I fiind them?
They´re old friends ofmine.

617
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,803
I know all the Harrisons´ friends.

618
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:41,365
How privileged they must feel.
Mywife and I are...

619
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,679
having a little garden party.

620
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:49,547
And we misplaced their number.
Perhaps you couldjot it down for me.

621
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:53,143
I´ll send them an invite. I´d leave it
here, but it´s more personal...

622
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:55,746
ifthey get it at home.

623
01:19:55,857 --> 01:20:01,727
I´ll put it on the back
ofone ofour business cards...

624
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:07,462
and then yourwife
can read it toyou at home.

625
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:08,968
Yes, mywife.

626
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,972
Thankyou.

627
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,201
I´ll see myselfto the door.

628
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,416
There´s one more favor
you could do for me.

629
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:32,258
Would you have a bathroom?

630
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,796
- What areyou hiding?
- Patient information is confiidential.

631
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,491
Confiidential? This is the kid
I´ve been seeing in my head--

632
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,763
I cannot divulge information
without that patient´s consent.

633
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,304
All right,
Jeremywas one ofmy patients.

634
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,574
Thankyou.

635
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,123
Bitch!

636
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:18,162
I was very nice toyou. Whyweren´tyou
nice to me? I just wanted information.

637
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,242
Do I have to call 41 1 ?

638
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,179
Jesus!

639
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,120
I´m concerned about the protection
ofyour family.

640
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,785
Protect my family? This fuckingJeremy
is stalking my teenage daughter!

641
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,420
- Tell me who he is?
- Calm down.

642
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,918
Father?

643
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:08,922
Tell me who he is!

644
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,201
Redlow.

645
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:38,981
Jeremy is your son?

646
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:44,991
Threeyears ago...

647
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,328
he killed his mother.

648
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:53,563
And he killed his sister,
then he killed himself.

649
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,568
You brought him back.

650
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,437
Like me.

651
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,940
Even as a child,
Jeremywas psychotic.

652
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,704
But he was my son.

653
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,717
You´d have done the same.

654
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:04,099
"Wonderland."

655
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,368
" UnderThe Roller Coaster."

656
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,608
Regina, areyou packed?
Hurry up.

657
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:28,662
I don´t know why I´m bringing all this.
I´m not gonna end up wearing it.

658
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:32,358
Call-waiting sucks.
I´m not getting that.

659
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:37,067
Okay. Please have left already.

660
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:43,472
I´ll giveyou the number
as soon as I know where we´re gonna be.

661
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:49,244
But we´re not supposed
to tell anybody ´cause--

662
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:15,736
Goddamn it!

663
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,797
He´s got Regina!

664
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:25,945
You drive.

665
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,529
Where am I going?

666
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:53,198
I don´t know.
Just keep going.

667
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:55,674
I´m so sorry.

668
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,871
Lindsey, we´ll get her back.

669
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:10,222

670
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:22,034
She´s still alive.

671
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:29,675
What areyou doing?

672
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:34,181
They´re on the highway, going east.

673
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:03,101
- Wonderland.

674
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,139
He´s taking her
to that old amusement park.

675
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,335
Jeremy.

676
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,340
Oh, you.

677
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:36,603
What is this?

678
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:50,257
You killedJeremy.

682
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,534
- I want to helpyou.
- "I want to helpyou."

683
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,259
Here, here.

684
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:38,906
Don´tyou get it? Huh?

685
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,966
I don´t wanna be saved!

686
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,412
I want to be damned.

687
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:00,556
Through this maintenance door.

688
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:15,572
I asked you here
to showyou mywork.

689
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:22,512
I changed my mind.

690
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:29,081
Oh,Jesus.

691
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,522
This way.

692
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,639
What?

693
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:55,507
He knows we´re here.

694
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:11,430
Regina!

695
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,169
What?

696
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:24,676
Through here.

697
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,654
Lindsey?

698
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:56,768
Daddy!

699
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,459
I´m here!

700
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,205
Forgive me.

701
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,275
Did you come to watch?
Good!

702
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,942
My fatherwasn´t able to watch his wife
and daughter die, butyou will be.

703
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:21,852
Regina´s the virgin crown
to my art.

704
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:25,119
I knew it when I saw her
through your eyes.

705
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:29,128
I´m not afraid ofyou.
I´m the one with the power.

706
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,788
You´re nothing!

707
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:34,664
You´re a link between
me and Regina, that´s all.

708
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,834
Come on up.
I´ll wait.

709
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:43,708
Shut up!

710
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:54,619
You skinny little fuck!

711
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,665
Here I come.

712
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,878
Daddy, what´s happening?

713
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:27,178
- I´m coming.

714
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,549
Fucker!

715
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:19,198
You´re invisible.

716
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:20,933
And I´m invincible.

717
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:35,044
On your knees!

718
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,489
We are Vassago.

719
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:39,044
Darkness has no power in the light.

720
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:24,681
Baby.

721
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:34,993
Samantha.

722
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:48,114
Regina, he´s dead.

723
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,614
It´s over.

724
01:43:56,597 --> 01:43:57,825
We can save him.

725
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:02,696
Watch the doors.
Get the crash cart ready.

726
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:07,706
Okay, on three.
One, two, three. Lift.

727
01:44:07,808 --> 01:44:09,173
Lose the gurney.

728
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:19,176
Pads.

729
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:21,584
- 83.7.
- Watch it.

730
01:44:26,059 --> 01:44:27,458
Stand by.

731
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:29,461
- Charge 200.
- Pads are on.

732
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:34,694
- Charged.
- Clear.

733
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:38,631
No pulse.

734
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:40,900
- Charge to 360.
- Clear.

735
01:44:44,978 --> 01:44:48,038
We´ve got a breath!

736
01:44:48,882 --> 01:44:51,783
Pulse is erratic.

737
01:44:58,425 --> 01:44:59,824
We´ve got him!

738
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:01,325
What?

739
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:06,822
- It wasjust a dream.
- Ah,Jesus.

740
01:45:06,933 --> 01:45:09,094
You scared me.

741
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,507
This isjust like that movie Carrie.

742
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:22,013
Sissy Spacek.

743
01:45:24,551 --> 01:45:28,453
- Oh, Badlands.
- Martin Sheen.

744
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:32,047
- TheSubject Was Roses.
- Patricia Neal.

745
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,559
- Hud.
- Paul Newman.

746
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:37,653
They say he dunks his head
in ice water every morning.

747
01:45:37,764 --> 01:45:40,528
Shut up and kiss me.
