1
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,121


2
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,340
Can we do a sound test?

3
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,220
A few words...

4
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,580
Yes... 1... 2... 3...

5
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,140
My name is Emmerich...

6
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,520
Jean-Baptiste...

7
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,300
Emmerich. With an "h".

8
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I was born...

9
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,220
April 2, 1926 in Limoges.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,100
Father: factory-owner.
Mother: factory-owner's wife.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,240
A small factory, a family business.

12
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,580
Not porcelain. Shoes.

13
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,880
In Limoges,
you're in teacups or footwear.

14
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,180
Is that OK?

15
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,380
Just checking for distortion.
It's fine.

16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,540
But that was rather...

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,940
bureaucratic, right?

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
Really?

19
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,760
We can give it a social slant,

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,380
sociological...

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,420
Emmerich, Jean-Baptiste,

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,760
born 04/02/26 in Limoges,

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,890
in the Haut et Vienne district.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,900
Haut et Vienne, yet!

25
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,720
Well-to-do family.

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,540
What else?

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,640
Excuse me.

28
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,900
I'm looking for the 7:55
to Limoges.

29
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,960
-You're catching it?
-Yes, I am.

30
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,740
Go to the intercity line.

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,240
Here it's local.

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,300
Sorry.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,020
That's all?

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,180
Well-to-do family.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,940
Not so well-to-do.

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,740
So-so Catholics, so-so war record.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,340
Medium-sized family business.

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,340
Family fell on moderately
hard times,

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,460
as factory only sold
moderately well.

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,820
We don't have much time!
Where are they all?

41
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,810
The only plus of a life
in the shoe biz,

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,450
of two generations in it,

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,650
a cute nickname:
the Centipedes.

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,960
The Centipedes!

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,730
-You serious?
-Sure!

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,580
That's the Emmerichs:

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,260
The Centipede family.

48
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,020
In Limoges, I'm Centipede, jr.

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,460
Is that what you want?

50
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,700
Just what do you want?

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,600
What does he want?

52
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,450
I don't know,

53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,280
to talk about painting!

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,300
I'd planned questions.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,718
We can talk about work, too!

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,530
No trouble at all.

57
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,090
I'll answer my own questions!

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,320
Here we go!

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,180
Emmerich, Jean-Baptiste!

60
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,260
...1926, in Limoges.

61
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,820
Eldest of the Centipede twin sons...

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,080
Painter.

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,620
An artist!

64
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,100
I'm a teacher, writing a novel.
It's done.

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,540
Or we could say...

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,260
a minor mid-20th century master,

67
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,688
the Centipedes' 101rst leg.

68
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,140
A dried fruit,
but a fruitful artist.

69
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,100
Stick to French, please!

70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,209
Not so famous that my name's

71
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,220
always spelled correctly,

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,960
but respected enough

73
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,900
never to be called Johnny...

74
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,732
by my friends.

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,519
I also teach.

76
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,810
Not very well,

77
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,240
if you look
at my students' results.

78
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,340
Father died at 69.

79
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,940
In horrible pain,

80
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,690
every nerve in his body
shot with pain!

81
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,017
Cancer! Never touched cigarettes
or drink, or my mother.

82
00:04:57,107 --> 00:05:00,930
Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train

83
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,100
Where's Francois?

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,020
-I'll go look for him.
-Hurry, we're late!

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,940
Mother died of a brain clot.

86
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,700
She was 69, too.

87
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,500
I was 69 last year.
What am I waiting for?

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,560
It's no good, Jean-Baptiste!

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,180
-One can't talk to him.
-What can I say?

90
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm 70 y ears old,
and I'm tired!

91
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,940
I'm closing up shop...

92
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,500
following my natural course...

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,020
My life is of no interest...

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,280
Claire!

95
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,300
My life is devoid of interest...

96
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,680
We're on platform 19.

97
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,680
I have to buy something!

98
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,640
We can talk about art,
or painting,

99
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,660
but that's a drag, too...

100
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,860
Isn't it?

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,500
Let's just talk about clothes...

102
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,780
Or...

103
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,820
shove a grenade up our ass
and wait for it to expl...

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,400
We said we'd go together!

105
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,620
I missed your message!

106
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,220
Are you sure I left one?

107
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,740
-Didn't you?
-Yes.

108
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,745
You see?

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,980
I dreamed of Frederic last night.

110
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,280
Isn't he dead?

111
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,600
No, he's not.

112
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,560
I was expecting him.
Where is he?

113
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,300
-You knew where to reach him?
-I always did.

114
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,080
Claire's missing, too!

115
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:28,175
I saw her!
I gave her her ticket!

116
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,100
I don't believe this!
Shit!

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
Didn't you come together?

118
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,960
You two got problems?

119
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,880
Want me not to come?

120
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,320
It's a tough day for you.
Just wanted to help.

121
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,180
I'm down.
If you're up, that'll be a help.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
How are you?

123
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,240
Is he your fiancé?

124
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Yes, he's my fiancé.
That's it...

125
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,500
Get in!

126
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,460
Hurry!

127
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,740
What about Frederic?

128
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,580
You told them we're in two cars?
I did my best!

129
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,340
I brought some cookies!

130
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,240
They're in my bag!

131
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,900
Here they are.

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,340
Elodie, I'm not scolding you.

133
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,600
Where did you get those cookies?

134
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,600
Who gave them to you?

135
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,360
Did you steal them?

136
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,780
Did you?

137
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,700
Claire's changed!
Like she's off it.

138
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,140
You think so?

139
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,320
Maybe.

140
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,250
Maybe?

141
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,600
Let's sit here.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,020
Is this smoking?

143
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,220
I looked all over for you!

144
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,020
Where are the others?

145
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
I got you the sports paper.

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,740
I'll move.

147
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,980
No, stay.

148
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,860
You said you'd help!

149
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,600
Still read it?

150
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,400
I can't get out of our lease.

151
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,180
We both signed it.
You must write, too.

152
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,760
You're a drag!
The 3 months' notice can't start!

153
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,940
OK.

154
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,100
You cut your hair.

155
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,930
-How are you?
-Don't!

156
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,925
Sorry!

157
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,240
Some people shake hands, or kiss.

158
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,700
Even years later.

159
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,380
Excuse me.

160
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,900
You never mentioned the letter.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,840
I left messages all over.
You're unreachable!

162
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,400
I can't ask how you are?

163
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,640
I'm fine.

164
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,240
I'll be better
when you write that letter!

165
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,620
Hi, darling.

166
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,540
Excuse me.

167
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,940
It was a fine death.

168
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,100
So unexpected, you know.

169
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,500
Don't cry, Lucie!

170
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,620
Maybe Claire knew things?

171
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,360
Where's François?

172
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,620
Seen him?

173
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,240
Over there.

174
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,920
She doesn't even say hi!

175
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,300
You're fine!

176
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,500
Why did she say you knew things?

177
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,740
Beats me.

178
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,880
Don't fall for that troublemaker!

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,905
There!

180
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
See? He reframed them all.

181
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,780
He cut them out of magazines,

182
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,420
Must we do that now?

183
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,180
Is it that urgent?

184
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,940
He'd have said, "No portraits.

185
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,300
Not my puss in your magazine!

186
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,220
Look, this one's really like him.

187
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,540
It's a drag.

188
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,620
What should we do?

189
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,340
Play scrabble?

190
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,700
Or chat?

191
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,340
That's what fags do:
chat, tell all...

192
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,420
Fags and women.

193
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,420
Montherlant said it!

194
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,820
I'm off to the bar.

195
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,060
To join the others.

196
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,540
My fiancé! Did you hear him?

197
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,180
Seems you're my fiancé.

198
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,760
Not the right word.

199
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,140
Then what is?

200
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,060
I don't know.

201
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,140
I wouldn't use that word.

202
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,640
How would you describe
our bonds?

203
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,200
Why'd you ask?

204
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,920
You said you wouldn't use
that word.

205
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,980
Need any help?

206
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,140
I'm an insomniac, I'm the only one

207
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,980
he could call
at any hour of the night.

208
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,280
The other day,
he phoned at midnight,

209
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,340
to make me listen to a concerto.

210
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,800
Bach, I think.

211
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,580
He'd bought the record that day.

212
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,180
-Where's my bag?
-Here.

213
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
What day was that?

214
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,800
He still called you?

215
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,140
I'm dripping! Revolting!

216
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,060
We talked,

217
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,780
we listened to music.

218
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,140
Or were silent: not to wake

219
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,020
the boy in the next room.

220
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,860
You hadn't heard?

221
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,140
I never saw him.

222
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,140
Wait...

223
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,740
You knew who the last boy was?

224
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,380
I wasn't trying to pick you up.

225
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,820
I'm as good at it as anyone,

226
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,300
but I wouldn't stare at someone...

227
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,380
so crudely.

228
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,600
You use a paper
with a hole in it?

229
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,900
That's called ogling.

230
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,140
We've met before.

231
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,480
I don't believe that.

232
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,100
-Where?
-Here.

233
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,620
I mean, at Austerlitz station.

234
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,980
About 3 years ago.

235
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,700
Almost to the day.

236
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,500
I shouldn't tell you this story,
it's crazy.

237
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,020
Lots of things scare me,

238
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,940
but not crazy stories.

239
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,840
We saw each other,

240
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,220
at least I saw you,
at the station 3 years ago.

241
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,245
-I couldn't believe it this morning.
-So what?

242
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,000
I saw you, that's all.

243
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,520
Maybe it wasn't me.

244
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
I'm never in that station.

245
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,760
3 years later I go back:
you're in the same spot.

246
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,780
As if time hadn't gone by.

247
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,380
-See what I mean?
-Sure.

248
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,260
It's possible.

249
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,340
My folks live in Orleans.

250
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,885
I don't know...
We've never met.

251
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,260
I know.

252
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,540
But I recognized you.

253
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,460
Though we've never met.

254
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,485
-What's your name?
-Louis.

255
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm Bruno.

256
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,420
You didn't ask, so I'll tell you.

257
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,340
Shall we go for coffee?

258
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,420
Or go suck each other in the john?
Just kidding.

259
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,805
-I'm with someone. And you?
-Me, too.

260
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,460
Let's all sit over there.

261
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,940
Get those people to move.
Ask them!

262
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,220
Go on.

263
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,340
I need to sit.

264
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,940
You look great.
Things must be better.

265
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,160
So marriage
isn't always destructive!

266
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,020
We all pick a family.

267
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,780
The family
Jean-Baptiste picked is us!

268
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,940
Shut up!

269
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,940
She's sad. It's her right.

270
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,060
Cause she raped him once
in Madrid, ages ago? She's a bitch!

271
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,140
It's odd!

272
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,810
Going back to Limoges
isn't a big deal.

273
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,140
Isn't that weird?

274
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,000
Sorry I only see you this way...

275
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,420
Yes, indeed.

276
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,180
But we don't overwork
our answering machines!

277
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,000
You saw him a lot?

278
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,080
Who? Jean-Baptiste?

279
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,300
I don't know what to tell you.

280
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,220
Two coffees.

281
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,480
You seem in great shape.

282
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,880
How's Lorette?

283
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,880
-Isn't Thierry here?
-No.

284
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,565
He is coming?

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
He's driving.

286
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,620
With Jean-Baptiste.

287
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,140
Driving with Jean-Baptiste?

288
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,110
We have a big station wagon.

289
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,760
-Jean-Baptiste gave it to Thierry.
-Nice...

290
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,140
Anyway...

291
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,140
Want to go for a smoke?

292
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,340
No, you go.

293
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,540
I didn't draw the sparks well

294
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,380
because sparks are light blue

295
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
and I don't have the right pen.

296
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,980
Know why there are sparks?

297
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,060
It goes into the city

298
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,660
and lights up the homes.

299
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,940
Magnet Man took the two wires...

300
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,020
You're not listening!

301
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,700
Of course I am.

302
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:57,928
Over there...

303
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,260
Who's that girl?

304
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,720
It's a boy!

305
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,300
Can't you tell?

306
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
Who's the fat guy?

307
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,110
A nobody.

308
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,340
No, an old pal who hates me.

309
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,960
He knew Jean-Baptiste?

310
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,580
He made a play for him.

311
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:15,540
-You said he was married.
-Not that kind of a play.

312
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,940
But who knows?

313
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,720
360 francs. I got a group rate.

314
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,160
I'll pay by check.

315
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,540
No checks!

316
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,020
None of that!

317
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,765
Look.

318
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,940
1967.

319
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,065
I'll be damned!

320
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,800
It's my father!

321
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,700
No, it's Jean-Baptiste.

322
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,500
They're so alike.
It was in Alexandria.

323
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,980
Lovely trip.

324
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,140
Then India, Cambodia.
Lovely trip.

325
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,740
Your mother, me,

326
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,320
Jean-Baptiste.

327
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,320
Beautiful, isn't she?

328
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,900
Some hairdo!

329
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,420
That was the style!

330
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,320
Can I have one too?

331
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,160
Aren't you Thierry's daughter?

332
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,140
Don't give your candy.

333
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,840
Just kidding.

334
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,700
So you knew my mother?

335
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,520
That's where we met:

336
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,580
in a big café, in Alexandria.

337
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,200
Your mother was...

338
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,580
I remember her as someone...

339
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,080
with a special laugh...

340
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,080
Mostly, she was very sad.

341
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,980
Keep it.

342
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,260
I have my own memories of her.

343
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,980
I brought it for you.

344
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,420
For your novel.

345
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
It's too late for that.

346
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,565
Give me that!

347
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,220
Don't be a pain!

348
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,600
Look, it's my dad!

349
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,300
No, there! Look!
It's dad!

350
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,460
"It's a pity?"
What does that mean?

351
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,440
Two figures on a bed...

352
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,500
I wanted them to be screwing!
So I smashed

353
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
the painting! That's a pity?

354
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,465
-It was destructive!
-Should we keep shit?

355
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,060
-What is shit?
-You think you're getting somewhere,

356
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,680
that you're painting
something good,

357
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,540
then realize you're nowhere...

358
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,160
Is it legal?
A coffin in a private car?

359
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,625
As you can see.

360
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,380
Or you need someone to talk to...

361
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,460
Someone with an eye...

362
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,880
Who can say: "Yes, that's good..."

363
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,060
But I've got nobody.

364
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,600
-And your students?
-They're boring, no initiative...

365
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,100
They just mimic.

366
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,100
They don't practice.

367
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,020
Nobody does now, they cheat!

368
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,620
-Even Frederic?
-No, he's very gifted.

369
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,060
But he quit.

370
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,885
Disappeared:

371
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,690
What can one teach them?

372
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,960
The moves, they can learn that...

373
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,440
But practicing...

374
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,420
Conjuring up images:

375
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,820
They're afraid of pain. So
they get nowhere, not in painting:

376
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,460
Sure, it's not enough.

377
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,380
You think of a body, a belly,

378
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,080
a shoulder...
A belly's beautiful...

379
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,660
It's silly but...

380
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,620
I keep thinking we could...

381
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,620
...start all over...

382
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,180
make a fresh start...
do it right...

383
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,540
I never knew why we lost contact...

384
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,900
No, I meant with Lorette.

385
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,400
Did you stop your tape recorder?

386
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,090
Is it off?

387
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,060
It's off, Jean-Baptiste!

388
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,080
Tea or coffee?

389
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,740
-Francois! Answer me!
-I don't care.

390
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,260
Move things,
so I can put down the tea-tray.

391
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
No news from Thierry.

392
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,300
Not a phone call!

393
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,200
It's been 5 or 6 days.

394
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,980
Aren't you getting used to it?

395
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,480
Now he's got a kid.

396
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,220
He's become a family man.

397
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,230
You have to be, with a kid.

398
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,640
Is he in trouble?

399
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,220
-He owes money.
-You give him money.

400
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,540
And more!
He swipes everything!

401
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,420
That's how it is.

402
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,460
Loving people means
putting up with their shit.

403
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,500
A guy alone with a coffin is weird.

404
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,380
It's disgusting!

405
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,580
When there's trouble,
you know if it's real.

406
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,660
That's friendship, love!

407
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,940
Being ripped apart.

408
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,240
Anything goes, even violence.

409
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,300
With limits!

410
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
To what? To love? To trouble?

411
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,080
There are no limits.

412
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,770
-With you there were none.
-With me?

413
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,660
You were a total pain!

414
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,540
You getting in?

415
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,760
Anyone in there?

416
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,880
Only carpenters move empties!

417
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,380
He had heart trouble.

418
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
I worked in a hospital then...

419
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,405
As a nurse.

420
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,540
That was 1.5 years ago.

421
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,720
I was his night-nurse.

422
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,380
I carried him home in my arms,

423
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,300
like a bride.

424
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,312
I got a place beside this.

425
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,790
After the operation

426
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,300
he needed peace.

427
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,900
He was alone, always working.

428
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,725
He was a painter.

429
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,990
Yeah?
What did he paint?

430
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
He was no Picasso,

431
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,540
but a painting of his'll trade
for a TV.

432
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,200
A really good TV.

433
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,000
People came around,

434
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,320
it tired him.

435
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,240
Then he wasn't alone!

436
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,960
I threw them all out!

437
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,860
The old lady, the nephew,
the fatbroad!

438
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,485
It's Thiery:

439
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,900
I'm on the road.

440
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,040
I don't know where...
Chateauroux... Vierzon... Poitiers.

441
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,560
Does Chateauroux exist?

442
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,420
Can I score there?

443
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,780
I'm hurting!

444
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,845
What?

445
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,260
Who? Didier?

446
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,460
I don't care if it's a detour!

447
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,020
I gotta be there by 3PM, it's OK.

448
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,445
What?

449
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,245
Shit!

450
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
Change of route!

451
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,005
Beat it!

452
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,520
Close the door!

453
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,380
I'm in no mood for that.

454
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,270
Neither am I.

455
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,000
I want to cry, too.

456
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,370
Go on.

457
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,220
Touch my ass.

458
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,940
Your friend
wants to fuck it all up...

459
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,370
So do I...

460
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,350
Some days are like that...
Some days...

461
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,920
Stop it!

462
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,059
I said stop!

463
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,560
Stop it!

464
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,890
What are the dumbest things
you did?

465
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,280
Dumb things!

466
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,908
That you do when you're
into that crap! When your're...

467
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,870
into dope.

468
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,640
You see?

469
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,170
I swiped checks.

470
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,560
I pulled some real dumb stunts.

471
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:44,860
Not just with money.

472
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,189
I know I goofed.
I goofed...

473
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,490
So what?

474
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,150
I mean, what now?

475
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,397
He wants to talk!

476
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:57,460
Really talk.
All the way.

477
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,400
But it's so low of him to act
like we're strangers.

478
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,160
Can I show you something?

479
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,120
I want to show you this.

480
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,560
Promise you won't tell.

481
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:14,689
You know,
we really had something going.

482
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,440
Even now, we still do.

483
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,630
Where is it?

484
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,810
Shit!

485
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,960
Want some pens?

486
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,600
There's markers, too.

487
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,450
Incredible colors. Fuchsia...

488
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,510
They're not worth much.

489
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,320
There.

490
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,100
It proves I'm well!

491
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,940
It's fabulous!
What does Jean-Marie say?

492
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,560
You said
you'd tell nobody!

493
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,900
Nobody.

494
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,140
You didn't tell him?

495
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,680
You must!

496
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,649
I know, guys have no guts...

497
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,229
But it's crazy
not to tell them.

498
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,509
Sure... So he can say:

499
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,710
"How do I know it's mine? "

500
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm not crying...

501
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,100
But it's really tough...

502
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:33,850
Last time we spoke,
my dad asked me...

503
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,680
to put pictures of the house...

504
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,160
on the teachers' bulletin board

505
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,600
at my school. Think of it!

506
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,329
Dad calls me
and wants a notice with the photos:

507
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,530
"For sale, fine house...

508
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,560
I forget the exact words...

509
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,320
just outside Limoges...

510
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,360
or in the countryside...

511
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,520
He said:
"It might interest someone... "

512
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,980
A huge, expensive house!

513
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,180
I'm sleeping.

514
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,920
He has real money anxieties,

515
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,530
worries about local taxes...

516
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,540
You get the picture.

517
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,620
Yes, I do.

518
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,200
The fact is, he killed her.

519
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,520
I think so. I'm sure of it.

520
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,460
Who?

521
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,680
My mother.

522
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,560
But who killed her?

523
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,560
My father! Not Jean-Baptiste!

524
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,200
He wouldn't have.

525
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,230
Anyway...

526
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,830
Mom married the wrong twin!

527
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,700
That's good.

528
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,210
Where are we?

529
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,600
Wait...

530
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,780
Going for a drink?

531
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,420
Claire told you
what they discussed Saturday?

532
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,640
What? Who?

533
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,210
Claire saw Jean-Baptiste
Saturday.

534
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,610
I thought you knew.

535
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,420
Tickets, please.

536
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,120
The interview's great.

537
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,260
Louis did it.
He could've dug deeper.

538
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,800
Am I intruding?

539
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,410
Handsome, eh?

540
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,200
Dominique likes your interview.

541
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,440
I'll be back.

542
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,930
Still agree
we should have no secrets?

543
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,000
What's on your mind?

544
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,550
I love you.

545
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,140
Ouch!

546
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,520
We've been together too long

547
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,010
for such declarations.

548
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,010
Here.

549
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,780
My mother gives them to me.

550
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,970
Every year, for Christmas.

551
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,560
By the dozen.

552
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,720
I told her
I don't cry that much...

553
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,830
Are we arriving somewhere?

554
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,840
She's completely wrong about me.

555
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,240
She thinks I'm ultra-sensitive.

556
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,480
Everyone knows I'm not.

557
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,000
So...

558
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,190
Don't use kid gloves.

559
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,050
I'm listening.

560
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,370
I love him.

561
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,120
-You can be so complex...
-We don't have to...

562
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,680
No, let's talk about it.

563
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,920
By all means.

564
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,160
Has it been going on long?

565
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,640
No, just since the station.

566
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,560
You kidding me?

567
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,600
At the station, just now.

568
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,280
In fact,

569
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,800
I've known him for ages.

570
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,640
But we never met or spoke.

571
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,530
I mean...

572
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,530
You needn't believe me.

573
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,910
It was sudden. I'm crushed.

574
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,560
Did he tell you he's HIV positive?

575
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,410
What are you saying?

576
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,160
The cute guy with long hair,
and the blue gizmo?

577
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,400
Bruno?

578
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,500
I'm asking you
if he told you he's HIV positive?

579
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,090
Because he didn't tell me.

580
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,200
He told me long after.

581
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,380
How did you find out?

582
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,970
He didn't tell me right off.

583
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,040
He thought it could wait until...

584
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,330
6 months later.

585
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,680
Then it wasn't a fling,
it was a real affair?

586
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,720
Since about a year.

587
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,200
Or a bit longer.

588
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,920
You're saying you just found out,
is that it?

589
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,000
You and he never talked
about me or Jean-Baptiste?

590
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,040
You're nuts!

591
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,140
We didn't talk about you!

592
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,950
Of course, why not?

593
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,460
You're a scumbag!

594
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,350
That's a strong word.

595
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,140
You've fallen hard.

596
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,760
Shit.

597
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,410
And stop bleeding!

598
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,810
There's my card. Gin!

599
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,730
We seem to be stuck here!

600
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,600
Why Limoges?

601
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,720
Family vault's there.
It's practical.

602
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,320
Not for those who love you.

603
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,620
-Nice interview!
-Limoges is far.

604
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,680
They can take the train.

605
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,840
I loved the bit on autopsies,
on butchers... You read it?

606
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,980
Jean-Baptiste's interview?

607
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,910
You're a pal of Louis?

608
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,190
No.

609
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,960
-I haven't read it.
-The bit on butchers.

610
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,160
How we're all so much meat.

611
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,520
At the butcher's he wonders

612
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,760
why he isn't hanging there,
instead of the animal.

613
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,760
-You don't agree.
-It's not his best thinking.

614
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,500
But I haven't read it.

615
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,600
-A bit lightweight?
-I don't get you.

616
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,880
Not to worry.

617
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,920
Not a very hip answer.

618
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,600
If he'd said:
"Why wasn't I the butcher? "

619
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,800
-That's a thought.
-Heavy!

620
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,900
You saw Jean-Baptiste Saturday?

621
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,530
-We're speaking again?
-What is this?

622
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,000
-You told him about us?
-So what?

623
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,090
-It was up to me!
-Because he liked you?

624
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,600
I did right.

625
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,960
So he'd know
why you dropped him.

626
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,000
That's my business.

627
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,680
I didn't drop him!

628
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,240
-It was for me to tell him.
-Why didn't you?

629
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,630
I'll tell you why!

630
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,240
It was admitting
he was right all along!

631
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,980
"Beware of that girI.
She's dangerous. "

632
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,950
"She's a killer, she'll ruin you! "

633
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,070
Idiot!

634
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,200
-You're a wimp!
-Stop it!

635
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,190
A wimp!

636
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,270
Stop it!

637
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,710
You're nuts!

638
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,610
Stop it!

639
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,650
Claire's pregnant!

640
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm stealing more than money:
your child!

641
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,300
Behind your back!
How about that?

642
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,210
Behind your back!

643
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,700
Dumb cunt!

644
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,500
Jean-Baptiste wasn't a talker,
he was a painter!

645
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,760
-He painted violence.
-Not true!

646
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:20,800
He couldn't: that's why
he was obsessed with Bacon.

647
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,520
On odd days, he loved him.
On even, he was a fraud.

648
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,880
Is that so bad?

649
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,680
Everyone cheats!

650
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,900
How about you?

651
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,840
People cheat all the time!

652
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,200
Everyone does!

653
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,290
Let's go.

654
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,630
She said it: behind my back!

655
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,080
A kid now!

656
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,320
She won't get at me like that!

657
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,170
"You use dope again,
I'll leave you! "

658
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,720
She thinks it was easy for me?
It was hard!

659
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,120
Stop it!

660
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,560
I came to bury Jean-Baptiste,
back to a place I hate!

661
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,240
No one mentioned that
on this trip!

662
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,480
Not a word!

663
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,870
They don't care!

664
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,560
This is where we meet them?

665
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,840
Wasn't stated.

666
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,080
There must be a waiting room.

667
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,560
I hope they have enough cars!

668
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,840
-I'm starving!
-What time is it?

669
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,720
I've seen no one.

670
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,360
-They should be here...
-Jean-Marie!

671
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,760
Marie-Rose.

672
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,150
Your dad isn't here?

673
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,880
You've seen no one?

674
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,060
Even Cedric?

675
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,950
Claire. Hello, Madame.

676
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,480
That's Marie-Rose. His sister.
A painter too,

677
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:18,670
poor fool.

678
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,420
Aunt May, Aunt Nisou.

679
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,800
Remember Gitou?

680
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,490
She's an orthopedist.

681
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,320
Sad to meet again like this!

682
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,960
I've never met her!

683
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,200
-Now what?
-I don't like being used.

684
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,800
Life's hard enough.

685
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,290
And Jean-Baptiste?

686
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,120
He's dead!

687
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,616
You're all here! That's enough!

688
00:46:57,706 --> 00:46:58,760
Count me out!

689
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,360
We're all in this together.

690
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,640
Like it or not!

691
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,180
Or whether we like it or not!

692
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,440
Come on, hurry!

693
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,480
"Hurry!"

694
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,260
See how you talk?

695
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,240
You forgot me months ago!

696
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,880
What is this?

697
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,770
It moved, see?

698
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,470
It always moves
at this time of year.

699
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,120
It's roots growing, springtime,
the rain...

700
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,250
I think it moved...

701
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,920
Won't you say hello?

702
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,210
Sure. That's easy.

703
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,570
Hi, dad.

704
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,700
How's teaching?

705
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,510
How's the miserable
teaching profession?

706
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,450
You look well.

707
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,380
Remember the trip to Egypt?

708
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,750
Your grand tour?

709
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,880
I thought of it
because of Jean-Baptiste.

710
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,690
That trip was his idea.

711
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,010
A very good idea. Your mother...

712
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,520
She loved it.

713
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,290
They visited things.
Temples, museums, and so on.

714
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,340
She was happy.

715
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,040
I think.

716
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,480
You weren't?

717
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,740
I don't like traveling.

718
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,600
Other places are like here.

719
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,890
Even far away places.

720
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,150
But worse.

721
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,350
You can't find stamps,

722
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,060
or medications you need...

723
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,120
You pretend to like
revolting food...

724
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,810
That wasn't really the problem.

725
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:09,850
No.

726
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,280
No, that wasn't...

727
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,280
really the problem.

728
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,620
It was that I was an idiot.

729
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,240
A common kind of idiotic husband.

730
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,170
But for her to be buried apart,

731
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,620
with her own family, that was...

732
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,430
that was her way
of undoing our marriage.

733
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,550
Alive, she stayed for you.

734
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,430
I presume.

735
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,590
That's how I see it.

736
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,880
I don't care what people think.

737
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,640
What could they think?

738
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,530
Mom was a manic-depressive.
Everyone knew.

739
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,324
Then one day she had enough.
That's depression...

740
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,295
I know.

741
00:51:58,385 --> 00:52:00,070
You give up on life.

742
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,680
Were you with him at the end?

743
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,920
No. I wasn't.

744
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:10,920
That's too bad.

745
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,660
You were there so often.

746
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,520
Did he leave a letter, a note?

747
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,110
No, why?

748
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,350
He wasn't a suicide!

749
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,770
When you don't know,
you imagine things.

750
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,474
-Where's Jean-Marie?
-I don't know.

751
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,160
It's Dad!

752
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,010
-Where were you?
-I knew you'd wait!

753
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,883
I couldn't.

754
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,120
My legs were putty.

755
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,440
That'll be 680 francs.

756
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,880
You idiot!

757
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,510
Engine trouble!

758
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,720
-Got 700 francs?
-No!

759
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,860
Some people haven't paid yet!

760
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,120
Holy cow!

761
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,660
Well, all isn't lost.

762
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,080
I'm Claire. Jean-Marie's wife.

763
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,720
It's been ten years.
About time.

764
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,550
Did you score?

765
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,220
I'm all out... Don't be a pain.

766
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,390
Cut it out.

767
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,720
OK, come on.

768
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,010
I'd like to say...
I haven't prepared anything.

769
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,028
Sami showed me his speech
on the train

770
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,092
and it didn't strike me like this...

771
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,356
I mean, in a way,

772
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,156
it didn't seem sad,

773
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,756
and told of someone
leaving on a journey...

774
01:00:58,025 --> 01:01:01,116
In fact it's very sad,
because in fact...

775
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,180
what happened is...

776
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,930
he gave up...
He got fed up...

777
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,170
He got fed up with painting,

778
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,610
with everything, with us too.

779
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,448
We were into dumb family gossip.
That bugged him!

780
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,330
It wasn't his fault,

781
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,058
it was ours!

782
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,750
He didn't want to be a father.

783
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,940
I wonder if anyone
wants to be a father.

784
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,426
He didn't want kids,

785
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,386
he didn't want any heirs.

786
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,200
He hated families!

787
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,926
He knew they stink of death
and dirty tricks!

788
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,314
And always have!

789
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:53,720
He came back here
to settle old scores.

790
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,826
To close the circle.

791
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,138
So it would be over.

792
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,913
He didn't want it to go on.
He wanted to be the last.

793
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:05,650
And now it's over.

794
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:13,738
I won't betray him! I'm the last
Emmerich. There will be no more!

795
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:21,782
Nature is efficient.
It kills things that are half-dead!

796
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,290
Now what happens?

797
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,314
What happens?

798
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,120
They've organized a snack.

799
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,040
We're not going, right?

800
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,954
I think I'll go jerk off.

801
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,858
Get in the red car.

802
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,602
Claire, come with us!

803
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:31,714
Claire!

804
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,026
I'll take you.

805
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:03,798
It's the biggest cemetery in Europe.

806
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,202
185,000 dead!

807
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:10,598
-What's the population of Limoges?
-A bit less. 140,000.

808
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,002
You that stuck on him?

809
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,946
Bye.

810
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,450
Have a good trip back.

811
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:10,900
I should visit the family.
Will you be OK?

812
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,342
Can I abandon you?

813
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,826
I'll have a cup of tea.

814
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,850
Don't worry about me.

815
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,978
-You're a jerk!
-You coming too?

816
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,960
I thought it might perk us up!

817
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:11,920
It's nothing, just a snack...

818
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,370
At least Mr. Emmerich
had fine weather.

819
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:18,642
Sit where you want.

820
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,040
Death is nothing. It's the pain.

821
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,554
The pain...

822
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,880
Madrid, 1952.
Feels like yesterday.

823
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,560
Know what I meant to him?

824
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:09,760
I was his impossible dream.

825
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,434
I was woman.

826
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:14,506
I was...

827
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,802
woman...

828
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:23,470
-The impossible woman.
-Don't you mean the opposite?

829
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:28,680
-Wasn't he the impossible man?
-What's the difference?

830
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,430
It was impossible, that's all!
You wouldn't understand!

831
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,938
No, I can't...

832
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,994
The Parisians...

833
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,660
They'll be leaving...

834
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,460
One day he was drunk.

835
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:05,940
He said:
'You must take it up the ass!

836
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:08,900
"As a duty to your partner!
But it hurts! "

837
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,500
I often wondered:

838
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:13,220
was Jean-Baptiste
the man or the woman?

839
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,620
Jean-Baptiste liked to seduce,
to watch.

840
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,820
Anyway, sex at his age...

841
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:21,550
-To you, age matters?
-Yes, it does!

842
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,980
You can't make love
if you're ashamed of your body.

843
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,380
Loving someone,
means doing everything...

844
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,260
Everything he wants.

845
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,220
Depends.

846
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,374
Eating out ass!
He loved that!

847
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,440
But I never wanted to.

848
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,460
He called it "rose petals"...

849
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,094
Who invited her? Who is she?

850
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,342
It's crushed sardines!

851
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:48,980
So my brother said it hurts
to get butt-fucked!

852
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,414
At last I know!

853
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,558
Can't you feel his presence?

854
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:58,060
Because the whole family's here.

855
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:01,462
Too bad he can't see it.

856
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:06,340
Why didn't you speak
in the cemetery?

857
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,980
You always say
such interesting things!

858
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:12,566
You'd have spared us
that awful scene!

859
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,742
To say what?

860
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:17,502
What could I have said?

861
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,340
What would you have said?

862
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:24,420
Lucie means that,
of us all, you were...

863
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,950
I was what?

864
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,360
The closest to Jean-Baptiste!

865
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:30,460
That's not what I meant!

866
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,000
Who was closest to Jean-Baptiste?

867
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:33,980
Stop it!

868
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:37,142
"Stop it!" Why?

869
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:41,140
You should've spoken!
Not Jean-Marie!

870
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,100
Let's not talk about it now.

871
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:45,060
We're too upset.

872
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,740
I'm not upset!

873
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:50,910
I don't care if you're not upset!
I don't give a damn!

874
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,100
Nobody asked you
to bare your soul!

875
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,980
-What would you have said?
-That's enough!

876
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:57,700
What is this dumb game?

877
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,420
We're all behaving

878
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,710
like kids!

879
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:03,140
We shouldn't have come here.

880
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:07,660
Jean-Baptiste
gave something to all of us!

881
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,060
I remember when...

882
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,900
But we gave him a lot, too!

883
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:14,246
We all did...

884
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,526
Speak of the devil!

885
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,526
You did a great job!

886
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:30,038
Spoiled everything!

887
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:33,420
...Jean-Baptiste made you feel

888
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:37,470
you could do anything.
That was my first impression.

889
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,980
From the day I met him.

890
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,460
That life was there
for the taking.

891
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:46,582
How do you feel,
now that you've missed the boat?

892
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:49,020
Wake up, man!

893
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:54,294
Didn't you know he badmouthed
you behind your back?

894
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,980
Didn't you suspect it?
Come on!

895
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:00,740
Oh, yeah? So what did he say?

896
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,222
I don't remember.

897
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,158
Does anyone else?

898
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,180
Because everyone knew!

899
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,854
Nobody remembers?

900
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,460
Was it about Lorette?

901
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,420
Because she's wacko?

902
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:19,110
Why Lorette? Why her?

903
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:23,500
He was a bastard!
But he didn't really hate women.

904
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,758
Who knows?

905
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:27,740
Was it about me?

906
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,098
Forget it, Bernard.

907
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,120
I will. I'd better.

908
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:33,510
The bulb's shot.

909
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:37,238
Well...

910
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,494
See you all.

911
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,302
Maybe I won't see you again.

912
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:46,500
So? We let him go just like that?

913
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:49,740
Could you tell him
what Jean-Baptiste called him?

914
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:52,950
A loser and an ass-kisser?

915
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:56,680
But Bernard wrote something
on Jean-Baptiste,

916
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,300
a short book...

917
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,620
He never finished it!
He's hopeless!

918
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:04,340
He craves our sympathy!
All he does is moan and praise!

919
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:07,358
He wrote a book on him,
you didn't! Why?

920
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:12,100
Because Jean-Baptiste
didn't share your views on art?

921
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,540
Jean-Baptiste wasn't big on theory!

922
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:15,974
He was vicious!

923
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,740
I'm sure he badmouthed us all!

924
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,840
"I'm sure"!

925
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,780
We loved it
when he put down others.

926
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:27,500
"He's hilarious when he's mean",
and so on.

927
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:29,060
That was his scheme!

928
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:32,220
To make us all compete
with one another.

929
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,780
It was a free-for-all!

930
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,540
Why did you stick around?

931
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:36,980
To be the one

932
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:39,566
he didn't put down.
His favorite!

933
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,006
He called the tune,
and you jigged to it!

934
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,086
You both make me puke!

935
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,382
Another empty.

936
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:11,942
Now we've cleaned up.

937
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,646
There's still work to do,

938
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:30,060
but most of it is done.

939
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,638
Sure is.

940
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:54,374
You really gave it to him!

941
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,166
That's your fine family!

942
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,180
Don't talk to me!

943
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,300
Can't you see it doesn't exist?

944
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,598
What if I want it to exist?

945
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,694
Frederic?

946
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,390
Don't call me Frederic.

947
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:21,582
There's no more Frederic.

948
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,542
Please.

949
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:30,030
Did Dominique tell you?

950
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,702
No, I figured it out.

951
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,950
Well?

952
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:41,814
Are you appalled?

953
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:44,030
Not at all!

954
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:46,890
But I can't believe it!

955
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,300
I see you,

956
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:54,926
but I can't believe it.

957
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,046
You're truly lovely...

958
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:08,950
Discouraging for us...

959
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:15,774
May I touch?

960
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,422
We look like idiots!

961
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:27,750
Anyone for bronchitis?

962
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:44,110
Look who I found!
His car broke down!

963
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:55,180
Quite a space!

964
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,326
Elodie!

965
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:00,790
Louis?

966
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,558
I want to see the house.

967
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:13,830
She's sleepy.

968
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,460
You're the mother

969
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,700
of that interesting little girl?

970
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:23,758
My house is packed!

971
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:26,740
I say, my house...

972
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:29,278
Can I talk to you a minute?

973
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,750
Jean-Baptiste wanted her
to be his heiress.

974
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,820
-He wanted her to have all...
-All of his share?

975
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,900
I know.
The lawyers mentioned it.

976
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,054
All of his share!

977
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,700
But I'm still alive.

978
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,670
It's no time to discuss this...

979
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:49,020
I know just how you feel.

980
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:51,700
You've lost a brother.
I lost mine

981
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:55,420
in a dumb moped accident.

982
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,060
Sorry to hear it.

983
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,460
Don't think we're awful people.

984
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,718
That's easily done.

985
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,140
He introduced her
as his granddaughter.

986
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:11,022
They had a real love story going.

987
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,270
Always called her
his granddaughter...

988
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,020
A love story!

989
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,934
Very beautiful.

990
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,798
Then you're my niece!

991
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:31,198
You didn't tell me
you were my niece!

992
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:40,566
So you'll know,
just to reassure you,

993
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,110
the will won't be contested.

994
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,294
In any way, whatsoever.

995
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,678
It never would have been.

996
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:56,262
You like Viviane as a name?

997
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,660
It's fine.

998
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,980
It's magical. Classy.

999
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,980
-Not vulgar.
-Yes, it's not vulgar.

1000
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,300
That's super-important.

1001
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:09,980
But it wasn't easy.
To decide, I mean.

1002
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,660
I know. It's easy to be vulgar.

1003
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,150
People don't realize that.

1004
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:19,262
They must, when they pick names
for their kids.

1005
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,900
-Dominique knew from the start?
-Yeah.

1006
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:32,110
He was great. Never snitched.

1007
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:35,180
I was thinking that in the cemetery.

1008
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,246
That it was funny...

1009
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,958
Yes, funny...

1010
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:44,702
That you, in fact no one,
recognized me.

1011
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:46,980
As no one did,

1012
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:51,054
it was also Frederic's burial today.

1013
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,766
One burial for two.

1014
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:58,438
Two birds with one stone.
That sort of thing.

1015
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,220
Not sad or anything.

1016
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:01,814
Cheerful, really.

1017
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,420
In fact, it's a birth

1018
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,238
in some ways...

1019
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,982
Sorry, I'm talking nonsense.

1020
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:12,582
That's me.

1021
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,894
Always goofing.

1022
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,518
What can I say...

1023
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,580
life's complicated for everyone.

1024
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:31,206
What else?

1025
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,750
You're at home anywhere, right?

1026
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:37,854
Weren't you off it?

1027
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:40,542
"You're at home anywhere."

1028
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:45,460
You rarely talk to me that way.
Something stops you...

1029
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,230
at the last minute.

1030
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,974
-Shyness, maybe.
-Thierry! -Shut up!

1031
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:54,126
You want my creation to collapse?

1032
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,010
Shit!

1033
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:58,870
Thanks!

1034
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:05,220
Did she grab your head, too?

1035
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:07,614
A close shave, but I hung on.

1036
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,598
Wow! Elodie!

1037
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,260
What lovely shoes!

1038
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:13,702
What did you call these shoes?

1039
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,070
What are they?

1040
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,190
They're bad!

1041
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:20,300
That's a virtue, I'm told.

1042
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:21,400
He kills me!

1043
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,740
Elodie won't be selling her share.

1044
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,654
You like the house, eh?

1045
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,694
We resume touring
your new house?

1046
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,910
Milk's boiling over!

1047
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,500
You're the Prince
who became a frog?

1048
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:42,020
Know what "heavy" means?

1049
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:43,698
-Careful!
-Not there!

1050
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,830
Nothing salty?

1051
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,006
Take some.

1052
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,900
Help me remove the froth.

1053
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,660
-Why?
-Must taste burned.

1054
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,180
Froth puffs it up.

1055
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:55,622
Let's put it there.

1056
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,340
I'm on hormones, of course.

1057
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:59,980
And Androcure.

1058
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:01,990
What's Androcure?

1059
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:05,262
No more body hair or erections.
Heaven!

1060
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,358
You're cooking?

1061
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,060
Viviane's doing it all!

1062
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:11,780
I love pots and pans!
Female sexuality!

1063
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:13,374
Speak for yourself!

1064
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,580
Isn't the operation risky?

1065
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,900
They cut your dick in four
and stick it inside.

1066
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,660
Some people never wake up,
but it's worth it.

1067
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,950
A banana split!

1068
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:26,974
We're making French toast!

1069
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:32,300
All these women!

1070
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,598
So many women in my house!

1071
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:38,380
Where did those jewels
come from?

1072
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:39,460
I want some!

1073
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:41,614
Show me...

1074
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,678
Why Elodie, and not me?

1075
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,140
-Smells good!
-It's vanilla.

1076
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,020
You had lots of stale bread!

1077
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,934
It was for the ducks!

1078
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,442
Sorry.

1079
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,540
Don't you have a train to catch?

1080
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:01,730
You have this in 10 1/2?

1081
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:05,660
Maybe.

1082
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,862
In our tall-women's department.

1083
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,780
If you'll kindly follow me...

1084
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,942
I hadn't planned
on buying anything...

1085
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,294
But since I'm rarely in Limoges...

1086
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:42,238
First, let's fight the darkness.

1087
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,780
I warn you, I may lose my mind!

1088
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:57,420
I'm a shoe-freak!
I love shoes.

1089
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:58,282
Really?

1090
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,206
Me, too.

1091
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,206
Shoe-freak's OK.

1092
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,860
I'd have dumped all this
years ago.

1093
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,486
But I don't know...

1094
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,900
We must have had hopes...

1095
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,486
That business would pick up...

1096
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,300
I'm for hope.

1097
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:15,782
Those are men's shoes.

1098
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,926
Too late.

1099
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,766
I'd have loved doing that.

1100
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:48,238
No, you wouldn't.

1101
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:50,262
Me, neither.

1102
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,230
How do you feel?

1103
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:59,846
In those.

1104
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,062
I'm embarrassed.

1105
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,100
You're bored and it's late.

1106
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,966
No, I'm not.

1107
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:09,990
And I know how to do it.

1108
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:13,382
I don't like to, but I know how.

1109
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:15,614
That happens.

1110
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:20,766
Things you dislike,
but you do well?

1111
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:23,900
For instance,

1112
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:26,140
I liked math,
but had to study Latin.

1113
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:29,446
I was quite good at it.

1114
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,590
I wanted to be a pilot,

1115
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,502
in the Naval air force...

1116
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,562
I wound up in shoes!

1117
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:41,758
I wasn't bad at that, either.

1118
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,300
Actually I was lousy. Very bad.

1119
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:52,030
I bankrupted the joint.

1120
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,020
That's not really true...

1121
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,780
Nothing too shameful.

1122
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:01,940
I need an idiot
who'd want this house...

1123
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,806
so I could sell it all.

1124
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:09,366
The world's poorly organized.

1125
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:15,014
Stand up,
that's how you know.

1126
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,894
Try walking a bit.

1127
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,574
The runway ends there.

1128
01:26:45,641 --> 01:26:46,561
It's short.

1129
01:26:47,221 --> 01:26:49,061
You have real inner beauty.

1130
01:26:49,741 --> 01:26:50,881
Inner beauty?

1131
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,361
You're very handsome.

1132
01:26:56,681 --> 01:26:58,521
You're very refreshing.

1133
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:02,321
Bitchingly refreshing,

1134
01:27:02,841 --> 01:27:04,201
maybe I should say...

1135
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:09,721
You shut up!

1136
01:27:10,841 --> 01:27:12,921
I wiped his ass
when he was sick!

1137
01:27:13,121 --> 01:27:15,761
I got him his smack!

1138
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:16,921
You hear?

1139
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:20,441
Keep him!
Keep the corpse!

1140
01:27:20,921 --> 01:27:22,761
You transported his body,

1141
01:27:22,961 --> 01:27:24,401
what's your gripe?

1142
01:27:24,601 --> 01:27:25,981
What's your gripe?

1143
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:26,961
Stop it!

1144
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:28,581
What's this mess?

1145
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:30,901
-Move over!
-No one'll steal it, OK?

1146
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:32,041
Shut up!

1147
01:27:35,801 --> 01:27:38,961
Want me to ream you right here?

1148
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:41,761
-In front of everyone?
-Get lost!

1149
01:27:42,001 --> 01:27:44,761
Monday he called at 4 AM!
He called me!

1150
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:47,321
He wanted to die in my arms!

1151
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:48,821
That bugs you all!

1152
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:50,241
Fuck it! Shut up!

1153
01:27:50,721 --> 01:27:51,601
Stop it!

1154
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:53,321
Where were you then?

1155
01:27:53,681 --> 01:27:54,561
Where?

1156
01:27:57,081 --> 01:27:58,181
Little creep!

1157
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:00,081
That guy's nuts!

1158
01:28:00,281 --> 01:28:01,321
Stop it!

1159
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:04,841
You stop!

1160
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:13,401
Do that again!

1161
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:15,701
Hit me again, I'm gone for good.

1162
01:28:16,361 --> 01:28:17,721
With Elodie!

1163
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:21,241
Bitch!

1164
01:28:33,061 --> 01:28:35,121
The French toast is sizzling!

1165
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:57,301
That's OK.

1166
01:28:57,401 --> 01:28:59,241
-Let me.
-Watch out!

1167
01:31:22,761 --> 01:31:24,541
I don't know where he went.

1168
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:32,841
I sat down in this café,
watched them from afar.

1169
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,681
He comes over: "What'll she have?"

1170
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:37,721
He says things like that.

1171
01:31:37,921 --> 01:31:39,381
"What'll she have?"

1172
01:31:39,481 --> 01:31:40,621
The treatment!

1173
01:31:42,081 --> 01:31:45,081
I hesitated:
"If I say, hi dad, it's Frederic!"

1174
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:46,851
he'll have a heart attack.

1175
01:31:46,941 --> 01:31:49,261
I looked him in the eye and said:

1176
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:52,001
Hi dad, it's Frederic,
remember me?

1177
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:54,121
I didn't say "remember me?"

1178
01:31:58,481 --> 01:31:59,761
He looked at me.

1179
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:01,321
When he saw it was me,

1180
01:32:01,881 --> 01:32:03,521
he really belted me!

1181
01:32:03,721 --> 01:32:06,241
For two days
I couldn't see straight.

1182
01:32:08,241 --> 01:32:10,921
Heart attack, my ass!

1183
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:16,501
May I smoke in your room?

1184
01:32:18,921 --> 01:32:21,041
Don't do this to yourself!

1185
01:32:22,021 --> 01:32:23,921
You have three solutions: A child.

1186
01:32:24,241 --> 01:32:26,121
No child. A child with him.

1187
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:30,601
OK, you're not a man or a woman.
What do you know about either sex?

1188
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:32,201
You an expert?

1189
01:32:35,061 --> 01:32:36,701
What's wrong with me?

1190
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:37,981
Shit!

1191
01:32:41,321 --> 01:32:43,321
I've gotta quit sniveling!

1192
01:32:49,621 --> 01:32:51,621
You hated Jean-Baptiste, right?

1193
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:55,961
He fucked us over quite a bit.
Now he's dead...

1194
01:32:56,161 --> 01:32:58,201
I don't think he hated you.

1195
01:32:59,981 --> 01:33:01,301
I saw him Saturday.

1196
01:33:03,381 --> 01:33:04,601
This Saturday?

1197
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:06,161
Come on!

1198
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,481
That's exactly what he said to me...

1199
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:11,881
That he didn't hate me...

1200
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:15,721
He said he was sorry...

1201
01:33:15,921 --> 01:33:18,361
Not that he was sorry,
but that he felt...

1202
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,081
It was weird.

1203
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:24,041
He must have sensed it coming...

1204
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:29,561
He knew
he wouldn't be around long...

1205
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:35,861
And then?

1206
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:37,961
Then?

1207
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:39,841
It's like pulling teeth!

1208
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,201
He told me

1209
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:46,201
he'd been sure
we wouldn't stay together,

1210
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:48,121
Jean-Marie and me...

1211
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:50,641
Because of dope...

1212
01:33:50,961 --> 01:33:53,521
That dope would destroy us...

1213
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:58,041
and he was happy
he'd been wrong.

1214
01:34:00,721 --> 01:34:02,041
Then I told him

1215
01:34:02,181 --> 01:34:04,281
that he wasn't wrong,

1216
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:06,421
that he was absolutely right.

1217
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:10,561
I said I was pregnant
and was getting an abortion.

1218
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:14,841
I was due at the clinic
this morning.

1219
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,161
I told him that he'd won.

1220
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:20,141
That it was all over,

1221
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:21,781
it was too late.

1222
01:34:21,881 --> 01:34:23,461
It was dumb to tell him!

1223
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:25,381
That's easy for you to say!

1224
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:27,901
He did everything to destroy us.

1225
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:31,061
Said I was destructive,
stunk of death...

1226
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:34,881
I heard it all!

1227
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:39,821
What did Jean-Baptiste say then?

1228
01:34:42,361 --> 01:34:43,801
It was very strange.

1229
01:34:45,921 --> 01:34:48,441
He said Satan put words
in his mouth.

1230
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:50,161
Literally.

1231
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:51,901
I'm not kidding.

1232
01:34:52,641 --> 01:34:54,341
It gave me the willies.

1233
01:34:55,761 --> 01:34:57,081
He said

1234
01:34:57,421 --> 01:34:59,741
Satan often put words in his mouth,

1235
01:35:00,121 --> 01:35:01,921
when he criticized me.

1236
01:35:04,681 --> 01:35:05,961
He told me

1237
01:35:06,961 --> 01:35:08,481
he was glad

1238
01:35:09,841 --> 01:35:11,201
he was wrong,

1239
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:14,441
that Jean-Marie
hadn't listened to him.

1240
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:17,401
A baby was a victory for love...

1241
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:21,741
But it's too easy, later,

1242
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:24,421
once the damage is done,

1243
01:35:24,521 --> 01:35:26,041
to play good guy.

1244
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:27,661
That's too easy?

1245
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:30,006
Nonsense!

1246
01:35:30,096 --> 01:35:31,581
Who apologizes in life?

1247
01:35:31,681 --> 01:35:33,241
Ever hear a guy apologize?

1248
01:35:38,201 --> 01:35:40,081
You told this to Jean-Marie?

1249
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:41,641
No.

1250
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:55,481
Haven't we met?

1251
01:35:57,661 --> 01:35:59,181
You seen Jean-Marie?

1252
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:00,601
No...

1253
01:36:05,281 --> 01:36:08,521
We met at Jean-Baptiste's.
You're a great cook.

1254
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,401
That must be it.

1255
01:36:11,201 --> 01:36:13,071
You don't know where he is?

1256
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:14,981
Jean-Baptiste? Yeah!

1257
01:36:15,841 --> 01:36:16,881
Cut the crap!

1258
01:36:16,981 --> 01:36:18,681
Everyone says that to me.

1259
01:36:19,081 --> 01:36:20,601
So take a hint!

1260
01:36:51,701 --> 01:36:52,901
Anyone there?

1261
01:36:59,121 --> 01:37:00,001
Dad?

1262
01:37:10,361 --> 01:37:11,801
Beychevelle, 1982.

1263
01:37:12,281 --> 01:37:14,001
Last of the family jewels.

1264
01:37:14,881 --> 01:37:16,681
I'm no expert.

1265
01:37:16,781 --> 01:37:18,261
I'm warning you.

1266
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:20,701
Am I intruding?

1267
01:37:21,721 --> 01:37:23,121
What do you mean?

1268
01:37:24,481 --> 01:37:26,141
My son: I kicked him out,

1269
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:29,361
he sneaks back
and asks if he's intruding.

1270
01:37:29,561 --> 01:37:32,061
-You didn't kick me out. I split.
-True!

1271
01:37:32,161 --> 01:37:33,921
Climbed out the window.

1272
01:37:34,241 --> 01:37:35,441
In the night.

1273
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:37,761
You split!

1274
01:37:38,581 --> 01:37:39,681
Right?

1275
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:41,721
Why not by the door?

1276
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:44,561
He wanted to fall.
So I'd feel guilty.

1277
01:37:45,221 --> 01:37:47,521
Pity to open these great bottles.

1278
01:37:48,521 --> 01:37:50,841
"So the Krauts won't get 'em! "

1279
01:37:52,901 --> 01:37:55,761
Just to run
to your spiritual father!

1280
01:37:56,101 --> 01:37:58,061
He was like a father to you!

1281
01:37:58,221 --> 01:37:59,521
And what else?

1282
01:37:59,801 --> 01:38:01,941
Did you eat out his ass, too?

1283
01:38:08,901 --> 01:38:11,841
He took my wife, my son,
and now my house!

1284
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:13,821
The house, that's rough!

1285
01:38:15,601 --> 01:38:17,081
But you love Elodie!

1286
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:18,841
I'm a grandpa.

1287
01:38:20,681 --> 01:38:23,521
Give him a junkie's kid,
and he's a grandpa!

1288
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:26,961
Yet he never spent
a single Sunday with us!

1289
01:38:27,521 --> 01:38:30,361
"Us" is him and his mom.
Who I drove to her death!

1290
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:36,721
We're due
for a serious talk about money!

1291
01:38:37,121 --> 01:38:41,201
I won't be fleeced,
you'd better believe it!

1292
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,401
I'm going to have a kid!

1293
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,241
-I know.
-No, you don't!

1294
01:38:45,341 --> 01:38:46,301
I don't think you do!

1295
01:38:46,401 --> 01:38:48,401
I know that Claire's pregnant.

1296
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:51,801
I know you're careful with money,
you'd rather die

1297
01:38:52,001 --> 01:38:54,481
than ask me for help
when you're strapped!

1298
01:38:54,681 --> 01:38:57,161
I know you don't act
like a rich kid!

1299
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:59,561
That you don't waste money!

1300
01:38:59,761 --> 01:39:01,481
I know I raised you right!

1301
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:09,081
Do you think
I lost track of you for 15 years?

1302
01:39:09,681 --> 01:39:11,801
That my only news
was your letters?

1303
01:39:12,161 --> 01:39:14,441
You didn't have a dad,
but I had a son!

1304
01:39:17,001 --> 01:39:18,921
And a brother, who blabbed!

1305
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,001
He promised me

1306
01:39:21,201 --> 01:39:22,991
that if you had no talent,

1307
01:39:23,081 --> 01:39:24,821
you'd not go to art-school.

1308
01:39:25,881 --> 01:39:27,221
And you didn't go.

1309
01:39:29,121 --> 01:39:30,561
That's disgusting!

1310
01:39:31,681 --> 01:39:33,601
Where did your money
come from?

1311
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:34,841
Your uncle?

1312
01:39:35,401 --> 01:39:36,881
Your spiritual father?

1313
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:39,361
Not from the Arts fund!

1314
01:39:39,801 --> 01:39:42,201
From the Centipedes' slush fund!

1315
01:39:42,801 --> 01:39:44,081
So fuck you!

1316
01:39:46,061 --> 01:39:47,261
How's the wine?

1317
01:39:47,361 --> 01:39:49,161
Fuck you!

1318
01:39:55,521 --> 01:39:56,841
There you are...

1319
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:03,841
I dislocated something.
I'm sure I did.

1320
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:06,441
-Take your shirt off.
-Oh, yeah?

1321
01:40:06,641 --> 01:40:08,101
Just the shirt...

1322
01:40:10,401 --> 01:40:11,841
My real problem

1323
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:14,761
is that I'm such a
conventional girl.

1324
01:40:15,201 --> 01:40:17,881
Yet why would I cheat?

1325
01:40:18,681 --> 01:40:19,841
Don't laugh,

1326
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:22,161
but I'd love to be
a bakerwoman...

1327
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:27,021
-So there!
-You dig buns?

1328
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,681
I'd mind the shop.

1329
01:40:29,601 --> 01:40:31,201
Here's my fantasy:

1330
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:34,801
it's Xmas-time, I open the bakery,

1331
01:40:35,181 --> 01:40:36,281
around 7 AM,

1332
01:40:37,061 --> 01:40:40,681
it smells good, people come in,
still half-asleep,

1333
01:40:41,181 --> 01:40:42,541
their faces puffy,

1334
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:45,921
they're off to work,
it's cold and dark,

1335
01:40:46,681 --> 01:40:48,301
mine's the only shop open,

1336
01:40:48,401 --> 01:40:50,321
I'm the star of Bethlehem.

1337
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:54,941
I don't bug them,

1338
01:40:55,441 --> 01:40:56,841
I flash a big smile,

1339
01:40:57,481 --> 01:40:59,261
they take off into the night.

1340
01:41:00,861 --> 01:41:02,221
I've made their day.

1341
01:41:02,321 --> 01:41:06,221
-Must be tiring. Stop, any time...
-Don't worry, I'm used to it.

1342
01:41:07,801 --> 01:41:09,361
Your neck's really stiff!

1343
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:18,121
You're the wife or an aide?

1344
01:41:18,321 --> 01:41:19,881
I'm the baker's wife!

1345
01:41:20,081 --> 01:41:22,041
Married or just shacked up?

1346
01:41:22,141 --> 01:41:24,421
You're not into Viviane's fantasy!

1347
01:41:24,981 --> 01:41:26,681
Of course they're married!

1348
01:41:27,241 --> 01:41:28,581
In church, right?

1349
01:41:28,681 --> 01:41:30,081
City hall is OK!

1350
01:41:30,281 --> 01:41:32,621
We made vows:
for better or for worse.

1351
01:41:32,721 --> 01:41:34,001
City hall's nice.

1352
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:35,201
It's lovely!

1353
01:41:36,201 --> 01:41:37,121
Exactly.

1354
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,001
Viviane wants an ordinary life.

1355
01:41:41,201 --> 01:41:43,961
He's getting nasty.
He's making fun of you!

1356
01:41:44,161 --> 01:41:45,001
Not at all!

1357
01:41:45,101 --> 01:41:46,921
You're impossible!

1358
01:41:47,121 --> 01:41:49,521
I agree with Viviane completely!

1359
01:41:50,161 --> 01:41:51,681
Rituals are essential.

1360
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:54,481
To commit before witnesses
is essential.

1361
01:41:54,681 --> 01:41:57,281
Secret love-affairs are lightweight.

1362
01:41:57,481 --> 01:41:58,961
What can witnesses do?

1363
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:03,441
If one lover dies,
they can tell the other:

1364
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:05,681
we were there,
it wasn't a dream,

1365
01:42:05,881 --> 01:42:07,681
he loved you, he really did.

1366
01:42:07,941 --> 01:42:09,681
-Right?
-Exactly.

1367
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:13,281
Witnesses establish the truth!
Like for murder.

1368
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:16,921
They'd make you believe
I loved you, if I said it?

1369
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:18,881
You never did!

1370
01:42:19,281 --> 01:42:20,401
Nor did you!

1371
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:22,241
-You see?
-See what?

1372
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:24,881
That we acted pretty rashly,

1373
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:28,041
but never lied to each other

1374
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:29,341
openly.

1375
01:42:31,701 --> 01:42:33,101
He can't admit...

1376
01:42:33,601 --> 01:42:37,961
he dropped me when he found out
I was HIV-positive.

1377
01:42:39,161 --> 01:42:40,161
Is that true?

1378
01:42:40,261 --> 01:42:42,461
Good question: Is it true?

1379
01:42:42,581 --> 01:42:43,461
Supposedly

1380
01:42:43,561 --> 01:42:45,501
I hid
that I was HIV-positive.

1381
01:42:45,601 --> 01:42:49,161
Did anything change
when you told me?

1382
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:51,521
This is a bore, sorry Viviane.

1383
01:42:51,721 --> 01:42:53,481
What did it change?

1384
01:42:53,581 --> 01:42:54,901
We stopped screwing?

1385
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:56,001
No way!

1386
01:42:56,961 --> 01:42:59,801
You waited a while,
to hide your fears.

1387
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:01,041
Is that it?

1388
01:43:02,001 --> 01:43:03,081
Any other...

1389
01:43:03,561 --> 01:43:04,721
explanations?

1390
01:43:05,401 --> 01:43:06,701
How about pity?

1391
01:43:07,841 --> 01:43:09,321
Isn't that worse?

1392
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:11,481
Fuck you!

1393
01:43:12,841 --> 01:43:14,881
Get it straight in your head.

1394
01:43:14,981 --> 01:43:16,661
Why am I such a bastard?

1395
01:43:16,761 --> 01:43:19,001
Because I stayed
or because I left?

1396
01:43:19,441 --> 01:43:20,861
Make up your mind!

1397
01:43:21,861 --> 01:43:23,501
You were in the garden.

1398
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:25,881
I saw you.
You went all the way.

1399
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:34,481
You saw how big it is?

1400
01:43:35,161 --> 01:43:36,601
Yes, I did.

1401
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:39,841
And falling apart.

1402
01:43:40,161 --> 01:43:41,541
There's work to do.

1403
01:43:42,241 --> 01:43:44,761
That's why people
can't keep big houses.

1404
01:43:45,361 --> 01:43:47,961
But many things are easy to fix.

1405
01:43:50,761 --> 01:43:52,361
Re-wiring the house,

1406
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:54,021
that's not too hard.

1407
01:43:58,241 --> 01:44:00,061
The roof's in tiptop shape.

1408
01:44:03,701 --> 01:44:05,361
What about that letter?

1409
01:44:08,761 --> 01:44:11,001
I have to say what you said?

1410
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:15,261
I'm moving out?

1411
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:17,521
The easiest thing is

1412
01:44:17,621 --> 01:44:19,881
-if we do it together.
-All right.

1413
01:44:25,001 --> 01:44:27,381
-Did Dad go to bed?
-I don't know.

1414
01:44:37,241 --> 01:44:39,321
I've always needed a challenge.

1415
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:44,801
One day...
I'd meet someone I couldn't break.

1416
01:44:50,161 --> 01:44:52,921
Lousy way to look at love!

1417
01:44:57,481 --> 01:44:59,001
I was rough on you.

1418
01:45:04,141 --> 01:45:05,601
You stood up well.

1419
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:15,501
I'm leaving you.

1420
01:45:16,801 --> 01:45:18,161
Will you be OK?

1421
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:44,241
What about you?

1422
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:18,961
Shit!

1423
01:46:23,081 --> 01:46:24,581
No hot water?

1424
01:46:24,701 --> 01:46:26,481
-Is there a Bruno here?
-Yes.

1425
01:46:26,674 --> 01:46:27,941
I'll take it.

1426
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:35,441
-Did I wake everyone up?
-Not at all.

1427
01:46:35,561 --> 01:46:37,261
We expected your call.

1428
01:46:37,801 --> 01:46:39,441
How was the station?

1429
01:46:40,581 --> 01:46:41,941
Had a good time?

1430
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:43,841
The station was great.

1431
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:46,561
I cried for three hours,
caught a train,

1432
01:46:47,521 --> 01:46:48,881
tried to reach you,

1433
01:46:49,721 --> 01:46:51,401
then cried some more...

1434
01:46:51,801 --> 01:46:53,961
How do you find time for all that?

1435
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:56,321
Well?

1436
01:46:57,321 --> 01:46:58,701
I've been thinking...

1437
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:04,021
You're essential to my life.

1438
01:47:04,881 --> 01:47:06,081
What a drag!

1439
01:47:08,041 --> 01:47:08,961
But...?

1440
01:47:11,801 --> 01:47:13,401
So is Bruno.

1441
01:47:15,161 --> 01:47:16,241
We could...

1442
01:47:17,801 --> 01:47:20,441
I mean,
you're both important to me.

1443
01:47:22,801 --> 01:47:25,041
We could bring him up together.

1444
01:47:25,241 --> 01:47:27,461
-Bring up Bruno?
-I don't know.

1445
01:47:28,261 --> 01:47:29,301
Why, is he a baby?

1446
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:30,761
Yes, he is...

1447
01:47:32,361 --> 01:47:33,441
He's a kid.

1448
01:47:37,281 --> 01:47:39,321
What I meant was...

1449
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:44,441
our lives could be more inventive...

1450
01:47:45,801 --> 01:47:49,041
-I want to keep you in mine.
-I don't want any kids!

1451
01:47:49,601 --> 01:47:52,081
Ask before you adopt
a stray baby!

1452
01:47:52,281 --> 01:47:54,681
-That's what I'm doing.
-The answer's no!

1453
01:47:55,241 --> 01:47:56,321
I need him.

1454
01:47:57,161 --> 01:47:58,481
If you say so...

1455
01:48:04,301 --> 01:48:05,441
Are you afraid?

1456
01:48:06,661 --> 01:48:07,461
Yes...

1457
01:48:08,921 --> 01:48:10,641
But not the way you think.

1458
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:12,841
Maybe that's what attracts me.

1459
01:48:13,721 --> 01:48:14,841
I don't know.

1460
01:48:16,081 --> 01:48:19,121
Your fear is wondering
if you can handle it.

1461
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:21,141
That's scary.

1462
01:48:21,301 --> 01:48:22,601
Sure...

1463
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:25,161
You're so smart!

1464
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:29,241
You meet the man of your life
and have to say

1465
01:48:30,681 --> 01:48:32,601
what if something happens,

1466
01:48:33,281 --> 01:48:35,081
if he gets sick and all,

1467
01:48:35,961 --> 01:48:38,641
could I deal with it?

1468
01:48:41,021 --> 01:48:42,281
Could I handle it?

1469
01:48:43,161 --> 01:48:44,561
I never asked myself.

1470
01:48:48,501 --> 01:48:50,561
I think about it and I'm scared.

1471
01:48:51,521 --> 01:48:53,421
But I know I could handle it.

1472
01:48:53,581 --> 01:48:54,321
Yes.

1473
01:48:54,721 --> 01:48:56,521
You know those things.

1474
01:48:57,361 --> 01:48:58,721
I know you know it.

1475
01:49:04,161 --> 01:49:06,481
You also know
when you can't handle it.

1476
01:49:13,921 --> 01:49:14,981
Where are you?

1477
01:49:15,601 --> 01:49:16,681
In a hotel.

1478
01:49:17,721 --> 01:49:18,481
Wait...

1479
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:24,481
Hotel Joan of Ark.

1480
01:49:25,881 --> 01:49:27,101
De Gaulle Avenue,

1481
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:28,201
number 17.

1482
01:49:29,701 --> 01:49:31,261
Here's Bruno for you.

1483
01:49:36,521 --> 01:49:38,601
-You never know, huh?
-What?

1484
01:49:38,801 --> 01:49:40,921
Sometimes it happens.

1485
01:49:41,441 --> 01:49:42,561
Give me that.

1486
01:49:43,121 --> 01:49:44,501
Something happens.

1487
01:49:44,721 --> 01:49:46,331
Someone happens.

1488
01:49:46,421 --> 01:49:47,551
It's crazy.

1489
01:49:47,641 --> 01:49:49,081
But it does exist.

1490
01:49:49,281 --> 01:49:50,001
Go!

1491
01:49:51,721 --> 01:49:54,281
You have to hold on.
Have to hope.

1492
01:49:54,481 --> 01:49:55,521
Do I go?

1493
01:49:56,201 --> 01:49:58,521
-I'm against death!
-So I should go?

1494
01:49:58,641 --> 01:49:59,621
I agree...

1495
01:49:59,721 --> 01:50:00,981
I go, right?

1496
01:50:01,461 --> 01:50:03,441
If you don't, I'll kill you!

1497
01:50:28,161 --> 01:50:29,601
Jeez, it's cold!

1498
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:41,721
Shit!

1499
01:51:04,601 --> 01:51:05,441
Wait!

1500
01:51:05,641 --> 01:51:06,801
One second!

1501
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:24,641
