1
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,426
There's more over here!

2
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:40,892
Bring another team!

3
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:44,391
We'll need a lot more help!

4
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:48,198
Are you okay? Is the baby all right?

5
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:51,262
It's okay. You can stay with your dad.

6
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,034
I'm not his father. He's alone.

7
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:54,200
- Go with him.
- No, please.

8
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:56,038
- You'll be okay.
- I want to be with you.

9
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:57,100
Take him.

10
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,509
I've got to find the mother.

11
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:00,973
Now, go.

12
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,917
Come with me.

13
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,474
You'll be all right.

14
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:08,547
Everyone, please stay where you are.

15
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:10,523
We'll be with you in a minute.

16
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,717
Get them out of there! It's going to blow!
Get them out!

17
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:40,579
My boy!

18
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,756
My boy! My little boy's in there!

19
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,829
No, my baby's in there!

20
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,032
I can't leave my boy!

21
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:00,238
Stop!

22
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,309
Stop, my baby's in there!

23
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:07,705
My baby!

24
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:14,544
Stop!

25
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:07,563
Are you okay?

26
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,808
Were you in the crash?

27
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:18,081
No. I found this baby.

28
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:20,845
I've got to find the mother.

29
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,482
There's a woman over there.
She's looking for her baby.

30
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,058
Right over there.

31
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:37,768
Is this your baby?

32
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,667
My sweet angel.

33
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,053
I want to go to the nearest hotel.

34
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,723
You've got to be kidding.

35
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:48,758
You're not dead.

36
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:06,306
An InterCity Air spokesperson indicates
an estimated 200 passengers were...

37
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,344
Wire reports confirm a crash
of an InterCity Airjet...

38
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:13,581
...in the northeast section of the county
at Route 7 and Lake.

39
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:35,994
ALthough, remarkabLy enough,
peopLe maintained themseLves pretty weLL.

40
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:40,798
PeopLe puLL together in a situation Like that
and the crew was very professionaL.

41
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,309
Max.

42
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,180
Max Klein.

43
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,245
What the hell are you doing here?

44
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,450
Just passing through.

45
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:00,254
You bastard, you don't look any different.

46
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,794
- Nice try.
- It's true.

47
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,955
Look at you. I can't believe it!

48
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:06,156
It's been 20 years.

49
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:12,234
These are strawberry pancakes?

50
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,465
I wanted...

51
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:18,872
Do you have whole strawberries?

52
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:20,439
I guess.

53
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,271
Bring me a bowl, please.

54
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:27,112
I don't remember you having
a thing for strawberries.

55
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:30,154
How's Bill? Is he head
of the theater department yet?

56
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:31,016
No.

57
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,486
He was passed over.

58
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:37,592
I'll make this quick. I can't stand going
through the list. My life's a disaster.

59
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:38,960
No, it isn't.

60
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,100
- Yes, it is.
- Trust me.

61
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:43,761
Your life isn't a disaster.

62
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:03,011
I'm fat. I haven't written a play in years.
Timmy, my oldest...

63
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,455
...has a learning disability.

64
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,689
Thanks to therapy I love him for what
he is, not my fantasy of what he should be.

65
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,927
The middle two, James and Sarah,
resent the extra attention Timmy got...

66
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,229
...so they fuck up in school to punish us.

67
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:19,136
They're working it out in a support group,
Siblings of the Learning Disabled.

68
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:23,341
My youngest, Ellen, who was going to be
a great ballerina...

69
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:26,969
...destroyed her ankle playing basketball
with her brothers.

70
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:30,177
As for Bill, he's screwing a student.

71
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:34,952
Pathetic.

72
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,887
It's not even tragic.

73
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,253
Have a strawberry?

74
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:41,226
What good will that do?

75
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,857
Forbidden fruit always does good.

76
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,437
Forbidden fruit.

77
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:02,910
I didn't come for that.

78
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,346
It figures.

79
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:08,648
You always were faithful.

80
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:10,484
And you?

81
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,287
Who'd have me?

82
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,459
Wait a minute.

83
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:18,057
Aren't you allergic to strawberries?

84
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,066
Didn't you almost die when you were little
from eating a strawberry?

85
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,602
I'm past all that.

86
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,329
See? No reaction.

87
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,700
No reaction at all.

88
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:56,094
- That's him.
- What?

89
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,436
Good morning. I'm Agent Parsons,
this is Agent Smith. We're with the FBI.

90
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:04,505
You're registered as Mr. Max Klein...

91
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:07,613
...1147 Varennes in San Francisco.
Is that correct?

92
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,044
You got me.

93
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:11,581
Can we come in?

94
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,220
Were you on a flight from San Francisco
to Houston that made an emergency...

95
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:23,456
Yes, I was.

96
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,761
Took a hike from the scene?
Just up and left?

97
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,795
- What time is it?
- 10:00, Thursday morning.

98
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:30,834
You've been missing almost a day.

99
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:31,894
Missing?

100
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,836
What are you doing here?

101
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:37,744
You walked from the crash,
rented a car, drove to L. A...

102
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:39,171
Why?

103
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:42,081
They didn't need me anymore.

104
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,341
Need you for what?

105
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:47,677
Am I under arrest?

106
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,319
You haven't done anything.

107
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,385
Do you?

108
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,032
Do you know this man?

109
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,473
I'm Cindy Dickens...

110
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:16,983
...of InterCity Air and I'm here
to help get you home.

111
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:18,351
That's nice.

112
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,013
No one's taken me home
since the first grade.

113
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:26,051
I have tickets on AmTrak
to get you to San Francisco.

114
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:28,388
Your train leaves in an hour.

115
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:29,826
I want to fly.

116
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,227
I'm sorry?

117
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:35,462
You'll fly me back to San Francisco
for free...

118
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:36,960
...right?

119
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,230
Of course.

120
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:45,141
But when I told your wife the good news,
she said that...

121
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:49,005
...even before the unpleasant...

122
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:52,810
Crash.

123
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:54,514
Yes, right.

124
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,881
Even before that...

125
00:14:57,992 --> 00:14:59,926
...you were afraid to fly.

126
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:03,795
I'd love to fly home on your airline,
but I've got a request.

127
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,025
Sir?

128
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,524
I want to go first class.

129
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:12,432
Super.

130
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,669
With our compliments, sir.

131
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,706
- Cockpit preparation?
- Completed.

132
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:24,773
Light test?

133
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,877
- Oxygen and interphone?
- Checked.

134
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:28,249
- Yaw damper?
- On.

135
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,378
Hydraulics?

136
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:30,445
On.

137
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:34,551
Sir, may I see your boarding pass?

138
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,530
Your seat is right down the aisle.

139
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,438
Is he on board?

140
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,612
I just made it.

141
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,177
I'm Bill Perlman.

142
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,523
Going home, right?

143
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:08,618
Glad to be going home, I bet.

144
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,291
You're a shrink.

145
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,493
That's right.

146
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:17,265
I specialize in the treatment
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

147
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,334
I wrote a book about it
and several airlines hired me...

148
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,172
We're pulling away from the gate.

149
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:26,974
...as a consultant to work
with crash survivors.

150
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:32,112
One of my perks is free tickets.
Seatbelt, I think you should put it on.

151
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,351
But I have to travel so much for work...

152
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,723
...that my idea of a vacation...

153
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,993
That's normal.

154
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:42,961
...is just to stay put.

155
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,697
I'm not scared.

156
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,798
But I would like another drink...

157
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:49,335
...when we're airborne.

158
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:51,933
I should say, if we're airborne.

159
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,993
- Mom, he's here! He's really here!
- I knew you were all right.

160
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:22,963
- I knew you were okay!
- We were so worried.

161
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:24,095
It's a miracle.

162
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,469
You're alive.

163
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:33,379
I knew I couldn't lose you.

164
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,415
- Coffee. Let's get coffee.
- Okay.

165
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:41,847
- Look at you. He's perfect.
- Yes, he is. He's just fine.

166
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,752
Come here.

167
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:48,854
Were you scared?

168
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:50,793
No.

169
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,089
Not at all.

170
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,155
Excuse me.

171
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,293
- I'm Steven Brillstein.
- Nan asked if he could wait here.

172
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,698
He's a lawyer.

173
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,568
I'm sorry to intrude, but...

174
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:04,110
...Mrs. Gordon's frustrated. The airline
can't make a definite identification.

175
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:05,076
Jeff's dead.

176
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,169
Oh, my God!

177
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,235
Jesus, Max!

178
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:10,039
Max isn't himself right now.

179
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:13,210
How do you know? We just met.

180
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,756
- I'm Bill Perlman.
- He's a therapist, works for the airline.

181
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,285
I'm here for you, Max.

182
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,920
If the airline pays your bills,
then it's a conflict of interest.

183
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:26,699
I have to warn Mr. Klein
that anything he says in your presence...

184
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,394
Is in confidence. It's my agreement.

185
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,130
Let's talk about that later.

186
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:34,536
Nan doesn't know.
She thinks if you're alive...

187
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:35,836
I'll tell her.

188
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,977
Can we speak privately?

189
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:40,707
This is inappropriate.

190
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,881
All right, out. Get out!

191
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:44,409
We should talk.

192
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:46,444
Max, relax.

193
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:49,282
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

194
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,888
I didn't hit him very hard.

195
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:55,590
I can't help you right now.

196
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,122
If you need anything, call me.

197
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,868
In fairness to Mrs. Gordon,
I should hear the details.

198
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,719
May I speak bluntly?

199
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:21,048
I'd prefer it.

200
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,521
You said you saw Mr. Gordon's dead body.

201
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:32,332
Let me give you a piece of advice.
When you speak to your lawyer...

202
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,525
...emphasize that you saw
your partner's dead body...

203
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,802
...and think hard about what else you saw.

204
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:41,773
It doesn't matter what you've said
to anybody so far.

205
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:44,310
With accidents there's a delayed reaction.

206
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:47,544
Memories of what happened
return gradually.

207
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:51,209
I know, I'm terrible to talk about it but...

208
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,619
...it's important that you remember...

209
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:58,488
...if you saw Mr. Gordon actually be killed.

210
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,659
Another thing to remember:

211
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:04,697
If he wasn't killed instantly...

212
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,561
...if he was in any pain...

213
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,463
You telling me how to lie
so I can get more money?

214
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:14,700
To be honest with you,
I wasn't thinking about you.

215
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,640
I was thinking about Mrs. Gordon.

216
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:18,836
She's not from a rich family and...

217
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:21,106
...now she's a widow with two children.

218
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,010
What? What?

219
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,513
What? What's wrong?

220
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:28,680
I don't want to tell any lies.

221
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,347
All right.

222
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,383
Next time, just say no.

223
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,661
Good evening, Mr. Klein.

224
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:43,436
Don't scream, okay?

225
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,529
Just bear in mind, you're sitting pretty,
you get the partnership insurance.

226
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,542
I think you owe Mrs. Gordon anything...

227
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:53,578
...that could improve her settlement
with the airlines.

228
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,190
One other thing:

229
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:09,591
I had all night to go through
Mr. Gordon's papers.

230
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:13,427
He cashed in the tickets
that you ordered on AMEX.

231
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Got a better price,
rebought them for cash...

232
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,903
...and pocketed the difference.

233
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,737
So Jeff cheated me out of $200.

234
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,809
So he cheated his wife...

235
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:27,205
...out of the automatic
American Express insurance.

236
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:29,946
That's another reason why...

237
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,884
...your memory of what happened
on the plane is so important.

238
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,337
Steady.

239
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:01,906
I knew it. I just knew it...

240
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,209
...right away.

241
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,182
- We were stupid.
- No, you weren't.

242
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:07,720
We lived like jerks.

243
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:11,155
Always nagging. We wasted it.

244
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,524
He loved you.

245
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,220
Mom, keep the kids...

246
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:23,867
- Let's go back to your room.
- Why's she crying?

247
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,528
You made him happy.

248
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:26,900
He loved you.

249
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:29,839
He loved you.

250
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:32,144
Max, please shut up.

251
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:00,505
Let me hold you.

252
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:06,370
Why didn't you call?

253
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:07,637
Where were you?

254
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:09,375
I was visiting my past.

255
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:12,280
But why didn't you tell me you were alive?

256
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,010
I thought I was dead.

257
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,166
How does it feel to be a hero?

258
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,904
How did it feel those last few seconds?

259
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:43,143
It's me.

260
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:48,915
We live in the same city.

261
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,183
Isn't that great?

262
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:54,924
This is my son, Jonah.

263
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:56,251
Hi, I'm Byron.

264
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:58,160
Did you know the plane would crash?

265
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,664
I want to get on the bus.

266
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:18,682
I'm Peter, Byron's father.

267
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:20,686
I want to thank you.

268
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:23,579
You have a brave son.

269
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,724
I made my dad bring me.

270
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:27,588
I can't sleep.

271
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:29,386
I want to be with you.

272
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:30,930
Why do you want to be with him?

273
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,487
I feel safe with him.

274
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,993
Many people are safe due to you.
They call you the Good Samaritan.

275
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,037
I didn't save anyone. The pilot did.

276
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:39,298
You saved me.

277
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:42,771
I was upside down, stuck. He got me out.

278
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:43,867
How?

279
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:45,241
And a baby too.

280
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,772
He found a way out for a lot of people.

281
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,779
We would've been fried.

282
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,508
What about the baby?

283
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,919
Get out of the road!

284
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,073
You can't do it!

285
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,371
You want to kill me, but you can't!

286
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:11,581
These images of death and destruction
fLashed around the nation recentLy...

287
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:14,720
...when InterCity 202 feLL from the sky.

288
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,363
The story is by now famiLiar.

289
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:21,858
A hydrauLic faiLure on a routine fLight
from San Francisco to Houston.

290
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:25,662
A desperate attempt to reach
BakersfieLd Airport...

291
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:30,068
...before the metaL giant pLowed
into the corn beside a quiet country road.

292
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,668
WaLking through this devastation...

293
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:35,715
...one couLd not heLp but refLect
on what it means to us...

294
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,250
...to those who Lived,
to those who heLped...

295
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,415
...and to those who mourned.

296
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,144
You and that computer.

297
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:12,343
You spend more time playing with it
than producing anything.

298
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:15,185
- Relax. Will you just relax?
- I'm fine.

299
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:19,157
You hear that?

300
00:28:20,427 --> 00:28:23,521
This is a very important meeting.
I need you to calm down.

301
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:25,826
I need you to be with me. All right?

302
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,833
God, you're such a neurotic.

303
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,375
Something's not right.

304
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:58,321
Oh, shit!

305
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:05,630
This is the captain.
Return to your seats.

306
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:08,037
Put your tabLes up
and fasten your seatbeLts.

307
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:10,467
Ladies and gentlemen, please be sure...

308
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,543
...to fasten your seatbelts
tightly around your waist.

309
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,907
The flight attendants will be coming
to collect your trays.

310
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:29,694
I don't think this is turbulence.

311
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:33,558
The hydraulics!

312
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,529
He can't steer!

313
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,100
We're going down!

314
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,068
Miss!

315
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:22,745
Come here!

316
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:23,748
I'm okay.

317
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:26,616
Miss!

318
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:27,846
Miss, come here!

319
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:28,853
Come here!

320
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:31,755
The fucking belt won't work.
It won't get tight enough!

321
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:38,895
Just hold him in your lap.
That's what you're supposed to do anyway.

322
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:41,629
Just keep your belt on and hold him.

323
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:42,690
He'll be okay.

324
00:30:42,902 --> 00:30:44,870
He's slipping! He's slipping!

325
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,739
He'll be okay.

326
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:55,774
I love you.

327
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,111
I need high-heeled shoes.

328
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,754
Remove all sharp objects.

329
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:11,693
Earrings. Sharp objects.

330
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,166
Sir, your pin. You must remove your pin.

331
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:18,898
You okay?

332
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,703
It's going to be fine.

333
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:29,037
Ma'am, you need to remove your glasses.
Take your glasses off your face.

334
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:31,577
You must take your glasses off your face...

335
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,243
...and put them in the bag.

336
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:35,684
It's unsafe to keep your glasses on.

337
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:41,022
All sharp objects to the center.

338
00:31:59,212 --> 00:32:00,509
This is it.

339
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,579
This is the moment of your death.

340
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:16,294
I'm not afraid.

341
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:20,456
I have no fear.

342
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,827
You know what time it is?

343
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:58,704
It's a fucking tomb in here.

344
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:07,336
Get up.

345
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,307
Get up, Carla.

346
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,117
Get up.

347
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,549
The doctor brought someone.

348
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:16,781
The Good Samaritan.

349
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,955
Come on, you read about him in the paper.

350
00:33:21,594 --> 00:33:23,255
Please, just let me die.

351
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,187
Please.

352
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:29,625
That's a sin, Carla.

353
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,003
I just want to die.

354
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,953
I appreciate you coming.

355
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,520
She's in bad shape.
I may put her in the hospital.

356
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,062
She's in a severe depression
about the crash, but she won't talk.

357
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,669
She's very Catholic.

358
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:07,163
Old World.

359
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:09,502
Full of guilt and shame.

360
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:13,344
I'm filled with guilt and shame.

361
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:15,376
How is that Old World?

362
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:19,209
You think I'm a fraud, don't you?

363
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:22,516
In the three months
since we flew together...

364
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,579
...I haven't thought about you at all.

365
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:30,926
She'll be right out.

366
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,062
Did you do this?

367
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,156
The carving?

368
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:38,099
Yeah, the whole bit.
I was playing, you know.

369
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:39,933
Beautiful work.

370
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,374
- You're an architect, right?
- Yes.

371
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,418
I better go get her.

372
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,589
It's better if I see her alone.

373
00:34:58,758 --> 00:34:59,986
You know...

374
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,093
...one crash freak to another.

375
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,428
Second door on the right.

376
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:48,737
- Have a seat, Doc.
- Thanks.

377
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:54,945
He and your wife are the only survivors
I can't reach.

378
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:58,244
She won't talk and he won't admit
the crash was bad.

379
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,046
Is that right?

380
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,843
He says it was good?

381
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:05,614
Says it was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

382
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,633
When I was 13...

383
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,903
...my father died in front of my eyes.

384
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:28,039
We were going out of our apartment.

385
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:31,244
I was throwing this...

386
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:35,079
...this softball up and down.

387
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,588
Mom screamed, I missed the ball,
turned to look...

388
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:44,426
...Dad was dead on the sidewalk.

389
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,360
Blood was coming out of his nose.

390
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,061
His legs were all twisted under him.

391
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:56,535
He looked like somebody...

392
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:01,980
...with a big hand had reached down
and squeezed the life out of him.

393
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:06,245
That was God.

394
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:08,377
That's what I thought.

395
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,654
God killed my daddy.

396
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,723
Why would He want to kill him?

397
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:22,262
Couldn't figure that out.

398
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,803
He was a religious guy...

399
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:30,267
...hard working...

400
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:32,208
...kind to my mother and my sister.

401
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,511
Did you love him?

402
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:39,607
Yes.

403
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:45,822
I didn't know why God killed my daddy.
There was no reason to.

404
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:49,585
So...

405
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:52,489
...I decided...

406
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,163
...there was no God.

407
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:07,938
You know...

408
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:11,310
...I go to church every day.

409
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:16,018
It's the only place I go.

410
00:38:24,063 --> 00:38:26,088
I go to pray for my baby's soul.

411
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,828
You go there to talk to God.

412
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,331
Got to talk to somebody.

413
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:38,175
The day we got home...

414
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:41,636
...all these lawyers called,
wanting our case.

415
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:46,608
And one guy came to see me, saying
he was a Good Samaritan's lawyer...

416
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,144
...so I signed.

417
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,656
I mean, I figured he'd be the best. Right?

418
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:59,028
'Cause I need someone
who's going to take it to them.

419
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:03,592
We're going to church.

420
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,577
I think that'll be okay.

421
00:40:30,022 --> 00:40:31,512
You know He hurt me.

422
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:38,762
He hurt me forever.

423
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:47,200
But I still believe in Him.

424
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:51,607
People...

425
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:55,943
...don't so much believe in God
as they choose not to believe in nothing.

426
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:01,711
Life and death...

427
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:05,188
...they happen for no reason.
We may think that...

428
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:08,053
...people are born
because their mothers wanted them...

429
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,652
...or because God needed
another home-run hitter for the Giants.

430
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:14,022
We think that we die...

431
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,795
...because we eat red meat or rob banks.

432
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,965
Though we can never be good enough...

433
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:25,272
...or careful enough to live forever,
at least we can try.

434
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,638
But if it makes no sense, if it...

435
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:31,177
If life and death just happen...

436
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,548
...then there's no reason to do anything.

437
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,545
There's no reason to love.

438
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:39,081
What?

439
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,156
There's no reason to love.

440
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,508
My car's across the street.
Let's go for a drive.

441
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,507
No. No, I can't.
The doctor told me I can't go nowhere.

442
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,008
You'll be safe.

443
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:04,876
Do you read the papers?

444
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:06,813
Everybody with me lives.

445
00:42:09,522 --> 00:42:11,615
You must think I'm very stupid.

446
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,348
No. I'm not lying.

447
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:16,354
I can't explain it but...

448
00:42:17,396 --> 00:42:19,091
...you're safe with me.

449
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:23,926
So, what are you telling me?
There's no God, but there's you?

450
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:28,867
Come with me.

451
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:32,374
Carla, I promise you'll be safe.

452
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:46,213
This is a German car?

453
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:47,516
Swedish.

454
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:49,087
It's very sturdy?

455
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,718
It's a very safe car.

456
00:42:52,164 --> 00:42:55,190
And I'm an excellent driver.
Never been in an accident.

457
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:58,899
Not while I've been behind the wheel,
anyway.

458
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:02,502
- And you know what?
- What?

459
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:05,308
It doesn't mean we'll survive this ride.

460
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,671
Because even if I do everything right...

461
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,483
...even strapped into this marvelous
technology of reinforced doors and roof...

462
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:14,177
...we could still be crushed.

463
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:15,811
That's reverse psychology, right?

464
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,379
No, it's the simple truth.

465
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,450
In fact you're not safe lying in your bed.

466
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:27,422
Remember '89? The next one could be
ten times worse.

467
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:33,934
You said I'd be safe with you.

468
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:35,132
You're safe.

469
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:38,001
We're safe because we died already.

470
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:43,942
Stop the car.

471
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:46,644
Please, just stop the car.

472
00:43:49,054 --> 00:43:50,316
I'm not dead.

473
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:52,883
Let me out.

474
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:55,290
No, you're not. That's not what I meant.

475
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:57,294
Look.

476
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,324
Look at them.

477
00:44:00,165 --> 00:44:03,134
They don't know what's it's like
to die in their heads.

478
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:05,460
We do. We passed through death.

479
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:11,807
That's bullshit.

480
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,606
I didn't die in my head.

481
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,206
My son died.

482
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,677
I wasn't thinking about dying.

483
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,915
I was thinking about...

484
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:24,280
About what?

485
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:26,188
About how he died?

486
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:38,491
Now hit him. Hit him, now!

487
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:42,058
Hit him. Right now!

488
00:45:42,134 --> 00:45:43,999
Two in a row. Awesome.

489
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:46,393
I'll die!

490
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,699
Don't die, we'll get "game over."

491
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:50,575
- I died.
- Let me try.

492
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:54,142
I got to Level 3.

493
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:55,473
Then he died.

494
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:58,712
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

495
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:01,547
Byron's dad called.
He wants to bring him over later.

496
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,210
Do I have to play with him?

497
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:08,221
That's the weird kid your dad saved?

498
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:11,694
He comes here practically every day
and hangs around my dad.

499
00:46:13,132 --> 00:46:14,156
Go.

500
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:21,132
Hi, darling.

501
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:24,037
I didn't know you were home.

502
00:46:25,944 --> 00:46:28,242
- Did you meet with Dr. Perlman?
- Yeah.

503
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:31,107
- Did you talk?
- No.

504
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:36,481
He took me to meet a woman
whose child died in the crash.

505
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:40,919
I thought the idea was for the two of you
to sit down and talk, one-to-one.

506
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:45,319
I have a feeling
of overwhelming love for her.

507
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,768
I've never felt anything like it before.

508
00:46:57,176 --> 00:46:58,973
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

509
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:01,111
...a little run, a little run!

510
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:04,376
Slide here.

511
00:47:09,655 --> 00:47:11,623
Slide, slide, slide.

512
00:47:19,364 --> 00:47:20,524
Change your hands.

513
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:22,324
Go, skip.

514
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:25,702
Change your hands.

515
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:38,081
Okay, Joan, stop the music.

516
00:47:38,517 --> 00:47:40,712
Let's rehearse the piece for the pageant.

517
00:47:40,786 --> 00:47:42,310
But we don't have Eric.

518
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:44,514
- No, we don't.
- That's right, we don't.

519
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:48,721
We need a volunteer.

520
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,219
Dr. Perlman, perhaps?

521
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:54,290
Me?

522
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:55,664
I don't...

523
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:57,099
I don't think... No.

524
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,597
Couldn't you get someone else?

525
00:48:04,376 --> 00:48:06,435
We need a male. Do you mind?

526
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,207
- What do I have to do?
- A tree.

527
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:10,440
Just a tree.

528
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,506
Just have to stand here. Like this.

529
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:16,350
Come on, Doctor. It'll be good therapy.

530
00:48:19,057 --> 00:48:21,719
Okay, girls. Hold hands all around him.

531
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:25,620
Joan, some wind music.

532
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,825
Swirling around like a tornado.

533
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:30,628
And go in!

534
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:36,664
Doctor, the tree has leaves and branches.

535
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:38,766
Come on, up. Up with your arms.

536
00:48:39,478 --> 00:48:43,209
Come on, up with your arms.
And feel the wind. Swing at the wind!

537
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:45,006
Come on, Doctor.

538
00:48:47,586 --> 00:48:48,678
Well...

539
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:50,852
...is that your revenge?

540
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:58,460
Look, it's getting worse.

541
00:48:58,864 --> 00:49:00,923
He's more remote and distant than ever.

542
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:04,935
He's spending more time with the child
from the plane than with his own son.

543
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:08,738
And I hate that crazy truth-telling,
like a robot.

544
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,472
What does he do every day?

545
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:14,739
He looks at buildings.

546
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:16,040
Looks at buildings?

547
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:17,979
I don't mind that. I think...

548
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,878
...he might be finding
something new for his work.

549
00:49:22,854 --> 00:49:24,879
I want to know about this woman.

550
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:30,291
Why did you introduce them?
What were you trying to achieve?

551
00:49:30,562 --> 00:49:34,828
No one can reach her. If she doesn't
get help, she'll end up in an institution.

552
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,056
Or worse.

553
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:37,427
And my husband?

554
00:49:39,004 --> 00:49:40,301
He worries me.

555
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:41,361
Why?

556
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:43,733
I don't know.

557
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,309
I think he thinks he's invulnerable.

558
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:49,671
I've seen it with Vietnam vets.

559
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:53,079
The high they get
from overcoming their fear...

560
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,351
...they become addicted to it.
I thought if I put them together...

561
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,152
They can help each other?

562
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:01,886
I don't know.

563
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:06,827
He said he felt overwhelming feeling
of love for her.

564
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:10,134
A feeling he never felt before.

565
00:50:11,103 --> 00:50:13,731
What does that mean?
Is he falling in love with her?

566
00:50:15,073 --> 00:50:16,734
Not in a rational way.

567
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,508
Love isn't rational.

568
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:20,471
It's not love.

569
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:22,712
He wants to save her.

570
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,105
Save her?

571
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:26,843
And who's saving Max?
Or me, for that matter?

572
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:30,583
Are you playing God?
Are you playing matchmaker?

573
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,321
What are you trying to achieve,
Dr. Perlman?

574
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,123
Trying to help, that's all.

575
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:39,760
I don't have all the answers.

576
00:50:52,244 --> 00:50:54,735
Can't wait to see what you're working on.

577
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:12,019
I'm going to bed now.

578
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,705
Would you turn that down?

579
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:53,270
- I haven't taken one in six days.
- Didn't I tell you?

580
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:54,896
I feel great. Thanks.

581
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:57,669
He chickened out
half a mile from the airport.

582
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,309
Good to see you.

583
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:04,972
It's great that you came.

584
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:09,743
Everybody, we're going to go downstairs.
You come with me, Carla.

585
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:11,254
Everybody downstairs.

586
00:52:11,323 --> 00:52:12,312
Come on.

587
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:14,686
You wait here, Manny.

588
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,991
It's okay. It's all right.

589
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:19,928
I'll be upstairs.

590
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:27,132
We used to live in tribes.

591
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:31,099
And when a tribe suffered a disaster...

592
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:34,969
...an exploding mountain,
a shaking of the earth...

593
00:52:36,348 --> 00:52:37,781
...a great flood...

594
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,608
...we would sit around fires...

595
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:42,850
...and we'd tell the event.

596
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:45,456
The stories of death...

597
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:47,853
...destruction...

598
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:50,023
...escape and rescue.

599
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:55,061
That's... why we're here today.

600
00:52:58,904 --> 00:53:00,166
Would someone...

601
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:03,000
...tell us their story?

602
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:08,938
Yes, please.

603
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:14,846
I lost my sister...

604
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:17,713
...and my two nephews.

605
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,515
Their seats were ripped away...

606
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:26,627
...right in front of my eyes.
I could almost reach out...

607
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:28,730
It's all right.

608
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,563
Let her stay on her own.

609
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:32,259
This'll take forever.

610
00:53:33,205 --> 00:53:35,196
I have to go back to the office.

611
00:53:35,307 --> 00:53:36,296
What's your name?

612
00:53:36,374 --> 00:53:37,807
John Wilkenson.

613
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:41,845
- Why were you on the plane?
- I was going to Houston on business.

614
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,439
You must be very committed to your work.

615
00:53:48,086 --> 00:53:50,452
Go ahead and finish your story, please.

616
00:53:52,991 --> 00:53:55,926
We were taking a vacation, my sister...

617
00:53:56,061 --> 00:53:57,528
...me and our kids.

618
00:53:57,996 --> 00:53:59,793
You know, no husbands.

619
00:54:01,399 --> 00:54:05,062
We saw all the dumb tourist sights
together, like when we were girls.

620
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,934
Only this time, we were also mommies.

621
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:14,977
And now we'll never be together again.

622
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:19,239
Let's just talk about the day of the crash.

623
00:54:20,252 --> 00:54:22,083
What happened when the plane hit?

624
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:25,950
I don't know.

625
00:54:29,361 --> 00:54:31,056
I guess I closed my eyes.

626
00:54:31,796 --> 00:54:33,661
There was incredible noise...

627
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:35,866
...and I couldn't see.

628
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:37,764
I was choking on the smoke.

629
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:40,697
I didn't think that we had long to live.

630
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,407
And then that man...

631
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:44,834
Is he here?

632
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:47,738
Are you here, Max Klein?

633
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:53,314
He couldn't come.

634
00:54:54,853 --> 00:54:56,184
He saved my life.

635
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:57,844
How?

636
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:04,553
We couldn't see anything
and it was all smoke.

637
00:55:04,629 --> 00:55:08,121
We couldn't even breathe
and I heard the sound of his voice.

638
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:11,532
He was shouting:

639
00:55:11,736 --> 00:55:13,328
"Follow me! This way!"

640
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:17,365
I had hold of my kids
and I just followed his voice.

641
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:22,203
He sounded so normal.

642
00:55:24,983 --> 00:55:26,678
"Follow me to the light!"

643
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:30,916
I was scared...

644
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,784
...but I saw him jump...

645
00:55:34,893 --> 00:55:36,224
...and call out:

646
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:39,991
"We're alive!"

647
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:43,500
So I followed and...

648
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:46,497
...then we were in the corn field.

649
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:47,895
Safe.

650
00:55:49,074 --> 00:55:51,099
I would have gone the wrong way.

651
00:55:52,444 --> 00:55:54,537
I came here today hoping to thank him.

652
00:55:55,113 --> 00:55:56,774
The same thing happened to me.

653
00:55:57,048 --> 00:55:58,379
I followed him too.

654
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,179
Excuse me, are you leaving us?

655
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:01,917
I don't belong here.

656
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,351
I wasn't on the plane.

657
00:56:03,588 --> 00:56:04,748
Who are you?

658
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:07,851
My son died in the crash. I'm sorry.

659
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,253
No, it's okay. It's all right.
Why did you come?

660
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:14,992
I don't know.

661
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:17,159
I wanted...

662
00:56:18,036 --> 00:56:20,027
...if anyone had seen my son...

663
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:22,829
...or knew how...

664
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:26,302
- What was his name?
- Where was he sitting?

665
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:28,573
They said he was in 21C.

666
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,376
That was right behind me.

667
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:34,943
Did he have red hair?

668
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:37,446
Yes. Kind of reddish brown.

669
00:56:38,323 --> 00:56:39,881
- Tall man?
- Six feet.

670
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:41,548
And a moustache?

671
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:42,856
Yes.

672
00:56:43,795 --> 00:56:45,057
You mean me.

673
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,762
Remember? We talked at the hospital.

674
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,500
We were on the other side of the plane.

675
00:56:52,937 --> 00:56:54,029
Sorry.

676
00:56:54,472 --> 00:56:56,599
Since it happened, I get confused.

677
00:56:59,744 --> 00:57:01,644
Anyone else remember that row?

678
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:04,506
21C was three rows ahead of me.

679
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:06,746
They were smashed flat.

680
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:08,284
Can anyone else help?

681
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,115
Go ahead, say something.

682
00:57:11,923 --> 00:57:14,414
- Anyone else have information?
- Stop it.

683
00:57:16,027 --> 00:57:17,517
Just let her go.

684
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:19,187
Why?

685
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,697
This isn't doing anybody any good.

686
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:25,565
She only wants to know what happened.

687
00:57:25,637 --> 00:57:27,070
My son died.

688
00:57:27,172 --> 00:57:29,299
Yes, but you know how he died.

689
00:57:29,974 --> 00:57:31,407
You were with him.

690
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:37,107
When was the last time you saw your son?

691
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:39,445
His birthday, about a month before.

692
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:42,683
I don't remember kissing him good-bye.

693
00:57:42,854 --> 00:57:45,345
I know I did, but I just can't remember.

694
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,819
You're very young.

695
00:57:51,262 --> 00:57:52,388
I'm not young.

696
00:57:53,498 --> 00:57:55,090
How old was your boy?

697
00:57:57,302 --> 00:57:58,826
He was almost two.

698
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:00,730
I'm sorry.

699
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:02,466
He wasn't with you very long.

700
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,666
Jesus Christ!

701
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:06,608
This is sadistic.
And we're not accomplishing anything!

702
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:17,516
Do you remember me?

703
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:20,113
I'm Lisa. The flight attendant.

704
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:28,728
I really wanted to see you.

705
00:58:30,635 --> 00:58:33,069
I came here mostly to see you.

706
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:38,935
I think about you and your baby a lot.

707
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:45,305
Do you remember how I tried to help you
with the seat belt?

708
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:47,543
Help me?

709
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:52,380
You told me everything would be okay.
You think you helped me?

710
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:54,852
Well, I tried.

711
00:58:54,959 --> 00:58:56,119
Tried!

712
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:59,156
You told me to hold him. I couldn't.

713
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:01,723
You told me everything would be okay.

714
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:02,458
It wasn't!

715
00:59:02,534 --> 00:59:03,660
Please, don't say that.

716
00:59:03,735 --> 00:59:04,724
I didn't...

717
00:59:05,703 --> 00:59:06,727
I didn't know!

718
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:08,237
You didn't know what?

719
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:09,503
Please.

720
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:10,973
You told me to hold him.

721
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:13,272
- You knew I couldn't!
- It's not my fault!

722
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:15,175
We're not here to blame each other.

723
00:59:15,246 --> 00:59:17,305
You said everything would be okay...

724
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:18,610
...and it wasn't!

725
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:19,842
He died!

726
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,553
You want everybody to talk.

727
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,521
But only if it's nice things.

728
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:32,062
No, that's not true.

729
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:35,091
My son died!

730
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:37,791
And blaming her won't bring
your baby back.

731
00:59:51,649 --> 00:59:53,674
Of course they think it's fair.

732
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:56,186
So what? What do you think?

733
00:59:58,222 --> 00:59:59,587
I'm being fucked.

734
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:03,124
The big law firms are getting
much more for their clients.

735
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,723
I'll get another lawyer.

736
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:10,030
Mr. Brillstein, I heard a woman got
$2 million for her dead baby.

737
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,296
I think I should get at least that.

738
01:00:14,205 --> 01:00:16,537
I'll call you. I'll call you every day.

739
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:18,499
Good-bye.

740
01:00:24,148 --> 01:00:25,638
You have to understand...

741
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,545
...they owe us. They kill them
and they have to pay.

742
01:00:28,686 --> 01:00:31,018
You don't understand a fucking thing!

743
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:33,790
I understand, Manny.

744
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:36,256
I understand that I'm alone.

745
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:44,100
So, pain and suffering are compensabLe.

746
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:48,072
Apart from the other compensable losses
such as...

747
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:51,199
...the $2-million Nutty Nick stores contract.

748
01:00:51,342 --> 01:00:52,832
We didn't have a contract.

749
01:00:53,578 --> 01:00:55,546
- Whose side are you on?
- Relax.

750
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:58,810
Don't tell me to relax. You have a husband
and a partnership insurance.

751
01:00:58,883 --> 01:00:59,815
I have...

752
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:02,114
...a deposition from...

753
01:01:02,186 --> 01:01:03,744
...Mr. Nutty Nick...

754
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:07,585
...that he had every intention...

755
01:01:08,092 --> 01:01:10,720
...of hiring Mr. Gordon and Mr. Klein.

756
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:11,921
That's good enough.

757
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:13,361
He's lying.

758
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:14,964
It's nice, but he's lying.

759
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:16,125
All right.

760
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:18,062
Do me a favor.

761
01:01:18,703 --> 01:01:19,965
Don't say that.

762
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:23,062
They don't have to know your opinion,
okay?

763
01:01:24,676 --> 01:01:26,701
Work with me on this, Mr. Klein.

764
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:28,237
I'm sorry.

765
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:31,372
You promised to do your best
for Mrs. Gordon and her children.

766
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:33,313
You get a third of what we get?

767
01:01:33,418 --> 01:01:34,817
I know. I'm terrible.

768
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:38,046
One-third is standard, Mr. Klein.

769
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,187
It's in my interest to get
as large a settlement as possible.

770
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,955
In fact, that's my job.

771
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:45,718
I don't apologize for it.

772
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:49,233
No, this is America in the '90s.
Nobody apologizes anymore.

773
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:50,866
They write a memoir.

774
01:01:52,103 --> 01:01:55,072
This is the law. Not some trick I invented.

775
01:01:55,406 --> 01:01:59,502
Each minute that you and Mr. Gordon
knew that you were going to die...

776
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,840
...is compensable as pain and suffering.

777
01:02:01,946 --> 01:02:02,935
Testify...

778
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:04,848
...to the mental anguish...

779
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:07,043
...that you and Mr. Gordon experienced...

780
01:02:07,118 --> 01:02:09,518
...and each minute is worth dollars.

781
01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:13,617
Big dollars. Dollars to which
you and Mrs. Gordon are entitled.

782
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,793
What you really want me to say...

783
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:20,964
...is that Jeff wept at the prospect
of his wife widowed and kids orphaned.

784
01:02:21,132 --> 01:02:24,898
It's a shame he died instantly.
If only he'd been mashed up and died...

785
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:26,493
...slowly in my arms, Nan...

786
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:27,538
Jesus, Max!

787
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:28,902
...could make out on this.

788
01:02:28,973 --> 01:02:30,440
Fine. Good night.

789
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:37,705
Are you ashamed of me?

790
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:42,642
I'm trying to get money, so I don't meet
your standards of widowhood?

791
01:02:43,354 --> 01:02:46,380
Let me ask you something.
If Jeff was here, what would he do?

792
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:49,119
Come on, Max, tell me.

793
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:51,185
I can't lie.

794
01:02:51,262 --> 01:02:55,596
If you died and he had lived, what would
he say to help Laura and Jonah?

795
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:59,495
I know he ripped you off for the tickets.

796
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:00,502
Maybe!

797
01:03:00,671 --> 01:03:01,729
Maybe he'd pay him back.

798
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:03,364
Are you punishing Jeff?

799
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:10,240
I'll say what you want.

800
01:04:26,858 --> 01:04:27,916
Let it go.

801
01:04:29,861 --> 01:04:31,192
I can Let it go.

802
01:05:17,808 --> 01:05:19,537
I can't live as a coward.

803
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:21,703
Oh, fuck.

804
01:06:23,507 --> 01:06:26,601
So I argued that it wasn't fair to us
and he agreed.

805
01:06:26,744 --> 01:06:28,939
He just said, "Life is unfair."

806
01:06:29,246 --> 01:06:33,080
So now the test's next week
and it's on Europe, not Central America.

807
01:06:33,317 --> 01:06:35,012
I think he proved his own point.

808
01:06:35,086 --> 01:06:37,145
Yeah, that's what I thought.

809
01:06:42,626 --> 01:06:44,491
What'd you do today, Dad?

810
01:06:49,967 --> 01:06:51,059
Go ahead.

811
01:06:53,871 --> 01:06:54,895
Tell him.

812
01:06:56,007 --> 01:06:57,804
What? What'd you do?

813
01:07:05,516 --> 01:07:06,642
Talk to me.

814
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:10,878
Tell me what's going on.

815
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,116
Talk to me!

816
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:25,765
Each day you have to jump off a roof
or stand before a train to lose your fear?

817
01:07:25,836 --> 01:07:26,928
Is that it?

818
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:29,466
What about me?

819
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:31,274
What about Jonah?

820
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:34,204
- You're like a crazy person.
- I'm not crazy.

821
01:07:36,614 --> 01:07:39,708
I love you. We have lived together
for 16 years!

822
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:41,984
They've been great.

823
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:43,882
Oh, not always.

824
01:07:44,388 --> 01:07:45,855
Yes. Always.

825
01:07:47,058 --> 01:07:49,253
They've always been great for me.

826
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:51,895
Even when I hate you, I know love you.

827
01:07:57,868 --> 01:07:59,597
I know you were happy too.

828
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,061
Remember?

829
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,989
Do you remember our marriage?

830
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:28,094
Even if I could remember, then what?

831
01:08:31,102 --> 01:08:32,899
How can I live in a memory?

832
01:08:34,305 --> 01:08:35,704
You see, that's cruel.

833
01:08:35,873 --> 01:08:38,273
- Do you know that's cruel?
- That's the truth.

834
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:39,500
The truth?

835
01:08:39,844 --> 01:08:41,869
You didn't tell Jonah the truth.

836
01:08:43,447 --> 01:08:45,540
It was unfair to use him that way.

837
01:08:45,816 --> 01:08:46,783
Fair?

838
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:49,681
Am I supposed to let you kill yourself?

839
01:08:50,654 --> 01:08:52,485
I walked away from that crash alive.

840
01:08:52,556 --> 01:08:56,151
That's what survived.
The taste and touch and beauty of life.

841
01:08:56,227 --> 01:08:57,125
But I love that.

842
01:08:57,194 --> 01:08:59,992
- I won't give that up!
- I don't want you to give it up!

843
01:09:00,898 --> 01:09:02,126
Let me in.

844
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:04,925
Let me be part of it.

845
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:08,296
You can't.

846
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:13,342
- I wish I'd been on that plane.
- I'm grateful you weren't.

847
01:09:13,444 --> 01:09:17,278
You don't make sense. You said
it was extraordinary, so beautiful.

848
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:20,474
You're right. I don't make sense
and I don't want to.

849
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:29,283
I know that what you found is...

850
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,919
...special, whatever it is,
and wherever it leads you, it's thrilling.

851
01:09:36,066 --> 01:09:37,693
But there must be a way...

852
01:09:38,669 --> 01:09:41,137
...to live with it so it does make sense.

853
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:48,172
I'm going to survive this.

854
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:54,474
I can't fight for you anymore. You want
to destroy yourself? I can't stop you.

855
01:09:57,087 --> 01:09:58,520
I hope you make it.

856
01:10:41,398 --> 01:10:43,025
You been dreaming a lot?

857
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,359
- You bet.
- Me too.

858
01:10:48,105 --> 01:10:49,800
Were you alone on the plane?

859
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,500
No, I was with my best friend. My partner.

860
01:10:53,944 --> 01:10:55,377
He was decapitated.

861
01:10:58,249 --> 01:10:59,409
You saw him?

862
01:11:08,425 --> 01:11:09,892
I should be going.

863
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,325
Thanks for coming.

864
01:11:17,434 --> 01:11:18,731
You know, if...

865
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:22,262
If Manny has any interest
in doing carpentry full time...

866
01:11:22,339 --> 01:11:24,307
...I could talk to some people.

867
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:27,375
They'd be happy to work
with somebody like him.

868
01:11:28,312 --> 01:11:30,109
Don't talk about my husband.

869
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:32,070
Sorry.

870
01:11:33,117 --> 01:11:36,348
No, it's all right.
I'm angry with him, that's all.

871
01:11:41,725 --> 01:11:43,283
Don't look so scared.

872
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:45,024
I'm not scared.

873
01:11:45,596 --> 01:11:47,359
I'm not scared of anything.

874
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:49,565
Scared to kiss me.

875
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,258
I just did kiss you.

876
01:11:51,402 --> 01:11:52,767
I mean, for real.

877
01:11:55,005 --> 01:11:56,836
I didn't want to offend you.

878
01:12:01,378 --> 01:12:02,504
You're right.

879
01:12:04,048 --> 01:12:05,811
I don't want to be kissed.

880
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,808
I don't want anything.

881
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:19,125
But I do want to go with you
next time you take a drive.

882
01:12:34,878 --> 01:12:36,209
I'm missing it.

883
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,279
Look at this show!

884
01:12:38,349 --> 01:12:39,611
It's beautiful.

885
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:49,020
Kate is so serious, isn't she?

886
01:12:50,394 --> 01:12:51,383
Oh, look!

887
01:12:51,762 --> 01:12:52,990
Adorable!

888
01:12:54,732 --> 01:12:55,721
Bravo!

889
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:00,161
Beautiful!

890
01:13:03,107 --> 01:13:05,098
Wonderful! Wonderful!

891
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:07,771
Wonderful!

892
01:13:39,243 --> 01:13:41,040
FoLks, this is the captain here.

893
01:13:41,111 --> 01:13:44,911
We're going to make an emergency Landing
at BakersfieLd Airport.

894
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,275
Fasten your seatbeLts before touchdown.
At that time...

895
01:13:48,352 --> 01:13:51,446
...you'LL hear me say the words,
"Brace, brace, brace."

896
01:13:51,522 --> 01:13:54,958
Hi, this is Nan. I'LL caLLyou back
as soon as possibLe.

897
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:58,925
Get into the crash positions
which your cabin attendants wiLL iLLustrate.

898
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:03,827
I'm not going to kid you,
it's going to be rough...

899
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:06,225
...maybe worse than that.

900
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,461
Pay attention to what
the cabin attendants say.

901
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,607
Good Luck to us aLL.

902
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:29,853
- May we be excused?
- Bring a bag of chips.

903
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:33,528
Let's play computer games.

904
01:14:34,698 --> 01:14:35,858
Let them go.

905
01:14:35,966 --> 01:14:38,526
It's a mistake to make them
anything but hamburgers.

906
01:14:38,602 --> 01:14:40,832
Next time we'll have relish and ketchup.

907
01:14:42,206 --> 01:14:45,004
What can you do? I don't mind,
as long as they're happy.

908
01:14:45,075 --> 01:14:47,737
If we'll have Thanksgiving, let's do it right.

909
01:14:51,315 --> 01:14:53,146
Max, don't play superdad.

910
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,012
Byron, honey, no.

911
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,653
Give me this. Give me this.

912
01:15:01,725 --> 01:15:04,091
- This is garbage.
- What're you doing?

913
01:15:04,161 --> 01:15:05,526
Go back to the table and finish!

914
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:07,928
- Max, calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.

915
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:10,226
Listen to me. I'm throwing this out.

916
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:12,801
When you die, you don't get another life.

917
01:15:13,604 --> 01:15:16,539
- Do you understand?
- It's not real dying. It's pretend.

918
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,871
- I know what dead bodies look like.
- Shut up!

919
01:15:18,976 --> 01:15:20,409
It's going in the garbage.

920
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:24,037
- He's only a little boy.
- Lf it was up to you, he'd stay a boy.

921
01:15:24,114 --> 01:15:25,206
I don't care!

922
01:15:25,282 --> 01:15:26,510
Don't be cruel.

923
01:15:27,084 --> 01:15:30,178
I don't want him to grow up
a frightened child in a man's body.

924
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:31,687
He's just fine, Max.

925
01:15:31,755 --> 01:15:33,450
It's you who is in trouble!

926
01:15:33,524 --> 01:15:34,957
Now give the game back.

927
01:15:35,058 --> 01:15:37,788
Or keep on going,
but right out of our lives!

928
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:42,523
Our son is innocent.
Do you want to crash our marriage?

929
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:45,458
Okay, but don't hurt our son.

930
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,970
I'm not scared to end our marriage.

931
01:15:50,073 --> 01:15:51,267
Neither am I.

932
01:15:53,477 --> 01:15:55,172
Then I'll keep on going.

933
01:15:58,148 --> 01:15:59,274
Good.

934
01:16:57,207 --> 01:16:59,437
- Where to?
- Beautiful downtown Oakland.

935
01:17:44,855 --> 01:17:46,049
Such a shame.

936
01:17:47,658 --> 01:17:51,355
It was going to be gentrified and rebuilt.
Then the recession hit.

937
01:17:52,062 --> 01:17:53,927
The country's falling apart.

938
01:17:55,799 --> 01:17:58,597
The United States is finished.
But you and me...

939
01:17:58,735 --> 01:18:00,430
...we're in peak condition.

940
01:18:19,756 --> 01:18:20,882
You hungry?

941
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:23,451
In there?

942
01:18:24,027 --> 01:18:26,018
Remember, we're ghosts.

943
01:18:26,997 --> 01:18:29,090
They can't do anything to us.

944
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:31,860
You're really nuts. You are so crazy.

945
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,266
You should talk.

946
01:18:51,555 --> 01:18:54,922
I can't believe you did that!
I'm not buying you another.

947
01:18:55,392 --> 01:18:57,019
Look at this mess.

948
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,319
I've had it. We're going home.

949
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:00,587
So happy.

950
01:20:12,135 --> 01:20:13,625
Maybe I am a ghost.

951
01:20:29,986 --> 01:20:32,386
I was going to buy him a lot of presents.

952
01:20:37,761 --> 01:20:39,729
Let's do it. Let's buy them.

953
01:20:39,863 --> 01:20:41,387
What did he like?

954
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:44,396
How about a sword?

955
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:47,698
My son used to love swords.
He still does, but he's too old to admit it.

956
01:20:47,771 --> 01:20:50,001
- What?
- What would your son like?

957
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:54,369
Does he play with Legos?
No, he's too young.

958
01:20:55,745 --> 01:20:58,009
Bristle Blocks? Does he have those?

959
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:00,777
Babies can use them
and older kids like them.

960
01:21:00,884 --> 01:21:02,977
You want me to buy a present for Bubble?

961
01:21:03,186 --> 01:21:05,017
Bubble. Is that really his name?

962
01:21:05,121 --> 01:21:07,351
It's Leonardo. I called him Bubble.

963
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:09,884
I can't buy him gifts. That's sick.

964
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:12,291
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

965
01:21:12,896 --> 01:21:15,126
- Of course he's dead.
- You're not serious.

966
01:21:15,599 --> 01:21:17,464
You wouldn't do this to me.

967
01:21:17,868 --> 01:21:20,166
Would you buy a present
for your dead father?

968
01:21:22,305 --> 01:21:23,363
My father?

969
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:26,768
I never bought him anything.

970
01:21:28,345 --> 01:21:29,403
I'm sorry.

971
01:21:30,413 --> 01:21:33,177
I didn't mean it. I just don't think
it's a good idea.

972
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,115
I made him something in school.

973
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:36,913
Carved his name in wood.

974
01:21:36,987 --> 01:21:40,479
Made a little nameplate
that you put on your desk.

975
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:43,955
I was 13 when he died and...

976
01:21:45,362 --> 01:21:47,922
...never had a chance to buy him
a real present.

977
01:21:48,298 --> 01:21:49,424
Let's do it.

978
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,729
Let's buy presents for the dead.

979
01:21:52,235 --> 01:21:54,499
Come on. Let's buy presents for the dead.

980
01:21:54,804 --> 01:21:56,635
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

981
01:21:56,706 --> 01:21:57,832
Come on!

982
01:21:58,842 --> 01:22:00,605
Who'll we give them to?

983
01:22:03,914 --> 01:22:07,850
He liked to build things: Shelves, chairs.
He made our dining-room table.

984
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:11,144
Sometimes he'd give me a hammer,
let me do the easy stuff.

985
01:22:15,759 --> 01:22:18,091
This is it. This is what he'd like.

986
01:22:18,762 --> 01:22:22,129
Every time we came into a hardware store,
he'd stop in front of these.

987
01:22:22,799 --> 01:22:24,824
It wasn't as magnificent as this one.

988
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:28,059
He'd be...

989
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:29,762
...totally silent...

990
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:33,873
...and then he'd say...

991
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:37,808
..."I'd like to have that"...

992
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:40,208
...and walk away.

993
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:45,579
Only thing I ever heard him say he wanted.
Excuse me.

994
01:22:46,056 --> 01:22:47,284
Excuse me!

995
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:49,525
I'd like to buy this for my father.

996
01:22:49,693 --> 01:22:51,957
That's nice. I'll take care of that.

997
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:58,930
I've got to get him a monster.
He loves them.

998
01:22:59,102 --> 01:23:00,729
I'll find him something.

999
01:23:08,611 --> 01:23:09,543
Come here.

1000
01:23:09,646 --> 01:23:11,477
Look at this. This is great.

1001
01:23:17,654 --> 01:23:19,053
Do you mind?

1002
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:21,114
Sorry.

1003
01:23:24,027 --> 01:23:27,758
Look what I have for us.
A beautiful bevy of desserts.

1004
01:23:27,897 --> 01:23:28,727
Now...

1005
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:30,263
...this.

1006
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:34,497
- Don't want any.
- We could use it as a paperweight.

1007
01:23:35,038 --> 01:23:36,096
I want that.

1008
01:23:36,339 --> 01:23:38,398
This is the only thing you can't have.

1009
01:23:40,477 --> 01:23:42,638
Now I have several other magical...

1010
01:23:43,713 --> 01:23:45,806
I have a magic mushroom for you.

1011
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:47,978
Or better yet...

1012
01:23:48,885 --> 01:23:50,648
...the beautiful simplicity...

1013
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,811
...of a ripe strawberry.

1014
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:18,375
Let's dance.

1015
01:24:19,816 --> 01:24:20,840
Come on.

1016
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,178
I don't dance.

1017
01:24:22,385 --> 01:24:23,443
Come on!

1018
01:24:24,154 --> 01:24:25,178
Pick up.

1019
01:24:31,694 --> 01:24:32,683
Hold on!

1020
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:36,731
Oh, please, please, please.

1021
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:58,951
Good night.

1022
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:00,620
So I'll pick you up?

1023
01:25:02,192 --> 01:25:04,251
My goodness, it's night.

1024
01:25:15,472 --> 01:25:16,962
Where are we going?

1025
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,507
We could disappear.

1026
01:25:37,594 --> 01:25:39,061
You all right?

1027
01:25:41,464 --> 01:25:42,829
What's wrong?

1028
01:25:47,804 --> 01:25:48,862
What?

1029
01:25:51,808 --> 01:25:54,003
There's something I have to tell you.

1030
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:57,539
You got to promise
you'll never tell anyone.

1031
01:25:58,848 --> 01:25:59,940
All right.

1032
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:16,922
All right, calm down now.

1033
01:26:17,934 --> 01:26:19,367
What is it?

1034
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:21,428
What?

1035
01:26:22,705 --> 01:26:25,401
I want to tell you something
that nobody knows.

1036
01:26:26,442 --> 01:26:28,000
Do you remember...

1037
01:26:28,511 --> 01:26:32,675
...just when we touched ground and
it was like we were going to land okay?

1038
01:26:38,655 --> 01:26:39,644
What?

1039
01:26:44,027 --> 01:26:45,551
I let go of Bubble.

1040
01:26:48,164 --> 01:26:51,565
I had him in my lap.
I looked at the road and...

1041
01:26:51,801 --> 01:26:55,202
...I thought we were going to be safe,
and the wheels bumped.

1042
01:26:55,371 --> 01:26:57,066
I opened my arms.

1043
01:26:58,474 --> 01:27:01,136
I was safe in my belt, but he wasn't.

1044
01:27:01,277 --> 01:27:03,541
Oh, I see. It was your fault?

1045
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,077
It wasn't the accident?

1046
01:27:05,148 --> 01:27:08,379
- I wasn't holding him!
- You killed your baby?

1047
01:27:09,419 --> 01:27:10,977
And the lawyer...

1048
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:13,954
- Brillstein?
...I didn't tell him the truth.

1049
01:27:14,457 --> 01:27:17,290
I understand. So you're also a liar?

1050
01:27:18,428 --> 01:27:23,297
Yes, I lied! I lied to Father Conti.
I lied in the confessional.

1051
01:27:23,366 --> 01:27:25,834
I lied to the whole church!

1052
01:27:26,102 --> 01:27:28,127
- It wasn't your fault.
- Oh, my God.

1053
01:27:28,204 --> 01:27:29,865
Oh, my God!

1054
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:31,839
Carla, it's not your fault.

1055
01:27:34,377 --> 01:27:35,901
"Hail, Mary, full of grace...

1056
01:27:35,979 --> 01:27:38,743
"...the Lord is with Thee.
Blessed art Thou amongst women...

1057
01:27:38,815 --> 01:27:40,942
"...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb Jesus."

1058
01:27:41,017 --> 01:27:43,952
Carla, I didn't mean
that you killed your baby.

1059
01:27:46,155 --> 01:27:48,055
Carla, you're not to blame.

1060
01:27:49,759 --> 01:27:51,727
You couldn't have held on to your baby.

1061
01:27:51,794 --> 01:27:54,228
We were going hundreds of miles an hour!

1062
01:27:59,168 --> 01:28:01,227
Of course you think it's your fault.

1063
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:04,700
God gave you a child.
It was your job to keep him safe.

1064
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:06,900
But it's not your fault!

1065
01:28:07,644 --> 01:28:10,807
Stop it now! Come on, stop it!
That's enough!

1066
01:28:18,054 --> 01:28:19,043
Oh, shit.

1067
01:28:27,263 --> 01:28:28,628
Oh, shit.

1068
01:28:33,102 --> 01:28:34,433
Now what have I done?

1069
01:28:59,762 --> 01:29:01,525
Come on now.
I want you to get in the back.

1070
01:29:03,433 --> 01:29:04,365
Come on.

1071
01:29:06,836 --> 01:29:07,962
Come on.

1072
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:09,402
Come on now.

1073
01:29:09,939 --> 01:29:10,963
Come on.

1074
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,775
Just get in the back now.

1075
01:29:31,994 --> 01:29:33,552
This is your baby.

1076
01:29:34,397 --> 01:29:36,695
No, hold it upright, like this.

1077
01:29:36,766 --> 01:29:39,564
I know it doesn't look like a baby.
It looks like a toolbox.

1078
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:40,761
It is a toolbox.

1079
01:29:40,837 --> 01:29:43,431
I want you to pretend
that this is your baby.

1080
01:29:43,506 --> 01:29:44,996
Pretend it's Bubble.

1081
01:29:45,808 --> 01:29:48,572
Now this is your chance to hold on tight...

1082
01:29:48,778 --> 01:29:50,177
...to save him.

1083
01:30:21,978 --> 01:30:23,673
Hold on to Bubble!

1084
01:30:24,514 --> 01:30:26,038
As tight as you can!

1085
01:30:36,559 --> 01:30:39,221
Pray to God to give you the strength
to save your baby.

1086
01:30:47,203 --> 01:30:48,898
Hold on to your baby!

1087
01:30:53,142 --> 01:30:54,871
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

1088
01:30:54,977 --> 01:30:57,946
Pray for us now
and at the hour of our death!

1089
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:41,747
Right behind you. Careful, please.

1090
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,930
Mrs. Rodrigo, how are you doing?

1091
01:31:54,003 --> 01:31:54,901
I'm okay.

1092
01:31:54,971 --> 01:31:56,836
It's whiplash. I was with Max.

1093
01:31:56,906 --> 01:32:00,364
I know. He's in intensive care.
He'll be all right.

1094
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,041
Just between us...

1095
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:03,305
...what happened?

1096
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,742
He was showing me something.

1097
01:32:05,815 --> 01:32:08,306
What? That brick walls are hard?

1098
01:32:09,886 --> 01:32:11,945
How'd you get here so fast?

1099
01:32:12,688 --> 01:32:15,248
My beeper went off,
I was just two blocks away.

1100
01:32:15,391 --> 01:32:17,951
I don't know. I've been really lucky lately.

1101
01:32:18,494 --> 01:32:20,394
I mean, I know it's terrible...

1102
01:32:20,463 --> 01:32:22,727
...to talk about luck
when you've suffered so.

1103
01:32:22,798 --> 01:32:24,425
Have you seen a doctor yet?

1104
01:32:26,202 --> 01:32:27,169
Are you okay?

1105
01:32:27,236 --> 01:32:28,430
Yes, I'm fine.

1106
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:31,863
- What happened?
- Mr. Klein drove into a brick wall.

1107
01:32:33,809 --> 01:32:35,299
You don't understand.

1108
01:32:35,478 --> 01:32:37,912
The flight attendant told me
to hold Bubble.

1109
01:32:38,781 --> 01:32:41,215
I thought I didn't hold him tight enough.

1110
01:32:41,284 --> 01:32:44,947
I wasn't sure my hands were clasped
when we hit.

1111
01:32:46,188 --> 01:32:48,418
Be careful about what we're not sure of.

1112
01:32:50,059 --> 01:32:51,959
I thought I could save him.

1113
01:32:52,595 --> 01:32:54,187
Max showed me I couldn't.

1114
01:32:54,263 --> 01:32:56,993
- There was no way.
- He crashed the car on purpose?

1115
01:32:57,099 --> 01:32:58,225
Yes, to show me.

1116
01:32:58,301 --> 01:32:59,199
That's it.

1117
01:32:59,268 --> 01:33:01,634
That fucking nut ain't coming close to you!

1118
01:33:01,737 --> 01:33:04,137
- Let me talk to you.
- It's out of control.

1119
01:33:04,307 --> 01:33:07,799
Listen, our case is good. Actually,
we could improve our numbers here.

1120
01:33:21,557 --> 01:33:23,024
You must be Jonah.

1121
01:33:23,926 --> 01:33:26,827
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
Is your mom home?

1122
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:29,163
Yeah, come in. Mom!

1123
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:38,764
- A woman's here to see you.
- I know.

1124
01:33:38,908 --> 01:33:39,966
Go to your room.

1125
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:41,532
Go to your room!

1126
01:34:08,437 --> 01:34:09,563
I'm Carla.

1127
01:34:10,306 --> 01:34:11,534
I know who you are.

1128
01:34:15,344 --> 01:34:17,539
This is a very nice house that you have.

1129
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,144
Please sit down.

1130
01:34:22,485 --> 01:34:23,474
Thank you.

1131
01:34:33,162 --> 01:34:35,392
I'm sorry to bother you like this...

1132
01:34:35,498 --> 01:34:38,262
...but I thought that it would be good
if we talked.

1133
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:47,475
I called the hospital.

1134
01:34:47,777 --> 01:34:50,245
They said that Max is doing okay.

1135
01:34:51,247 --> 01:34:53,238
I don't think he's doing okay.

1136
01:35:01,424 --> 01:35:02,618
How are you?

1137
01:35:03,492 --> 01:35:04,424
I'm okay.

1138
01:35:04,593 --> 01:35:06,322
I really wasn't hurt.

1139
01:35:10,232 --> 01:35:12,792
You know, I came by because I...

1140
01:35:13,436 --> 01:35:15,802
...I just wanted to say, you know...

1141
01:35:18,107 --> 01:35:21,372
...I can imagine what you must be feeling...

1142
01:35:21,444 --> 01:35:23,002
...about what has happened.

1143
01:35:23,112 --> 01:35:24,204
Really?

1144
01:35:27,116 --> 01:35:28,083
You can?

1145
01:35:31,253 --> 01:35:33,585
You have every right to be angry with me.

1146
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:35,486
I'm not angry with you.

1147
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:38,516
Why should I be? Wasn't it Max's idea?

1148
01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:41,961
- What he did was crazy.
- He must be very much in love with you...

1149
01:35:42,031 --> 01:35:43,896
...to risk his life for you.
- It's not like that.

1150
01:35:43,966 --> 01:35:45,058
Isn't that love?

1151
01:35:45,134 --> 01:35:45,930
No.

1152
01:35:54,076 --> 01:35:55,907
Look, I'm sorry.

1153
01:35:57,379 --> 01:35:59,370
I didn't come to argue with you.

1154
01:36:00,349 --> 01:36:02,442
I think I better go. I'm sorry.

1155
01:36:03,319 --> 01:36:04,513
Please stay.

1156
01:36:21,036 --> 01:36:23,197
I am very sorry about your little boy.

1157
01:36:29,845 --> 01:36:30,903
Thank you.

1158
01:36:37,787 --> 01:36:38,845
You know...

1159
01:36:41,223 --> 01:36:42,588
...when he died...

1160
01:36:43,325 --> 01:36:44,815
...I had nothing.

1161
01:36:46,862 --> 01:36:48,557
I couldn't feel anything.

1162
01:36:53,836 --> 01:36:55,565
Now I can feel something.

1163
01:36:56,739 --> 01:36:59,970
I can feel something inside
besides the pain for Bubble.

1164
01:37:02,378 --> 01:37:03,970
That's because of Max.

1165
01:37:04,914 --> 01:37:06,347
He would talk to me.

1166
01:37:06,415 --> 01:37:09,111
He'd talk to me like nobody else ever has.

1167
01:37:09,819 --> 01:37:12,344
We would have these great conversations...

1168
01:37:12,454 --> 01:37:15,753
...and they were weird,
but they were so exciting and...

1169
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:20,753
It's not what you think.

1170
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:23,493
He's my friend.

1171
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,633
He's my best friend.
It's like God sent him to me.

1172
01:37:27,736 --> 01:37:29,829
It's like he sent me my own angel.

1173
01:37:35,311 --> 01:37:37,074
Let me be honest with you.

1174
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:43,847
Maybe this wonderful friendship
that you have...

1175
01:37:44,653 --> 01:37:46,314
...might have helped you.

1176
01:37:47,122 --> 01:37:48,851
But it hasn't helped Max.

1177
01:37:50,559 --> 01:37:52,356
Maybe our marriage is over...

1178
01:37:53,629 --> 01:37:57,030
...but I have a son
and I want him to have a father.

1179
01:38:01,937 --> 01:38:03,871
Max is not an angel.

1180
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,029
He's a man.

1181
01:38:08,043 --> 01:38:09,840
He cannot survive up there.

1182
01:38:34,937 --> 01:38:36,495
Hey, you.

1183
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,231
How're you doing?

1184
01:38:39,341 --> 01:38:41,400
I got you these chocolates.

1185
01:38:41,477 --> 01:38:43,468
That's what they give patients.

1186
01:38:44,313 --> 01:38:45,302
Here.

1187
01:38:46,815 --> 01:38:48,476
- How's your head?
- Hurts!

1188
01:38:51,553 --> 01:38:52,542
I just...

1189
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:57,015
I've really wanted to tell you how much...

1190
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:05,967
I just wanted to say
how wonderful you are.

1191
01:39:07,303 --> 01:39:08,793
You look happy.

1192
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:13,299
You know, it's probably
because Manny moved out.

1193
01:39:14,143 --> 01:39:15,371
I told him to.

1194
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:17,574
Are you all right with that?

1195
01:39:20,282 --> 01:39:21,442
You know...

1196
01:39:21,717 --> 01:39:23,548
...I visited Bubble's grave.

1197
01:39:25,387 --> 01:39:27,446
For the first time, it was okay.

1198
01:39:29,191 --> 01:39:30,215
I'm glad.

1199
01:39:35,164 --> 01:39:36,290
But you know...

1200
01:39:38,033 --> 01:39:40,593
...things can't go back
to the way that they were.

1201
01:39:42,104 --> 01:39:43,537
You know what I mean?

1202
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:49,505
I want you to go home, Max.

1203
01:39:50,813 --> 01:39:52,508
I want you to live again.

1204
01:39:54,616 --> 01:39:56,277
I'm not a ghost anymore.

1205
01:39:59,521 --> 01:40:00,954
I can't get back.

1206
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:03,985
Yes, you can.

1207
01:40:05,194 --> 01:40:06,525
I don't want to.

1208
01:40:12,034 --> 01:40:13,729
I wish I could help you.

1209
01:40:16,839 --> 01:40:18,534
We could disappear, Carla.

1210
01:40:22,111 --> 01:40:23,408
I can't anymore.

1211
01:40:25,914 --> 01:40:26,903
I'm back.

1212
01:40:28,617 --> 01:40:31,484
I want to try living
on planet Earth for a while.

1213
01:40:34,256 --> 01:40:36,554
You can't save everybody, Max.

1214
01:40:39,294 --> 01:40:41,524
You got to try taking care of yourself.

1215
01:40:49,204 --> 01:40:50,569
Say good-bye, Max.

1216
01:40:52,374 --> 01:40:54,604
Good-bye? Why do we have
to say good-bye?

1217
01:40:59,114 --> 01:41:00,672
It has to be that way.

1218
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:03,542
I don't want to say good-bye.

1219
01:41:06,121 --> 01:41:07,110
Just...

1220
01:41:09,491 --> 01:41:11,584
Just say it like it means nothing.

1221
01:41:13,829 --> 01:41:15,057
Good-bye, Max.

1222
01:41:29,011 --> 01:41:30,137
Please, Max.

1223
01:41:31,213 --> 01:41:32,237
Say it.

1224
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:37,684
Good-bye, Carla.

1225
01:44:25,754 --> 01:44:28,552
"The soul comes to the end
of it's long journey...

1226
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:31,054
"...and naked and alone...

1227
01:44:31,727 --> 01:44:33,718
"...draws near to the divine."

1228
01:45:33,221 --> 01:45:34,483
How're you feeling?

1229
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,484
Okay.

1230
01:45:41,763 --> 01:45:43,993
101.4.

1231
01:45:46,234 --> 01:45:47,223
Let's see.

1232
01:45:57,779 --> 01:45:59,246
Are you going to stay?

1233
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:02,610
I don't know. We'll see.

1234
01:46:06,855 --> 01:46:08,584
Sorry about the video game.

1235
01:46:09,958 --> 01:46:11,858
It's okay. You didn't break it.

1236
01:46:13,862 --> 01:46:14,726
Good.

1237
01:47:32,441 --> 01:47:33,772
What is it?

1238
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:40,811
I want you to save me.

1239
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,307
These are for you.

1240
01:48:07,242 --> 01:48:08,709
You're here! Great.

1241
01:48:08,777 --> 01:48:10,836
Listen, it may be premature.

1242
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:15,109
I don't want to jinx it but I think
I'll have it all locked up tomorrow.

1243
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:18,778
So, champagne, assorted goodies.
A little celebration.

1244
01:48:19,387 --> 01:48:21,014
It's an incredible story.

1245
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:25,182
Because of your suicide attempt,
don't argue that...

1246
01:48:25,494 --> 01:48:29,692
That's how I presented it, that you were
suffering from post-traumatic stress...

1247
01:48:29,798 --> 01:48:33,495
...and that they were going to be
on the hook if you killed yourself.

1248
01:48:33,768 --> 01:48:35,292
I know, I'm terrible.

1249
01:48:36,371 --> 01:48:37,668
What a situation.

1250
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:39,297
What am I going to do?

1251
01:48:40,008 --> 01:48:41,669
It's incredible!

1252
01:48:42,077 --> 01:48:46,844
Anyway, today I hondled with InterCity's
lawyer for two hours and we got close...

1253
01:48:47,282 --> 01:48:51,582
...really close, to big dollars for you,
Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Rodrigo.

1254
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:54,711
But I think we're going to make out
like bandits.

1255
01:48:54,956 --> 01:48:57,447
I know, I'm horrible, but listen to this:

1256
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,889
An hour after the call...

1257
01:49:00,962 --> 01:49:04,125
...from the airline lawyer,
I get one from the insurance carrier.

1258
01:49:04,799 --> 01:49:06,096
What a situation!

1259
01:49:06,167 --> 01:49:08,965
I'm mean, I know.
I'm terrible to take advantage...

1260
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:11,834
...but there's been a fuck up
in their communication.

1261
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:15,967
They both think they're the one
who's been designated to deal with me.

1262
01:49:16,711 --> 01:49:18,042
So I played dumb.

1263
01:49:19,281 --> 01:49:23,479
Started doing numbers with
the insurance guy and his offer is higher!

1264
01:49:25,754 --> 01:49:27,654
Millions, we're talking millions!

1265
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:30,248
Oh, shit!

1266
01:49:39,434 --> 01:49:40,594
This is it.

1267
01:49:41,169 --> 01:49:43,103
This is the moment of my death.

1268
01:49:50,745 --> 01:49:52,144
We'll make it, Max.

1269
01:49:52,213 --> 01:49:53,805
He's going to bring us in.

1270
01:49:53,915 --> 01:49:56,543
- He'll bring us in.
- There's a boy alone up there.

1271
01:49:57,719 --> 01:49:59,516
I'm going to sit with him.

1272
01:50:02,023 --> 01:50:03,581
It's going to be okay.

1273
01:51:49,497 --> 01:51:50,862
Everything's okay.

1274
01:51:59,808 --> 01:52:01,435
Now, put your head down.

1275
01:52:04,112 --> 01:52:05,511
Close your eyes.

1276
01:52:06,114 --> 01:52:07,843
It'll be over soon.

1277
01:52:09,217 --> 01:52:11,185
Everything's wonderful.

1278
01:53:30,498 --> 01:53:32,295
In the kitchen, there is a phone!

1279
01:53:33,067 --> 01:53:35,399
It's an emergency! It's an allergic reaction!

1280
01:53:42,677 --> 01:53:45,373
Stop it! What's happening? Dad!

1281
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,077
No, Max! No!

1282
01:55:23,678 --> 01:55:25,043
I'm alive!

1283
01:55:28,917 --> 01:55:29,975
I'm alive!

1284
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:46,828
I'm alive!
