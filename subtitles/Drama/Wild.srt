00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,011
God.

2
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,282
Okay. Okay.

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,849
"I'd rather be a hammer
than a nail."

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,729
No.

5
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,009
No.

6
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,720
Fuck you, bitch!

7
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,044
Good luck.
Thanks.

8
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,926
Hi.

9
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,963
I need a room for the night.

10
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,565
$18.

11
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,283
Unless, uh, you have a
companion joining you later.

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,885
If you have a companion,
it's more.

13
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,485
I don't have a companion.

14
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,610
So it's $18.

15
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,601
For now.

16
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,966
It'll stay $18.

17
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,645
Unless someone comes later.

18
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,446
Which he won't.

19
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,851
He may.

20

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,730
Um, I'm hiking the PCT.

23
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,331
And, um, I don't have a license
plate number or an address.

24
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,130
Just put down
your folks' address.

25
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,965
Hello.
Hey.

26
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,285
Oh, hey.

27
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,486
Hi.

28
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,166
Hey.

29
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,605
Y-You in Mojave?

30
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,561
Yeah.
Um, I used your address

31
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,041
as my address on the
registration form 'cause I...

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,161
<i>I couldn't think

No, that's cool.

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,363
Not that he would give a shit,

39
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,885
Oh. Which friend?

40
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,560
Does it make
any difference?

41
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,362
You know, I only called because
I was looking for Leif.

42
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,803
No, I want you to call.
I want you to call.

43
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,370
We're friends, remember?

44
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,605
Sorry.

45
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,490
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

46
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,721
For what?

47
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,925
I-I don't know.

48
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,611
I'm-I'm sorry, uh...

49
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,003
that you have to walk
a thousand miles just to...

50
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,649
Finish that sentence.

51
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,527
Why do I have to
walk a thousand miles?

52
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,890
Uh, do you have the list
of addresses to write to?

53
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,761
Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,808
Do you want me to
send anything else?

55
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,325
<i>Uh, no, thanks.</i>

56
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,402
Aimee's in charge
of all the boxes.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,809
<i>Okay. Okay-</i>

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,765
Um...

59
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,291

Shit.

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,522
Oh, my God.

64
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,166
Shit!

65
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,726
Okay.

66
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,526
<i>So where are you going?</i>

67
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,568
<i>I'm hiking
the Pacific Crest Trail.</i>

68
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,047
It goes from the Mexican
border up to Canada.

69
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,049
I'll be walking for
the next 3 months.

70
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,281
Wow.

71
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,441
Up to Ashland.

72
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,281
You do a lot of hiking?

73
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,687
Well, I mean,

74
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,207
I'm not obsessive, but this is
quite a stretch, even for me.

75
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,370
I guess we're gonna be
the last human contact

76
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,044
you have for a while, huh?

77
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,891
That's true.

78
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,124

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,082

It's not because

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,802
You've got a paper to write.

167
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,881
Uh-uh.

168
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,008
If I can't be a mom, then I
can't be a student, either.

Rule book.

170
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,361
That's ridiculous.

171
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,364
If she wants to make me
dinner, then let her.

172
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,124
I wonder,
have you learned any of this

173
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,168
that we're reading? You know,
I have to do everything.

174
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,526
I want to do everything.

175
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,204
I hope you do, too.

176
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920

Hey!

210
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,767
Hey!

211
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,641
Hi!

212
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,730
My name is Cheryl.

213
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,929
I'm walking the PCT,
and I've run out of food.

214
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,244
I'm just wondering
if you could take me someplace

215
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,924
I could get a warm meal.

216
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,526
I'm working.

217
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,683
Yeah, I understand. Um...

218
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,241
But maybe when you're finished,
you could take me somewhere?

219
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,049
Not gonna find anything open
this time of day.

220
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,527
Well, maybe you could
just drive me

221
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,523
to someplace that'd be open
in the morning for breakfast,

222
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,762
and I can camp nearby.

223
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,086
You must be starving.

224
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,925
I brought all these dehydrated
meals, and I brought a stove,

225
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,365
but I brought
the wrong fuel.

226
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,966
Yeah, I got a little bit
more work to do,

227
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,281
but you can wait in my truck.

228
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,205
Thank you.

229
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,604
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.

230
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,410
All right,
I've been thinking.

231
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,005
You can come back to my place

232
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,242
for a hot dinner
and a hot shower.

233
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,960
Okay.

234
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,082
So,
what kind of woman are you?

235
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,007
What kind?

236
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,844
Yeah. Are you like a Jane?

237
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,284
You know,
Tarzan's Jane.

238
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,845
Are you a Jane?

239
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,445
A wild woman?

240
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,969
I got a little
something for us.

241
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,409
That is, if you partake.

242
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,641
Sure.

243
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,485
Ladies first.

244
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,642
Oh. It's cheap, but it's good.

245
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,246
See?

246
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,121
Thanks.
Yeah.

247
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,565
I'm gonna call you Jane.

248
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,967
Yeah, my husband's
hiking the PCT with me.

249
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,727
He's just a little bit
further ahead on the trail.

250
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,731
We're gonna meet
up really soon.

251
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,890
Probably around
Kennedy Meadows.

252
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,010
I got a little something else I
like to do after a hard day's work.

253
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,769
You like licorice?

254
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,009
Oh, thanks.

255
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,641
Come on.

256
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,250
Come on, Jane!

257
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,691
All right,
you got to promise

258
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,171
that you're not
gonna tell my wife,

259
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,049
because she hates it
when I eat candy.

260
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,527
Okay.

261
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,810
What,
you just gonna stand there?

262
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,167
Oh, um, hold on, sweetheart.

263
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,890
No offense, but...

264
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,409
Thank you.

265
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,288
Well, you just
gonna look at it or...

266
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,362
Thank you.

267
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,210
Good meal.

268
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,641
So,your husband,

269
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,729
the two of you
meet in college?

270
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,770
Your husband.
Oh, Paul?

271
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,331
Yeah.
Yes.

272
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,487
Yeah.

273
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,403
Well, he must be crazy.

274
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,883
It's one thing for a man to
take off on a hike like that,

275
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,803
but to allow
your wife to do it?

276
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,370
Whole other thing entirely.

277
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,364
Not everyone in the world
thinks like you do, Frank.

278
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,761
Nope, that's why everything
is so messed up.

279
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,760
Paul and I kind of
do our own thing.

280
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,884
Don't you get any ideas.

281
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,803
How could I possibly?

282
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,801
You gonna take off with her?

283
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,251
You have an extra tent?

284
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,845
You'd be yelling for me

285
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,082
to come get you before you got
to the end of the driveway.

286
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,089
This is really good.

287
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,762
<i>Baby, baby, be my friend</i>

288
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,563
So, what does this tattoo
mean to you guys, anyways?

289
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,802
Well, we both just
really dig horses.

290
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,603
We're getting divorced today

291
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,441
and we thought
we should do something

292
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,568
that bonded us together.

293
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,647
Oh.

294
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,805
Okay.

295
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,084
it hasn't occurred to you guys that it
might be easier just to stay married?

296
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,170
Cheaper, too.
Mmm.

297
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,366
At least we probably
won't regret it.

298
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,286
Couples don't
necessarily stay married,

299
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,164
but they tend
to stay divorced.

300
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,601
You get a lot of people asking
you about removing tattoos?

301
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,761
Well, sometimes.

302
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,490
I cheated on him.

303
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,246
It happens.

304
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,327
She seems sorry.

305
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,606
I am sorry.

306
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,920
Cheryl, come on,
can we just...

307
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,291
Come on, man,
wipe the slate clean.

308
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,488
Uh, it's quite a big slate.

309
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,081
I cheated on him
a lot of times.

310
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,889
Is that right? "Stryed"?

311
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,525
Uh, no, it's "strayed."

312
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,081
Like a stray dog.

313
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,921
The form asked me what my new
last name would be. I...

314
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,761
I looked it up.

315
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,563
It just sounded right.

316
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,446
You're all set.

317
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,690
<i>You're going to have to
mail them yourselves.</i>

318
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,564
It's been a wonderful
and crazy 7 years.

319
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,561
<i>Goodbye,</i>

320
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,081
<i>Cheryl Strayed.</i>

321
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,801
Got what you needed?

322
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,120
Yes.

323
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,645
Now I don't have to
eat cold mush anymore.

324
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,846
I can eat hot mush.

325
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,848
There's no husband,
is there?

326
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,849
No. I mean, there was,

327
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,129
but he's in Minneapolis,
not on the PCT.

328
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,327
I said that 'cause
I was scared of you.

329
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,287
Yeah, I knew that.

330
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,921
Can't say I blame you.

331
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,686
Do you ever
think about quitting?

332
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,485
Oh, only once every
2 minutes or so.

333
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,800
Everything hurts.
All the time.

334
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,201
You think I should quit?
Yes, I do.

335
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,731
Don't listen to me. Hell,
I've quit a bunch of stuff.

336
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,609
Quit jobs, quit marriages.

337
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,682
I'd have quit that hike
after the first day.

338
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,330
You regret any of them?

339
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,084
I didn't have a choice.

340
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,487
I just couldn't
do them no more.

341
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,329
Never been a time when there
was a fork in my road.

342
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,647
Yeah.

343
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,208
That's about the size of it.

344
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,486
<i>Be careful.</i>

345
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,170
All right.
Nice meeting you.

346
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,208
Nice meeting you.
Thank you, Frank!

347
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,481
Yes!

348
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,366
Okay.

349
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,330
Oh, my God.

350
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,811
Oh, my God!

351
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,361
<i>You're doing good, Strayed.</i>

352
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,288
<i>5 to 7 miles a day.</i>

353
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,204
<i>At this rate, you'll be
finished in about 20 years.</i>

354
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,005
<i>I'm not hungry.</i>

355
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,731
<i>I don't miss food.</i>

356
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,320
<i>I don't miss tacos,
chips and guac.</i>

357
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,527
<i>I don't miss Minneapolis snow,
that's for sure.</i>

358
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,330
<i>I don't miss margaritas.</i>

359
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,323
<i>I'd kill a snake for a sip.</i>

360
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,603
<i>It's not like I'm some junkie.
I'm in control.</i>

361
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,330
Yeah,
like everyone is with drugs?

362
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,170
I'm an experimentalist.
Mmm.

363
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,641
I'm the girl who says
yes instead of no.

364
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,601
Uh, hi!

365
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,567
Cheryl Strayed?

366
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,645
Oh, yeah, hi!

367
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,051
I... Do I know you?

368
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,163
I... I saw your name
in the trail register.

369
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,366
You're the only
woman in there.

370
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,487
Right.

371
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,881
I'm Greg!

372
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,486
Nice to meet you!

373
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,601
I'm coming down.

374
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,567
Oh, great!

375
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,605
Sorry. I wasn't
expecting any visitors.

376
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,886
So how many miles
a day are you doing?

377
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,167
I'm averaging 22
at the moment.

378
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,290
You'll be in Kennedy Meadows
by tomorrow?

379
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,807
Hope so.

380
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm only managing about...

381
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,046
11 or 12.

382
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,603
Uh, well, the first couple
of weeks are always hard.

383
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,331
And you do all that
preparation and training,

384
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,006
and nothing prepares you
for the pain and the heat.

385
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,722
Yeah, we picked
the wrong year, though.

386
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,689
You, uh, bypassing the Sierra?

387
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,887
Sure.

388
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,684
I'll bypass anything.
Should I?

389
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,444
Oh, it's completely socked in.

390
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,243
Biggest snowfall
in a decade or so.

391
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,806
Yeah, nobody's
getting through that.

392
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,687
Say, uh...

393
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,129
how 'bout we make a plan
up in Kennedy Meadows?

394
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,044
I'm... I'm staying there
for a few days to rest up.

395
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,607
Yeah.

396
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,761
Thanks.

397
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,570
Let's make a plan. I...

398
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,687
Think that'd be good for me.

399
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,561
Great.

400
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,647
I think I'm pregnant.

401
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,647
What?

402
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,604
Who's the father?

403
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,881
I don't know.

404
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,767
I mean...

405
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,205
I think I have an idea.

406
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,884
You have an idea?

407
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,562
Are you fucking kidding me?

408
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,841
What are you
doing to yourself?

409
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,921
Can we have the check, please?

410
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,931
Shit. Pregnancy
test and a shovel.

411
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,521
You're going to do this in front
of me, and if you're pregnant,

412
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,008
we're gonna pay visit to
your "idea" and make a plan.

413
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,809
Next please!

414
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,164
<i>Give me a reason to love you</i>

415
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,207
<i>This is the beginning</i>

416
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,251
Of forever and ever

417
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,086
<i>It's time to move over</i>

418
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,202
<i>It's all I want to be</i>

419
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,524
<i>Give me a reason to love you</i>

420
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,810
<i>Give me a reason to be</i>

421
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,282
<i>A woman</i>

422
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,725
<i>I just wanna be a woman</i>

423
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,609
<i>There's no plan to make.</i>

424
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,087
I'm not gonna have this baby.

425
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,163
I don't know when I became
such a piece of shit.

426
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,126
I was strong...

427
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,009
Responsible.

428
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,608
I wanted things in life.

429
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,329
I was good, you know?

430
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,486
I ruined my marriage,

431
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,562
and now I'm ruining
the rest of my life.

432
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,843
I gotta go back to that store.

433
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,963
I'm gonna walk
myself back to the woman

434
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,485
my mother thought I was.

435
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,529
<i>I'm gonna put myself
in the way of beauty.</i>

436
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,170
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

437
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,083
<i>In the way
of another fucking giant rock.</i>

438
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,851
<i>Maybe your other girlfriends</i>

439
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,080
<i>Couldn't pass the test</i>

440
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,287
Come on, Bruce.
Sing with me.

441
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,401
<i>Well, if
you're rough and ready for love</i>

442
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,002
<i>Honey, I'm tougher than...</i>

443
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,286
<i>Bruce and the rest</i>

444
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,287
Hey, there.

445
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,171
There she is!

446
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,321
Hey!

447
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,769
You made it!
I made it!

448
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,527
Okay, guys?

449
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,087
This is Cheryl.

450
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,721
And Monster.

451
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,681
"Monster"?

452
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,367
My Pack?

453
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,200
Oh, man.

454
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,604
Okay,

455
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,727
what can I get you?

456
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,250
Snapple. I've been dreaming
of Snapple Lemonade.

457
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,320
And potato chips.
Any kind of potato chips.

458
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,401
Any kind?
Thank you.

459
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,608
I have cash.
No, no, no! My treat.

460
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,681
Ah, thank you.

461
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,967
Seriously, you have
no Snapple in that pack?

462
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,610
l wish!

463
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,361
Stay.

464
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,805
Congratulations.
Thank you.

465
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,167
I wish I'd gotten applause
like that when I walked in.

466
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,284
Okay! I know they said
don't feed the animals,

467
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,647
but I figured this would be
a special occasion.

468
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,848
One Snapple and chips.

469
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,291
Ah! That's perfect.

470
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,770
When you're done here,
Ed over there

471
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,081
will cook you dinner
down at the campsite.

472
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,841
That would be amazing.

473
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,921
Thank you.

474
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,727
Ed is amazing.
We call him Amazing Ed.

475
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,327

00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,361
I just come up
here every summer

492
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,771
to hang out
with the real hikers.

493
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,490
You fascinate me.

494
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,769
I'm not a real hiker.

495
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,207
You just hiked 100 miles
through the desert heat.

496
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,123
And it nearly killed me.

497
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,641
You want some help?

498
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,322
Do I look like somebody
who needs help?

499
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,409
Your boots.
They're too small.

500
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,403
That's why you're
losing toenails.

501
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,324
Yeah. You're right.

502
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,364
I only just realized it
the second you said that.

503
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,568
I thought they were
supposed to hurt that bad.

504
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,641
What am I supposed to do?

505
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,330
I don't have any money
to buy new boots.

506
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,482
Did you get them at REI?
Yeah.

507
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,921
Well, you call 'em,

508
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,081
you tell 'em,
and they'll have new boots

509
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,321
sent to your next stop.

510
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,845
Seriously?
Mmm.

511
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,724
And your pack,
it's insane.

512
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,083
We need to do
a little pruning.

513
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,011
Okay,
so I'm gonna pick out

514
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,889
the stuff that's
useless to you.

515
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,325
And you can leave it
in the free box

516
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,606
unless you can
give me a good reason

517
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,761
why you need it with you.

518
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,081
Okay.
Okay?

519
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,006
Ah, how's this
working for you?

520
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,046
I stink.

521
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,681
I stink all the time. And my
armpits are the least of it.

522
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,769
Are you having
much fun with these?

523
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,928
I've never used them once.

524
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,084
I don't know what
I was thinking with the saw.

525
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,090
You burning what you read?

526
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,207
You want me to burn books?

527
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,647
I know you're not gonna
become a Nazi, I promise you.

528
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,166
But you are gonna make
your pack a lot lighter.

529
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,005
Okay? So... Everything
before Kennedy Meadows...

530
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,607
Wait. Not those.

531
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,890
These will never be burned.

532
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,610
It's your weight.

533
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,007
I don't take pictures
at night.

534
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,521
Never

535
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,841
You...
You need the whole roll?

536
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,967
What woman goes on a hike
and brings 12 condoms.

537
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,644
Hey, Ed!

538
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,007
Wait just a minute.

539
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,326
But you'll just
send the boots there?

540
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,568
I don't have to
do anything?

541
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,561
Thank you so much.

542
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,769
You will be my favorite
company forever and ever.

543
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,927
Okay.

544
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,761
Great.

545
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,965
<i>So what's wrong
with James Michener?</i>

546
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,122
He's crap is what's wrong.

547
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,363
And which of his books
have you read that are so...

548
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,845
I haven't read
any of his books.

549
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,649
I read things
like Adrienne Rich

550
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,085
and Flannery O'Connor.

551
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,049
Which you do, too, now,
by the way.

552
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,282
Doesn't it make
a difference to you?

553
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,164
Um...
I don't know what to say.

554
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,844
I love James Michener!

555
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,003
And I'm not going to
stop loving him!

556
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,768
It must be so weird for you.

557
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,001
What?

558
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,329
That I'm just so much more
sophisticated than you were

559
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,925
at my age, you know?

560
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,322
Yeah, that was the plan.

561
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,084
What was the plan?

562
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,602
I always wanted you to be
more sophisticated than me.

563
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,606
I just didn't realize
it would hurt sometimes.

564
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,360
<i>Why do you
put up with my crap?</i>

565
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,767
You look so pretty
in that dress.

566
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,840
<i>And I'll make you
another one soon.</i>

567
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,521
What'd you decide
about the snow?

568
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,842
Well, I'd like to push on,
if it's possible.

569
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,881
Well, Ed told me
a lot of the hikers

570
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,681
went up the PCT another
40 miles to Trail Pass.

571
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,285
Yeah? And that's where
they're getting forced off

572
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,771
by the snow.

573
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,810
And they're catching a bus
up to Reno and on to Truckee,

574
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,769
just, rejoining the trail
at a lower elevation.

575
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,170
I didn't come out
here to ride buses.

576
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,406
You probably
didn't come out here

577
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,488
to slide off the side
of a mountain, either.

578
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,050
True.

579
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,243
If you're worried
about cheating yourself,

580
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,647
just make your hike longer.

581
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,087
You know, just, uh,
walk to Mount Hood

582
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,242
or the Bridge of the Gods.

583
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,163
The Bridge of the Gods?

584
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,362
I like the sound of that.

585
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,761
Either way,
don't beat yourself up.

586
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,280
You, uh,
you strike me as someone

587
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,761
who's done plenty
of that already.

588
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,480
<i>Can I ride my horse?</i>

589
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,687
Bobbi Grey?

590
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,566
I'm sorry.

591
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,243
How long?
Can I ride my horse?

592
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,200
We'll be
giving you radiation

593
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,851
to shrink the size of
the tumors along your spine.

594
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,803
The slightest jolt,
it could crumble.

595
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,961
How long?

596
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,681
You all right, honey?

597
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,685
Yeah, I'm fine.

598
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,041
<i>Hi, this is Paul.</i>

599
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,407
<i>Leave a message and I'll call
you back whenever I can.</i>

600
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,203
<i>Hey, sorry to call so late.</i>

601
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,087
Thank you.

602
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,323
<i>I'm in Reno. If you were here,
we could get divorced again.</i>

603
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,566
<i>Um...</i>

604
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,648
<i>Anyway, I... I'm still alive.</i>

605
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,286
And that's all my news.

606
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,730
And the sum total of
what I've learned on my hike.

607
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,205
Okay. Bye.

608
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,681
<i>Hi. I'm Cheryl.</i>

609
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,842
<i>I'm an unaccompanied
female hitchhiker.</i>

610
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,124
<i>Would it be okay if I got into
your car</i>

611
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,806
<i>so that you can rape
and dismember me?</i>

612
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,126
Hey, going north?

613
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,807
Yeah, l am, actually.

614
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,609
Okay, I just need
a ride about 12 miles up.

615
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,971
Well, that's quite a backpack
you got there. Thanks.

616
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,923
I can't offer you a ride
because I don't have any room.

617
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,207
What do you mean?

618
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,441
Yeah,
I'm packed to the gills.

619
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,086
Jimmy Carter.

620
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,367
No relation.

621
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,606
I interview hobos for the Hobo Times.
Drive all over the USA.

622
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,923
And I have to tell you.
Lady hobos? Hard to find.

623
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,681
I think you're mistaken.
I'm not a hobo.

624
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,171
<i>Second of all, that's a
real thing, the Hobo Times?</i>

625
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,130
Yeah, it's real enough
to pay for my rent and gas.

626
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,646
So, how long have you
been out on the road?

627
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,281
I'm not "on the road." I'm
hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.

628
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,044
I just had to
bypass a chunk of it

629
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,248
because there was
a snowfall this year.

630
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,166
Okay, so if you're not a
hobo, where do you live?

631
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,765
I'm between places right now.

632
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,922
I'm probably going to live in
Portland when I get off the PCT.

633
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,730
This is so fucking cool.
I mean...

634
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,687
I've only spoken to maybe one
other female hobo in two years.

635
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,161
Let me reiterate to you,
lam not a hobo.

636
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,447
And that's probably because women
cannot walk out of their lives.

637
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,090
They've got kids
to take care of,

638
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,083
they've got parents
to look after.

639
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,924
You sound like a feminist.

640
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,047
I am.

641
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,851
That's excellent. That's fantastic.
I love feminists.

642
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,042
So you're trying to tell me
you're not a hobo,

643
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,929
so that means you
have a job then, right?

644
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,606
I've had a whole
lot of different jobs.

645
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,291
Up until a couple of years
ago, I was studying.

646
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,171
I hope you don't think
this is too personal,

647
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,164
but I've noticed it's
often personal trauma

648
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,368
that forces people
out of their life

649
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,240
and into the hobo life. Would you
say that's been the case for you?

650
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,529
This is my life. I'm just
taking a little time out.

651
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,126
This is not a hobo life.

652
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,367
I don't know what
else to tell you.

653
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,081
Can I get a shot?
No! That...

654
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,802
Yeah, this should
be in the fall issue.

655
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,611
A couple of my pieces have
been in some other magazines.

656
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,250
Harper's has
expressed interest.

657
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,287
<i>Harper's?</i>

658
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,646
It's a New York magazine.

659
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,767
Pretty swanky,
kind of a big deal...

660
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,807
Yeah, I know what Harper's is.

661
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,166
I want to write
for Harper's one day.

662
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,961
I don't really feel like being
their centerfold Bum of the Month.

663
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,041
What's this?

664
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,487
Hobo care package.
Thanks a lot!

665
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,521
Hmm.

666
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,726
What's your dog's name?

667
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,408
Stevie Ray.
Got him the day he died.

668
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,564
The other Stevie Ray,
I mean.

669
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,924
I love Stevie Ray.

670
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,324
<i>Hey, put on Love Struck.</i>

671
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,720
Just came to me the second
you got in this car.

672
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,485
Wooh, shut up, Spider!
Jesus!

673
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,689
Ignore him. He's nothing
but a horny old bastard.

674
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,203
You must be pretty tough,
hiking this fucking trail.

675
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,560
I'm in a car with you,
taking a ride.

676
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,843
That's not very tough.

677
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,243
That's a cute little boy.
How old is he?

678
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,205
He was 8.

679
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm so sorry.

680
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,246
He got hit by a truck
when he was riding his bike.

681
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,121
5 years ago.

682
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,448
He was a tough motherfucker,
too. Just like his mom.

683
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,171
I'm really sorry.

684
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,329
I know you are,
sweetheart.

685
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,805
I was never me.

686
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,730
Don't. Okay? Don't.
It's not over.

687
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,080
We're gonna find somebody
who can help you

688
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,889
and we are gonna fight this!

689
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,485
I was always...

690
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,648
A mother or a wife.

691
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,928
I was never even in the
driver's seat of my own life.

692
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,686
I thought there was
so much time, you know?

693
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,210
And just when...

694
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,282
So many things
were beginning.

695
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,007
Oh, well!

696
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,209
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

697
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,681
Hang on.

698
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,125
All right.

699
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,760
<i>I surely would---</i>

700
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,005
<i>Can you
stop humming that song?</i>

701
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,401
<i>Happy people sing!</i>

702
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,084
<i>Shut up.</i>

703
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,404
<i>I'm sitting in
the railway station</i>

704
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,689
<i>Got a ticket
for my destination</i>

705
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,048
<i>The sun is
right behind my back</i>

706
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,521
<i>So true north
should be over there</i>

707
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,327
<i>I will not lose
this fucking track</i>

708
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,051
<i>Or I'll end up in Delaware</i>

709
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,802
<i>Portland bound</i>

710
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,007
<i>I hope I am Portland bound</i>

711
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,801
Hey!

712
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,321
Hey!

713
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,085
Where am I?

714
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,925
California!

715
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,044
Fucking hilarious.

716
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,724
Plumas County!

717
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,884
Are you lost?

718
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,721
No!

719
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,645
Just screwed.

720
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,645
<i>Hey, beauty.</i>

721
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,290
Hey, my Lady.

722
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,006
<i>She saved my life.</i>

723
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,169
You know,
after I left your dad.

724
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,241
I know.

725
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,364
I'm not going to
make you promise anything.

726
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,960
This is hard enough on you
as it is.

727
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,961
Just please try and do
the kindest thing.

728
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,331
Come back!

729
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,926
Come back.

730
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,006
Come back!

731
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,645
Here you go.
This should keep you warm.

732
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,042
I'll be back in
the morning with Leif.

733
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,011
I love you.

734
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,724
You're the center of me.

735
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,604
Everything I am.

736
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,611
Love.

737
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,085
Love.

738
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,881
How's she doing?

739
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,847
The doctor said
it would be a year.

740
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,204
It's been a month.
One fucking month!

741
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,571
I'm sorry.

742
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,124
I'll pray for her.

743
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,211
Fucking Saint Patrick.

744
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,363
Go to hell, all you saints.

745
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,647
<i>Thank you, God,
for showing me the way.</i>

746
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,569
<i>As if He gives a shit.</i>

747
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,284
<i>I'm sorry,
but God is a ruthless bitch.</i>

748
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,082
Yeah, well, I really need him.

749
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,481
It's urgent. Tell him
to get the fuck home.

750
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,403
Where the fuck have you been?

751
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,450
I've been at the hospital
all day! She's dying.

752
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,204
Don't say that!
You understand that?

753
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,131
She can't die.
She can. She is dying.

754
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,201
Stop it!

755
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,329
She can't die.

756
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,964
<i>There was Killer, and Doobie.</i>

757
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,124
Doo-bie!

758
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,849
And Motorcycle Dan.

759
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,881
Motorcycle Dan...wow!

760
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,042
I wanted to be like that guy.

761
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,770
And Nipper.

762
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,643
"If you press your face
against the glass...

763
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,087
"...you can see a little slice
of Lake Superior."

764
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,846
A room with a view.

765
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,681
She said.

766
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,525
All my life, I've always
wanted a room with a view.

767
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,086
<i>Jesus, she just never stops.</i>

768
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,887
The past few years, I've acted
like she was nothing to me.

769
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,726
But...

770
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,402
...really, she was everything.

771
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,365
What are you doing?

772
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,646
Praying.

773
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,485
Shut up.

774
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,531
I'm praying to
the whole fucking universe...

775
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,082
...hoping there's a God.

776
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,530
Because I want a miracle.
I want a fucking miracle!

777
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,210
Our mother isn't
going to die at 45.

778
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,651
<i>Are you
burning and yearning?</i>

779
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,605
<i>Do you ever feel blue?</i>

780
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,327
<i>And do you
think of returning?</i>

781
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,842
<i>How's the world
treating you?</i>

782
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,921
I can't wait to
see her face.

783
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,802
She'll be so happy
to see you.

784
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,043
So happy to see you...

785
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,161
<i>How much do I love you?</i>

786
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,327
No.

787
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,401
This much?

788
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,650
<i>This much?</i>

789
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,081
This much?

790
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,481
This much?

791
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,848
<i>I'm stuck! I can't go wider.</i>

792
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,251
I can't go wider!

793
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,521
<i>How's the world treating you?</i>

794
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,689
We put ice on her eyes.

795
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,326
What?

796
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,162
She wanted to
donate her corneas, so...

797
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,931
Oh, my God.

798
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,124
<i>Fuck you, bitch!</i>

799
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,169
What the fuck do you want?

800
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,643
Fuck you, let's go.

801
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,246
<i>I'd rather be a sparrow</i>

<i>Yes, I would</i>

808

01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,051
<i>I surely would</i>

814
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,407
Fuck it.

815
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,285
<i>Can you
stop humming that song?</i>

816
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,041
What is wrong with you?

817
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,282
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?

818
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,089
I'm happy.
Happy people sing!

819
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,330
Why are you happy?
We have nothing, Morn. Nothing.

820
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,608
We're rich in love.

821
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,011
Oh, my God, please.

822
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,844
Don't even start
with that.

823
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,084
We're both waitressing
full-time.

824
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,400
We're students.

825
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,562
We'll have loans the rest of our lives.
This house...

826
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,371
...is falling apart.
You're all by yourself

827
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,762
because you married some
abusive alcoholic asshole.

828
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,208
And I come home
and you're singing?

829
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,850
What part of it
do you not get?

830
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,851
There's nothing I don't get,
believe me.

831
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,685
But then what?

832
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,604
Cheryl, if there's one thing
I could teach you...

833
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,762
It's how to find
your best self.

834
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,764
And when you do, how to
hold onto it for dear life.

835
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,968
And this is your best self.

836
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,686
I'm trying.

837
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,923
Do I regret marrying
an abusive alcoholic asshole?

838
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,361
No.

839
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,726
Not for a second.
Because I got you.

840
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,970
And your brother.

841
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,521
See how it works?

842
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,644
It isn't easy...

843
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,680
But it's worth it.

844
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,527
There's going to be
a lot worse days than this.

845
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,441
And you can let
them kill you...

846
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,647
But, I don't know...
I want to live.

847
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,720
<i>"I want to live."</i>

848
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,407
<i>You couldn't
even stick around</i>

849
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,801
<i>and enjoy your
miserable happy life.</i>

850
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,327
<i>I think you have packages for me?
My name is Cheryl Strayed.</i>

851
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,411
New boots from REI?

852
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,527
Yes.

853
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,091
How far did you walk in those?

854
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,407
About 50 miles. You sure
there's not another package?

855
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,526
I'm sure. And, lady,
if you walked 50 miles

856
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,086
in duct tape,
you got the right package.

857
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,724
It's two bucks
for the Snapple.

858
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,920
I'll pass.

859
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,251
Thanks.

860
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,171
You like my shoes?

861
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,686
<i>Dearest Cheryl,
you made it halfway.</i>

862
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,047
<i>600 miles. Damn!</i>

863
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,408
<i>I ran into Aimee. She said you
were making your hike longer.</i>

864
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,528
<i>Did you decide
where you'll finish?</i>

865
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,444
<i>Let me know, I'll send
a tube of foot cream.</i>

866
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,288
<i>I'm sorry if I cut you short
on the phone before you left.</i>

867
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,488
<i>I still resent you, I guess.</i>

868
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,969
<i>The funny thing is...</i>

869
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,570
<i>...hell, I'll admit it...</i>

870
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,051
<i>...I miss you.</i>

871
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,203
Be sure to take plenty of
water with you for the trail.

872
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,402
There's a water tank
20 miles up, right?

873
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,484
Yep. But it's way over
100 degrees out there.

874
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,245
That's a lot of sweat.

875
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,170
Okay. Thanks.

876
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,606
Howdy.

877
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,411
You should have something
for Stacey Johnson.

878
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,525
I'll go check.

879
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,688
Hey, are you hiking the PCT?

880
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,446
Yeah.

881
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,681
Are you?

882
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,251
You're a woman!

883
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,201
You come across
a guy named Greg?

884
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,126
Yeah. Awhile ago,
at Kennedy Meadows...

885
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,687
...when I knew even less
than I do now.

886
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,525
Well, he quit.

887
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,489
What? Greg?

888
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,970
He couldn't deal with the snow.
He's coming back next year.

889
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,361
Wow.

890
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,889
Greg quit and I'm still here?

891
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,085
Cheers to that.

892
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,090
You get lonely?

893
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,206
Honestly, I think I'm lonelier
in my real life than out here.

894
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,449
Yes, I miss my friends,
of course, but...

895
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,929
...it's not like anybody's
waiting for me at home.

896
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,641
How about you?
Why are you here?

897
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,204
I don't know. I just need to find
something in myself, you know?

898
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,206
I think the trail
is good for that.

899
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,921
I mean, look.

900
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,642
This has the power to fill
you up again if you let it.

901
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,050
My mother used to say
something that drove me nuts.

902
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,203
"There's a sunrise
and a sunset every day...

903
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,090
"...and you can choose
to be there for it.

904
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,207
"You can put yourself
in the way of beauty."

905
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,931
My kind of woman.

906
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,040
<i>She was the love of my life.
There's nothing else...</i>

907
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,326
...to say.

908
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,565
I thought there'd be couches
and Kleenex and shit.

909
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,604
That's
50-bucks-an-hour therapy.

910
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,647
This is
10-bucks-an-hour therapy.

911
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,361
Why were you destroyed
by your mother's death?

912
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,570
Is that your job? To tell the
bereaved they're grieving too much?

913
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,043
People grieve in all sorts of different ways.
I'm asking about yours.

914
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,326
Is mine so bad?

915
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,041
You're using heroin and having
sex with anyone who asks.

916
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,203
I'm not sure these things
are making you happy.

917
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,521
That's where you're wrong.

918
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,490
When I'm doing them,
I feel good and happy.

919
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,041
When I'm not,
I feel like I want to die.

920
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,361
You sleep with
your husband, too?

921
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,240
No, I'm sort of like a guy about sex.
I prefer to be detached.

922
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,406
You think that's
what guys are like?

923
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,010
"You are here"?

924
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,882
I see that poster everywhere,
and I fucking hate it.

925
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,891
Why would you ever teach a
child they don't matter?

926
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,924
Did you feel you mattered?

927
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,650
I know I mattered.

928
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,280
So who detached from you?

929
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,769
Right. You know what?

930
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,924
This is not going to work.
This is not about talking.

931
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,889
<i>"You want a knuckle sandwich?"</i>

932
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,523
You want a knuckle sandwich?

933
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,725
You want a knuckle sandwich?

934
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,041
Go, go, go!
Go get in the car.

935
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,081
Get in the car.

936
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,650
Get the fuck out of here!

937
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,201
Fucking whore!

938
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,562
I'm going to kill you!

939
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,768
<i>I'll kick your ass with my
new boots, you fucking asshole.</i>

940
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,251
Thank you, baby.

941
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,925
<i>"Eggs and bacon."</i>

942
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,248
You want some eggs and bacon?

943
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,441
Baby?

944
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,560
<i>No more rain, no more pain.</i>

945

01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,646
<i>The ashes of a body aren't
really like ashes from a fire.</i>

950
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,486
<i>Soft and silky,
they're more like...</i>

951
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,846
<i>...pale pebbles mixed
with a gritty gray gravel.</i>

952
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,485
<i>I spread most of them
around her grave.</i>

953
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,004
<i>But some of
the larger chunks...</i>

954
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,405
<i>...I put in my mouth...</i>

955
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,685
<i>...and I swallowed whole.</i>

956
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,920
<i>Then I moved to Portland...</i>

957
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,250
...with crazy Joe.

01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,848
<i>The first time
I smoked heroin...</i>

959

<i>...I laughed like a child...</i>

960
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,404
<i>...and twirled around
in my mother's jewelry box.</i>

961
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,489
<i>Then we snorted it.</i>

962
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,688

going to shoot it.</i>

<i>Never.</i>

01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,042
<i>The day after my birthday...</i>

968
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,802
<i>...a man asked me for money.</i>

969
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,531
<i>That's what I want</i>

970
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,083
<i>A week after that...</i>

971
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,284
<i>...somebody finally
wished me happy birthday.</i>

972
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,004
Heroin? Of all the stupid,
selfish things!

973
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,242
Why are you doing
this to yourself?

974
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,000
Don't you fucking touch me!

975
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,411
Don't play this game!

976
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,205
Why did you even come?
I didn't ask you to!

977
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,691
You just want to be the hero!

978
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,091
Yeah, maybe!

979
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,365
Why did you come here?

980
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,771
Because!

981
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,331
<i>Just because.</i>

982
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,211
<i>Fuck it.</i>

983
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,289
<i>Where is this fucking tank?</i>

984
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,327
No.

985
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,641
No!

986
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,681
Shit.

987
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,603
Don't fucking die here.

988
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,411
<i>30 minutes.</i>

989
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,682
Fucking iodine pills.

990
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,605
You got any water?

991
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,684
I'd give you some of mine,
but it's not ready.

992
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,964
It takes about half an hour...
with an iodine pill.

993
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,602
But you have to
filter it first.

994
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,765
We don't have a filter.

995
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,805
You can use mine.

996
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,925
Do you have a bottle?

997
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,443
Got an empty beer can.

998
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,086
Okay-

999
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,649
What are you
doing out here?

1000
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,650
Hiking the PCT.

1001
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,010
So how can we kill the time?

1002
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,931
I can think of some ways.

1003
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,561
She's got a real nice figure,
doesn't she?

1004
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,889
I have to get going.

1005
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,725
Sit down. We're just
messing with your head.

1006
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,324
We need to get going, too.

1007
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,486
Thank you much.

1008
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,607
Yeah.

1009
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,566
Thought you were heading out.

1010
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,044
I changed my mind.

1011
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,929
Tried to trick us?

1012
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,408
No, I changed my mind.

1013
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,724
Changed your clothes, too.

1014
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,165
I like your pants.

1015
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,685
They look good on you.

1016
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,842
Show off your hips and legs
and tight little ass.

1017
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,163
Please don't say that.

1018
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,090
Can't a guy give a girl
a compliment anymore?

1019
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,611
Thank you.

1020
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,689
What the hell are you doing?

1021
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,646
I thought you were lost. Get
your ass over here, let's go!

1022
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,205
Here's to a young girl
alone in the woods.

1023
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,010
Hello, Oregon cow.

1024
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,484
<i>Look out of any window</i>

1025
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,005
<i>Any morning, any evening</i>

1026
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,287
<i>Any day</i>

1027
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,482
<i>Maybe the sun is shining</i>

1028
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,643
<i>Birds are winging</i>

1029
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,362
<i>Rain is falling
from a heavy sky</i>

1030
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,811
<i>What do you want me to do</i>

1031
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:02,605
<i>To do for you to
see you through...</i>

1032
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,488
That shade looks nice on you.

1033
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,846
Oh, you think?

1034
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,760
Oh, my.

1035
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,962
Do you mind
if I say something?

1036
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,087
Sure.

1037
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,120
The nicest lipstick in the
world can't help a girl

1038
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,204
if she doesn't take care
of her personal hygiene.

1039
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,369
I've every intention
of taking care of that.

1040
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:01,205
It really needs to be
a priority, sweetie.

1041
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,046
Hey.

1042
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,201
Hey.

1043
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,243
I, uh... I work at a music
club down the street.

1044
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,763
We're honoring
Jerry Garcia tonight.

1045
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,728
You should come along.
Oh. Cool.

1046
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,646
What's your name?

1047
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,246
Cheryl.

1048
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,649
Don't worry,
I don't bite.

1049
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,449
I don't mind biting.

1050
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,607
Oh, my God. I can't
believe I just said that.

1051
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,809
I'm so sorry. I've been on
my own for a little while.

1052
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,451
Not that I'm "on my own." I've been
in a lot of relationships before.

1053
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,046
I've just been hiking
on my own for a while.

1054
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,449
Look, I'm gonna put your
name on the guest list.

1055
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,123
Hope to see you later.

1056
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,411
Hi, honey.

1057
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,122
<i>Here is your Ashland box.</i>

1058
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,604
<i>Enjoy some well-deserved rest,
but don't overdo it, okay?</i>

1059
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,568
<i>Still a lotto hike, no?</i>

1060
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,163
<i>I had said
you can quit anytime.</i>

1061
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,489
<i>But I take it back.</i>

1062
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,445
<i>Call me when you get
to the finish line.</i>

1063
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,123
<i>Love and kisses, Aimee.</i>

1064
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,566
<i>As it were your own</i>

1065
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,847
<i>It's a hand-me-down</i>

1066
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,440
<i>The thoughts are broken</i>

1067
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,323
<i>Perhaps they're better</i>

1068
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,451
<i>Left unsung</i>

1069
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,004
<i>I don't know</i>

1070
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,691
<i>I don't really care</i>

1071
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,000
Do I know you?

1072
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,086
Thanks.

1073
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,130
<i>Let there be song</i>

1074
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,482
<i>To fill the air</i>

1075
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,131
<i>Ripple in still water</i>

1076
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,526
<i>When there is no pebble tossed</i>

1077
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,203
<i>Nor wind to blow</i>

1078
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,086
<i>Dear Paul,</i>

1079
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,083
<i>I woke up this morning and
wrote your name in the sand.</i>

1080
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,686
<i>I've done that on every beach I've
been on ever since I met you.</i>

1081
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,601
<i>But I'm not
going to do it again.</i>

1082
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,209
<i>I'm ready to move on.</i>

1083
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,922
<i>Baby, baby,
be my friend</i>

1084
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,411
<i>I have only another
300 miles left to walk.</i>

1085
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,243
<i>I'm desperate for it
to be over.</i>

1086
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,163
<i>But I'm terrified, too.</i>

1087
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,404
When I'm done...

1088
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,041
<i>...I'll only have
two dimes to my name.</i>

1089
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,561
<i>But I'll have to start living.</i>

1090
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,488
<i>And I'm nowhere near ready.</i>

1091
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,684
Please! Sir, wait!

1092
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,170
I just closed.

1093
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,127
I think you have
a package for me in there?

1094
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,964
Could it wait until tomorrow?

1095
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,283
It has fresh clothes and food,
and batteries I need.

1096
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,760
Okay.

1097
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,763
If you'll have
a drink with me later.

1098
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,001
Sure.

1099
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,365
There you go,
good-looking.

1100
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,526
Thanks.

1101
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,125
You like punch?
Hmm?

1102
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,483
I make a good one. I throw every
liquor I can find into a bucket

1103
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,847
and I pour a couple
of cans of juice on top.

1104
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,651
Sounds good.

1105
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,561
Cheryl?
Yeah.

1106
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,005
Oh, my God.
We're closed, guys.

1107
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,003
"If your nerve deny you...
"...go above your nerve."

1108
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,003
Emily Dickinson.
Yes.

1109
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:12,482
"I have promises to keep and
miles to go before I sleep."

1110
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,641
Walt Whitman?

1111
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,324
No, that was Robert Frost.

1112
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,323
The Whitman was,
"Be curious, not judgmental."

1113
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,640
Yes.

1114
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,166
"God is a ruthless bitch."
You left the name off.

1115
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,083
That one was me.
You're our hero.

1116
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,128
Okay, fellas,
I'm shutting up now.

1117
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,009
We just wanted to
pick up our post?

1118
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,401
No. I'm sorry. l already reopened
for the young lady here.

1119
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,606
And I'm not
gonna reopen again.

1120
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,806
But you wouldn't
really have to reopen

1121
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,086
because you
haven't closed yet.

1122
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,164
And their packages
are right there.

1123
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:36,605
It's such a miserable night.

1124
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,331
Whatever's in them is gonna make
the night just that much better.

1125
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,731
Do you mind?

1126
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,370
That your horse?

1127
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,441
If you want to take her out

1128
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,885
in the morning,
she could do with it.

1129
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:54,681
Hey, so the campsite,
is it left? Left, right?

1130
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,966
Yeah.

1131
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,962
Good night!
I'll see you in the morning.

1132
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,087
Oh.

1133
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,886
Number one and number two.

1134
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,846
Just a little.
Just a little.

1135
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,361
Wonderful!

1136
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,007
So, Cheryl,
how do you deal with

1137
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,281
being on your own
all the time?

1138
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,409
I mean, we're with each other and
we're still sick of ourselves.

1139
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,481
Mmm-hmm.

1140
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,801
No. I've been to most of
the places in my head that

1141
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,641
I didn't want to go to,
but I feel like there's

1142
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,884
one or two that,
for whatever reason, I just...

1143
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,325
I hear you.

1144
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:38,969
There's a few girlfriends that I'm
in no hurry to think about again.

1145
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,930
I think I know exactly who
you're talking about. Right?

1146
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,561
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

1147
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,050
Not again!
Good night!

1148
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,008
Just please
try to do the kindest thing.

1149
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,882
<i>We don't have to do this.</i>

1150
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,529
<i>She's been
really sick for a long time.</i>

1151
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,247
<i>There has to be another way.</i>

1152
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,721
<i>We don't have the
money to do it right.</i>

1153
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,404
<i>We can't go to a vet.</i>

1154
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,446
<i>Leif, she's just going
to die slowly and painfully.</i>

1155
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,081
<i>Just please
do the kindest thing.</i>

1156
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,964
Hey, brother, it's me.

1157
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,681
Look, I know we don't have
a home to go back to, but...

1158
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,129
...I want you to know
I'm pulling you along with me.

1159
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,162
It's been really hard, but

1160
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,604
do me a favor, okay?

1161
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:21,885
Walk a little?

1162
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,491
I love you.

1163
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:29,847
Bye.

1164
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,881
Hey, good-looking.

1165
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,601
I brought you coffee and a
donut, fresh this morning.

1166
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,091
Thanks. Really.

1167
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,445
Why don't you come by for a
refill before you head off?

1168
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,045
I will. Thanks.

1169
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,007
Good morning, fellas.

1170
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,844
Morning.
Morning.

1171
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,082
So, you got a trail name?

1172
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,204
Hmm?
You know, like a nickname.

1173
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,089
We've got one for you.

1174
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,443
Really.
Queen of the PCT.

1175
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,367
Come on.

1176
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,124
You've just got
so many stories

1177
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,771
about people doing things for you
and wanting to help you out.

1178
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,081
I mean, nobody ever
gives us anything.

1179
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,128
No one ever does
anything for us, in fact.

1180
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,727
But please, please, come and
get your refill, Your Majesty.

1181
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:20,121
Yeah, Your Majesty doesn't
really go for refills.

1182
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,884
Refills typically
come to her.

1183
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,961
Exactly.

1184
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,565
Dude, stop.

1185
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:35,206
Stop. Now I'm going to have
that song stuck in my head

1186
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,089
for the next
hundred fucking miles.

1187
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,689
Would you prefer I just--
Don't.

1188
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,041
Don't.

1189
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,483
<i>And I said hey, hey, hey...</i>

1190
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,806
Shut up, man.

1191
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,848
Shut up! I'm serious.

1192
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,610
<i>I said, hey!</i>

1193
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,644
<i>What's going on?</i>

1194
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,926
Get him.
Get him!

1195
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,646
I'll get you soaked!

1196
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,927
<i>I said hey,
what's going on?</i>

1197
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:16,602
<i>I'd rather be
a forest than a street</i>

1198
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,645
It's okay.

1199
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,605
You're safe.

1200
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,971
It's okay.

1201
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,364
You're all right.

1202
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,570
Don't be scared.

1203
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,484
Wow You got him! Thanks!

1204
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,805
Thanks.

1205
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,801
Does he have a name?

1206
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,245
Shooting Star.

1207
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,401
Shooting Star?

1208
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,602
And I'm Vera,
and this is Kyle.

1209
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,169
I'm Cheryl. Are you
enjoying your hike today?

1210
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:27,483
I'm having a wonderful time,
thank you very much for asking.

1211
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,210
You're so polite.

1212
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:32,011
We're just out for the
weekend, rain or no.

1213
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,127
Yeah.

1214
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,247
Vera's my grandmom.

1215
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,607
She's looking after me
because I have some problems

1216
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,842
I'm not supposed
to talk about with strangers.

1217
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,491
Well, you don't have
to talk about them.

1218
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:50,561
But, you know, everybody has problems.
I have problems, too.

1219
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,689
What kinds of problems?

1220
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,726
Well, I mean,
I have problems with my dad.

1221
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,884
I don't see him anymore.

1222
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,725
Me, neither.
What about your mommy?

1223
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,686
She died.

1224
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,724
But, you know,
problems don't stay problems.

1225
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,923
They turn into something else.

1226
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,730
How did she die?

1227
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,245
Um...

1228
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,529
She got very sick.

1229
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:26,563
My mother's a singer.
She's taught me many songs.

1230
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,327
Oh, really?

1231
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,562
Would you like to hear one?

1232
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:31,841
Yeah.

1233
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:36,484
<i>From this valley
they say you are leaving</i>

1234
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,165
<i>We shall miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile</i>

1235
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:46,249
<i>For you take with you
all of the sunshine</i>

1236
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:50,730
<i>That has brightened
our pathway a while</i>

1237
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:55,205
<i>Then come and sit by
my side if you love me</i>

1238
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,282
<i>Do not hasten to bid me adieu</i>

1239
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:03,885
<i>Just remember
the Red River Valley</i>

1240
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,131
<i>And the cowboy
that loved you so true</i>

1241
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,964
<i>Just remember
the Red River Valley</i>

1242
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:17,285
<i>And the cowboy
that loved you so true</i>

1243
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,766
That was really beautiful.

1244
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,811
Thank you.

1245
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,491
I miss you.

1246
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,490
God, I miss you.

1247
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,886
<i>There's no way
to know what makes</i>

1248
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,571
<i>one thing happen
and not another.</i>

1249
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,329
<i>What leads to what.</i>

1250
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,529
<i>What destroys what.</i>

1251
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,322
<i>What causes what to flourish.</i>

1252
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,246
<i>Or die.</i>

1253
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,963
<i>Or take another course.</i>

1254
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,722
<i>What if I forgive myself?</i>

1255
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,849
<i>What if I was sorry?</i>

1256
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,881
<i>But if I could
go back in time,</i>

1257
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,247
<i>I wouldn't do
a single thing differently.</i>

1258
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,929
<i>What if I wanted to sleep with
every single one of those men?</i>

1259
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,763
<i>What if heroin
taught me something?</i>

1260
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,248
<i>What if all those things I did
were the things that got me here?</i>

1261
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,406
<i>What if I was never redeemed?</i>

1262
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,168
<i>What if I already was?</i>

1263
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:50,643
<i>It took me years to be
the woman my mother raised.</i>

1264
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:56,161
<i>It took me 4 years, 7 months 
and 3 days to do it.</i>

1265
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,964
<i>Without her.</i>

1266
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:04,649
<i>After! lost myself
in the wilderness of my grief,</i>

1267
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,282
<i>I found my way
out of the woods.</i>

1268
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,961
<i>And I didn't even know
where I was going</i>

1269
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:20,691
<i>until I got there
on the last day of my hike.</i>

1270
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,407
<i>Thank you, I thought
over and over again,</i>

1271
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,724
<i>for everything
the trail had taught me,</i>

1272
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,560
<i>and everything
I couldn't yet know.</i>

1273
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,367
<i>How, in 4 years,
I'd cross this very bridge.</i>

1274
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:43,405
<i>I'd marry a man in a spot almost
visible from where I was standing.</i>

1275
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,889
<i>How, in 9 years,
that man and I</i>

1276
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,088
<i>would have a son named Carver,</i>

1277
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:53,324
<i>and a year later, a daughter
named after my mother, Bobbi.</i>

1278
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,126
<i>I knew only that
I didn't need to</i>

1279
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,601
<i>reach with my
bare hands anymore.</i>

1280
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:04,441
<i>That seeing the fish beneath the
surface of the water was enough.</i>

1281
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,167
<i>That it was everything.</i>

1282
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,370
<i>My life, like all lives,</i>

1283
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,043
<i>mysterious,
irrevocable and sacred.</i>

1284
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,045
<i>So very close.</i>

1285
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,764
<i>So very present.</i>

1286
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,328
<i>So very belonging to me.</i>

1287
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:32,564
<i>How wild it was...
to let it be.</i>

1288
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:38,567
<i>I'd rather be
a sparrow than a snail</i>

1289
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,921
<i>Yes, I would</i>

1290
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,241
<i>If I could</i>

1291
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:48,723
<i>I surely would</i>

1292
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:58,650
<i>I'd rather be a hammer
than a nail</i>

1293
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,321
<i>Yes, I would</i>

1294
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,446
<i>If I only could</i>

1295
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,725
<i>I surely would</i>

1296
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:17,527
<i>Away, I'd rather sail away</i>

1297
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,206
<i>Like a swan</i>

1298
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,722
<i>That's here and gone</i>

1299
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:30,401
<i>A man gets tied
up to the ground</i>

1300
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:34,249
<i>He gives the world</i>

1301
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:40,083
<i>Its saddest sound</i>

1302
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:52,489
<i>I'd rather be a forest
than a street</i>

1303
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,760
<i>Yes, I would</i>

1304
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,450
<i>If I could</i>

1305
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,251
<i>I surely would</i>

1306
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,690
<i>I'd rather feel
the earth beneath my feet</i>

1307
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:13,284
<i>Yes, I would</i>

1308
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,603
<i>If I only could</i>

1309
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,604
<i>I surely would</i>

1310
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,522
<i>As the sun comes up</i>

1311
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,648
<i>As the moon goes down</i>

1312
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,084
<i>These heavy notions
creep around</i>

1313
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:18,004
<i>It makes me think</i>

1314
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,804
<i>Long ago</i>

1315
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:26,011
<i>I was brought into this life</i>

1316
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:31,206
<i>A little lamb, a little lamb</i>

1317
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,803
<i>Courageous, stumbling</i>

1318
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:39,206
<i>Fearless was my middle name</i>

1319
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:44,287
<i>But somewhere there
I lost my way</i>

1320
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:48,490
<i>Everyone walks the same</i>

1321
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,724
<i>Expecting me to step</i>

1322
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,329
<i>The narrow path they've laid</i>

1323
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:02,122
<i>They claim to walk unafraid</i>

1324
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:06,444
<i>I'll be clumsy instead</i>

1325
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:11,924
<i>Hold me, love me or leave me</i>

1326
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,569
<i>High</i>

1327
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:20,490
<i>Say keep within the boundaries</i>

1328
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:24,170
<i>If you want to play</i>

1329
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:31,127
<i>Say contradiction
only makes it harder</i>

1330
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:36,484
<i>How can I be</i>

1331
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:41,729
<i>What I want to be?</i>

1332
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:49,004
<i>When all I want
to do is strip away</i>

1333
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,208
<i>These stilled constraints</i>

1334
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:54,767
<i>And crush this charade</i>

1335
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:59,129
<i>Shred this sad masquerade</i>

1336
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:04,286
<i>I don't need no persuading</i>

1337
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:08,922
<i>I'll trip, fall,
pick myself up and</i>

1338
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,243
<i>Walk unafraid</i>

1339
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:16,006
<i>I'll be clumsy instead</i>

1340
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:21,890
<i>Hold me, love me or leave me</i>

1341
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,568
<i>High</i>
