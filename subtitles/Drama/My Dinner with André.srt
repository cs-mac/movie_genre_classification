1
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,526
Poor Jacobson.

2
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:38,693
He took his stapler?
How pitiful is that?

3
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:41,932
Still, you got to hand it
to him... he wen! for it.

4
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,439
That was his big mistake.

5
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,441
Always stay in the middle of the pack.

6
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,773
It's the frontrunners
who fall off the cliff.

7
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:51,007
At least Jacobson made it
up on the seventh floor.

8
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:53,583
It smells like cabbage on this floor.

9
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,687
That's the smell of dead dreams.

10
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:57,550
I go to the clubs at
night and people are like,

11
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:59,680
"Hey, who's wearing the coleslaw?"

12
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:04,018
Do you know how hard it is to get
laid when you smell like coleslaw?

13
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,031
NO! hard, but Still.

14
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:10,361
He had a pretty sweet office.
I wonder who’s gonna get it?

15
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,800
You wonder who's gonna get his office?

16
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:15,532
Jesus, Josh, why don't
you show a little class?

17
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:17,039
The guy just got fired.

18
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:23,943
- I’m gonna get that office.
- You’d better, Tim.

19
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:28,048
You need that job. With that car
you’re driving and that apartment?

20
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,052
You're overextended.

21
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,720
These opportunities don't
come along all the time.

22
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:35,316
Right now, the window's open
and if you hesitate, bam!

23
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,056
You're gonna be my assistant.
Assistant to an assistant.

24
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,560
You can't go lower.
It's a shitty job, Tim.

25
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,602
Do you think Julie's
gonna marry you then?

26
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:47,966
Don't mess this up.

27
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:53,401
- Good pep talk.
- All right. Go, team!

28
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:17,091
The whole reason we bought the
plant was to shut the factory,

29
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:19,597
shed the workforce
and sell the equipment.

30
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,934
But now, it's all contaminated
with low-level radiation.

31
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,001
- Nobody wants to touch it.
- Americans are so uptight

32
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,314
- about radiation.
- They are.

33
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:32,948
But the Russians are a little less
particular about this sort of thing.

34
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,108
I like it. Get two
bids. Drive up the price.

35
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:38,150
- OK, that makes sense.
- On a different note, you'll notice

36
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:41,953
hat our colleague, Doug Jacobson,
has been relieved of his duties. I

37
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:47,155
Mr. Jacobson led us right to the edge,
playing around in the currency markets.

38
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:49,028
As a consequence, tomorrow morning,

39
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:52,137
I want ten ideas to
make up for his mistakes.

40
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,975
- What are you doing?
- I have an idea.

41
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,735
An analyst...

42
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:05,749
- ...has an idea. OK, then.
- Nice knowing you, buddy.

43
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:08,717
Sixth floor, stepping up, Nice!

44
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:13,987
It's all right. it's dead.

45
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:18,086
It's manufactured by Mueller
Armaments, from Zurich, Switzerland.

46
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,160
It's a company that made a
fortune during World War I.

47
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:23,161
Now they're sitting on a bunch of bombs

48
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,166
that even the worst armies
in the world don't want.

49
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,096
All right, so we
cannibalize the company...

50
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,831
,,,who's gonna buy the pieces?

51
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,533
Oh, no, we're not gonna
strip this one down.

52
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,547
Novelty lamps. Great idea.

53
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,620
We could literally make
hundreds of dollars. Hundreds.

54
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:47,419
- Who cares about lamps?
- Marlin Mueller does.

55
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:52,523
When Martin isn’t busy running his
family’s business into the ground,

56
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:55,690
he's either yachting or
buying art for his castle.

57
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:59,235
The business is going under,
but his personal fortune is vast.

58
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,066
Nearly half a billion.

59
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:06,041
I heard he was in town, so I sent
a prototype over to his hotel.

60
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,374
He loved the lamps.
He wants to sit down.

61
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,714
The lamps are really just a
way to get our foot in the door.

62
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,048
We're gonna lose money on them.

63
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:19,590
But we'll make millions
managing his personal portfolio.

64
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:23,593
Mueller keeps his business.
We've got a brand-new client.

65
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:28,257
- Everybody wins.
- Everybody wins. That's a new one.

66
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:30,163
- Caldwell, you want to take the lead?
- Absolutely.

67
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,491
I'll ride shotgun.

68
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,434
Actually, I was hoping
I could take the lead.

69
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:39,072
Let me think... no.

70
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,080
You should've quit while
you were ahead, buddy.

71
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:53,681
You know what they say... tallest
tree gets chopped down first.

72
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:56,852
- Well, that went well.
- Mr. Conrad?

73
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:01,289
Have you got a second?

74
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,270
Come in!

75
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,536
You can just set your bombs by the door.

76
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:20,714
You put on quite a
show in there. Sit down,

77
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:28,292
Oh, that looks good on him, right?

78
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:32,563
Yep. Better than it did on Jacobson.
You're gonna need a nicer watch.

79
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,962
Nicer watch, nicer suit.

80
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,625
Hey, to the ballsiest
guy on the sixth floor.

81
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:39,635
Not gonna be on the
sixth floor for long.

82
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,805
Does that mean this is my new office?

83
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:47,207
Not yet. No, I want to get
to know you a little better.

84
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:50,208
I host a dinner once a month.

85
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:53,245
- Next one's on Saturday.
- Great, OK.

86
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,247
And it's top secret.
You can't tell anyone.

87
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:59,323
What are we talking about here? Orgy?

88
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,757
Is it a human sacrifice of some kind?

89
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:05,691
We're... collectors.

90
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,098
I’ll let the guys fill you in.

91
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,361
Some people collect vintage automobiles.

92
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:18,340
Some people collect fine
wines. Fender collects people.

93
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:19,837
- People?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,948
Each of us Ends a remarkable person
and invites them to dinner at Fender's.

95
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:26,381
We call it the Dinner for Winners.

96
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,679
Here's the guy that I invited last year.

97
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:31,688
There you go. Look at that.

98
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,883
The guy designed that
suit. Real-life Iron Man.

99
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,365
- He took first prize.
- He's an idiot.

100
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,065
You got it.

101
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,064
You invite idiots to
dinner and make fun of them?

102
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:52,141
That's,,. messed up.

103
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,267
- I know, right?
- It's completely messed up.

104
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:57,639
Al the end of the night, Fender
picks the best one, gives him a trophy

105
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,876
and we release him out in
the wild, none the wiser.

106
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:03,420
Yeah. No harm, no foul.
Hey, you're gonna do great.

107
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:06,217
Just have a little subtlety
when you pick your guy.

108
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,758
Fender's a connoisseur.

109
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,384
Yeah. Hey, and no mimes. It's a cliché.

110
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:12,219
Jacobson brought a mime.

111
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,799
Exactly. And you don't see
his shit here, anymore, do you?

112
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:41,155
- Hey.
- Hey!

113
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,282
Congratulations.

114
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:43,951
So how did it go? What happened today?

115
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:46,257
Oh, I'll tell you later.
Look at this crowd!

116
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,696
I know, it's amazing. We
actually sold every painting.

117
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,928
That's incredible! Oh, my God!

118
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:55,972
Except that I did another
on of my name-fiasco thingies

119
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,939
Oh, God, What happened?

120
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:00,510
The director of San
Francisco MoMA is here.

121
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,376
His name is Steve Doche.

122
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:07,212
And I thought that it
was pronounced "Douche."

123
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,446
God. It's like the Ron
Fuchs episode all over again.

124
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,523
Well, it actually kind of
loosened things up, and...

125
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:18,153
...and he's giving Kieran a solo
show, and he wants me to curate it.

126
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,128
Oh, my God!

127
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,463
You know, that is so like
you! You call a guy a douche

128
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,298
and get your first
museum show out of it.

129
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,802
You're amazing. I love you so much.

130
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,738
You’re stunning and you’re smart an
you’re just awful with pronunciation.

131
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,675
- Hey!
- I'm not Fuching around here.

132
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,012
Marry me.

133
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:41,247
I love you.

134
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:44,014
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

135
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,490
But remember when you asked me before,

136
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:52,422
and I said this is a big step, and
maybe we should just wait a little bit?

137
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:53,929
Yeah?

138
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:57,831
- That was two days ago.
- I know. I know.

139
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,200
I just need a little bit of time.

140
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,329
All right. I'll ask you in two hours.

141
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,270
Let's go.

142
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,404
Wow, it's packed.

143
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,378
So, where's the artiste?

144
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:13,507
I always try and create
some tension in my work.

145
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,520
Once a reviewer said of
a certain piece of mine,

146
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,351
may said, "i mink mars disgusting."

147
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,515
I said, "Good! I want
it to disgust you."

148
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:25,458
Sometimes I'll be working on a piece
and I'll think, "No, this is bullshit."

149
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:30,461
So I will literally rub bull excrement
on the piece as a meta... metaphor.

150
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,862
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

151
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:35,028
Julie.

152
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,779
Kieran, you remember Tim?

153
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,407
- The stockbroker.
- No. No.

154
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:50,146
I work for a private equity firm
that specializes in distressed assets.

155
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:54,987
- So kind of a stockbroker.
- Almost nothing like a stockbroker.

156
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,152
Do you mind if I just
call you stockbroker?

157
00:12:57,284 --> 00:13:00,231
It's the way I remember
people. You're stockbroker Tim.

158
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,064
Hey, so what do you think?

159
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,571
Really... tremendous work.

160
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,640
They're so big. And
you're in all of them.

161
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:12,936
Come with me, Tim.

162
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,137
Enjoy.

163
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,076
I have a little ranch... I say little.

164
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,980
It's absolutely massive
if you actually measure,

165
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:24,612
outside of town, where I go to
disappear, get away from this bullshit.

166
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:27,918
One of my zebras was in
labor. It was a messy business.

167
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,994
The foal was in breech.
At about the 22nd hour,

168
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:32,425
I just said, "Stuff it."

169
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:36,658
And I just thrust my hand in,
turned the little guy around.

170
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,268
Do you have any idea what it’s like

171
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:43,932
to be up to your elbow...
in a zebra's vagina?

172
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:48,102
And feel life? New life, fresh life.

173
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:53,609
- No, I don't.
- You should try it, Tim. It's magical.

174
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,044
Yeah, I'm OK.

175
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:58,679
She let me keep the afterbirth
to create this piece.

176
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:02,954
Oh, wow, that's disgusting. I
don't think I get it, Kieran.

177
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:06,553
Poppycock. You've been
stockbroking too long, Tim.

178
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,894
What does it make you think of?

179
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:15,238
I guess it kind of makes me...

180
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,406
...think of your penis.

181
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:19,839
Then you get it.

182
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,513
Julie gets it.

183
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,212
Hi, I need you to talk
to a buyer. This way.

184
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:30,910
See you in a bit.

185
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:38,821
Do you know what its like to have
your entire head inside its anus?

186
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:41,689
Julie? Poppycock.

187
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:47,271
OK, so you're just completely
immune to his animal magnetism?

188
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:50,500
He looks good in a pair
of hooves. What can I say?

189
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,411
So, are you gonna tell
me what happened today?

190
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,109
I think I might've
gotten that promotion.

191
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:59,342
Really? Oh, my God, that's amazing.

192
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,179
- Well...
- When? When do you start?

193
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:03,048
All right, well, it's not
official yet. It's not official.

194
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:06,180
- There's this dinner.
- Good. When is it?

195
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,260
- it's Saturday.
- OK. We can do that.

196
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:12,420
No, it's not really a
girlfriend type thing.

197
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,293
It's really the guys from the office.

198
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:17,630
- And we have to bring a person.
- What do you mean, "a person?"

199
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:22,706
A person with a skill
or a talent of some kind.

200
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,566
Are you talking about strippers,
here? 'Cause I'm not...

201
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:27,700
No, no. Nothing like that. No.

202
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:32,744
We have to bring an idiot to
dinner to make fun of them.

203
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:37,388
- OK, that is messed up.
- I know,

204
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:41,222
- I know.
- So you told them you're not going.

205
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:44,725
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.

206
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,732
Tell Fender I can't make the dinner.
Tell him my back thing is acting up,

207
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:50,731
and I have to stay
in bed for a few days.

208
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,401
Why don't I just tell him
you're having your period?

209
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,733
Um, I can't stay on this floor anymore.

210
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:58,736
These people are pathetic!

211
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,738
Happy birthday, Carol.

212
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,637
Why can? you just suck it up,

213
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:06,416
make fun of some idiots and stop
thinking about yourself for once?

214
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,575
Susana, I know this is painful for you,

215
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:10,586
but sometimes in life you
have to do the right thing.

216
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:14,919
Just lie. l!'s not that hard.
I'm texting a lie right now!

217
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:22,699
Jesus Christ!

218
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,262
Are you OK?

219
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,700
Yeah, I'm OK.

220
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,669
- Is that a Porsche?
- Yeah.

221
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,543
I have been hit by a Datsun before.

222
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:38,012
- Never a Porsche.
- Oh, man...

223
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:41,710
- Barry Speck.
- Tim Conrad.

224
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:45,379
Are you sure you're OK? I didn't
see you. What were you doing?

225
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:48,789
Well, I saw this little guy in the
street, I was trying to save him.

226
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:53,053
- I think it's dead.
- Yes, that's why he couldn't run away.

227
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,665
A couple more seconds,
you would've squished him.

228
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:56,164
Nice pelt, though.

229
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:58,361
Ready?

230
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,533
I hope those aren't for your lawyer.

231
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,674
No. I would rather not
have lawyers get involved.

232
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,838
All right, I get it. You
said you were fine, but...

233
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,416
What would it take to
keep the lawyers out?

234
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,313
Five.

235
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,254
Five dollars.

236
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:23,182
I don't... What do you mean?

237
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:26,490
- Ten dollars.
- Seriously, what? Come on.

238
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,030
How much do you want?

239
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:32,762
- Hundred dollars.
- I don't want anything.

240
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:35,168
- Five hundred dollars.
- I don'!... It's OK.

241
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,172
- All right...
- As long as you're OK, then...

242
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:41,208
Ten thousand!

243
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,345
OK, I'll take ten thousand dollars.

244
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,512
I don't have ten thousand dollars.

245
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:56,418
You know what? Don't worry about it.

246
00:17:57,884 --> 00:18:01,627
- Really?
- Yeah. As long as you're OK.

247
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,859
- You're a good person.
- No... It's all right.

248
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,699
- Get out of the road!
- You are. You're a good person.

249
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,361
- Thank you.
- No, you really are.

250
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:11,135
- You're a really nice person.
- All right, well, as long as you're OK,

251
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,436
- that's OK.
- Thanks. Thank you.

252
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:15,478
Yeah. You take care.

253
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,542
I won't forget this.

254
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:22,152
- You dropped your...
- Oh, yeah. That's my latest series.

255
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:26,280
I know. Mouseterpieces. Get it?

256
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:30,157
- That's the Mona Lisa.
- That's the Mouse-a-Lisa.

257
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,658
- Mouse-a-Lisa...
- There they are.

258
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:39,065
Found her on the 405. From here down,
she was a mess, but the head, perfect.

259
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,803
Oh, that's Cubism, Not
as easy as it looks.

260
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:44,408
Well, it doesn't look easy.

261
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:48,139
I like her. I love the tail.

262
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,981
- Check that out. You like them?
- I'm speechless.

263
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,078
So is he.

264
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:59,417
'Cause he's screaming.

265
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:03,517
I was just stopping by the store today
to get some pelt wax and spine wire.

266
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:06,687
Wanted to ill the guys in
on what I've been up to,

267
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,857
Hey, you know what? I have some
in the flesh. Want to see 'em?

268
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:12,970
Where did they...? Come here! Come here!

269
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,973
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't look!

270
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:22,438
- OK... All right...
- Can I look?

271
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,446
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

272
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:27,478
Go ahead.

273
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:33,783
Incredible.

274
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,295
Does that guy look sort of familiar?

275
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:41,997
I'll give you a hint.
He wrote the Bible.

276
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,630
- ls it Jesus?
- Yes!

277
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,965
- You know your stuff!
- Amazing.

278
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:50,797
Yeah. Well, it's a hobby.
I like to think that...

279
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,571
...I'm sort of giving them
a second chance, you know?

280
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,308
In the words of John Lennon, "You
may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not."

281
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,521
- "The only one."
- The only what?

282
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:07,352
No, that's the lyric. "You may say I'm
a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."

283
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,489
OK, Tim.

284
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,999
You know, Barry, this was
a very strange way to meet,

285
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,665
but I think everything
happens for a reason.

286
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:18,994
Did you make that up?

287
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:20,831
Yeah.

288
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:25,899
"Everything happens for
a reason." I like that.

289
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:29,702
Thanks. Anyway, tomorrow night,
I'm having dinner with some friends.

290
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:33,841
Are you? That's
incredible. Congratulations.

291
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,420
I was wondering, would
you like to join us?

292
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:38,447
- You shitting me?
- No.

293
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:42,253
Say that your girlfriend
thinks meat is murder,

294
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:44,361
and she convinces you
to become a vegetarian.

295
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,523
Then one day, you're grilling up a
veggie burger, and all of a sudden,

296
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:52,467
a chicken comes up, plucks itself,
covers itself in barbecue sauce

297
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,037
and flings itself on the grill.

298
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,964
That's God sending a message, right?

299
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:58,741
Yeah, that chicken wants to die.

300
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:02,711
No. God wants us to move
to the seventh floor.

301
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:04,941
And He sent His only son to tell me.

302
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:09,385
Come with me, my children,
to the seventh floor,

303
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:17,717
Tim! I'd like you to
meet Mr. and Mrs. Mueller

304
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:21,059
Of course! What a
pleasure it is to meet you.

305
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:23,594
Mr. Conrad! You sent
the lamp to my hotel.

306
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:25,498
- That's... yeah!
- I wished to meet you in person.

307
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,004
Yes, Tim was really helpful when we
came up with the idea for the lamps.

308
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:31,074
And we'd been discussing
personal investment as well.

309
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:34,139
That's a conversation I'm very much
looking forward to getting back to.

310
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,247
- Well, I'm glad we could do this.
- Yeah.

311
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:41,944
Congratulations on your
new Matisse. It's beautiful.

312
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:47,089
My wife is a true collector.
It was quite a bidding war.

313
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:50,019
Well, to the victor go the spoils.

314
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,920
You know my family crest.

315
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:55,031
Our motto continues to inspire.

316
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:59,097
- Ad Victorem Spolias.
- Fantastic.

317
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:03,132
- Well, shall we?
- Yeah.

318
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,008
Join us.

319
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,482
So you follow the art world, Mr. Conrad?

320
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:19,715
I try to. My girlfriend runs
The Cronin Gallery downtown.

321
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:23,123
I would love to meet her.
We must have brunch tomorrow.

322
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:26,555
They can speak about beauty.
We can speak about business.

323
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:28,560
Sounds perfect.

324
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:31,134
I'll have my assistant
make the arrangements.

325
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:43,037
OK, what the hell just happened?
This guys supposed to be my client.

326
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:45,979
- You're still just an analyst...
- No, no, this is better.

327
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:48,052
I didn't know it was
going to be a double date.

328
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:51,321
Tim's the only one here who
isn't divorced or dating a hooker.

329
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:58,523
This guy wants to invest $100 million.
Don't mess it up. We need this.

330
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:03,324
Well, the sixth floor steps up.

331
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,525
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

332
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:09,834
Hey, rooting for you, buddy, Good luck.

333
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,172
- My girlfriend's not a hooker.
- She tried to give me a BJ.

334
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,905
If she didn't ask for money,
then she's not a hooker, is she?

335
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:21,678
She asked me for money. It
wasn't that expensive, either.

336
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,788
I still had a ton of singles left
over from your sister's birthday party.

337
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:27,118
Hey, is Cinnamon a family name?

338
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,428
- Hey, honey.
- Hey!

339
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:39,024
Glad you're still here. Look,
don't make plans tomorrow morning.

340
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,536
Why?

341
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:45,535
How'd you like to have brunch
with a fascinating Swiss couple?

342
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:47,700
- OK.
- She's an art collector

343
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,244
and he's got a lot of money.

344
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:52,872
- I need you. This is huge.
- it's huge?

345
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,719
- Really huge.
- What's this?

346
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:02,056
What is this?

347
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,221
That's a...

348
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:08,793
It's a mouse dressed like Jesus.

349
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:12,463
This guy that I ran into
today, he makes them.

350
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:16,061
He's amazing. He's some kind of artisan.

351
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:19,632
Really? Are you doing that dinner?

352
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,233
No.

353
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,742
- Hey, come on.
- No, not when you're lying to me.

354
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,680
- Julie, Fender invited me.
- So?

355
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,848
Fender, as in Fender Financial?

356
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,586
The you I know would have just said no.

357
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:39,525
The me that you know did say no.

358
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:42,030
But the me that you
don't know had to say yes.

359
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,259
- The you I don't know?
- Yes.

360
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,695
Look, there's you and
the me that you know.

361
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,534
And we love each other and
we have a wonderful life.

362
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,608
But then there's the
me that you don't know.

363
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:55,211
And the me that you don't know has
to do things sometimes so that you

364
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:58,037
and the me that you know can
live in this nice apartment,

365
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,878
and eat at nice restaurants
and go to Cabo for Christmas.

366
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:02,884
- He takes care of us.
- You know what?

367
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,114
There should not be
any you I don't know.

368
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:07,282
But there is. You might not like him.

369
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,951
I don't like him. I hate
him! But we need him.

370
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,962
- You know? It's like the CIA.
- The CIA?

371
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,157
The CIA does some pretty funky,
nasty stuff in the shadows,

372
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,961
but I, for one, am glad they're there.

373
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:20,196
The CIA doesn't invite people to dinner

374
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:24,365
- to make fun of them.
- No. The CIA kills people.

375
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:27,376
And I'm getting raked over the
coals because of a little dinner.

376
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,911
Can I just ask you something?

377
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:32,744
Is there any you I don't know
who isn't completely full of shit?

378
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:36,012
I'd love to talk to him right now.

379
00:25:37,343 --> 00:25:38,913
Julie, come on. Julie!

380
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:44,326
Julie! Julie, where are you going?

381
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,187
I... I have to go meet Kieran
and talk about San Francisco.

382
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,198
Julie, please come out of the elevator.
All right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:52,165
I'll call him, I'll tell
him the dinner's off.

384
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:55,102
- I want to believe you.
- You can believe me.

385
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:56,831
I'll never see that guy in my life.

386
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,102
- Yeah.
- I promise.

387
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,673
Oh, my,,, Let's talk later.

388
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:03,836
- In a few hours.
- What?

389
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:04,937
I think we need to cool off.

390
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:07,381
- Gosh, I hate when that happens.
- We'll talk in a bit, OK?

391
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:09,884
- Just give ourselves a moment...
- I gotta go to work.

392
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,784
I feel like I'm in The Shining.

393
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:18,218
You are welcome.

394
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,263
Oh, God. My back, my back, my back.

395
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:23,196
Is it your back?

396
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:24,961
What the hell are you doing here?

397
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:26,365
Well, I went to the address you gave me.

398
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:30,029
Nobody was there. Are we
having this dinner or not?

399
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:33,973
OK, just... slow.

400
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:37,605
Au right.

401
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:43,317
- What are you doing?
- I'm applying heat.

402
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,717
Barry, please stop doing that.

403
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:52,218
- I'm gonna ix your back.
- Barry, stop!

404
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,319
I am a trained taxidermist.

405
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:56,895
- And I am alive.
- You are tight.

406
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:59,630
- Oh, God!
- OK...

407
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:01,304
Look at that face!

408
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:03,834
- Stop it!
- OK, all right.

409
00:27:05,397 --> 00:27:08,970
- I hope this doesn't mess up dinner.
- We're not having dinner tonight.

410
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,911
- it's tomorrow,
- I don'! think so, Tim.

411
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:15,609
Barry, I made the
plans. I know when it is.

412
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:19,249
- I'm pretty sure it's tonight.
- it's not tonight.

413
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:22,758
OK. All right. I guess
one of us got confused.

414
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:29,964
Great. She left her phone here.

415
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:33,466
You know what they say,
everything happens for a reason.

416
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:35,663
YOU Said That.

417
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:38,304
You know what, Barry?

418
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,707
I am really, really looking forward
to our dinner tomorrow night.

419
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:45,976
But, right now, I'd
appreciate it if you just left.

420
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:50,281
And the reason is...'?

421
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:51,887
Because I got in a
right with my girlfriend,

422
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:56,050
and because I'd like to be here
alone when she comes back, OK?

423
00:27:56,882 --> 00:28:00,830
- What if she doesn't come back?
- She's coming back.

424
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:06,999
Hey, we are gonna get
through this together.

425
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:10,073
I think I know someone who
might make you feel better.

426
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:17,409
Remember this guy from
the street? This is you.

427
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,744
Barry, that was a dead mouse in the road

428
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,978
a couple of hours ago. Please
get it away from my face.

429
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:26,385
It's like looking in a mirror,
isn't it? You feel better?

430
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,822
- it's amazing.
- Are you cheered up?

431
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:32,485
Barry, I have a back
brace in my bedroom.

432
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:35,495
If you could just help
me get off this couch...

433
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,822
Sure.

434
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:39,266
I wan! to do this very
slowly and carefully.

435
00:28:40,326 --> 00:28:41,327
On the count of...

436
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:42,494
Three!

437
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,909
- All you.
- All right.

438
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,918
Now, I... If I could just...

439
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:02,582
You can do it. You got it!

440
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:05,855
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Tim!

441
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:08,431
- You got this! I'll help!
- No, no, no! I have it.

442
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:10,700
- All right.
- I'm good.

443
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,801
Tim, you look good!

444
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:23,097
What are you doing?

445
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:27,342
- What are you doing?
- Computer,

446
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,212
Oh, my God! You gave her my address?!

447
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:36,548
- She's very concerned about you.
- Barry, this woman is a nightmare.

448
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,481
She's been stalking me for three years!

449
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:42,114
I slept with her one night,
biggest mistake of my life.

450
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:45,626
- It was before I even met Julie.
- Why did you do that?

451
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,624
Because it was New Years and I was drunk

452
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,324
arid she was wearing
these fishnet stockings

453
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:51,628
You want me to tell her not to come?

454
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,633
Go. Go.

455
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,968
Come to dinner tomorrow and
that's it. Let's go. Move!

456
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:01,168
Come on! Go, go!

457
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:06,480
- Oh, my God, what have you done?
- I'm gonna make it up to you.

458
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:39,077
OK! OK!

459
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:42,782
Well, well, well. If it isn't
little miss panty bottom.

460
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:46,018
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I am a friend of Tim's.

461
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:48,590
- Yeah, I don't know you.
- Oh, you don't?

462
00:31:48,914 --> 00:31:50,359
So you know everything about Tim?

463
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:54,089
You are the world's greatest
expert on all things Tim?

464
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,396
Did Tim invite you to
a dinner tomorrow night?

465
00:31:57,523 --> 00:31:59,628
According to him, it
is tomorrow night, yes.

466
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:03,069
Right. You want my advice?

467
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,206
- Don't go.
- OK, may I give you some advice, too?

468
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,246
Do not wear fishnets on New Year’s Eve.

469
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:14,647
It's too cold. When the wind
blows, you gotta go with the hose.

470
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:18,050
- You know what? I really need to...
- Now, Darla, Darla, come on,,,

471
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:20,384
- Darla?
- Yes. He told me all about you.

472
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,392
Really? What did Tim tell you about me?

473
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:26,556
Told me about the sex.

474
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,890
The Sex?

475
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:33,665
The dirty, dirty sex. But he
lives with a woman named Julie,

476
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,794
and if she comes home and
Ends you, that, that...

477
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,771
You can imagine how she would feel.

478
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,740
Yeah, I imagine she'd
be pretty pissed off.

479
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,636
I gotta nip this in the bud.

480
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:46,142
- You gotta move along.
- You tell your friend, Tim, he can...

481
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:48,012
You tell him he can kiss my ass.

482
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:50,247
Don't have to. We have a picture.

483
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:58,024
Problem solved. l intercepted
your stalker in the hallway.

484
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,154
Darla showed up? And
you got her to leave?

485
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:04,665
Oh, I don't think you're
ever gonna see her again.

486
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:12,532
- Who is that?
- Kieran Vollard. He's an artist.

487
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:16,271
Very attractive man. He can it
a whole octopus in his mouth.

488
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:18,541
Sort of an animal magnetism about him.

489
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,172
That's what Julie says.

490
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:24,643
"For Julie. Thanks for
everything. Kieran."

491
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:29,056
- Everything?
- Yeah, she curated his show.

492
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:31,786
Bet that's not all she curated.

493
00:33:32,117 --> 00:33:34,324
I don't know what that means, Barry.

494
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:37,024
Well, I don't know what curated means.

495
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:38,156
Where is she?

496
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,302
Working.

497
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,174
Probably with Kieran.

498
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:48,335
Where? In his bed?

499
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,812
I seriously doubt they’re
working in his bed.

500
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,510
Well, if they're not working,
why are they in his bed?

501
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:58,420
Tim, you need to call Kieran's
house and see if she's there.

502
00:33:58,544 --> 00:33:59,716
I'm not doing that.

503
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:01,381
It's the only way you're
gonna know for sure.

504
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:03,151
- I'm not calling.
- I'm telling you...

505
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:06,821
No, I'm not gonna call Kieran and
say I don't know where Julie is.

506
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:08,396
- Do it. Do it.
- No. No.

507
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,521
All right, I will.

508
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:12,101
What reason could you
possibly have for calling him?

509
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:14,704
I want to make a movie about his life.

510
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:17,670
I want to make a documentary.
I gain his confidence,

511
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:20,503
and then he starts feeling more
relaxed about talking to me.

512
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,509
He's really opening up to me.

513
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,841
We're talking about
his sex life and then...

514
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,578
...Julie's name pops up
and we've got it on tape!

515
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:30,618
- Yeah.
- He's been curated!

516
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:33,713
Well, that sounds like
a bullet-proof plan.

517
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,847
What's his number?

518
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:39,427
-One-1-1...1-1...
- Hold on.

519
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:41,186
OK. Go.

520
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:42,855
- One-1 -1
- Got that.

521
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,633
One-1

522
00:34:44,756 --> 00:34:46,463
- One-1.
- OK.

523
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:55,276
He must've changed his number.
I'm just getting a weird sound.

524
00:34:56,101 --> 00:34:57,478
Oh, well. We tried.

525
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,273
There he is. Kieran Vollard. I got him.

526
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:03,209
Don'!! Don't!

527
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,818
- I'm serious. Don't call him.
- it's ringing...

528
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:08,322
Hang up the phone.

529
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:09,926
Hang up the phone!

530
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:11,755
I'm gonna do an accent.

531
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:13,885
Don't do an accent. Hang up the phone.

532
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:17,625
- Hello?
- Hello! How are you?

533
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:19,599
This is Nigel!

534
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:22,433
I'm a documentary filmmaker

535
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:24,939
-from London, England.
- Hang up!

536
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:27,839
May I speak to Kieran Vollard, please?

537
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:30,572
- This is Kieran.
- Kieran.

538
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:34,310
I want to make a
documentary about your life.

539
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:39,153
Start the water, I’ll be right
in. Yeah, I could do an interview.

540
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:43,191
Smashing! Champagne
wishes and caviar dreams!

541
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,522
I will have my man-servant
Contact you with the details.

542
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:47,597
That sounded like Julie's laugh.

543
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:50,757
She might've been there!

544
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:53,427
- I'm going over there.
- No, Tim!

545
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:56,599
You can't drive in this condition.

546
00:35:57,996 --> 00:36:00,476
Clutch! Oh, God, use the clu...

547
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,943
You can’t just shift. You
need to use the clutch, Barry.

548
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:04,440
Oh, God.

549
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:10,681
OK, hold on. I'll get it.

550
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:16,948
No, no, no, no...

551
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:18,458
- OK.
- I got it.

552
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,161
She's gotta be in there.

553
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:31,003
Just need to get her attention.

554
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,140
Those were my car keys, weren't they?

555
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:51,684
Oh, God.

556
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:58,824
Here we go. Let's do this thing.

557
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:02,736
Barry! Barry, just... Just
get the keys and come back!

558
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:05,174
Barry!

559
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:11,514
I am inside the apartment.

560
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:14,777
I know. I want you out of the apartment.
Get the keys and let's get out of here!

561
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,614
Oh, Tim, I wish you could
see this place! It's amazing!

562
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:19,620
I thought you had a
great apartment.. This...

563
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:23,784
This, my friend... Oh, my God!

564
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:29,063
He's friends with Morgan Freeman.

565
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:31,696
Please get the hell out of there.

566
00:37:36,027 --> 00:37:37,097
He's coming!

567
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:20,145
- Cat got the Tim mouse!
- Forget about the mouse! Come on!

568
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,914
Get the keys and get out of there!

569
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:24,246
Forget the mouse!

570
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:38,931
Thank you. Hey! He's OK!

571
00:38:39,991 --> 00:38:41,265
Hide! Hide!

572
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,512
Kieran, I'm ready.

573
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:03,651
Barry!

574
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:05,454
Barry!

575
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,388
Julie's here.

576
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:16,904
Oh, yes..

577
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:19,664
Sounds like they're having intercourse.

578
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:22,404
That's it. Oh, fantastic.

579
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,813
I'm having trouble describing
what I'm looking at.

580
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:32,216
Fly, fly...

581
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:37,850
Yes! Primordial...

582
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:47,192
Hello.

583
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:49,427
Who are you?

584
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:50,996
I'm...

585
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,168
Monique, Christina, this is Tim.

586
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:56,103
He's a stockbroker,
or something like that.

587
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:59,904
- Tim, can I help you?
- No, no, no. Sorry, I...

588
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:01,176
I'm Nigel Nigel!

589
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:05,010
- I'm here doing a documentary!
- You can stop that now, Barry.

590
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:09,852
My name's not Barry! So,
what have you done with Julie?

591
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:12,757
Tim... has Julie left you?

592
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:18,089
Oh, Tim. I was always very
attracted to Julie and I still am.

593
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,031
You must be broken. She's
a wonderful creature.

594
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:22,193
Stop...

595
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,203
I have to say, though,
Tim, I'm not surprised.

596
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:26,531
- Really?
- There's not a lot of monogamy

597
00:40:26,698 --> 00:40:30,703
in the animal kingdom. Not many
animals mate for life. Penguins do.

598
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:33,214
I've spent a lot of time with
penguins, and they're really cool.

599
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:36,784
And maybe you're a penguin,
Tim, but Julie's not a penguin.

600
00:40:36,908 --> 00:40:41,050
She's a lioness. Don't try to
mate a lioness with a penguin.

601
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:46,252
Ever. Have you ever seen
a mammal and a bird mate?

602
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,159
I've never even heard of that.

603
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:51,756
Is that right? You
gonna try and tame her?

604
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:57,101
- 'Cause I don't think you're her type.
- Maybe. But I have something.

605
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,230
Something that women respond to.

606
00:40:59,564 --> 00:41:02,738
That's true. Julie and
I have been saying that.

607
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:06,906
- Tim doesn't get it.
- He's right. Listen to your friend.

608
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,952
Am I gonna make love with
Christina and Monique tonight?

609
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:13,249
Yeah! Hell, yes! Guilty.
You caught me out. Yeah.

610
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:15,584
But only because it's
part of my process.

611
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,250
Your "process"?

612
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,152
There are two things in this world:

613
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:25,127
Wonderful, visceral, sexy sex...

614
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:26,667
...and death.

615
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,967
Horrible, boring death.

616
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:36,268
Now, I'm gonna go off and have some
sex with these girls before I die.

617
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,711
Go ahead.

618
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:40,043
If you guys wanna join, that's cool.

619
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:42,276
But don't look at me in
the eye. It puts me off.

620
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,150
- What?
- OK, you're not into it. That's cool.

621
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:48,553
Good to see ya, Tim, Thanks
for visiting. Great to meet you.

622
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:54,460
I wanna grow a beard.

623
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,032
I know you're set on a
documentary, but hear me out...

624
00:41:59,157 --> 00:42:03,333
Charlize Theron plays
Julie. Kieran plays himself.

625
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:05,634
I don't know. It is
something to think about.

626
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:07,140
Three, two, one...

627
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:11,976
Oh, my God.

628
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,313
Oh, my God! How did you do that?

629
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:20,152
A human back and a rodent
back are eerily similar.

630
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:23,317
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

631
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,416
Now, go.

632
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,492
- What about dinner?
- It's tomorrow, Barry. Tomorrow.

633
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,900
That's interesting.

634
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:36,028
You say you're over Darla and yet you
have a picture of her in your apartment.

635
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:37,765
How does Julie feel about that?

636
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,545
That is Julie.

637
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,282
Barry, is that the woman
you talked to in the hallway?

638
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,921
Well...

639
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,415
Well...

640
00:42:57,182 --> 00:42:59,184
She has the same face.

641
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,528
I'll get the door.

642
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,791
Where's Tim?

643
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:13,706
- Oh, God.
- Well, well.

644
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:18,971
You blew it with Julie. Just
like you blew it with me.

645
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:23,712
Poor little Timmy.
You missed your chance.

646
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,048
And you'll never have me again.

647
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:29,387
- Let's go.
- You're hurting me.

648
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,951
- I'm not," Stop it.
- Please, stop hurting me.

649
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:36,930
- I'm not even touching you.
- Why do we keep doing this?

650
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:40,930
You know, some day, I'm
really gonna leave you.

651
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:49,308
All right, go, go! Get
out of my house, right now!

652
00:43:51,736 --> 00:43:53,443
You're very cruel, Tim.

653
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:56,916
- Hello.
- Who's your friend?

654
00:43:57,075 --> 00:43:58,611
Barry, his name's Barry.

655
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:02,454
Wanna watch while I
screw Barry's brains out?

656
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,255
- I can honestly say no to that one.
- Oh, really?

657
00:44:07,252 --> 00:44:09,163
So, do you guys wanna get pizza?

658
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:14,096
Wanna lick cheese off my naked body?

659
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:15,829
I'm sure Tim has plates.

660
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,262
Hello?

661
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:19,774
Hey, who’s Dana? I just
met your friend earlier.

662
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:21,309
He told me some pretty
interesting things

663
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:23,469
- about this woman.
- What did he saw

664
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:27,447
- Oh, I don't know. He spoke about...
- Oh, wow, you're like a friendly dog.

665
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,877
- ...talked about sex... What?

666
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:31,351
What exactly did he say?

667
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:33,387
Can you just tell me?
Are you cheating on me?

668
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:35,782
lt's not a difficult question to answer!

669
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,521
- Hello? Are you cheating on me?
- She put it in her pants.

670
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:41,790
Tim! I don't know why it's
so hard for you to answer..

671
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:43,899
Julie! You're crazy to think
that I'm cheating on you!

672
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:47,003
That's insane! Where
are you? Where are you?

673
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,696
- Julie!
- I think I hung up.

674
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:51,696
You have no right!

675
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,908
No right? Barry, we're gonna be a while.

676
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,478
- You're a crazy person.
- All right, I'll be here.

677
00:44:56,801 --> 00:45:00,476
Hey, Tim? Tim?

678
00:45:00,805 --> 00:45:02,978
- Tim?
- Oh, God...

679
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:06,020
Tim? Timmy Tim?

680
00:45:06,144 --> 00:45:08,556
What do you say? Should
we drive him crazy?

681
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:10,820
OK!

682
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:14,089
I'm a naughty little schoolgirl!

683
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:15,994
You look a little old
to be a schoolgirl.

684
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:18,192
I need to be punished.

685
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:20,530
Hey, Naomi, how you doing? It's Tim.

686
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:22,763
I'm wondering if
you've heard from Julie.

687
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:25,204
Don't you wanna be my schoolteacher?

688
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,401
I'm really not qualified.
I work for the IRS.

689
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:29,443
- No, no, no...
- Not tonight.

690
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:32,270
- No, all the time. I work...
- OK, OK.

691
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:36,874
You work for the IRS,
and I have been very...

692
00:45:37,008 --> 00:45:40,387
- ...very bad.
- Have you heard from Julie?

693
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:42,115
- I haven't paid my taxes...
- No?

694
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:45,524
...and I need to be spanked! Now!

695
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,523
Well, that's really
not the way it works.

696
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,259
You probably just have to pay
the difference, plus interest.

697
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:52,026
OK, I...

698
00:45:52,123 --> 00:45:54,433
- I need you to spank me real hard.
- I'm looking for Julie.

699
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:57,205
Spank me hard, Barry!

700
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:59,366
- Barry!
- No, no. That's the TV.

701
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,876
Oh, yeah! Oh, Barry!

702
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:07,573
Yeah! Oh, Barry!

703
00:46:13,044 --> 00:46:15,081
Oh, Barry!

704
00:46:15,213 --> 00:46:18,456
If she gets in touch with you, please
tell her to call me. It's an emergency.

705
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:21,491
You're like some crazy
animal all over...

706
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:24,561
- I wanna be a penguin!
- I like to eat penguins.

707
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,493
Hope you don't catch me.
Penguins are very slow.

708
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:28,394
Except I'm Turbo Penguin!

709
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:32,440
Come here... I'm gonna catch you...

710
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:35,937
Did you hurt your knee?

711
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:39,640
Barry, that's funny, You
are a bad little penguin.

712
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:42,640
Don't get me!

713
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:45,480
Come here!

714
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:58,327
- You're gonna die.
- No, I'm not.

715
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,761
Oh, God.

716
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:15,440
God!

717
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:25,850
Barry?

718
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:30,232
Tim? Call me! OK?

719
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:33,632
This was so much fun! I love you!

720
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:37,295
Forever And ever...

721
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,917
Barry! Barry.

722
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:56,488
Works every time.

723
00:47:56,647 --> 00:48:00,390
If you are attacked, you
should always play dead.

724
00:48:00,518 --> 00:48:02,555
People don't want to punch
something that's dead.

725
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:04,264
- it's instinctual.
- She's gone?

726
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,335
Yes, she is.

727
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:09,165
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, we had a little bit of a ruckus.

728
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,001
Oh, my God!

729
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:13,436
- That your phone?
- Julie's.

730
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:20,705
Kieran.

731
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:25,385
Hey listen, when you get up there,
let the horse into the pasture.

732
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,581
She loves to run around in the grass.

733
00:48:27,712 --> 00:48:29,749
Grab a bottle of wine,
make yourself a fire,

734
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:32,521
stay as long as you want.
This is gonna be good for you.

735
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:35,962
- She's going to his ranch.
- Oh, my God.

736
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:39,026
- That's code.
- What?

737
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:42,366
It's code, Tim. You
should watch Law & Order:

738
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:48,537
Horse is heroin. Grass is marijuana.

739
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:51,976
The horse likes to run
around on the grass.

740
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,743
The heroin likes to run
around on the marijuana.

741
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:59,082
Wine. Alcohol.

742
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,951
Like beer. Or wine.

743
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,724
Oh, man, they are planning
one hell of a party.

744
00:49:04,882 --> 00:49:06,793
It's gonna be wild up there.

745
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:11,264
I think that you need to get out of
my house in the next... 30 seconds,

746
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:13,630
before I beat you to death with
the chair that you're sitting in.

747
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,768
- What?
- You have to go. I want you to go.

748
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:21,335
- Who's gonna help you with Julie?
- Who's gonna help me with Julie?

749
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:23,104
You didn't really
just say that, did you?

750
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:25,145
Because of you, Julie
thinks I'm having an affair

751
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:26,646
and she's on her way to Kieran's ranch!

752
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:29,081
Whatever you do, don't
help me with Julie!

753
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,516
We should go there and we
should explain the whole mix-up.

754
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:34,782
I don't know where it is. It's
unlisted! He goes there to disappear!

755
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:39,190
Please, please, I'm
begging you! Go, leave, go!

756
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:40,352
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,656
I'm sorry, Tim.

758
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:52,271
Wait. Tim, Tim!

759
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,606
I work at the Canoga Processing Center.

760
00:49:56,767 --> 00:50:00,772
It's only the second-largest [RS
processing center on the west coast.

761
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:02,713
And you're telling me
this now because...?

762
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,289
If Kieran has a ranch, we can ind
the address from his tax return.

763
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:12,123
And if he's up there sleeping with
Julie, that's not business-related.

764
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:13,559
He can't deduct that.

765
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:20,167
- You can get me his tax returns?
- No. But I know somebody who can.

766
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:24,405
- There it is, The mother ship.
- It looks deserted.

767
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:27,635
No, no, no. He's in there.
My boss never sleeps.

768
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:30,074
Be careful around this guy.

769
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,807
- He can tell what you're thinking.
- What are you talking about?

770
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,408
Don't look him in the eye. Don't
think any embarrassing thoughts.

771
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:39,249
Just keep your mind blank.

772
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:47,328
Therman? I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Tim Conrad.

773
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:49,393
Hi.

774
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:54,762
I could use some help and Barry
says you're just the man for the job.

775
00:50:55,726 --> 00:50:56,761
Have 3 Seat.

776
00:50:57,495 --> 00:51:00,442
I did an audit on a Steven
Conrad two years ago.

777
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:01,600
Any relation?

778
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:05,180
- Where does he live?
- Bayside State Prison.

779
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:06,838
He's doing seven years.

780
00:51:08,906 --> 00:51:10,852
Are you hiding something, Mr, Conrad?

781
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:15,351
- What is it that you do for a living?
- Don't ask. He makes money.

782
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:17,618
Nobody knows where
it comes from, though.

783
00:51:17,748 --> 00:51:19,625
Shall we take a look
at his return, Barry?

784
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:25,193
Guys, I think we're getting
a little off track here.

785
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,394
- Look, I'm in a little bit of a rush.
- That's him.

786
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:31,936
Guys, I don't have much time, so...

787
00:51:34,298 --> 00:51:36,039
Mr. Conrad...

788
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:41,712
Men lie to me a thousand times a day.

789
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,781
And my job is to End
the truth. Right, Barry?

790
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,553
I've studied the human mind.

791
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:55,892
I've learned how to read it
and, ultimately, control it.

792
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,898
This is fascinating, I
can't wait to read it.

793
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,128
It's $14.99 on my website,

794
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:02,737
- OK.
- Plus shipping and handling.

795
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:04,395
Even if I buy it here?

796
00:52:04,495 --> 00:52:08,568
It's shipped from somewhere else,
isn't it? And I've been handling it.

797
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:12,439
Could you just tell
Therman why we're here?

798
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:16,746
We are looking for an address of
a nondeductible vacation property.

799
00:52:17,975 --> 00:52:20,114
You are looking for
someone or something.

800
00:52:22,146 --> 00:52:26,458
That's exactly right. Tim is
looking for his girlfriend.

801
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:30,191
She ran off with an artist. They
are probably sleeping together.

802
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,267
- Oh, God...
- Your girlfriend has left you.

803
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:35,870
- Tim, he can see right through you.
- Well, you also just told him that.

804
00:52:36,193 --> 00:52:38,503
Are you still skeptical, Mr, Conrad?

805
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,206
Watch this. Barry...

806
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:44,869
What is he doing?

807
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,276
He's making me do something.
What is he making me do?

808
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:51,682
You're not doing anything, Barry.

809
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:53,880
That's right, Barry.
You're not doing anything.

810
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,283
I'm not doing anything.

811
00:52:57,381 --> 00:53:02,558
- I'm paralyzed, Oh, God.
- God can't hear you, Barry.

812
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:04,633
- Tim?
- Tim can't hear you, Barry.

813
00:53:04,722 --> 00:53:08,966
- No, actually, I can hear him.
- My body’s a prison.

814
00:53:10,394 --> 00:53:15,309
This is so painful, I can't move, Tim.

815
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:19,671
Tim, help me. Help me, Tim.

816
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:22,307
All right, you know what, Barry?
Just move. You can do it. Just move.

817
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:27,812
I release you.

818
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:35,724
OK, I will never take movement
for granted, ever again.

819
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:39,934
Well, I was wrong. Apparently,
his brain really is your puppet.

820
00:53:40,257 --> 00:53:41,861
I need an address.

821
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:45,872
- Can you help me, please?
- Perhaps. For a price.

822
00:53:45,996 --> 00:53:46,997
How much?

823
00:53:47,164 --> 00:53:51,704
I just need to hear Barry
say, "You can eat my pudding."

824
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:54,280
No.

825
00:53:55,005 --> 00:53:58,009
Barry, I can make you say it.

826
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:03,621
But with your own free will,
say, "You can eat my pudding."

827
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:05,591
I’m not gonna say it.

828
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:08,026
Barry, I'm gonna eat it, anyway!

829
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,033
But I want you to say,
"You can eat my pudding!"

830
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:17,036
Barry, I will give you a thousand
dollars if you say it, right now.

831
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:21,138
A thousand dollars? Barry,
your friend is a high roller.

832
00:54:21,866 --> 00:54:25,370
- You are hiding something.
- Wait a minute. No, wait...

833
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,543
Can we just stick to the issue at hand?

834
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:33,048
You almost had me. But you cannot
declare offshore investment losses

835
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:37,416
against future capital
gains. Any child knows that.

836
00:54:37,548 --> 00:54:41,553
I'll have to ask my
accountant about that.

837
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:01,610
Mr. Conrad...

838
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:04,685
,,,you, my friend... are being audited.

839
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,755
NO, HO, HO.

840
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:08,857
Call the 800 number.

841
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:11,684
I release you.

842
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:15,891
Hey, Tim?

843
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,630
I guess you just have to remember
what the wise man once said...

844
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:26,338
"Everything happens for a reason."

845
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,143
- You know who said that?
- Shut up, Barry.

846
00:55:31,303 --> 00:55:33,647
- You did. You're the wise man.
- Don't talk.

847
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,685
Don't say a word. Don't move your lips.

848
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:44,261
Oh, my God. It's
Martha. it's my ex-wife.

849
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:53,093
There's my magic man.

850
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:06,883
- Look at you. OK,
- Get in the car, Pudding.

851
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,694
I used to call her Pudding.

852
00:56:22,025 --> 00:56:24,869
Look, why don't we just each
go home, we'll get some sleep,

853
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:26,099
and I'll see you tomorrow at the dinner.

854
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:27,965
OK.

855
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:33,141
I think I left my bus
pass at your apartment.

856
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,216
- I'll drive you home.
- OK.

857
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:39,382
I left my keys at your apartment, too.

858
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:44,084
That's OK. You know what? I'll
just sleep here. I have a cubicle.

859
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:46,058
- I can pull two chairs together.
- it's all right.

860
00:56:46,217 --> 00:56:48,629
- Get in the car.
- I can fashion them into a bed.

861
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,290
They... Well, they son of
roll apart in the middle, so...

862
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:53,061
- Barry, Barry...
- ...you sag,

863
00:56:53,224 --> 00:56:55,170
- You can stay with me.
- Don't worry about me.

864
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,672
- I insist.
- Really?

865
00:56:57,797 --> 00:57:00,243
- Yeah.
- I won't cramp your style?

866
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,177
- it's already cramped.
- OK.

867
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:17,592
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna propose to her?

868
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:19,753
I have, a few times.

869
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,265
- Why do you keep carrying this around?
- In case she changes her mind.

870
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,797
- Please don't go through my pockets.
- OK.

871
00:57:29,263 --> 00:57:30,298
Hey, Tim?

872
00:57:31,165 --> 00:57:33,270
The first night alone
is always the hardest

873
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:36,208
I can sleep in there
with you if you want.

874
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:38,110
No, thank you.

875
00:57:38,273 --> 00:57:40,275
Hey, just don't think about
the fact that you can't sleep.

876
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:43,783
Because then you're sunk. Then you
just start thinking, "Whats going on?"

877
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:46,859
Your mind starts
reeling. "Where's Julie?

878
00:57:46,982 --> 00:57:49,793
Oh, she's with Kieran. Is
he a better lover than I am?

879
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:52,729
Yes, he is." Don't think about that.

880
00:57:52,856 --> 00:57:54,699
Get those thoughts out of your head.

881
00:57:56,026 --> 00:58:00,703
- Why are you putting on aftershave?
- Force of habit.

882
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,744
When I was married, I used to
stay up late working on my mice,

883
00:58:03,868 --> 00:58:06,007
and Martha hated the
smell of formaldehyde.

884
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:12,411
You can smell them both,
Barry. Two layers of bad smell,

885
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:16,485
That's exactly what Martha used to say.

886
00:58:18,183 --> 00:58:19,423
Good night.

887
00:58:28,027 --> 00:58:29,404
Tim?

888
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,744
- Tim?
- What, Barry?

889
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:38,679
I can't sleep. I'm too
excited about dinner.

890
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,843
- Oh, God!
- What are you gonna wear?

891
00:58:41,008 --> 00:58:43,352
Should I rent a tux?
Or is that too formal?

892
00:58:43,444 --> 00:58:44,354
Here's the thing:

893
00:58:44,678 --> 00:58:47,522
It's always better to be
overdressed than underdressed, right?

894
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,431
Thanks, Tim! That's great!

895
00:58:58,426 --> 00:59:02,465
Oh, he ate it! He's eating paper!

896
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:04,636
NO...

897
01:00:09,937 --> 01:00:14,044
I'll be back in a few hours.
Don't play with the stove.

898
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:16,849
Don't do anything with electricity.

899
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:19,717
Do you understand?

900
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:21,987
Sometimes I think you
think I'm an idiot.

901
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:24,393
Just stay in the chair. Promise me.

902
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:28,467
I will. I will stay in the chair.
Why is this brunch so important?

903
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,737
Because the future of
my career depends on it.

904
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,840
It's a very important potential client.

905
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,805
- I can help.
- You want to help me?

906
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,910
- Stay in the chair.
- OK.

907
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,204
I'll pick you up for dinner. All right?

908
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,344
- You gonna stay in that chair? Yes.

909
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,680
That's it.

910
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,020
Hello?

911
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:58,327
You got everything you need for brunch?

912
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:03,763
OK, you got me working Saturday, so
I'm billing you overtime for this.

913
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:06,876
You're going to Madison
Restaurant, 10am.

914
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:11,004
Don't be late, They're Swiss.
And make sure Julie's there.

915
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:14,276
- They're dying to meet her.
- OK, Julie'Il be there.

916
01:01:15,774 --> 01:01:16,878
Tim?

917
01:01:17,009 --> 01:01:18,579
Tim!

918
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,525
Tim?

919
01:01:33,628 --> 01:01:37,735
Tim? Tim! Tim!

920
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:40,306
Hi, Tim? We switched phones.

921
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:44,109
I need to talk to you. Julie
has to go to that brunch! OK.

922
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:53,559
Hi, Tim, me again. I just
realized you can't get my messages.

923
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:58,662
My password is
P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D. OK.

924
01:02:00,923 --> 01:02:02,630
Oh, God!

925
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:05,731
You can't get that message,
either! Why am I...'?!

926
01:02:11,802 --> 01:02:14,248
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

927
01:02:15,472 --> 01:02:17,474
We feared that some
disaster had befallen you.

928
01:02:17,808 --> 01:02:20,584
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- And where is...?

929
01:02:20,744 --> 01:02:24,921
Julie sends her regrets.
She dropped a box on her foot

930
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:29,192
- and broke a distal phalange.
- Please wish her a swift recovery.

931
01:02:29,321 --> 01:02:32,131
I had hoped for another
woman to lend some poetry.

932
01:02:32,257 --> 01:02:33,930
I understood from my husband

933
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:36,937
I would not have to suffer
another business conversation.

934
01:02:37,096 --> 01:02:39,474
What was it Baudelaire said?

935
01:02:39,598 --> 01:02:42,044
"Misunderstanding makes
the world go 'round."

936
01:02:42,168 --> 01:02:44,512
I see we will have poetry after all.

937
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:47,880
It is rare to find an American
businessman with a sense of culture.

938
01:02:59,553 --> 01:03:03,525
Tim! It's me again! Barry!
Disregard all previous messages!

939
01:03:03,858 --> 01:03:07,635
I figured it out! Help
is on the way! Bye!

940
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:12,511
Obviously, many of the
strategies are complex.

941
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:16,548
- I imagine you have several questions.
- I am a simple man, Mr. Conrad.

942
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:20,643
My father left me with very
little, except for all of his money.

943
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:23,983
The world is full of people
who want to separate me from it.

944
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:27,651
Why should I trust
you with $100 million?

945
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:29,660
A very fair question.

946
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:33,998
Now, you're obviously
very civilized people.

947
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:37,570
But, unfortunately, the world
of finance is a brutal place.

948
01:03:37,894 --> 01:03:42,173
The good hunters win.
The bad hunters lose.

949
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,574
I am a very good hunter.

950
01:03:44,902 --> 01:03:47,678
You are refreshingly honest, Mr. Conrad.

951
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:51,251
I try to be. I hope we
can do business together.

952
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:53,779
A call for you, sir.

953
01:03:57,015 --> 01:03:59,222
I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Hello?

954
01:03:59,351 --> 01:04:00,591
I got your back, Wm. Can you hear me?

955
01:04:00,919 --> 01:04:02,091
- Hello?
- Hello!

956
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,426
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

957
01:04:03,555 --> 01:04:04,967
Hello. Hello.

958
01:04:06,025 --> 01:04:11,475
Hello. My name is Tim's brother,
Barry, and this is Julie.

959
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:14,237
Tim, look. I brought Julie.

960
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:18,316
Hi, my love. Oh, I have missed you so.

961
01:04:19,873 --> 01:04:20,874
YOU...

962
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:25,080
You know... Your phalange.
You shouldn't be here.

963
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:28,386
Nonsense, She is the picture of health.

964
01:04:28,482 --> 01:04:31,157
Please. Sit. Sit, sit.

965
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:36,325
Thank you.

966
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,470
- Birgit Mueller.
- Such a pleasure.

967
01:04:41,596 --> 01:04:44,100
- Martin Mueller, delighted.
- Such a pleasure.

968
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:47,112
And I am Barry. Delightful.

969
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:52,751
I am so pleased you could join us.
I always say you do not know a man

970
01:04:53,075 --> 01:04:55,682
until you meet his partner in love.

971
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:59,589
I couldn't agree more. I would love
to go over some of these main points.

972
01:04:59,749 --> 01:05:03,595
- Where are you from?!
- We are from Switzerland.

973
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:05,667
You know what? We're
gonna focus on business.

974
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:09,431
Switzerland! I love Switzerland.
It is one of my favorite countries.

975
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:12,768
I love your army knives
with the toothpicks,

976
01:05:13,097 --> 01:05:18,046
And your cheese. Does the cheese
come out of the cow with the holes?

977
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:23,376
Our countries are not
enemies. They are friends.

978
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:26,718
- We are friends,
- You have been to Switzerland?

979
01:05:26,845 --> 01:05:29,621
No, bull have a friend
who drives a Volvo.

980
01:05:29,781 --> 01:05:31,886
And I speak a little of your language.

981
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:39,963
That's my brother. Always joking.

982
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:43,472
It's a jokey joke, ja?

983
01:05:49,837 --> 01:05:53,808
You know, we should continue this
conversation back in my office.

984
01:05:53,974 --> 01:05:56,716
But I have not received my salmon.

985
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:58,518
Or my green salad.

986
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:05,527
So...

987
01:06:05,654 --> 01:06:09,831
...do you and Julie have
wedding bells in your future?

988
01:06:09,992 --> 01:06:14,031
That's kind of a sore topic. He keeps
asking her, but she keeps saying no.

989
01:06:15,164 --> 01:06:19,772
- Ask me again.
- No, it's not the right time.

990
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:23,710
If a woman asks you to
propose, it is the right time.

991
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:25,511
Really, I can't.

992
01:06:25,676 --> 01:06:27,917
- Why not?
- Do it. Do it!

993
01:06:28,045 --> 01:06:29,888
- I don't have a ring.
- Yeah, you do.

994
01:06:30,013 --> 01:06:32,721
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do, it's in your pocket.

995
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:36,263
- Come on, You know you have it...
- Barry...

996
01:06:36,387 --> 01:06:40,563
- Told ya.
- You are a hunter, Mr. Conrad.

997
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,763
There is nothing more
honorable than for a man

998
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:45,074
to join himself to his lady love.

999
01:06:45,863 --> 01:06:50,210
Join yourself to her.
In the name of love.

1000
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:52,805
Join yourself in the name of love.

1001
01:06:54,406 --> 01:06:58,115
You must kneel, Mr.
Conrad. She is a princess.

1002
01:06:58,944 --> 01:07:00,390
Thank you.

1003
01:07:09,823 --> 01:07:11,825
Something's happening!

1004
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,297
- Julie,,,
- Call me Darla.

1005
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:18,933
- Oh, I don't want to call you Darla.
- Julie's just a nickname.

1006
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:22,604
- I want it to be real.
- Look into her eyes.

1007
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,342
Look, look.

1008
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:30,352
There is your home.
There is your future.

1009
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:32,948
I love you, Tim.

1010
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:35,856
Do it, do it, do it!

1011
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:37,931
Do it!

1012
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,864
- Julie.
- Darla.

1013
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:43,864
Darla. Will you marry me?

1014
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,605
Yes. Yes!

1015
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,208
LOOK at that. We did it.

1016
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,886
- Julie.
- I thought this was Julie.

1017
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:05,551
- Nope. I'm Julie.
- They are both Julie.

1018
01:08:05,684 --> 01:08:07,288
Julie and Julie.

1019
01:08:07,385 --> 01:08:09,456
Susana thought you were
gonna lose your promotion

1020
01:08:09,621 --> 01:08:10,964
if I didn't show up today.

1021
01:08:11,056 --> 01:08:14,731
Look at you. You had a
replacement all lined up.

1022
01:08:14,859 --> 01:08:16,669
-Yeah.
- No, no, no.

1023
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:19,333
- This is a huge misunderstanding.
- Let me explain.

1024
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:23,345
This is Darla. She's a naughty
schoolgirl who cheats on her taxes.

1025
01:08:23,469 --> 01:08:25,210
I didn't know whether
you were gonna come today,

1026
01:08:25,337 --> 01:08:27,874
so I brought Darla to keep
things running smoothly.

1027
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,313
Very important potential client.

1028
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:32,218
That clears that up. Yeah. Thank you.

1029
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:36,851
Darling, you're embarrassing
yourself. it's over.

1030
01:08:36,983 --> 01:08:39,930
She's really quite a
catch, Tim. Congratulations.

1031
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:42,734
- No! Julie...
- Nice to have met you.

1032
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:45,531
- He's very crafty.
-Julie! Julie!

1033
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,539
I'm so sorry, I hope we can
continue this at a later date,

1034
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:51,007
- but, actually, I love her.
- Wait, Tim?

1035
01:08:51,332 --> 01:08:54,041
- Julie!
- Tim?

1036
01:08:54,903 --> 01:08:57,008
Julie! Julie, look...

1037
01:08:57,339 --> 01:09:00,047
Wait, wait, I know that looked
awkward, but you've gotta trust me.

1038
01:09:00,175 --> 01:09:03,019
- Trust you?
- Yes. I trust you.

1039
01:09:03,112 --> 01:09:06,026
I know you spent the night at Kieran's
ranch. I know nothing happened.

1040
01:09:06,349 --> 01:09:07,794
Right?

1041
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:09,954
I didn't go to Kieran's
ranch last night.

1042
01:09:10,086 --> 01:09:12,532
- I'm going now.
- No! Don't go! Don't go!

1043
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:15,966
Tim, I have to go. It's my job. We're
going to San Francisco this weekend

1044
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:19,467
to set up for the show. He wants me
to be part of his artistic process.

1045
01:09:19,597 --> 01:09:23,602
His artistic process...
That means sex, Julie.

1046
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:25,941
He told me last nigh! when
I broke into his house!

1047
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,706
You broke into his house?

1048
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:34,485
My God. I guess there
really is a you I don't know.

1049
01:09:36,148 --> 01:09:38,651
It's too bad. I was so in
love with the other one.

1050
01:09:47,126 --> 01:09:48,662
- Hop in.
- MOVE.

1051
01:09:48,795 --> 01:09:49,933
OK.

1052
01:09:56,236 --> 01:09:58,079
Tim, Tim...

1053
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:18,668
May dead!

1054
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:25,105
I don't think you're a
very nice person, Tim.

1055
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:29,445
Just stay out of my life.
And I'm keeping the ring.

1056
01:10:38,515 --> 01:10:41,052
I think that was really good for her.

1057
01:10:49,126 --> 01:10:50,628
See? It works.

1058
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,537
I can't help but think
this is partially my fault.

1059
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:02,675
Really? Well, it is your fault.
it's 100 percent your fault!

1060
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:07,323
I'm sorry.

1061
01:11:16,322 --> 01:11:20,168
Hello, Therman. You win.

1062
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:22,530
You can eat my pudding.

1063
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:27,004
Thirty-one Lighthill
Drive. OK, Therman.

1064
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:39,856
I don't even know who he is anymore.
it's like I'm having a bad dream.

1065
01:11:41,016 --> 01:11:44,122
I mean, am I crazy? Am I
completely delusional, here?

1066
01:11:44,686 --> 01:11:46,688
I don't even know
what's going on anymore.

1067
01:11:49,525 --> 01:11:51,129
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be unloading this.

1068
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,763
I want to photograph you right now.

1069
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,710
I don't think it's the
best time right now, really.

1070
01:12:00,736 --> 01:12:04,150
It is exactly the best time.
I've never seen you like this.

1071
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:08,279
You're so raw, so wonderfully
visible. So beautiful.

1072
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,225
This is weird, Kieran.
I don't think we should...

1073
01:12:11,548 --> 01:12:15,793
Not doing this would be weird.
Keep talking. Tell me about Tim.

1074
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,457
I don't know. I mean, I just...

1075
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:23,602
I just always thought that
there was this decent...

1076
01:12:23,728 --> 01:12:26,573
...basic person underneath it all.

1077
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:29,475
You'd think that you would
know someone after two years.

1078
01:12:29,601 --> 01:12:32,912
But, no. That's bad.

1079
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:38,254
He's such a smooth
talker. So convincing.

1080
01:12:38,577 --> 01:12:41,024
I don't even know if anything
he's ever said to me is true.

1081
01:12:41,147 --> 01:12:44,594
- These pictures are gonna be amazing.
- Kieran, you've lost your mind!

1082
01:12:44,684 --> 01:12:47,096
- This is crazy! No!
- Don't light it, It's art.

1083
01:12:47,253 --> 01:12:48,755
I don't want to take
pictures. Can we just stop it?

1084
01:12:51,024 --> 01:12:52,129
What are you doing here?

1085
01:12:52,259 --> 01:12:54,261
Julie, there's something
I need to tell you.

1086
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:57,104
- Kieran has gonorrhea.
- No, I don't.

1087
01:12:57,264 --> 01:12:59,107
- You might.
- I don't.

1088
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:01,143
- Well, she does, She has gonorrhea.
- What?

1089
01:13:01,268 --> 01:13:02,941
- Don't sleep with her.
- She doesn't.

1090
01:13:03,104 --> 01:13:04,675
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1091
01:13:04,806 --> 01:13:06,786
Because you can get
it from riding the bus.

1092
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:08,853
- No, you can't.
- Yes, you can, Tim.

1093
01:13:08,977 --> 01:13:09,978
That's how my wife got it.

1094
01:13:10,112 --> 01:13:12,683
Barry, no one here has gonorrhea.

1095
01:13:14,383 --> 01:13:15,828
I do.

1096
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:20,062
I have gonorrhea.

1097
01:13:22,725 --> 01:13:26,298
I got gonorrhea from my wife,
who got it from a bus seat.

1098
01:13:26,396 --> 01:13:28,376
And no one should sleep with me.

1099
01:13:33,537 --> 01:13:34,880
OK.

1100
01:13:35,005 --> 01:13:37,713
Could I speak with Julie alone, please?

1101
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:46,355
Tim, you have to tell
her what's in your heart,

1102
01:13:46,484 --> 01:13:48,361
- you have to be honest with her.
- Yeah.

1103
01:13:48,486 --> 01:13:50,659
That's what I did with
Martha, and that did not work.

1104
01:13:50,822 --> 01:13:52,995
But I think this'Il work for you.

1105
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:56,562
- OK.
- Thank you. All right.

1106
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:07,718
Have you ever just spent five months

1107
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:10,947
living with a herd of
goats, as one of them?

1108
01:14:12,112 --> 01:14:13,182
- No?
- No.

1109
01:14:13,346 --> 01:14:14,757
That surprises me.

1110
01:14:15,682 --> 01:14:20,029
The thing about a goat is, it never
denies itself what it's hungry for.

1111
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:24,898
A goat will eat anything. A
goat could probably eat a bike.

1112
01:14:27,261 --> 01:14:30,708
A goal could eat itself,
if it was driven to it.

1113
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,079
I'm just a goat...

1114
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:39,482
,,,who's halfway through eating itself.

1115
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:48,763
Just to be clear, what
exactly are we talking about?

1116
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:51,729
Everything.

1117
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:57,395
I had no idea. It happened one night
three years ago, before we ever met.

1118
01:14:57,728 --> 01:14:59,332
I haven't seen her since.

1119
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,337
So she just popped back up
into your life, like that?

1120
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,408
She tried to get in touch with me
and Barry intercepted the message.

1121
01:15:05,736 --> 01:15:10,982
- So it's all Barry's fault?
- Barry is... He's a sweet guy,

1122
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:16,252
but he is a tornado of destruction.
The only friends he has are dead mice,

1123
01:15:16,348 --> 01:15:19,420
and that's 'cause they're the only
ones that can't get away from him.

1124
01:15:23,256 --> 01:15:25,862
You know what else mice can't do?

1125
01:15:25,992 --> 01:15:27,938
They can't lie.

1126
01:15:29,495 --> 01:15:32,305
Barry. Barry!

1127
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:36,111
I'm gonna go to San Francisco tonight.

1128
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,343
And... I'll come by
to pack around eight.

1129
01:15:39,673 --> 01:15:42,711
I think it's better if you're not there.

1130
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:13,152
I never really knew
what Martha thought of me

1131
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:16,315
until I heard her
talking behind my back.

1132
01:16:19,683 --> 01:16:23,153
You were lying to me the
whole time. You didn't like me.

1133
01:16:24,688 --> 01:16:29,160
"How do I get ahead in business?
How do I get ahead? Oh, I know...

1134
01:16:30,094 --> 01:16:33,541
I'll ind a great taxidermist
and I'll hit him with my car.

1135
01:16:33,898 --> 01:16:37,175
And then I'll invite him
to dinner. That'll do it."

1136
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:42,609
Well, somebody forgot to tell
you there is no "me" in "mean."

1137
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:48,890
Well, there is a bit of a happy ending.

1138
01:16:49,014 --> 01:16:51,928
'Cause the mean guy finally
got what he deserved.

1139
01:16:58,124 --> 01:17:01,037
World's smallest violin, and
it's playing just for you.

1140
01:17:04,798 --> 01:17:07,745
- Sorry.
- What?

1141
01:17:08,969 --> 01:17:12,382
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, OK. Whatever.

1142
01:19:18,776 --> 01:19:20,187
- Hello?
- Tim!

1143
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:22,586
I heard you had an interesting
brunch this morning.

1144
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:24,518
Sir, I can explain.

1145
01:19:24,682 --> 01:19:28,289
You might want to
explain it to Mn Mueller

1146
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:33,025
You should have told
me Barry was your fool.

1147
01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:35,604
We have the same game in Switzerland.

1148
01:19:35,928 --> 01:19:37,703
Dinner for Unterschlagen.

1149
01:19:37,863 --> 01:19:39,604
I am very much looking forward

1150
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:42,412
to seeing the two of you
this evening, Mn Conrad

1151
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,550
Where are you? Dinners about to start.

1152
01:19:47,874 --> 01:19:49,046
There's been a complication.

1153
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:52,156
Tim, for Christ sake,
we're running on fumes.

1154
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:54,725
If we don't make this deal tonight,
there is no Fender Financial.

1155
01:19:55,048 --> 01:19:58,154
So, hurry up, We gotta
land Mueller tonight.

1156
01:20:06,494 --> 01:20:09,566
My guys a lock. You know what I'm
saying? Mueller's gonna love him.

1157
01:20:09,664 --> 01:20:10,665
Now, he might be a little late.

1158
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:13,001
- He's on his way, but...
- Tim!

1159
01:20:14,069 --> 01:20:16,242
Sir, I've run into a
little bit of a problem.

1160
01:20:16,405 --> 01:20:19,011
Never mind that. You know, ever
since I invited you to this thing,

1161
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:21,678
Caldwell's been telling
me I made a mistake.

1162
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:23,346
He says you're not cut out for it.

1163
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:26,359
- Really?
- Caldwell is full of shit.

1164
01:20:26,483 --> 01:20:31,432
Mueller told me your guy was good.
I had no idea he was this good.

1165
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:33,761
Well, I try to look at the bright side.

1166
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:36,435
You could say I'm an
eternal optometrist,

1167
01:20:36,594 --> 01:20:38,835
When life gives you
lemons, you make lemonade.

1168
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:40,772
Unless you don't have
any water or sugar.

1169
01:20:40,931 --> 01:20:42,638
And then, then you just eat the lemons.

1170
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:46,270
And the rind will give you
diarrhea. So, mama mia, papa pia,

1171
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,873
baby got the diarr... Hey, Tim!

1172
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:53,179
Mr. Conrad! You have
been missing all the fun.

1173
01:20:53,945 --> 01:20:55,788
Barry... you're here.

1174
01:20:55,947 --> 01:21:00,123
Yes, and I have been telling Sir
Lancelot that you deserve a promotion.

1175
01:21:00,285 --> 01:21:02,789
And he's been making a
pretty persuasive case, Tim.

1176
01:21:03,122 --> 01:21:06,228
Tim, I'd like to
introduce my friend, Lewis,

1177
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:09,306
- and his wife, Diane.
- Your wife?

1178
01:21:09,395 --> 01:21:10,635
For now.

1179
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:17,345
- Honey, please.
- Honey, please. You're so pathetic!

1180
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:20,918
My God, it's raining men. I
don't know who's more gorgeous.

1181
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:23,654
Well, beauty's only skin deep.

1182
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:26,416
Unless there's something wrong with
your bone structure. And then...

1183
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:29,688
...you could have flawless
skin and still be very ugly.

1184
01:21:29,817 --> 01:21:33,492
Because your bones are just... gross.

1185
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,727
Lewis, Diane, there's
someone I'd like you to meet.

1186
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:36,835
I think you're drunk.

1187
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,400
Not drunk enough to do you.

1188
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,435
Tim, when you said this was a
dinner for extraordinary people,

1189
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,204
I had no idea. Look at that.

1190
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:48,838
Are you hungry? He
hasn't eaten a lot today.

1191
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,842
Come on.

1192
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:54,177
Yes?

1193
01:21:54,844 --> 01:21:57,518
OK... her. You know what she does?

1194
01:21:57,614 --> 01:21:59,685
She communicates with dead pets.

1195
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:03,854
Lorenzo's mother wants to talk to him.

1196
01:22:04,187 --> 01:22:06,532
Right? Nice?

1197
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:11,106
OK, that guy? Right there?
2002 National Beard Champion.

1198
01:22:11,228 --> 01:22:13,435
I'm telling you, these
people are amazing.

1199
01:22:13,564 --> 01:22:16,636
- I am so not in their league.
- Barry, what are you...

1200
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:20,910
- Why are you here?
- Because that's what friends do.

1201
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:24,384
I know, I know. You chose
some words carelessly.

1202
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:26,820
I know you are in a dark
place, but I also know

1203
01:22:27,145 --> 01:22:30,559
that you need to show your boss
that you are friends with a winner.

1204
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:32,390
In my book, you're a winner, too.

1205
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:37,793
Ladies and gentlemen! Dinner is served.

1206
01:22:43,497 --> 01:22:46,842
The eyes are but two of the Eve senses.

1207
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:51,582
Remove them and the others
become incredibly sensitive.

1208
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,685
But some people still ask:

1209
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:57,950
How can a blind man compete
at the Olympic Games as fencer?

1210
01:22:58,079 --> 01:22:59,422
I will show you how.

1211
01:23:03,518 --> 01:23:05,930
Absolutely tremendous!

1212
01:23:06,254 --> 01:23:08,599
- All right!
- Are you enjoying this?

1213
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:13,299
Yes. Such a pleasure to laugh
at the misfortune of others.

1214
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,809
Are they cute when they're small,

1215
01:23:15,931 --> 01:23:18,275
or are they pretty much
horrible the whole time?

1216
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:23,618
- Are you looking down my dress?
- No.

1217
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:26,313
- Why not?
- I don't know.

1218
01:23:26,443 --> 01:23:28,616
- Tim, were you?
- No.

1219
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:31,454
- Please don't embarrass me.
- I'm not doing... Oh, God.

1220
01:23:34,452 --> 01:23:36,693
- Here you go, sir.
- Here you are, ma'am. Bon appetit.

1221
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,404
I am receiving a message
from the other side!

1222
01:23:52,171 --> 01:23:55,641
I'm trapped. Where are they taking me?

1223
01:23:55,808 --> 01:23:59,985
- She's talking to the lobster.
- The water, it...

1224
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:01,921
...boils!

1225
01:24:16,731 --> 01:24:18,768
Thai might win. Thai might win.

1226
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:28,850
Fuck it. I don't care.

1227
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:34,587
So, Tim... I understand your
guest has an interesting hobby.

1228
01:24:35,384 --> 01:24:38,365
I guess I'm up. Wish me luck.

1229
01:24:43,526 --> 01:24:46,564
This is something that I
call the Tower of Dreamers.

1230
01:24:57,975 --> 01:25:01,549
A thousand years ago, the only
people on Earth were monkeys.

1231
01:25:01,646 --> 01:25:05,822
And they said, "We'll
never walk erectus.

1232
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:09,557
We'll never use tools.
We'll never talk."

1233
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:14,728
And then one monkey said: "Oh,
yeah? Well, I'm talking right now."

1234
01:25:14,827 --> 01:25:18,070
That monkey... was a dreamer.

1235
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:20,570
- Mice dressed
as monkeys. - Yes-

1236
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:23,077
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

1237
01:25:25,906 --> 01:25:28,250
Fast-forward 500 years.

1238
01:25:31,111 --> 01:25:34,923
The Wright Brothers decide to
make themselves a 'Hying machine.

1239
01:25:35,015 --> 01:25:40,432
"You fools! You idiots! What's
your problem?" everyone shouted.

1240
01:25:40,588 --> 01:25:44,468
"That will never work because
plywood weighs more than air!"

1241
01:25:44,592 --> 01:25:47,038
To which the Wright Brothers responded:

1242
01:25:47,795 --> 01:25:49,331
"No, it doesn't."

1243
01:25:50,599 --> 01:25:53,011
The Wright Brothers were dreamers.

1244
01:25:55,971 --> 01:26:00,681
The Earl of Sandwich
and Sir Francis Bacon.

1245
01:26:00,809 --> 01:26:06,385
Had it not been for them, the BLT
would merely be lettuce and tomato.

1246
01:26:09,452 --> 01:26:12,365
They were dreamers. And sandwich makers.

1247
01:26:14,123 --> 01:26:15,363
It's not over yet.

1248
01:26:16,961 --> 01:26:19,407
Vincent van Gogh.

1249
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:23,478
Everyone told him,
"You only have one ear.

1250
01:26:23,634 --> 01:26:26,137
You cannot be a great artist."

1251
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:30,419
And you know what he
said? "l can't hear you."

1252
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:32,488
Vincent van Gogh was a dreamer.

1253
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:35,987
- I love to paint.
- Really?

1254
01:26:36,147 --> 01:26:38,093
- I love to paint.
- Are you any good?

1255
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:41,023
- I don't know.
- Of course not.

1256
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:46,698
Louis Pasteur turned
cheese into medicine.

1257
01:26:56,536 --> 01:26:59,176
Benjamin Franklin.

1258
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:03,079
People said, "You can't
fly a kite in a rainstorm."

1259
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:08,861
And Ben Franklin said, "Yes, you
can, if you have an electric kite."

1260
01:27:13,288 --> 01:27:15,598
Little detail with the
kite. That's good, ja?

1261
01:27:15,723 --> 01:27:19,069
A man who broke more bones...

1262
01:27:19,895 --> 01:27:22,068
...than any man in history:

1263
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:26,071
Eve! Knievel.

1264
01:27:32,742 --> 01:27:33,982
It's fantastic.

1265
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:36,147
Well played, rookie. Well played.

1266
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:40,757
And who might this
handsome young lad be?

1267
01:27:41,651 --> 01:27:42,959
Tim Conrad.

1268
01:27:44,388 --> 01:27:48,837
He believes that someday he will
marry the girl of his dreams,

1269
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,237
even though every time
he asks, she says no.

1270
01:27:52,563 --> 01:27:56,068
And even though, as we speak,
she is probably having sex

1271
01:27:56,234 --> 01:28:02,082
with a handsome artist.
Tim Conrad... is a dreamer.

1272
01:28:09,849 --> 01:28:13,524
So dare to dream. Dream
your wildest dreams.

1273
01:28:13,653 --> 01:28:16,156
You can climb the highest mountain.

1274
01:28:16,489 --> 01:28:21,166
You can drown in a teacup, if
you find a big enough teacup

1275
01:28:21,295 --> 01:28:24,708
And if somebody tells you
that you can't do something,

1276
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:28,109
you say, "Yes, I can.

1277
01:28:28,268 --> 01:28:31,215
'Cause I'm doing it right now!"

1278
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:37,620
Bravo!

1279
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,123
Bravo, Sir!

1280
01:28:44,386 --> 01:28:46,993
You must come to Switzerland.
You'll be the toast of Zurich!

1281
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:50,326
I can't understand your accent!

1282
01:28:53,029 --> 01:28:58,172
- Caldwell. This guy's taking it.
- The night is young.

1283
01:28:59,803 --> 01:29:03,842
Gentlemen, ladies, I'd like to
introduce you to Mr. Therman Murch,

1284
01:29:03,974 --> 01:29:07,820
IRS auditor and master of mind control.

1285
01:29:07,911 --> 01:29:09,481
Therman?

1286
01:29:15,153 --> 01:29:16,655
Sorry for my tardiness.

1287
01:29:16,821 --> 01:29:19,324
Mr. Murch came by the office last night.

1288
01:29:19,424 --> 01:29:21,165
Shame to hear about that audit, Tim.

1289
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:23,532
Anything I can do to
help, I'm here for you.

1290
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:26,375
Barry, what are you doing here?

1291
01:29:27,499 --> 01:29:28,273
I dunno.

1292
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,605
- You two know each other?
- Yes. We work together.

1293
01:29:33,872 --> 01:29:35,909
I'm gonna have to get the
address of that office.

1294
01:29:36,509 --> 01:29:40,013
So Therman was telling me about some
of his techniques for mind control,

1295
01:29:40,113 --> 01:29:42,559
and I gotta say, I
was pretty blown away.

1296
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:49,198
Yes. The brain has pressure
points, just like any other muscle.

1297
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:51,031
Apply those pressure points,

1298
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:55,299
and the brain will
obey your every command.

1299
01:29:55,629 --> 01:29:57,734
Allow me to demonstrate.

1300
01:29:58,766 --> 01:29:59,972
Barry!

1301
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:03,610
Barry.

1302
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,611
Look into my eyes, Barry.

1303
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:10,451
Barry!

1304
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,486
Where is your wife, Barry?

1305
01:30:16,219 --> 01:30:20,929
Tell us. Where is she?
Come on, Barry, tell us.

1306
01:30:21,057 --> 01:30:26,507
- Your house?
- Yes.

1307
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:38,144
Let me just get this straight,
Barry. Your wife left you for him?

1308
01:30:40,345 --> 01:30:43,326
She has extraordinary taste in men.

1309
01:30:46,684 --> 01:30:51,633
And, tell us, Barry... why
did your wife leave you?

1310
01:30:57,263 --> 01:31:00,437
- Spit it out of your mouth.
- No.

1311
01:31:00,533 --> 01:31:02,206
- Say it!
- No.

1312
01:31:02,968 --> 01:31:04,276
Say it, boy!

1313
01:31:07,774 --> 01:31:09,617
I lost her clitoris.

1314
01:31:11,945 --> 01:31:16,792
- That's right.
- You lost her clitoris?

1315
01:31:16,883 --> 01:31:18,795
She got mad because I couldn't End it.

1316
01:31:18,953 --> 01:31:22,298
- Well, you know.
- I said, "it's probably in your purse,"

1317
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:24,461
because nine times out of
ten when she loses something,

1318
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,135
that's where they end up.

1319
01:31:26,227 --> 01:31:28,468
Barry, do you even know what that is?

1320
01:31:28,796 --> 01:31:31,073
I don't know what half
the stuff in her purse is.

1321
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,738
Well, don't worry, Barry. I found it.

1322
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,076
It was in her purse.

1323
01:31:37,472 --> 01:31:39,179
It was in her naughty purse.

1324
01:31:39,308 --> 01:31:43,382
Well, I mean, thank God
somebody found it, right?

1325
01:31:45,315 --> 01:31:49,195
I thought I found it under the couch.

1326
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:52,027
Turns out it was just an
old piece of chewing gum.

1327
01:32:08,373 --> 01:32:09,681
I release you!

1328
01:32:13,378 --> 01:32:16,188
Ladies and gentlemen, mind control.

1329
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,124
Bravo.

1330
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,755
Bravo! Bravo!

1331
01:32:25,858 --> 01:32:26,928
That was sweet.

1332
01:32:30,296 --> 01:32:34,370
Barry, you're better than him.
Martha may not see it, but I do.

1333
01:32:34,468 --> 01:32:38,143
Thanks. Thank you, Tim.
You're a good friend.

1334
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:41,110
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

1335
01:32:41,241 --> 01:32:46,453
I'm not. Barry, this... Man, this...

1336
01:32:46,581 --> 01:32:48,891
This dinner isn't what you think it is.

1337
01:32:50,718 --> 01:32:52,163
What?

1338
01:32:52,287 --> 01:32:54,426
We invited you all
here to make fun of you.

1339
01:32:56,824 --> 01:33:00,170
So you invite a bunch of
incredibly talented people to dinner

1340
01:33:00,296 --> 01:33:05,268
- and you make fun of them?
- No. it's a dinner for idiots.

1341
01:33:06,969 --> 01:33:09,313
Well, you'd better go ind some idiots.

1342
01:33:09,972 --> 01:33:11,247
We do.

1343
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:17,422
I'm sorry. I... Really, I'm so sorry.

1344
01:33:19,249 --> 01:33:23,596
If it’s any consolation, Therman
will probably win first prize.

1345
01:33:27,792 --> 01:33:29,271
He'll have that, too.

1346
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,603
And he'll be able to lord it
over me for the rest of my life.

1347
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:35,935
Barry, Erst prize is the biggest idiot.

1348
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:40,982
I know. That guy beats me
at everything. He just...

1349
01:33:41,106 --> 01:33:45,282
I don't know, what's the use?
He has mind control, I don't.

1350
01:33:48,614 --> 01:33:50,389
Barry, look at me.

1351
01:33:52,885 --> 01:33:55,627
Therman has mind control, but you...

1352
01:33:56,723 --> 01:34:01,969
- ...you have brain control.
- Brain control? What,,,?

1353
01:34:02,062 --> 01:34:04,303
- You didn't know you had brain control?
- No.

1354
01:34:04,398 --> 01:34:06,071
I knew it the second that I met you.

1355
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,646
You crawled in my brain,
and you stayed there.

1356
01:34:08,736 --> 01:34:10,306
- I did?
- You did.

1357
01:34:10,404 --> 01:34:12,714
And I can't get rid of you,
no matter how hard I try.

1358
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:17,415
You burrowed your way into my brain,
through my ear, like an earwig!

1359
01:34:17,545 --> 01:34:20,321
- I didn't mean to.
- it's like you set up camp,

1360
01:34:20,482 --> 01:34:23,588
- and I can't get you out of my head!
- I'm an earwig?

1361
01:34:23,718 --> 01:34:26,700
Ifs like teeth and spikes and...

1362
01:34:26,822 --> 01:34:31,669
...all your... spilling out millions
of earwig eggs all in my brain!

1363
01:34:31,827 --> 01:34:34,273
- I can't do anything about it!
- Oh, my God!

1364
01:34:34,397 --> 01:34:36,377
Brain control beats mind
control any day of the week!

1365
01:34:36,499 --> 01:34:39,003
Because the brain tells
the mind what to do!

1366
01:34:39,569 --> 01:34:43,381
You can beat this guy. You
can beat this guy, Barry.

1367
01:34:44,174 --> 01:34:47,678
Barry, you can beat Therman.

1368
01:34:47,778 --> 01:34:49,587
"You may say I'm a dreamer..."

1369
01:34:51,516 --> 01:34:54,258
"But I'm not the only one..."

1370
01:35:02,059 --> 01:35:04,370
I'm going to go lay eggs in his brain.

1371
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,739
- Back for more, Barry?
- Yes! I am, Therman.

1372
01:35:12,871 --> 01:35:16,786
Only this time, I brought
my secret weapon... my brain.

1373
01:35:19,379 --> 01:35:23,384
- What are you talking about?
- He's talking about brain control.

1374
01:35:26,886 --> 01:35:30,664
Brain control? There ain't no
such thing as brain control.

1375
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:34,568
There is mind control.
Brain control is ridiculous.

1376
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:36,141
That's ridiculous.

1377
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:38,810
Yes, it's ridiculous.

1378
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:41,505
- That's ridiculous.
- Barry.

1379
01:35:41,636 --> 01:35:42,637
Barry.

1380
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:49,513
- Barry.
- Barry.

1381
01:35:49,644 --> 01:35:52,591
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

1382
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:56,286
- It works.
- How are you doing that?

1383
01:35:56,419 --> 01:35:59,127
I am making you say
everything that I say.

1384
01:35:59,255 --> 01:36:00,632
Yeah, but I’m saying it first.

1385
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:02,598
- Are you?
- Yes!

1386
01:36:02,692 --> 01:36:03,693
Really?

1387
01:36:05,094 --> 01:36:07,632
I am very, very powerful.

1388
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:10,307
Oh, my gosh.

1389
01:36:29,153 --> 01:36:30,564
- Oh, thank you,
- You're welcome.

1390
01:36:34,126 --> 01:36:35,127
Oh, no!

1391
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:50,314
Best dinner ever.

1392
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:52,821
You have no secrets from me.

1393
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:56,484
Oh, contrary. You have no
secrets from me, Therman.

1394
01:36:56,651 --> 01:37:01,157
I know that, after sex, you like
to curl up in the fecal position.

1395
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:05,667
You cry like a little baby.

1396
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:08,363
- Martha told you.
- No, she did not.

1397
01:37:08,496 --> 01:37:13,344
I know that you take a magic marker
and you draw a face on your penis.

1398
01:37:13,502 --> 01:37:15,880
Is that against the
law? I don't think so.

1399
01:37:16,004 --> 01:37:19,781
And you put a little hat on
it, and you call it Sammy.

1400
01:37:19,908 --> 01:37:21,855
Nobody is supposed to know that.

1401
01:37:22,178 --> 01:37:25,216
- And you sing to it.
- You keep your mouth shut!

1402
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,723
That's... That's not 100 percent true.

1403
01:37:33,857 --> 01:37:38,738
I know everything! I have
laid eggs inside of your brain.

1404
01:37:38,862 --> 01:37:40,808
Get them out of my head!

1405
01:37:41,131 --> 01:37:44,704
You are no longer in
control of me! I control you!

1406
01:37:44,868 --> 01:37:49,875
And you are under my power.
I know everything, Therman.

1407
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:52,110
And I release you.

1408
01:37:58,116 --> 01:38:00,597
Barry! Barry!

1409
01:38:01,387 --> 01:38:02,457
Yeah!

1410
01:38:03,389 --> 01:38:05,892
I hope that you have
all kept your receipts,

1411
01:38:05,992 --> 01:38:08,472
because you will all be audited.

1412
01:38:12,165 --> 01:38:15,612
He slept with Martha at my house!

1413
01:38:15,736 --> 01:38:19,115
I was under the bed the
whole time. What an idiot!

1414
01:38:20,907 --> 01:38:23,911
Right? I know!

1415
01:38:24,245 --> 01:38:26,782
We have a little tradition,
here, at this dinner.

1416
01:38:26,914 --> 01:38:31,329
We give an award to the evening's
most extraordinary person.

1417
01:38:31,452 --> 01:38:35,867
Tonight's winner is the most
extraordinary person I have ever met.

1418
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:37,829
Our winner:

1419
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,166
Barry!

1420
01:38:40,596 --> 01:38:42,098
Yeah!

1421
01:38:47,269 --> 01:38:49,375
- We did it!
- Congratulations.

1422
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:50,507
Thank you.

1423
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,780
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Conrad.

1424
01:38:53,877 --> 01:38:57,950
Tim, Tim, you did it.
Your guy is amazing.

1425
01:38:58,048 --> 01:38:59,322
Mueller loves him.

1426
01:39:00,283 --> 01:39:01,957
He is amazing.

1427
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:04,030
- I thought you did such a great job.
- You're the winner?

1428
01:39:04,155 --> 01:39:05,725
- I am, yeah!
- Whatever.

1429
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:09,728
And he deserves a hell
of a lot better than this.

1430
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:13,501
- They all do.
- What do you mean, exactly?

1431
01:39:14,499 --> 01:39:18,641
Any one of you would throw me
under the bus for a bigger bonus.

1432
01:39:18,804 --> 01:39:22,581
And Barry would throw himself in
front of a car to save a mouse...

1433
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:24,346
...even though it was already dead.

1434
01:39:25,644 --> 01:39:28,524
I have been trying to play on your team.

1435
01:39:28,648 --> 01:39:31,925
Barry doesn't deserve that trophy. I do.

1436
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:35,232
Hold on a second. Tim, I won
this trophy fair and square.

1437
01:39:35,354 --> 01:39:36,833
Barry, you don't want that trophy.

1438
01:39:36,923 --> 01:39:39,404
- I've never won a trophy before.
-Yeah, I know, but...

1439
01:39:39,526 --> 01:39:41,028
- You know what? Keep the trophy.
- OK.

1440
01:39:41,161 --> 01:39:42,731
I'm sorry, What's going on here?

1441
01:39:42,863 --> 01:39:46,504
Well, these people invited
us here to make fun of us.

1442
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,513
This is a contest for the biggest idiot.

1443
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:51,172
Which I nailed!

1444
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:54,013
Wait, wait, wait...

1445
01:39:54,109 --> 01:39:56,350
-You told him?
-I did.

1446
01:39:56,511 --> 01:39:59,390
It seems this contest was fixed.

1447
01:39:59,514 --> 01:40:01,926
I thought you conducted
yourselves honorably.

1448
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:04,360
No, we do. We do.

1449
01:40:04,452 --> 01:40:07,923
We do. Tim had a very
bright future here,

1450
01:40:08,257 --> 01:40:11,704
but for some reason, he's chosen
to throw his lot in with the losers.

1451
01:40:11,861 --> 01:40:14,808
Excuse me? I think I must
not have heard correctly.

1452
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:17,571
- Did he call us losers?
- He did.

1453
01:40:18,268 --> 01:40:21,977
You insult my honor at great
risk. I will be leaving.

1454
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:25,052
Count yourself lucky I
have spared your life.

1455
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:26,551
Yeah!

1456
01:40:31,549 --> 01:40:33,051
- Marco!
- Oh, God.

1457
01:40:33,384 --> 01:40:36,922
So it is a fight you want, is it?
Well, you shall have your fight.

1458
01:40:37,054 --> 01:40:38,556
But on my terms.

1459
01:40:44,396 --> 01:40:48,572
In a world of complete darkness,
the sighted are blind...

1460
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:51,147
...but the blind can see.

1461
01:40:54,139 --> 01:40:55,141
Oh, God.

1462
01:40:56,242 --> 01:40:59,519
Welcome... to my world.

1463
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:03,693
I am invisible. Where am I?

1464
01:41:03,817 --> 01:41:06,821
- He's good.
- I am a shadow...

1465
01:41:06,953 --> 01:41:07,955
...with a big knife!

1466
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:12,834
- Simmer down!
- I can smell your fear!

1467
01:41:14,028 --> 01:41:15,530
I think he's gonna kill someone.

1468
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:18,703
Over here!

1469
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,711
Hey, no! Not the boys!

1470
01:41:20,836 --> 01:41:22,611
This has become a fiasco!

1471
01:41:22,704 --> 01:41:24,809
Wait a second... the Swedish
guy who thinks he's a German!

1472
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,113
He's an idiot, too! Mueller!

1473
01:41:28,109 --> 01:41:29,782
This is what you've
been up to all along!

1474
01:41:29,878 --> 01:41:30,879
NO! NO!

1475
01:41:31,012 --> 01:41:32,515
- You brought me hereto make fun!
- No...

1476
01:41:32,648 --> 01:41:35,151
I can assure you. I am no Unterschlagen!

1477
01:41:40,122 --> 01:41:42,124
No, no! Lorenzo, no!

1478
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:44,699
- Somebody, grab the bird!
- I got it...

1479
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:49,006
No, no, no!

1480
01:41:49,132 --> 01:41:51,874
It is my wife's favorite
finger! Please get it back now!

1481
01:41:52,002 --> 01:41:54,812
Williams, get the bird!
Somebody kill the bird!

1482
01:41:54,905 --> 01:41:56,384
- They're going to kill my bird!
- It's not his time!

1483
01:41:56,506 --> 01:41:58,646
- It's over there!
- Don't hurt him!

1484
01:41:58,743 --> 01:42:00,916
- Get the bird!
- Parry right, thrust left!

1485
01:42:01,045 --> 01:42:03,150
You want the bird? You
have to kill me first!

1486
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:05,654
Fight like a blind man! Kick
him in the business center!

1487
01:42:05,817 --> 01:42:06,989
Right here.

1488
01:42:11,323 --> 01:42:12,996
- There's a Ere!
- Oh, come on!

1489
01:42:13,092 --> 01:42:14,662
Grab the vulture!

1490
01:42:15,661 --> 01:42:18,437
Somebody, just let the bird
out! Please! Just let him out!

1491
01:42:18,564 --> 01:42:21,773
- Wait, I have an idea.
- Let Lorenzo out!

1492
01:42:21,901 --> 01:42:24,906
You, stop! Don't move
or I'm gonna kill you.

1493
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:26,840
Allow me.

1494
01:42:32,245 --> 01:42:33,349
There it is!

1495
01:42:37,018 --> 01:42:38,292
Nice!

1496
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:42,790
Wanna?

1497
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:45,960
Great dinner! Let's go get Julie!

1498
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:48,731
Mein finger!

1499
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:54,440
Don't you die on me!

1500
01:42:59,574 --> 01:43:03,079
- Juiiel Julie?
- Julie?

1501
01:43:03,212 --> 01:43:05,214
Julie?

1502
01:43:05,882 --> 01:43:07,259
Tim.

1503
01:43:16,627 --> 01:43:18,903
There's a way to read that
that's actually positive.

1504
01:43:19,063 --> 01:43:22,067
How? How is that positive, Barry?

1505
01:43:23,634 --> 01:43:25,512
"Tim, have a ni..."

1506
01:43:25,637 --> 01:43:27,241
"Hey, Tim, ha..."

1507
01:43:27,572 --> 01:43:29,245
"Have a nice life."

1508
01:43:30,942 --> 01:43:36,688
- This is my fault, isn't it?
- It's not. it's my fault.

1509
01:43:36,815 --> 01:43:41,162
I'm the reason this happened. Not you.

1510
01:43:41,287 --> 01:43:44,666
I messed up. Want to
hear something pathetic?

1511
01:43:45,925 --> 01:43:47,529
God, yeah.

1512
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:49,867
You know why I wanted that promotion?

1513
01:43:49,996 --> 01:43:52,603
So that Julie would think
that I was good enough for her.

1514
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:57,339
So stupid. I couldn't believe
that someone so amazing

1515
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:59,815
would want anything to do with
me. I tried to impress her...

1516
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,887
...with stuff she doesn't
care about, I don't care about.

1517
01:44:04,178 --> 01:44:07,125
You know what I care about? Her.

1518
01:44:08,282 --> 01:44:09,818
And what else?

1519
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:13,626
Waking up next to her every
day, seeing her every day.

1520
01:44:13,788 --> 01:44:15,233
And more things?

1521
01:44:15,556 --> 01:44:20,233
She's the greatest thing in my life,
and I blew it. God, I'm an idiot.

1522
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:24,971
What are you doing?

1523
01:44:33,143 --> 01:44:34,850
Did you know I was listening?

1524
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:38,187
- No.
- I did. I did.

1525
01:44:41,552 --> 01:44:43,657
I... I thought you'd gone.

1526
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:47,434
I left my phone.

1527
01:44:48,826 --> 01:44:52,899
- Julie... I'm...
- Julie?

1528
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,844
We should hurry if we're
gonna catch that plane.

1529
01:44:59,905 --> 01:45:03,546
- Kieran...
- Julie, I will handle this.

1530
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:09,626
Kieran... since the
dawn of ancient times,

1531
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:13,094
men and women have striven
to End the perfect mate.

1532
01:45:13,219 --> 01:45:15,893
And, once in a while, a couple will meet

1533
01:45:16,022 --> 01:45:18,799
and spark a passion that is so powerful,

1534
01:45:18,926 --> 01:45:22,874
a thousand armies could
not pull them apart.

1535
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:25,203
That is what you have with Julie.

1536
01:45:26,033 --> 01:45:27,808
But Tim got there first.

1537
01:45:27,935 --> 01:45:30,313
And if Julie leaves, ii will kill him.

1538
01:45:31,773 --> 01:45:34,219
People can die of broken hearts.

1539
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:36,878
I know. It almost happened to me.

1540
01:45:37,645 --> 01:45:43,118
And because of that...
you may see Julie no more.

1541
01:45:43,953 --> 01:45:47,093
You may talk to Julie no more.

1542
01:45:47,223 --> 01:45:52,400
You may look upon
Julie's face... no more.

1543
01:45:52,495 --> 01:45:55,271
OK, but we work together, so...

1544
01:45:55,397 --> 01:45:57,844
What part of "no more"
do you not understand?

1545
01:45:57,968 --> 01:45:59,276
We had a talk, Kieran and I,

1546
01:45:59,402 --> 01:46:02,246
and he understands it's
purely professional.

1547
01:46:02,405 --> 01:46:06,649
- There is professional no more.
- He's right, Julie.

1548
01:46:08,078 --> 01:46:13,188
If we start this tire...
we'll burn this world to ashes.

1549
01:46:13,317 --> 01:46:17,356
- What are you talking about?
- If you start this Ere...

1550
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:22,595
- Burn it to ashes.
- ...burn this world to ashes.

1551
01:46:24,096 --> 01:46:28,135
- There goes my museum show.
- Welcome to my world.

1552
01:46:28,267 --> 01:46:31,771
- Yeah.
- Julie...

1553
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:35,648
...I love you. I don't care if
we get married. I'll stop asking.

1554
01:46:37,443 --> 01:46:38,979
Don't stop asking.

1555
01:46:53,794 --> 01:46:58,174
- You are a wise man, my friend.
- As are you.

1556
01:47:07,309 --> 01:47:10,313
Au revoir Julie. Au revoir Tim.

1557
01:47:10,478 --> 01:47:12,220
Au revoir Kieran.

1558
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:17,856
Be kind to your birds and your goats!

1559
01:47:32,336 --> 01:47:34,509
We're gonna be so happy together!

1560
01:47:42,614 --> 01:47:45,857
I guess things really
do happen for a reason.

1561
01:47:46,017 --> 01:47:48,520
Tim lost his job, but the
two of us remain best friends.

1562
01:47:48,853 --> 01:47:53,030
And once a month, I invite
him to a gathering I hast.

1563
01:47:53,125 --> 01:47:56,470
It’s called The Breakfast of Champions.

1564
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:00,210
Kieran and I became friends.

1565
01:48:00,366 --> 01:48:01,971
He asked me to collaborate with him,

1566
01:48:02,102 --> 01:48:04,412
and we showed our work
ah' over the world...

1567
01:48:04,537 --> 01:48:06,983
...including South Africa.

1568
01:48:07,107 --> 01:48:09,144
And guess who came to see us?

1569
01:48:09,276 --> 01:48:10,880
Morgan Freeman.

1570
01:48:14,247 --> 01:48:17,559
Tim went on to help Martin Mueller
convert his munitions factory

1571
01:48:17,652 --> 01:48:20,064
into the Martin Mueller
Museum of Modem Art...

1572
01:48:20,221 --> 01:48:21,291
. , . or. .

1573
01:48:24,558 --> 01:48:27,665
Kieran and I collaborated on
a sculpture for the opening.

1574
01:48:33,435 --> 01:48:37,247
I met up with Darla again.
Boy, does she like role playing.

1575
01:48:37,406 --> 01:48:41,014
She had me play detective, and
she left all of these clues.

1576
01:48:41,144 --> 01:48:42,350
And you know what?

1577
01:48:43,246 --> 01:48:44,850
I found it.

1578
01:48:48,251 --> 01:48:50,128
Therman wrote a new book.

1579
01:48:50,253 --> 01:48:52,860
And it is very popular in some circles.

1580
01:48:54,425 --> 01:48:58,669
I guess it's true what they say...
"A mind is a terrible thing. "

1581
01:49:02,966 --> 01:49:07,438
Oh, yeah, as for Tim and Julie...
Well, Julie finally said yes.

1582
01:49:07,605 --> 01:49:09,949
They went to Paris for the honeymoon.

1583
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:14,114
I waited around to surprise them,
but it never felt like the right time.

1584
01:49:15,547 --> 01:49:17,619
Anyway, I can tell you this:

1585
01:49:18,184 --> 01:49:20,528
They both got curated..

1586
01:49:20,653 --> 01:49:21,961
...several times.

1587
01:53:10,968 --> 01:53:14,541
Oh, yeah... Fenders company
went out of business.

1588
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:18,415
Forbes Magazine named him
Wall Street's biggest loser!

1589
01:53:18,543 --> 01:53:20,750
Way to go, Fender!
