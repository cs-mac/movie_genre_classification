3
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,812
You've got them mixed up.

4
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,233
You're making a mistake.

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,737
You're making a mistake
with the reindeer.

6
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,822
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,913
Would you mind stepping out
for a moment? Open the door.

8
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,503
I'm sorry. The store
isn't open today. I'm just...

9
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,506
I don't want to buy anything, and
I'm sorry to interrupt you in your work.

10
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,675
But I wanted to tell you
you're making a rather serious mistake.

11
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,844
- Huh?
- With the reindeer, I mean.

12
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,055
You've got Cupid
where Blitzen should be.

13
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,809
And Dasher- Oh, Dasher should be
on my right-hand side.

14
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,144
- He should, huh?
- Yes. Yes.

15
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,607
Oh, and another thing. Donner's antlers
have got four points instead of three.

16
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,360
Still, I don't suppose anybody
would notice that except myself.

17
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,529
- Nah, I don't suppose so.
- No.

18
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,197
- Well, bye.
- Not at all.

19
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,407
- Thanks.
- Glad to have helped you. Bye.

20
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,618
Dear, dear.

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,043
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

22
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,129
Jingle...

23
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,736
You're on float number three.

24
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,780
You're on the Pilgrim float.

25
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:20,966
You three, you're on the pirate float,
and you follow the band!

26
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,768
Mrs. Walker! Mrs. Walker, something
got to be done! That "Rub-a-dub-dub,

27
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,662
three men in a tub" float isn't big enough.

28
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,823
We can get the butcher and the baker in,
but the candlestick maker...

29
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Shellhammer, but I've
got enough to do to take care of people.

30
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,544
Oh, dear. I was so hoping... George!

31
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,569
I beg your pardon, Sir.

32
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
You seem to have got slightly mixed-up
with this whip of yours.

33
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,240
Allow me, will you? Allow me.

34
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,951
It's quite simple, really.
You don't mind if I show you, eh?

35
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,078
- No, Sir.
- Now. Now then.

36
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,876
- See? It's all in the wrist.
- Is that so?

37
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,295
- You have to follow through, you know.
- Is that so?

38
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,547
Yes, it's just like throwing a ball.

39
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,674
If you were to...

40
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,637
- You've been drinking.
- Oh, well, it... it's cold.

41
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,847
A man's gotta do somethin'
to keep warm.

42
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,807
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

43
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:31,103
Don't you realize there are thousands of
children lining the streets waiting to see you?

44
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,190
Children who've been dreaming
of this moment for weeks?

45
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,609
You're a disgrace to the
tradition of Christmas.

46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,738
And I refuse to have you malign me
in this fashion. Disgusting!

47
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,032
Tell me. Who's in charge
of this parade?

48
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,409
When you find out, you tell me.

49
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,329
These pants are gonna fall off
in the middle of Columbus Circle.

50
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,628
I beg your pardon. Could you tell me
who's in charge here?

51
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,798
Yes. Mrs. Walker.
There she is down there.

52
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,633
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

53
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,386
Oh, you two ought to be
over on 81st Street.

54
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,305
Mrs. Walker, one of the men in your
parade is not fit to be seen by chil...

55
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,016
What are you doing out of costume?
Now, get back and get dressed.

56
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,602
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought
you were our Santa Claus.

57
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,105
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

58
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,440
- Oh, no!
- Yes. It's disgraceful.

59
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,734
How can you allow a man  to get so...

60
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,280
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

61
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,282
- Jingle all...
- Stop that! What do you mean by drinking?

62
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,508
You know it's not allowed.

63
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,787
A man is cold, a man's gotta
do something to keep warm.

64
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,290
- I'll warm you. I ought to take this cane...
- And I ought to...

65
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,376
Uh, somebody, Julian,
get some black coffee.

66
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,169
- Plenty of it, please.
- Yes, Mrs. Walker.

67
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,839
Uh, black with a little cream.

68
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,174
Wake me up when the parade starts.

69
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,261
- Oh!
- Jingle bells, jingle bells...

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,305
Jingle all the way...

71
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,184
Oh!

72
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,604
Shameful. Absolutely shameful.

73
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,900
Could you be Santa Claus?
Have you had any experience?

74
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,652
Oh, a little.

75
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,904
- Oh, please. You've got to help me out.
- Madam!

76
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,949
I am not in the habit of substituting
for spurious Santa Clauses.

77
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,702
- No! No, I... I...
- Oh, please.

78
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,832
Well, the... the children
mustn't be disappointed.

79
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,959
- All right. I'll do it.
- Oh, good, thank you.

80
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,295
Come along, right this way.

81
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,934
Get that costume.

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,573
Hello there!

83
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,871
Hello there, boys and girls!

84
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,628
He's wonderful! He's the best we've
ever had, and he didn't need any padding.

85
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,880
- What?
- Padding. He didn't need any padding.

86
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,357
- Oh.
- Where did you find him?

87
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,550
Oh, I just turned round, and there he was.

88
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,053
I'm glad you turned round.
I mean, I'm glad he was there.

89
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,055
Just think if Mr. Macy
had seen the other one.

90
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,641
Just think if Mr. Gimbel
had seen the other one.

91
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,643
You want to ride
in a motorcycle or a car?

92
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,645
No, I'm going to go home
and get in a hot tub,

93
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,939
and I might stay there
until next Thanksgiving.

94
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,258
You really should see the parade,
you worked so hard on it.

95
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,611
Oh, if I want to, which I doubt, I can
see it from the roof of my apartment.

96
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,863
Oh, that's right.
You live down the...

97
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,282
Mrs. Walker!

98
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,202
Go ' head!

99
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:45,965
Hello there, Dear!

100
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,884
I just stepped out to see you.

101
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,150
Susan?

102
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,657
Susan.

103
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,755
- Hello, Cleo.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.

104
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:17,756
Mmm., what a beauty!

105
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,749
- Where's Susan?
- She's watching the parade.

106
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,356
Oh! Where? With whom?

107
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:24,587
With that Mr. Gailey who
lives in the front apartment.

108
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,090
Oh, yes.

109
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,386
Oh, I've been keeping
an eye on her.

110
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,347
She can see everything from there.
That's the 50-yard line.

111
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,435
He's so very fond of Susan. When he
asked me, well, I didn't think you'd mind.

112
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,981
Well, I guess it's all right.
I'll go on in in a minute.

113
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,818
Looks like they're having a little
trouble with the baseball player.

114
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,820
He was a clown last year.

115
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,780
They just changed the head
and painted him different.

116
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:53,616
- My mother told me.
- Mmm.

117
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,994
Mmm! He certainly is a giant, isn't he?

118
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,914
Not really. There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.

119
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,919
Well, maybe not now, Susie, but in
olden days, there were a lot of...

120
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:09,965
Well, what about the giant
that Jack killed?

121
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,637
- Jack? Jack who?
- Jack, uh...

122
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,352
Jack. "Jack and the Beanstalk."

123
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,355
- I never heard of that.
- You must've heard of that.

124
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,899
You’ve just forgotten.
It's a fairy tale.

125
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,319
Oh. One of those. I don't
know any fairy tales.

126
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,740
Oh, your mother and father
must have told you a fairy tale.

127
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,159
No. My mother thinks they're silly.

128
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,995
I don't know whether my father
thinks they're silly or not.

129
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,081
I never met my father.

130
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,732
You see, my father and mother
were divorced when I was a baby.

131
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,587
Well, that baseball player
certainly looks like a giant to me.

132
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:55,945
People sometimes grow very big,
but that's abnormal.

133
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,014
I'll bet your mother
told you that, too.

134
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,440
Hello. Uh, I'm Susan's mother.

135
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,360
Yes, I know. Won't you come in?
Susie's told me quite a lot about you.

136
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,404
- I'm Fred Gailey.
- Yes, I know.

137
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,031
Susan's told me quite a lot about you, too.

138
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,200
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Dear.

139
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,328
Won't you have a cup of coffee?

140
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,372
- You must be half-frozen standing out...
- Oh, don't bother.

141
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,667
- It's no bother, it's all ready.
- Well, in that case, thanks.

142
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,296
- What do you think of my parade?
- It's much better than last year's.

143
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,381
Well, I hope Mr. Macy agrees with you.

144
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,592
Sugar? Cream? Both? Neither?

145
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,678
Just one sugar, please.

146
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,267
- This is very kind of you, Mr. Gailey.
- Sit down.

147
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,436
And I want to thank you
for being so kind to Susan.

148
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,439
Cleo tells me that you
took them to the zoo yesterday.

149
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:53,569
That's right, but I must confess,
it's part of a deep-dyed plot.

150
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,196
I'm fond of Susie, very fond,

151
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,408
but I also wanted to meet you.

152
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,370
I read someplace that the surest way to
meet the mother is to be kind to the child.

153
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,374
- What a horrible trick.
- It worked.

154
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,002
There goes Santa Claus.

155
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,838
Oh! Don't even mention the name.

156
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,259
He's much better than last year's.
At least this one doesn't wear glasses.

157
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,511
This one was a last-minute substitute.

158
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,182
- The one I hired, I fired.
- Why?

159
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,842
You remember the way the
janitor was last New Year?

160
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:27,853
Oh, yes.

161
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,815
- Well, this one was much worse.
- Oh.

162
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,027
I see she doesn't believe
in Santa Claus either.

163
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:40,157
No Santa Claus, no fairy tales,
no fantasies of any kind.

164
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,409
- Is that it?
- That's right.

165
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,704
I think we should be realistic and
completely truthful with our children...

166
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,874
and not have them growing up believing in
a lot of legends and myths,

167
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,919
like Santa Claus, for example.

168
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,838
- I see.
- That's the end.

169
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,759
- The acrobats were good.
- They ought to be, at those prices.

170
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,054
- Thanks for the coffee.
- And thank you for inviting me in.

171
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,139
It was a pleasure, Missy.

172
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,602
Mother, I was thinking, we've got
such a big turkey for dinner,

173
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,562
and there are only two of us...

174
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,690
- Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey? Couldn't we?
- Well...

175
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,778
Oh, don't even think about it.
I'll have a sandwich or something.

176
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,365
- It's an awful big turkey.
- That's not it, Dear.

177
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,742
I'm sure Mr. Gailey has other plans.

178
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,911
No, he hasn't. Have you?

179
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,123
Uh, to be quite honest
and truthful with the child,

180
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,958
I must admit I haven't any other plans.

181
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,001
- Please, Mother, please?!?
- I don't want to interfere...

182
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,711
- Well, I...
- Did I ask all right?

183
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,713
Hmm?

184
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:43,653
Didn't I ask all right, Mr. Gailey?

185
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,822
That all depends.

186
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,664
- Dinner's at 3:00.
- Thanks.

187
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,664
Susie, Honey, you asked just right.

188
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,066
I'll see you at 3:00.

189
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,360
- It worked.
- Yes.

190
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,492
I tell you, Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.

191
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,568
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.

192
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:11,582
Well, hire him, by all means,
it's perfectly all right with me.

193
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,668
As a matter of fact, it'll save me
a frantic search in the morning.

194
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,281
Yes. That's right.

195
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,601
All right, I'll take care of it as soon
as he gets through. Oh, you'll love him.

196
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,452
I just know that with that man on the throne,

197
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,454
my department will sell
more toys than it ever has.

198
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,056
He's a born salesman. I just feel it.

199
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,477
Yes, yes, yes. We'll talk about it
in the morning. Good-bye.

200
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,312
Good-bye.

201
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,901
And you will find toys
of all kinds at Macy's.

202
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,166
Gee, that sure is
an elegant costume.

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,629
Yes, I've had it for years...
and years.

204
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,993
Sure makes a bum out of
the one they gave you.

205
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,878
- Ah.
- But even that one's better than the one I wear.

206
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:04,870
You, Alfred?

207
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,804
Yeah, I play Santa Claus over
at the "Y" near our block, see?

208
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,683
- No kidding.
- Started about three years ago.

209
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:16,104
They had a costume, but, well,
it didn't have no paddin' and...

210
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,610
since I carry my own paddin'
around with me, I got the job, see?

211
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,491
You enjoy impersonating me?

212
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,596
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?

213
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:30,827
I don't know. It's...
When I give packages to little kids,

214
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:35,541
I like to watch their faces get that...
that Christmas look all of a sudden.

215
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,294
It makes me feel kind of good
and important.

216
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:44,424
Pardon me!!

217
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,870
...three pound turkey, I had my daughter
and her kids over for dinner last night.

218
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,726
There you are! There you are!

219
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,003
- Good morning!
- Morning!

220
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:59,807
Now, before... oh, my, what a striking
costume. Before you go up on the floor,

221
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,751
I just want to give you a few tips
on how to be a good Santa Claus.

222
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,111
Go right ahead.

223
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:07,730
Here's a list of toys
that we have to "push", you know,

224
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:09,575
things that we're overstocked on.

225
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:13,328
Now, you'll find that a great many children will
be undecided as to what they want for Christmas.

226
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,874
When that happens, you immediately
suggest one of these items.

227
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,168
- You understand?
- I certainly do.

228
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,922
Good. Now, you memorize that
list, and I'll...

229
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,433
Oh, no. 9.50!

230
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,695
I'll tell you, when you've finished,
come up to the seventh floor.

231
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:29,939
I'll be waiting for you.

232
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,977
Imagine, making a child take
something it doesn't want...

233
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,606
just because he bought
too many of the wrong toys.

234
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,941
That's what I've been
fighting against for years...

235
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,152
the way they commercialize Christmas.

236
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah, there's a lot of bad "isms"
floating around this world,

237
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,282
but one of the worst is "commercialism."

238
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,952
Make a buck, make a buck.
Even in Brooklyn, it's the same.

239
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,872
Don't care what Christmas stands for.
Just make a buck.

240
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,749
- Make a buck.
- Ah.

241
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,335
Oh, don't bother, I'll put it away for you.

242
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,378
Huh? Oh, thank you, Alfred.

243
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:08,759
- And what should I do with these?
- Throw 'em on the floor.

244
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,519
I get kinda tired
just sweepin' up dust.

245
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:16,183
- Thanks.
- No. Thank you, Alfred.

246
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,981
<i>This way, please, right
this way, please.</i>

247
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:28,670
Yes, yes, yes. Peter's a fine name.
What do you want for Christmas, Peter?

248
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,490
I want a fire engine just like
the big ones, only smaller.

249
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,784
It has a real hose that squirts real, wet water.

250
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,954
I won't do it in the house. I'll only
do it in the backyard. I promise.

251
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:39,956
Psst. Psst.

252
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,709
Macy's ain't got any. Nobody's got any.

253
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,488
Well, Peter, I can tell you're a good boy.
You'll get your fire engine.

254
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:49,508
Oh, thank you very much.

255
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:53,248
You see? I told ya he'd get me one.

256
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:57,424
Mmm. That's fine. That's just dandy.
Listen, you wait over there.

257
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,963
Mama wants to thank Santa Claus, too.

258
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,279
Say, listen, what's the matter with you?
Don't you understand English?

259
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,942
I tell ya, Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.

260
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,319
I've been all over.
My feet are killin' me.

261
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,703
Fine thing promisin' the kid.

262
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,741
Now, you don't think I would've said
that unless I was sure, do you?

263
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,937
You can get those fire engines...
at Schoenfelt's on Lexington Avenue.

264
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,080
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.

265
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:23,110
Schoenfelt's? I don't get it.

266
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:27,290
Oh, I keep track of the toy market
pretty closely. Does that surprise you so?

267
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:29,005
Surprise me?

268
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,085
Macy's sendin' people to other stores...
are you kiddin' me?

269
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,721
Well, the only important thing
is to make the children happy.

270
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,549
And whether Macy or somebody else
sells a toy doesn't make any difference.

271
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,309
- Don't you feel that way?
- Huh?

272
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,967
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.
Only I didn't know Macy's did.

273
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,481
As long as I'm here, they do.

274
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,483
I don't get it.

275
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,820
No. I just don't get it.

276
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,242
<i>Right this way, please.</i>

277
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,120
Good morning, Mr. Shellhammer.

278
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:02,164
<i>This way, please.</i>

279
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,844
Oh, I quite understand. Your little
girl would like some skates...

280
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,429
but, of course, you must get her the best.

281
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,103
Because of their little ankles,
you know, they want protecting.

282
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,421
<i>Now, we've got skates,
and they're very good, too,</i>

283
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:23,968
<i>but they're not quite good enough.</i>

284
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,821
<i>You go to Gimbels. They'll have exactly what</i>

285
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,755
<i>you're looking for, I'm
sure. There you are, Dear.</i>

286
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:28,640
Gimbels!

287
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,926
<i>There, that's for you,
Merry Christmas. Good-bye!</i>

288
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,201
Gimbels.

289
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,363
Hello, my good girl,
how old are you?

290
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,077
Gimbels. Gimbels.

291
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,403
Pardon me, the guard said
I should speak to you.

292
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,541
- You're the head of the toy department, huh?
- Yes, madam, but at the moment-

293
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:52,130
Well, listen, I wanna congratulate you and Macy's
on this wonderful new stunt you're pullin'.

294
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,967
Imagine, sendin' people to
other stores. I don't get it.

295
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,803
- Why, it's... it's...
- It certainly is.

296
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,139
You said it. Imagine a big
outfit like Macy's...

297
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,850
puttin' the spirit of Christmas
ahead of the commercial.

298
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,687
It's wonderful. Well, I'll tell ya.
I never done much shoppin' here before.

299
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:12,192
But I'll tell ya one thing, from now on,
I'm gonna be a regular Macy customer.

300
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,779
- All right, Dear.
- Thank you, Madam.

301
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,880
There are six more women
out there who wanna thank ya.

302
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:25,516
Not now. I've gotta think this thing over.

303
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,345
Well, personally, I think
it's a wonderful idea, too.

304
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,211
- You think so.
- Those women think so.

305
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,339
The point is, will Mr. Macy think so?

306
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,720
This seems awfully silly, Mr. Gailey.

307
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:45,225
Well, I thought as long as we're in the store,
you might as well say hello to Santa Claus.

308
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,227
Why?

309
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,064
Well, because when you talk to him,
you might feel differently about him.

310
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,864
Good-bye, Elmer. Be a good boy now.

311
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,907
Merry Christmas!

312
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:05,871
- Well, young lady, what's your name?
- Susan Walker. What's yours?

313
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,791
Mine? Kris Kringle. I'm Santa Claus.

314
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,669
Oh, you don't believe that, do you?

315
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:17,975
Mm-mmm. You see, my mother's
Mrs. Walker, the lady who hired you.

316
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,551
Oh.

317
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,329
But I must say, you're the
best-looking one I've ever seen.

318
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,208
Really?

319
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:26,302
Your beard doesn't have one of those
things that goes over your ears.

320
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:29,477
That's because it's real,
just like I'm really the Santa Claus.

321
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,148
Oh, go ahead, pull it.

322
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,686
<i>All right, folks, don't crowd.</i>

323
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,449
<i>You have all day to see
Santa Claus. Now, children, behave.</i>

324
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,076
<i>This way, please.
Get back in the line there.</i>

325
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,163
And, now, what would you
like me to bring you for Christmas?

326
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,248
Nothing, thank you.

327
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,659
Oh, come now, you must want something.

328
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:54,669
Whatever I want, my mother
will get for me...

329
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,589
<i>if it's sensible and doesn't
cost too much, of course.</i>

330
00:20:58,015 --> 00:20:59,925
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Susan, hello, Mr. Gailey.

331
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,345
I think you've taken up enough of this
gentleman's time. Come along, Dear.

332
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,556
The, uh, explanation for this
is all very simple.

333
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,975
Cleo's mother sprained her ankle.
She had to go home.

334
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,894
So, she asked me to bring
Susie down to you.

335
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,396
Yes, I know. Cleo called me.
I've been wondering where you were.

336
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,066
Well, I thought, as long as we're here,
we might as well say hello to Santa Claus.

337
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,255
He's a nice old man, Mother,
and those whiskers are real, too.

338
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,739
Yes, yes, dear, many men
have long beards like that.

339
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,699
Susan, would you
stand over here a minute?

340
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,243
- I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.
- All right.

341
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,497
I shouldn't have brought Susie
to see Santa Claus, huh?

342
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,333
Now, you're making me feel
like the proverbial stepmother.

343
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,834
I'm sorry, but it's just that I couldn't see
any harm in just saying hello to the old fella.

344
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,089
But I think there is harm.

345
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,841
I tell her Santa Claus is a myth,
and you bring her down here,

346
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:46,846
she sees hundreds of gullible children, meets
a very convincing old man with real whiskers.

347
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:50,141
This sets up a very harmful
mental conflict within her.

348
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:53,441
What is she going to think?
Whom is she going to believe?

349
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,536
And by filling them full of fairy tales,

350
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,488
they grow up considering life
a fantasy instead of a reality.

351
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,449
They keep waiting for Prince
Charming to come along.

352
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,743
And when he does,
he turns out to be a...

353
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,287
We were talking about Susie,
not about you.

354
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,289
Well, whether you agree or not,

355
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,459
I must ask you to respect
my wishes regarding Susan.

356
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:20,088
She's my responsibility, and I must
bring her up as I see fit.

357
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,923
Okay.

358
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,849
- Say "Thank you, Santy Claus."
- Thank you.

359
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,767
Bye. Merry Christmas!

360
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,605
Well, young lady, and what's your name?

361
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,485
I'm sorry, she doesn't speak English,
she's Dutch, she just came over.

362
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,197
She's been living in an orphan's home
in Rotterdam ever since...

363
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,491
Well, we've adopted her.

364
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,036
I told her you wouldn't
be able to speak to her,

365
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,413
but when she saw you
in the parade yesterday,

366
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,707
she said you were Sinterklaasje, as she
calls you, and you could talk to her.

367
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,051
- Well, I didn't know what to do.
- Hello.

368
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,087
I am happy you came!

369
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:05,209
Ooh! You ARE Sinterklaasje!

370
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,289
Well, yes of course!

371
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:11,627
I knew it, I knew you would understand me.

372
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:15,599
Of course! Tell me what you
would like to get from Sinterklaasje.

373
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,746
Nothing! I already have everything!
I just want to stay with this lovely lady.

374
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,033
Do you want to sing something for me?

375
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:30,870
Sinterklaasje Little Rascal,
Put something in my little shoe,

376
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:36,611
Put something in my little boot,
Thank you, Sinterklaasje!

377
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:41,853
Sinterklaasje Little Rascal
Put something in my little shoe,

378
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:47,295
Put something in my little boot,
Thank you, Sinterklaasje!

379
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:51,679
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, I see what you mean, Mother.

380
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:56,575
Good. But when he spoke Dutch to
that girl, he was so...

381
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,249
Susan, I speak French, but that
doesn't make me Joan of Arc.

382
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,731
What I'm trying
to explain to you is...

383
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,302
- Come in.
- They said you wanted to see me, Mrs. Walker.

384
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:08,110
- Come right in.
- Hello there, good to see you again.

385
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:11,030
- It's nice to see you.
- You're awfully lucky, Mrs. Walker.

386
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,784
Lovely little girl you have here.

387
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:17,113
Thank you, and Susan's the reason I asked
you to drop down. She's a little confused,

388
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:19,045
and I thought you could
help to straighten her out.

389
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:20,109
I'll be glad to.

390
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:23,378
Would you please tell her
that you're not really Santa Claus,

391
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,131
that there actually
is no such person?

392
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,299
Well, I'm sorry to disagree
with you, Mrs. Walker,

393
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,482
but not only is there such a person,
but here I am to prove it.

394
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,297
No, no, no.
You misunderstand.

395
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,561
I want you to tell her the truth.
Uh, what's your name?

396
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:39,185
Kris Kringle. I'll bet
you're in the first grade.

397
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:39,944
Second.

398
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,647
- I mean your real name.
- That is my real name.

399
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,607
Second grade. It's a progressive school.

400
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,405
Oh, it's a progressive school.

401
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,380
May I have this gentleman's
employment card, please?

402
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:51,465
Yes, Mrs. Walker.

403
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,325
This dress is very cute. Where did
you get such a lovely outfit?

404
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,370
- Here at Macy's. We get 10% off.
- Oh.

405
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,707
Please don't feel that you have to
keep pretending for Susan's benefit.

406
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,703
She's a very intelligent child and
always wants to know the absolute truth.

407
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:06,713
Good, because I always tell
the absolute truth.

408
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,842
Now, about your school.
What's the name of your teacher?

409
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:11,301
- Mrs. Hainey.
- Mrs. Hainey.

410
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,429
- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
- Thank you.

411
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,598
<i>What else do you do besides
read and play games?</i>

412
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,726
<i>We have rest periods, one half-hour.</i>

413
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,687
<i>I don't suppose you care for that, eh?</i>

414
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,939
<i>No. We're not allowed
to talk or anything.</i>

415
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,443
<i>Tuesday, Chester Richards,
he kept talking all the time.</i>

416
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,737
<i>My! That was bad.</i>

417
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,032
<i>Yes. Mrs. Hainey made him stay
resting all alone for nearly an hour.</i>

418
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:38,036
Susan, dear, would you go out
and talk to Miss Adams for a minute?

419
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,996
And I'll be right with you.

420
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,332
- All right. Good-bye.
- Good-bye, young lady.

421
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,001
- Hope to see you again.
- Thank you. I hope so, too.

422
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,669
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

423
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:51,549
- Uh, I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr.,...
- Kringle.

424
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,159
I'm sorry, but we're going
to have to make a change.

425
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,052
Change?

426
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,224
The Santa Claus we had two years ago
is back in town, and I feel we owe it to him...

427
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,019
- Have I done something wrong?
- Oh, no! N... No.

428
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,105
Uh, well, uh...

429
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,234
- Yes?
- Mr. Macy wants to see you immediately.

430
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:12,319
Uh, I'll be right up.

431
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,102
Would you sit down? And I'll be
right back and sign your pay voucher.

432
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,079
Yes, indeed.

433
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,874
Oh, uh, go right in. Mr. Macy's waiting.

434
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,844
<i>No, no...</i>

435
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:29,074
- The effect that this
will have on the public...

436
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,648
Oh, come in, Mrs. Walker.

437
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:32,215
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.

438
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,259
- My seat.
- Sit over here.

439
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,344
I've just been telling these gentlemen

440
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,138
of the new policy you
and Mr. Shellhammer initiated.

441
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:43,601
I can't say that I approve of your not
consulting the advertising department first,

442
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,854
but in the face of this tremendous
response on the part of the public,

443
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,815
I can't be angry with you.

444
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:51,767
- What's he talking...
- I'll tell you later.

445
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:54,362
Uh, now to continue, gentlemen,
I admit that on the face of it,

446
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,083
this plan sounds idiotic and impossible.

447
00:26:57,118 --> 00:27:00,876
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus
sending customers to Gimbels.

448
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:04,706
But, gentlemen, you cannot argue with success.

449
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,002
Look at this... telegrams,
messages, telephone calls.

450
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,296
The governor's wife,
the mayor's wife.

451
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,810
Over 500 thankful parents
expressing undying gratitude to Macy's.

452
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:19,220
Never in my entire career
have I seen such a tremendous

453
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,242
and immediate response
to a merchandising policy.

454
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:22,760
But R.H.

455
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:26,081
And I'm positive, Frank,
that if we expand our policy,

456
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:28,388
we'll expand our results as well.

457
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:32,900
Therefore, from now on, not only will
our Santa Claus continue in this manner,

458
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:38,082
but I want every salesperson in this
store to do precisely the same thing.

459
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,462
If we haven't got exactly
what the customer wants,

460
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:42,308
we'll send him where he can get it.

461
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:46,692
No high-pressuring and forcing a customer
to take something he doesn't really want.

462
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:49,336
- But after all, Mr. Macy...
- We'll be known as the helpful store,

463
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:52,598
the friendly store, the store with a heart,

464
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,840
the store that places
public service ahead of profits.

465
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,306
And, consequently, we'll make
more profits than ever before.

466
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:03,439
Oh, yes, I know it's late and we're
all tired and we want to go to dinner,

467
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,780
so we'll continue the
first thing in the morning.

468
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:10,351
In the meantime, you fellas get together and
figure out the best way to promote this thing.

469
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:11,356
- We'll do that. Good night, R.H.
- Good night.

470
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,705
- Good night.
- Good night.

471
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:13,301
Good night.

472
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,009
- Good night, R.H.
- Good night, good night.

473
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:16,859
I want to thank you two again.

474
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:21,076
And in your Christmas envelopes, you'll find
a more practical expression of my gratitude.

475
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,412
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

476
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,583
And tell that Santa Claus
I won't forget him either.

477
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:25,702
Yes, Mr. Macy.

478
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,834
Imagine! A bonus!

479
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,129
He just assumed it was our idea,
so I didn't... what's the matter?

480
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:37,938
- I fired him.
- Who?

481
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:40,261
- Santa Claus.
- What?

482
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:42,546
He's crazy, he thinks he is Santa Claus.

483
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:45,557
Why, I don't care if he thinks he's the
Easter bunny. You've got to get him back.

484
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,886
He's insane, I tell you.

485
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,807
We'll have to hire somebody else
and have him do the same thing.

486
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:52,225
Oh, no. You heard what Mr. Macy said.
We've got to keep him.

487
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,800
But what if he should have
a sudden fit or something?

488
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,925
Oh, no, no, I've got to tell Mr. Macy.

489
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,546
But... but maybe he's only a little crazy,

490
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:03,245
like painters or composers or...
or some of those men in Washington.

491
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,961
We can't be sure until he's been examined.

492
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:08,301
If you fire him and then we find
out that he wasn't really crazy,

493
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:11,416
Mr. Macy will have
us examined... and fired.

494
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,043
I suppose we ought to be sure.

495
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,827
We could have Mr. Sawyer talk to him.

496
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:20,453
Of course. He's a psychologist. That's what
he's paid for... to examine employees.

497
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:23,393
Now, until we get his report,
we won't say a word.

498
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,080
I'll get in touch
with him right away.

499
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:27,713
Yeah, but first,
get that Santa Claus back.

500
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:30,015
The examination won't be worth
a thing without the patient.

501
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:34,121
It was just because I felt
that we owed it to him,

502
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:38,019
but Mr. Macy suggested that we find
something else for the other Santa Claus...

503
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:40,506
and keep you on, by all means.

504
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:44,107
Oh, well, thanks. That's
mighty good news. Yes.

505
00:29:44,142 --> 00:29:46,550
- You'll be here in the morning then?
- Certainly, I will.

506
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,495
You see, Mrs. Walker, this is
quite an opportunity for me.

507
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,541
For the past 50 years or so, I've been
getting more and more worried about Christmas.

508
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,327
It seems we're all so busy
trying to beat the other fellow

509
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,569
in making things go faster
and look shinier and cost less...

510
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:03,525
that Christmas and I are sort of
getting lost in the shuffle.

511
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,451
Oh, I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.

512
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:09,842
Oh, Christmas isn’t just a day.
It's a frame of mind.

513
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,725
And that's what's been changing.

514
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,312
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something about it.

515
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,945
And I'm glad I met you and your daughter.
You two are a test case for me.

516
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,907
- We are?
- Yes! You're sort of the whole thing in miniature.

517
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,819
If I can win you over,
there's still hope.

518
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:29,160
If not, then I guess I'm through.

519
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,830
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.

520
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:35,460
- Good night.
- Good night.

521
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:37,223
- Oh! Oh, Mr. Kringle.
- Yeah?

522
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,504
The first thing in the morning, would you
report to Mr. Sawyer's office?

523
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,313
- Sawyer?
- Yes, he'll just give you a little examination.

524
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:47,857
- Oh, we do it with all our employees.
- A mental examination?

525
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:51,061
Uh, well, uh...

526
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,611
Oh, I don't mind, I've taken dozens of them.

527
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:56,103
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.

528
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,690
- "How many days in the week?"
- Seven.

529
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,568
- "How many fingers do you see?"
- Four.

530
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,612
"Muscular coordination test."

531
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:11,410
No damage to the nervous system.

532
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,500
"Who was the first president
of the United States?"

533
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,205
George Washington.

534
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,765
"Who was the vice president
under John Quincy Adams?"

535
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,520
Daniel D. Tompkins.

536
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,783
And I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer
doesn't know that.

537
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,841
Good night.

538
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:43,390
Miss Adams, would you get me the Brooks'
Memorial Home in, uh, Great Neck?

539
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:45,570
It's... it's a home for old people. That's right.

540
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,530
I want to talk
to the doctor in charge.

541
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:00,126
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

542
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,462
- Who was the first president of the United States?
- George Washington.

543
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,515
- How much is three times five?
- Oh, you asked me that before.

544
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,639
You'll find the answer
right there at the bottom of the...

545
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:11,941
I'm conducting this examination.
How much is three times five?

546
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:14,801
The same as it was before... 15.

547
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,677
You're rather nervous,
aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?

548
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:24,760
- Do you get enough sleep?
- My personal habits are of no concern to you.

549
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:27,804
Oh! I'm sorry. It’s just that I
hate to see someone tied up in...

550
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,035
How many fingers do you see?

551
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,633
Three. Oh! You bite your
nails, too. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

552
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,507
Now, I want you to stand with your
feet together and your arms extended.

553
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:40,231
- Then I want you...
- Muscular coordination test?

554
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,235
Surely. Be glad to.

555
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:50,212
You know, sometimes the cause of nervous
habits like yours is not obvious.

556
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,977
No. Often they're the result
of an insecurity.

557
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:57,490
- Are you happy at home, Mr. Sawyer?
- That will be all, Mr. Kringle!

558
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,040
The examination's over. You may go.

559
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:02,529
- Thank you.
- You may go out that way.

560
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:09,932
And it may interest you to know that
I've been happily married for 26 years.

561
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,046
Really? Delighted to hear it.

562
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:15,076
Good-bye.

563
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,681
- Get me Mrs. Walker.
- Yes, Sir.

564
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,980
And your wife's on 672.
She says it's very important.

565
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,423
Agnes, how many times have I told you
not to bother me at the office?

566
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:35,367
No, not a penny, I give you a liberal allowance
and it's up to you to run the house on it.

567
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:37,324
If that fat, stupid brother
of yours would get a job,

568
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,943
you wouldn't have to be
pestering me all the time!

569
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:45,425
Mrs. Walker. I'd like to talk to you
right away about this Kringle fellow.

570
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,688
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce from the
Brooks' Home is here,

571
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:50,554
and it would be a good time
to settle the whole matter.

572
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,381
Sorry, Doctor, but that was Mr. Sawyer,
the gentleman I was telling you about.

573
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,239
- Oh, yes.
- He'll be right in. He's just down the hall.

574
00:33:57,274 --> 00:34:00,356
I can't tell you how we appreciate
your giving us your time, Doctor.

575
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:03,723
Not at all. As a matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.

576
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:07,150
I had a feeling, along about now,
you people would be wondering about Kris.

577
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:10,571
Oh, Dr. Pierce, uh, Mr. Sawyer.

578
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:11,465
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

579
00:34:11,558 --> 00:34:14,320
Mrs. Walker, after giving this man
a comprehensive examination,

580
00:34:14,355 --> 00:34:16,712
it's my considered opinion
he should be dismissed immediately.

581
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:20,076
Really? He failed to pass
the examination?

582
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,435
- Uh, yes.
- He didn't answer the questions correctly?

583
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,458
Well, yes, he did, but there
was complete lack of concentration.

584
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:28,106
He kept changing the subject.
He was even questioning me.

585
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,770
I don't think there's any doubt about it.
He should be placed in a mental institution.

586
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,400
Oh, I don't agree, Mr. Sawyer.

587
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:37,301
People are only institutionalized to prevent
them from harming themselves or other people.

588
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,326
Now, Mr. Kringle
is incapable of either.

589
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,726
His is a delusion for good. He only
wants to be friendly and helpful.

590
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,653
That's what I feel, too.

591
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:46,486
Why, there are thousands of people
walking around with similar delusions,

592
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,874
living perfectly normal lives
in every other respect.

593
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,461
A famous example is that fellow, uh, uh...

594
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:56,325
Well, I can't think of his name, but for
years he's insisted he's a Russian prince.

595
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,179
There's been all kinds of evidence to prove
him wrong, but nothing has shaken his story.

596
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:02,793
Is he in an institution? No.

597
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:05,590
He owns a famous restaurant in Hollywood
and is a highly respected citizen.

598
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:09,118
Dr. Pierce, I've made a great study
of abnormal psychology

599
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:12,186
and I've found from experience that
when a fixed delusion is challenged,

600
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:14,101
the deluded is apt
to become violent.

601
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:16,041
I'm afraid I'll have to disagree
with you again, Mr. Sawyer!

602
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:16,705
But I...

603
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,434
If you tell Kris
there is no Santa Claus,

604
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:21,586
I grant you he'll argue the point,
but he'll not become violent.

605
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,454
His whole manner
suggests aggressiveness.

606
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,644
Look at the way he carries that cane...
and he's never without it.

607
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:31,446
I know Kris always carries a cane, but surely
you're not implying he'd use the cane as a weapon.

608
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:36,061
Uh... Mrs. Walker, naturally,
I can't discharge this man.

609
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:39,011
That's up to you, but you asked for
my opinion, and I've given it to you.

610
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,643
So, when he exhibits his latent maniacal
tendencies, which I assure you he will,

611
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:45,712
please realize the responsibility
is completely yours.

612
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,467
Uh, speaking of delusions.

613
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:55,822
Now we're right back
where we started.

614
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:59,756
No, we're not. After listening to
Dr. Pierce, I feel perfectly confident.

615
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,952
Yes, but if anything happens,
you won't get blamed, I will.

616
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:05,348
Mrs. Walker,
nothing's going to happen.

617
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:08,426
And please don't feel that what I've
said was prompted by my affection for Kris.

618
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:11,216
- My specialty is geriatrics.
- Huh?

619
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,504
The treatment of the diseases of old age.

620
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:18,425
I've had quite a bit of experience, and I assure
you Kris has no "latent maniacal tendencies."

621
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,431
Well, you'll probably want to discuss this with
Mr. Shellhammer, so I'll be on my way.

622
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:24,664
- May I see Kris?
- Why certainly, Doctor.

623
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:28,022
- Use the employees' elevator. It's much quicker.
- It's the same one you came up on.

624
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,672
- Well, now, where is that? I'm a little twisted.
- I'll show you, Doctor.

625
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:32,147
That isn't necessary, I'll find my way.

626
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,025
You understand my position, Doctor.

627
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,291
If there’s the slightest possibility of his
becoming violent or getting into any trouble,

628
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:40,865
- I could...
- What possible trouble could he get into?

629
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,909
All that's got to happen is for
a policeman to ask him his name.

630
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:47,051
A big argument... clang-clang, Bellevue.

631
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:48,536
Well, you can prevent that very simply.

632
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:51,065
There must be someone at the store
who could rent a room out to him.

633
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,294
Then they could both ride
to and from work together.

634
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,547
I'd just as soon he didn't take that long
train ride out to Great Neck twice a day.

635
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,310
That'd solve everything. If someone was with him,
they could steer him away from trouble.

636
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,886
You mean, sort of take custody of him?

637
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,962
- Do you think he'd agree to that?
- I'll talk to him. I'm sure he will.

638
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:06,833
- In that case, he can stay.
- Good.

639
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:07,688
Thank you.

640
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:10,544
It's the seventh floor,
Doctor, and thank you very much.

641
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,245
- You're welcome. - Bye, Doctor. - Bye.

642
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:16,272
Well, I'm sure you made
a wise decision.

643
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:19,386
Now, let's see. Who could rent him a room?

644
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:23,219
You! Your son's away at school,
what about his room?

645
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,783
Well, I don't mind.

646
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,522
I'd be glad to, but I'm positive
Mrs. Shellhammer wouldn't like it.

647
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:31,832
She's a little... Say! I have an idea.

648
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,834
We always have martinis
before dinner.

649
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,441
I'll make them
double strength tonight.

650
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:39,953
I'll bet after a couple of them,
she'll be more receptive to the idea.

651
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:43,235
But Kris is through work at 6 o'clock,
what about the in-between time?

652
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,683
You'll take him home to dinner,

653
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,989
and I'll call you as soon as my wife's
plast... uh, feeling gay.

654
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,775
- Oh, no.
- Oh, really, Mrs. Walker.

655
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,608
If I am willing to let my wife have
a big headache in the morning,

656
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:55,140
the least you can do is to have
a little headache tonight.

657
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:57,183
- All right.
- Won't take but an hour or so.

658
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,909
By that time, everything
will be quite all right.

659
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,279
Oh, good. Very good.

660
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:06,569
What sort of games do you play with the
other children in the apartment building here?

661
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:08,077
I don't play much with them.

662
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,660
- They play silly games.
- They do?

663
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:13,624
Like today, they were
in the basement playing zoo,

664
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,918
and all of them were animals!

665
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,839
When I came down, Homer,
he was supposed to be the zookeeper,

666
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:22,852
he said, "What kind of an animal are you?"

667
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:25,581
and I said, "I'm not an
animal. I'm a girl.",

668
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:29,835
and he said, "Only animals allowed here.
Good-bye.". So I came upstairs.

669
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,305
Why didn't you tell him
you were a lion or a bear?

670
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,645
- Because I'm not a bear or a lion.
- Yes.

671
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,691
But the other children were only children,
and they were pretending to be animals.

672
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,900
- But that's what makes the game so silly.
- Oh, I don't think so.

673
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:45,005
Sounds like a wonderful game to me.

674
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:49,340
Of course, in order to play it,
you've got to have an imagination.

675
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,308
Do you know what the imagination is?

676
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:57,357
Oh, sure. That's when you see things,
but they're not really there.

677
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:00,833
Well, that can be caused
by other things, too.

678
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:06,260
No, to me the imagination is a place
all by itself... a separate country.

679
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,466
Now, you've heard of the
French nation, the British nation.

680
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,933
Well, this is the Imagination.

681
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:13,751
It's a wonderful place.

682
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:19,246
How would you like to be able to make
snowballs in the summertime, eh?

683
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:23,569
Or drive a great big bus
right down Fifth Avenue.

684
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,906
How would you like to have
a ship all to yourself

685
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:31,052
that makes daily trips
to China and Australia?

686
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:34,242
How would you like to be the
Statue of Liberty in the morning

687
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:37,897
and in the afternoon fly south
with a flock of geese?

688
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:43,380
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.

689
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:47,551
Now, the first thing you've got
to learn is how to pretend.

690
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,597
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"

691
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:54,012
You tell him you're a monkey.

692
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:57,510
- But I don't know how to be a monkey.
- Sure you do.

693
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,499
Here. I'll show you. Now, just bend
your body over a little like that.

694
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:02,374
Let your arms hang loose. See?

695
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,674
Now put your right hand
up here, under here.

696
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:08,552
That's right. Now scratch yourself.
See? That's right. Now, then.

697
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:12,064
Put your tongue under your lips,
over your teeth. Hmm?

698
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,259
- Like this?
- Like that. That's right.

699
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:16,761
Now, then, scratch yourself
and chatter. See?

700
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:24,359
On the contrary, Haislip, Haislip,
Sherman, Mackenzie and Haislip

701
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:25,749
have been very kind to me.

702
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:28,926
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.

703
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,595
Would you put this in Susan's
place for me, please?

704
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,099
I think you can take the meat out.
It should be done.

705
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:38,900
<i>No, no, don't forget to scratch now.</i>

706
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,729
<i>Put your tongue up
in front of the teeth.</i>

707
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:43,756
<i>That's right, talk to the other monkeys.</i>

708
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:45,075
What's going on here?

709
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,736
Oh. We're just having
our first lesson in pretending.

710
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,823
Doing quite well at it, too.
That's right, go on now.

711
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,117
Call the other monkeys.
That's right.

712
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,494
Now you're a goose.
No, you mustn't be a goose,

713
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,913
be a monkey, see?

714
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,040
- Mr. Kringle?
- Yes?

715
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:04,871
Mrs. Walker just happened to mention that
they're looking for a room for you here in town.

716
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:08,715
That's right. Dr. Pierce doesn't want
me to make that long trip every day.

717
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,926
Well, I was just thinking.

718
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,137
I'm all alone in my apartment...

719
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,181
twin beds and plenty of room.

720
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:20,964
Um, if you’d like to move in with me,
I'd be only too happy to have you.

721
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:22,319
That's awfully nice of you.

722
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:26,034
You could ride to and from work
every day with Mrs. Walker and...

723
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,651
Yes.

724
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:32,027
Give me a chance to really
talk things over with her.

725
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,659
Now, don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.

726
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,661
You're not...

727
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,664
Besides, I could see Susie
now and then. Yes.

728
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,713
- Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.
- Good.

729
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,328
We'll drive out after dinner
and get your things.

730
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:50,107
- Thanks.
- Hello? Oh, yes. Just a moment.

731
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:51,717
- It's a Mr. Shellhammer.
- Thanks.

732
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,449
Hello? Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.

733
00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:59,592
Yes. Just a moment. Mrs. Shellhammer
wants to talk to you.

734
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:05,500
I made the martinis triple strength,
and she feels wonderful.

735
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,984
Here, my pet.

736
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,486
Thank you. Hello?

737
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,909
- Hello?
- No, no, no, no... no, Dear.

738
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,286
Thank you, darling.

739
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,458
- Hello!
- No, no, no, Dear.

740
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:28,503
- There.
- Oh, darling! How silly of me.

741
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,424
Hello!

742
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,888
Why, we'd love to have Santa Claus
come and stay with us.

743
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,973
Mm-hmm.

744
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,594
I think it would be
simply charming.

745
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:47,754
Oh, and so do I, Mrs. Shellhammer.
Just a moment.

746
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,372
It's Mrs. Shellhammer,
and they have the loveliest room,

747
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:53,332
and they'd be so happy
if you’d stay with them.

748
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,885
That's very sweet of them.
Please thank them very much.

749
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,549
- But I'm going to stay with Mr. Gailey.
- Mr. Gailey?

750
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:04,548
I think I'd better get the meat.

751
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:10,398
Yes, I understand that, but there must
be something you want for Christmas,

752
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,123
something you haven't even
told your mother about, eh?

753
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,883
Ah, come on now.

754
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,844
Why don't you give me a chance?

755
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,722
Well...

756
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,623
That's what I want for Christmas.

757
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:43,643
- You mean a doll's house like this?
- No, a real house.

758
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:44,293
A real...

759
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:46,809
If you’re really Santa
Claus, you can get it for me.

760
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:50,635
And if you can't, you're only a nice man
with a white beard, like Mother said.

761
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,386
Now, wait a minute, Susie.

762
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:56,099
Just because every child can't get his wish,
that doesn't mean there isn't a Santa Claus.

763
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,352
That's what I thought you'd say.

764
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:02,934
No, but don't you see, Dear? Some children
wish for things they couldn't possibly use

765
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:05,930
like real locomotives or B-29s.

766
00:44:05,965 --> 00:44:09,665
But this isn't like
a locomotive or a B-29.

767
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,226
It's awful big
for a little girl like you.

768
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:14,683
What could you possibly do
with a house like this?

769
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,994
- Live in it with my mother.
- But you've got this lovely apartment.

770
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:20,532
I don't think it's lovely.

771
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,619
I want a backyard with a great
big tree to put a swing on and...

772
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,396
- I guess you can't get it, huh?
- I didn't say that.

773
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,963
No.

774
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:44,138
Well, it's a tall order,
but I'll do my best.

775
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,100
- May I keep this picture?
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,353
Thank you.

777
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,172
- Good night, Susie.
- Good night, Mr. Kringle.

778
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,280
Nice place you've got here.

779
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,324
And was I lucky to get it.

780
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,204
- You, uh... You like living in Manhattan?
- Oh, it's all right.

781
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,416
Of course, someday I'd like to
get a place on Long Island.

782
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,920
Not a big house, just one of those
junior partner deals around Manhasset.

783
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,006
I know just the kind
of place you mean.

784
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,908
One of those little, uh,
colonial houses.

785
00:46:03,943 --> 00:46:05,345
Mm-hmm. Either that or a Cape Cod.

786
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,057
Yeah. You know, I think you're
right about Mrs. Walker.

787
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:13,019
A little more effort on your part,
and she might crawl out of that shell.

788
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,397
Take her out to dinner
or the theater.

789
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:19,586
Mmm. I've tried that.
She's always too busy with her job.

790
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:21,166
Well, try a little harder.

791
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:24,239
Those two are a couple of lost souls,
and it's up to us to help them.

792
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,867
I'll take care of Susie
if you’ll take care of her mother.

793
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,827
- It's a deal.
- Good. Ready?

794
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,288
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not going
to be cheated this way.

795
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,666
All my life I've wondered something,
and now's my chance to find out.

796
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,587
I'm gonna find the answer to a question
that's puzzled the world for centuries.

797
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,924
Does Santa Claus sleep
with his whiskers outside or in?

798
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,926
Always sleep with them out.

799
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,454
- Cold air makes 'em grow.
- Ah.

800
00:46:54,503 --> 00:46:57,353
- Joe, we're running out of books.
- I'll get some for you right away.

801
00:46:57,388 --> 00:46:59,065
And I need some more Wanamaker's!

802
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,300
Yes, I know just what you want.

803
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,011
We don't carry that brand,
but I think Gimbels does.

804
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,056
Let me see. Yes, here it is!

805
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,933
I thought I noticed it before.

806
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,479
- 2.98. Looks like an exceptional bargain.
- Yes. Yes, it does.

807
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,190
- Thank you.
- Not at all. Not at all.

808
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,109
And why didn't one of you
think of this idea?

809
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:53,954
It's the greatest goodwill policy
I ever heard of.

810
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:59,334
Every shopper in New York City suddenly
thinks of Macy as a benevolent soul,

811
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,975
thinking only of the
welfare of the public.

812
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,508
And what does that make Gimbel?
Nothing but a profiteering money-grubber.

813
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,413
Well, two can play at this game.

814
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:12,846
From now on, if we haven't got what the
customer wants, send him back to Macy's.

815
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:14,266
And what's more,
we'll do the same thing

816
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,861
in our stores in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee and Pittsburgh.

817
00:48:18,387 --> 00:48:19,792
Now get to work on it right away.

818
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:21,410
<i>Can you imagine anything like that?</i>

819
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:26,332
So, Gimbel's doing it in Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh and Milwaukee, eh?

820
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,973
- Yes, and very successfully.
- Well, we can cover the country, too.

821
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:35,077
Notify our stores in San Francisco, Atlanta,
Toledo and Newark to get going right away.

822
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,413
- All right, R.H.
- All right, Mr. Macy.

823
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:41,042
<i>- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.</i>

824
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,044
<i>Now one more, shake hands!</i>

825
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,589
- That's fine! - Thanks! - Good.

826
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:48,592
- Now we'll take some at my store.
- Uh, just a minute.

827
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,262
I have something I'd like
to give our friend here.

828
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:57,183
This is just a little something to show
my appreciation for all you've done.

829
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,394
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

830
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,439
Ooh! That's very kind of you.

831
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:06,026
I didn't think you were that generous.

832
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,077
That's a bit of money,
what are you going to do with it?

833
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:14,618
Well, I have a friend... a doctor.

834
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,598
He's been very kind to me.
He needs an X-ray machine.

835
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:21,166
Oh, I don't think
that's going to be enough.

836
00:49:21,201 --> 00:49:23,900
- I better give you...
- I'll make up the difference.

837
00:49:23,935 --> 00:49:28,731
- Buy it through the store and get 10% discount.
- I can get it for cost.

838
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,464
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Cleo.

839
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:41,190
Now, would you like me to sing you
a little good-night song?

840
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:42,542
If you want to.

841
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:48,350
- Doesn't your mother ever sing to you at night?
- Mm-mmm. Why should she?

842
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:53,612
Oh, no reason, I... I just
think it's kind of nice.

843
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,733
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.

844
00:49:57,768 --> 00:50:01,775
To market, to market
to buy a fat pig

845
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,036
Home again, home again
Jiggety jig

846
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:08,383
To market, to market
to buy a fat hog

847
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:12,759
Home again, home again
Jiggety...

848
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:18,431
Amazing.

849
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,102
- Do you happen to have a spare piece?
- Mm-hmm.

850
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:35,240
Well, here goes.

851
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,961
Oh!

852
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,145
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Kris.

853
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,647
How about a little game
of checkers after lunch, eh?

854
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,948
Leave us not today, Kris.
I... I don't feel like it.

855
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:14,779
- Oh, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

856
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,407
Well, something is wrong.
What is it?

857
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:21,837
Well, remember I was telling you how I liked

858
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,892
to play Santa Claus over at
the "Y" on Christmas and...

859
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:27,584
- and give out packages to the young kids?
- Yeah.

860
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,628
Well, I was telling that
to Mr. Sawyer, see, and...

861
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,630
Well, he says that's very bad.

862
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,758
Sawyer? You mean...

863
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,969
That's the one. He's a psy...
a psychologist, you know.

864
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,722
Well, that's a debatable point.

865
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,391
- Why is it bad? Does he say?
- Oh, sure.

866
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:48,521
He says that guys who dress up like Santa
Claus, see, and give presents away...

867
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,608
do it because when they was young,
they must've did something bad,

868
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,651
and they feel guilty about it.

869
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:57,121
So now they do something they think
is good to make up for it, see?

870
00:51:57,306 --> 00:51:59,789
It's what he calls "a guilt complex."

871
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,205
- How old are you, Alfred?
- Seventeen.

872
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,415
Seventeen.

873
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:12,313
It doesn't seem to me that you've had time to
be guilty of anything much except overeating.

874
00:52:12,348 --> 00:52:16,414
It's nothing to laugh about, Kris.
It's pretty serious, he says.

875
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:18,680
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen to him.

876
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:20,685
Oh, he knows what he's talking about.

877
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,714
He's been studying that stuff
for a long time.

878
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:29,591
Oh. Well, what's the basis of this
guilt complex you're supposed to have?

879
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:31,314
Does he say that?

880
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,234
Well, he ain't found out yet.

881
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,695
It's probably way down
inside of me someplace, see?

882
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,115
Maybe somethin' that happened to me
when I was a baby, he says.

883
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,243
It takes time, but he'll do it, he says.

884
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,620
You mean you're going to him again?

885
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,207
Oh, sure. I go every day for a little
while, after I finish my lunch.

886
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,543
Uh, he don't soak me nothin'.

887
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:55,300
He's doing it for free 'cause...
'cause I'm an interesting case.

888
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:59,163
Yes. What else has he found
wrong with you, Alfred?

889
00:53:01,906 --> 00:53:03,982
- Anything else?
- No.

890
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,224
Oh, just that I hate my father.

891
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,560
I didn't know it, but he says I do.

892
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,278
And he sees you every day?

893
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:15,056
Yeah, I just sit in a chair and say
anything that comes into my head.

894
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,574
Excuse me, Alfred.

895
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:20,063
A few things have just come into
my head, and I'm going to say them.

896
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:33,648
What do you mean bursting
into my office like this?

897
00:53:34,568 --> 00:53:37,297
- Are you a licensed psychiatrist?
- What business is it of yours?

898
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,340
I have great respect for psychiatry

899
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,939
and great contempt for meddling amateurs
who go around practicing it.

900
00:53:42,974 --> 00:53:47,618
You have no more right to analyze Alfred
than a dentist has to remove a gallbladder.

901
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:48,516
I beg your pardon!

902
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,773
Your job here, I understand,
is to give intelligence tests.

903
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:55,491
Passing yourself off as a psychologist,
you ought to be horsewhipped.

904
00:53:55,526 --> 00:54:00,474
Taking a normal, impressionable boy like Alfred
and filling him up with complexes and phobias.

905
00:54:00,509 --> 00:54:02,500
I think I'm better equipped
to judge that than you are.

906
00:54:02,535 --> 00:54:06,380
Just because the boy wants to be good and kind
to children, you tell him he has a guilt complex.

907
00:54:06,415 --> 00:54:08,565
Having the same delusion, you
couldn't possibly understand.

908
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,771
The boy is definitely maladjusted,
and I'm helping him.

909
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:12,663
Maladjusted? You talk about maladjustment?

910
00:54:12,698 --> 00:54:14,716
Seems to me that the patient
is running the clinic here.

911
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:15,752
I won't stand...

912
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,244
Leave this office immediately.

913
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:19,387
Now, either you stop analyzing Alfred,

914
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,967
or I go straight to Mr. Macy and tell him
what a malicious, contemptible fraud you are.

915
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:24,090
Get out before I
have you thrown out.

916
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,514
There's only one way
to handle a man like you.

917
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,669
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.

918
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:34,145
- You have no humanity.
- Are you going to leave?

919
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,563
Yes.

920
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,899
Ow!

921
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:46,917
- Kris?
- Mr. Sawyer!

922
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:50,016
- Mr. Sawyer, are you all right?
- Look at that bump!

923
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:52,980
Mr. Saw... he's unconscious,
better get a wet towel.

924
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:55,041
- No, better get a doctor.
- Mr. Sawyer.

925
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,960
You must have done something to him.

926
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,379
I tell you, we were merely talking.

927
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,526
But the moment I mentioned Santa Claus...

928
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:03,466
the moment I attacked his
delusion... he became violent.

929
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,070
I told you he had latent
maniacal tendencies.

930
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:08,846
Well, I think this prove... proves it.

931
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,668
Maybe we'd better have Dr. Pierce
give him another examination.

932
00:55:11,703 --> 00:55:14,645
Dr. Pierce! He doesn't know
anything about this sort of thing.

933
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,907
- He's a general practitioner.
- You must admit, this is rather serious.

934
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:19,617
Perhaps we'd better get
a competent psychiatrist.

935
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:22,944
He's taken dozens of those
examinations and passed them all 100%.

936
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,489
Well, in view of this, it's possible
his condition has changed.

937
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,700
I don't think we can take any chances.
Really, I don't.

938
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:32,328
I can't see any harm in it. If he passes
the test, he can return to work immediately.

939
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,483
And if he doesn't, well
it... it's better we find out.

940
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,373
I suppose so.

941
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,326
And you better have the examination
right away, before he tells Mr. Ma...

942
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:40,753
before Mr. Macy finds out.

943
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:45,396
Oh, yes. Oh, my, yes. You explain to
Mr. Kringle. After all, you're a friend of his.

944
00:55:45,431 --> 00:55:47,543
I won't do it. I can't do it.
I've grown very fond of him,

945
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:50,094
and this would be like coming out and
telling him that I thought he was insane.

946
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:53,560
- Well! You don't call this acting normal, do you?
- Of course I don't.

947
00:55:53,595 --> 00:55:56,394
But there are thousands of other
old people who aren't normal either.

948
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,523
This is going to hurt Kris very deeply,
and I don't want to be the one to do it!

949
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:12,169
I don't think that would be very fair to him.
I'll tell him the truth.

950
00:56:12,204 --> 00:56:14,037
I always believe
in being truthful with people.

951
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,892
If he sees me or you mention psychiatrist,
it's more or less attacking his delusion again.

952
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:20,244
He's apt to become violent.

953
00:56:20,245 --> 00:56:23,025
But in front of the children?
Oh, but that'd be terrible.

954
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,424
Well, you'd better get him out of
the store on some other pretext.

955
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:28,655
- Then, once outside, I'll explain it to him.
- All right.

956
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,219
If you think that it's better that way.

957
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:35,035
Please keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.

958
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,557
- Mr. Kringle.
- Yeah?

959
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:47,472
Mrs. Walker wanted me to tell you we're going
to take some publicity pictures this afternoon...

960
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:50,676
down... down at the city hall,
you and the mayor.

961
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,471
Good. Like to meet him.

962
00:56:52,506 --> 00:56:54,744
A few things I'd like
to talk over with him.

963
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,789
Oh, but I've made an appointment
with Mr. Macy at 4 o'clock.

964
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,707
Want to tell him
about something.

965
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,211
You'll be back in plenty of time.
There's a car waiting for you downstairs,

966
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:06,422
and it's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat. I'll get it.

967
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,382
Thanks, I'll be right with you.

968
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:11,161
Just want to take care of a
few of these kiddies first.

969
00:57:12,102 --> 00:57:12,678
All right.

970
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:39,122
- Where to?
- Bellevue.

971
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:41,207
Bellevue!?!

972
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:54,355
- Did she know about this?
- Yes. We all discussed it.

973
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:06,021
The second party shall, in consideration
of the property hereby agreed to be conveyed

974
00:58:06,056 --> 00:58:07,258
by the first party
to the second party

975
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,245
Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.

976
00:58:13,248 --> 00:58:16,242
Hello. Yes. Yes.

977
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,680
Why, yes, we share
an apartment together.

978
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:26,210
Bellevue? But why, Doctor?
What did he...

979
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,462
Oh, he's quite comfortable.

980
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,464
He's going to be with us
for a few days,

981
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:34,177
and he was wondering if you could
bring over his personal things.

982
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,429
Yes.

983
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,806
Yes, in view of his examination,

984
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,592
I'm afraid I shall have
to recommend commitment.

985
00:58:43,003 --> 00:58:46,336
Well, yes, I... I know, Mr. Gailey,
but I'd rather speak to you in person.

986
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:47,815
I'll be right over, Doctor.

987
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,310
- See the new patient.
- Thanks.

988
00:58:57,345 --> 00:58:58,659
Not at all.

989
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:10,578
- Hello, Kris.
- Fred.

990
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,758
Why'd you do it, Kris?

991
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,427
You deliberately failed
that examination, didn't you?

992
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,766
- Why?
- Why?

993
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,727
Because the last few days,
I've had great hope.

994
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,647
I had a feeling Doris was
beginning to believe in me.

995
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:31,548
Now I find out she was only
just humoring me all the time.

996
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:32,860
But I just talked
to her on the phone.

997
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:35,946
She didn't know anything about that
taking pictures with the mayor.

998
00:59:35,981 --> 00:59:38,574
- That was Sawyer's idea.
- Hmm?

999
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,576
Well, I'm glad of that.

1000
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:43,369
But why didn't she come to me
and explain the whole thing?

1001
00:59:43,404 --> 00:59:44,734
She didn't want to hurt you.

1002
00:59:44,769 --> 00:59:49,530
But only because I was a nice, kind,
old man and she was sorry for me.

1003
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:52,195
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. She had doubts.

1004
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,173
That's why she was just sorry.

1005
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,409
If you’d been dragged off here instead
of me, she wouldn't have been sorry.

1006
00:59:57,444 --> 01:00:00,952
- She'd have been furious.
- All right. She had doubts.

1007
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:04,600
Why not? She hasn't really
believed in anything for years.

1008
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,478
- You can't expect her to suddenly...
- Oh, it's not just Doris.

1009
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,190
There's Mr. Sawyer.
He's contemptible, dishonest,

1010
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,651
selfish, deceitful, vicious.

1011
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,837
Yet he's out there,
and I'm in here.

1012
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:18,827
He's called normal,
and I'm not.

1013
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:21,008
Well, if that’s normal,
I don't want it.

1014
01:00:21,043 --> 01:00:23,786
That's why I answered
the questions incorrectly.

1015
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,998
But, Kris, you can't
just think of yourself.

1016
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:30,635
What happens to you
matters to a lot of other people,

1017
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,296
people like me who believe
in what you stand for.

1018
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,674
And people like... like Susie
who are just beginning to.

1019
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,802
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.

1020
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,659
No, I suppose I shouldn't.

1021
01:00:42,694 --> 01:00:46,892
Who knows? Maybe someday, the Sawyers
will be in here instead of out there.

1022
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,979
You're right. I ought
to be ashamed of myself.

1023
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,773
Even if we can't win,
we can go down swinging.

1024
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,610
Let's get out of here.
Now, wait a minute.

1025
01:00:55,645 --> 01:00:58,779
You're forgetting, you flunked
your examination, but good.

1026
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:02,074
Oh, yes. I forgot.

1027
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,493
I said Calvin Coolidge
was the first president.

1028
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,288
I can imagine what they're
thinking of me for saying that.

1029
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:11,288
But you'll get me out of this.
You'll think of something.

1030
01:01:11,323 --> 01:01:13,053
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.

1031
01:01:13,088 --> 01:01:17,331
Oh, it will be for you. I believe you're
the greatest lawyer since Darrow.

1032
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:19,880
Just a second, Kris. You're
putting me in an awful spot.

1033
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:24,212
- But I believe in you. You can't let me down.
- But you don't understand. It...

1034
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,560
- I'll do everything I can, Kris.
- Thank you.

1035
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,645
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1036
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:40,739
That's a lot of nonsense.
Dangerous, my foot!

1037
01:01:40,774 --> 01:01:44,002
I don't care if he failed 10
examinations. You had no right to do it.

1038
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,826
Now, you get the case
dropped tomorrow,

1039
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:49,413
or you might have another lump
to match the one that Kris gave you.

1040
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,499
Yes, Mr. Macy.

1041
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,308
"Age unknown."
Old man, huh?

1042
01:02:09,343 --> 01:02:14,088
- Very old, Your Honor.
- I suppose I'll have to read all this.

1043
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:15,606
You can take my word for it.

1044
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,900
Just routine commitment papers...
cut and dried.

1045
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,617
The man calls himself Kris Kringle.
Thinks he's Santa Claus.

1046
01:02:21,652 --> 01:02:23,155
Uh-oh.

1047
01:02:26,058 --> 01:02:27,208
Come in.

1048
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:31,745
A Mr. Gailey to see you, Your Honor.
He represents Mr. Kringle.

1049
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:34,591
Better show him in.

1050
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,714
Good morning. Your Honor, there seems
to be undue haste in this case.

1051
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,591
I wish to protect my client's
rights, as I'm sure you do.

1052
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:44,539
Of course, of course.

1053
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:48,180
If Your Honor please, I request a formal
hearing to which I may bring witnesses.

1054
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,138
- I thought you said this was cut and dry.
- That's what I was told.

1055
01:02:51,173 --> 01:02:52,601
I didn't know anything
about a protest.

1056
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,521
Of course you may sign the commitment
papers now, if you wish, Your Honor,

1057
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,222
but I shall bring in an
habeas corpus this afternoon.

1058
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,984
There's no point in signing.

1059
01:03:00,468 --> 01:03:05,265
We'll have a hearing on, uh,
Monday morning at 10 o'clock.

1060
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,116
Thank you, Your Honor, good day.

1061
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,706
Thank you.

1062
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:23,632
Uh, that man... I heard him say something
about Mr. Kringle before. Who is he?

1063
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:25,749
His name is Gailey, Kringle's lawyer.

1064
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:27,789
Probably grabbed the case
to get some cheap publicity.

1065
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:29,596
Publicity? Oh! We can't have that, Mr. Mara.

1066
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,311
As a matter of fact, Mr. Macy would
rather drop the whole thing right now.

1067
01:03:32,346 --> 01:03:33,601
Well, it can't be done, it's too late now,

1068
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,227
Kringle has been examined
by psychiatrists at the City Hospital.

1069
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:39,362
- It has to go through the regular routine.
- Oh! We must avoid publicity.

1070
01:03:39,397 --> 01:03:40,841
I... Oh.

1071
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,037
Mr. Gailey, I represent Mr. Macy.
My name's Sawyer.

1072
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,998
- Oh, so you're Sawyer.
- Yes.

1073
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,022
Now, regarding this Kringle matter,

1074
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:00,505
we're very anxious to
avoid publicity of any kind.

1075
01:04:00,506 --> 01:04:01,006
Naturally.

1076
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,804
So, if you would agree to put this
matter through, uh, quietly,

1077
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,134
I'm sure we could find some generous
way of expressing our appreciation.

1078
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,429
- Very interesting.
- Then you'll cooperate?

1079
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:15,272
Very interesting. Publicity. Hmm.
You know, that's not a bad idea.

1080
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:19,482
Ya know, if I'm gonna win this case, I'm gonna
have to have public opinion and plenty of it,

1081
01:04:19,506 --> 01:04:21,674
and publicity's just the way to do it.

1082
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,320
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.

1083
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,740
Oh, Mr. Gailey. Mr. Gailey,
wait a minute. I just want to talk.

1084
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:32,519
Mr. Gailey, one moment, please.

1085
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:00,968
Well, I... I don't see what they're
making such a fuss about.

1086
01:05:01,003 --> 01:05:02,841
After all, he's an old man and...

1087
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:05,280
How you been feeling lately, Henry?
You look a little run-down.

1088
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:09,103
Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.

1089
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,534
Why don't you go and see the doc,
take a few weeks off?

1090
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:14,000
Go fishin'. Go huntin'.
Go anyplace.

1091
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:18,225
- Why should I?
- Because this Kringle case is dynamite.

1092
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,173
Let some judge handle it that isn't
coming up for reelection.

1093
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:25,291
- I can't do that.
- Henry, listen. I'm no legal brain trust.

1094
01:05:25,326 --> 01:05:27,392
I don't know a habeas
from a corpus.

1095
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:29,592
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.

1096
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:33,140
I got you elected, didn't I? And I'm
gonna try to get you reelected.

1097
01:05:33,175 --> 01:05:36,264
I know, Charlie.
Now, don't misunderstand me.

1098
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,374
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

1099
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:40,876
- And I'm telling you to get off this case.
- But why?

1100
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:44,258
Because you're a regular Pontius Pilate
the minute you start, that's why.

1101
01:05:44,293 --> 01:05:46,709
Oh, I don't believe it.

1102
01:05:46,744 --> 01:05:48,319
I'm an honest man,

1103
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,217
and nobody's going to hold it against me
for doing my duty as I see it.

1104
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,825
Grandma! Grandma!

1105
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,286
- Grandma! Grandma!
- Grandma! Grandma!

1106
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:01,373
- Good night, Terry.
- Good night, Alice.

1107
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,375
Now straight to bed.

1108
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,648
I promised your mother you'd be
in bed by 8 o'clock and it's way past.

1109
01:06:06,683 --> 01:06:07,858
Aren't you coming, too?

1110
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:10,770
Mm-hmm. I'll be up in a minute
to tuck you in. Now scoot!

1111
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:15,336
Now, how about a great big kiss
for Grandpa, hmm?

1112
01:06:17,615 --> 01:06:19,295
- Hmph!
- Hmph!

1113
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:25,042
A fine way to treat their grandfather...
no hug, no kiss, no anything.

1114
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:28,359
I don't blame them. Any man who puts
Santa Claus on trial for lunacy.

1115
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,363
See what I mean?

1116
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:38,686
Hey.

1117
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:57,741
Oh, don't worry about me, I've got
the best lawyer in the world.

1118
01:06:57,776 --> 01:06:59,876
H...how long do you think
this will take?

1119
01:06:59,911 --> 01:07:01,225
- Maybe a week.
- A week?

1120
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,227
That seems impossible.
All that has to be done is...

1121
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,587
You don't think that lawyer's going to be
stupid enough to let him admit anything, do you?

1122
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,762
He's naturally going to deny everything. And I'll
bring witnesses, and he'll bring witnesses.

1123
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:12,393
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1124
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:16,303
All persons having business with the
Special Term, Part 3 of the supreme court

1125
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:18,038
held in and for the County of New York,

1126
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:21,161
draw near and give your attendance,
and ye shall be heard.

1127
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,797
In the matter of Kris Kringle, Your Honor,
the commitment papers are before you.

1128
01:07:27,832 --> 01:07:30,587
If Your Honor please, I should like
to call the first witness.

1129
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,173
Mr. Kringle, will you take the stand?

1130
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,522
Good morning, Your Honor.

1131
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:52,943
You do solemnly swear that the testimony you
are about to give in the cause before this court

1132
01:07:52,978 --> 01:07:55,516
shall be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1133
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:56,947
- I do.
- Uh...

1134
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,203
Before you begin, Mr. Mara,
I want to explain to the witness

1135
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:01,987
that this is a hearing, not a trial.

1136
01:08:02,722 --> 01:08:06,795
Mr. Kringle, you don't have to answer
any questions against your wishes

1137
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,587
or even testify at all.

1138
01:08:08,622 --> 01:08:10,602
We have no objection, Your Honor.

1139
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,379
Oh, I'll be glad to answer
any questions I can.

1140
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,644
- What is your name?
- Kris Kringle.

1141
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,340
- Where do you live?
- That's what this hearing will decide.

1142
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,575
A very sound answer, Mr. Kringle.

1143
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:39,304
- Do you believe that you're Santa Claus?
- Of course.

1144
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,413
The State rests, Your Honor.

1145
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:58,724
Well, Mr. Gailey, do you wish
to cross-examine the witness?

1146
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,089
I believe he was employed
to "play" Santa Claus.

1147
01:09:01,124 --> 01:09:03,590
Perhaps he didn't understand
the question correctly.

1148
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,370
Oh, I understood the question
perfectly, Your Honor.

1149
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,831
No further questions
at this time.

1150
01:09:17,274 --> 01:09:18,367
Thank you.

1151
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:26,203
In view of this statement, do you still
wish to put in a defense, young man?

1152
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,330
I do, Your Honor.

1153
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,999
I'm fully aware
of my client's opinions.

1154
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,001
In fact, that's the entire case
against him.

1155
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,963
All these complicated tests
and reports boil down to this.

1156
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:40,263
Mr. Kringle is not sane because
he believes himself to be Santa Claus.

1157
01:09:40,298 --> 01:09:44,545
An entirely logical and reasonable
assumption, I'm afraid.

1158
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:49,495
It would be if the clerk here or Mr. Mara
or I believed that we were Santa Claus.

1159
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,093
Anyone who thinks
he's Santa Claus is not sane.

1160
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:53,730
Not necessarily.

1161
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,316
You believe yourself
to be Judge Harper,

1162
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,819
yet no one questions your sanity
because you are Judge Harper.

1163
01:09:59,854 --> 01:10:01,822
I know all about myself, young man.

1164
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:05,817
- Mr. Kringle is the subject of this hearing.
- Yes, Your Honor.

1165
01:10:05,852 --> 01:10:09,642
And if he is the person he believes
himself to be, just as you are,

1166
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:11,511
then he's just as sane.

1167
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:14,546
- Granted, but he isn't.
- Oh, but he is, Your Honor.

1168
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:15,138
Is what?

1169
01:10:15,139 --> 01:10:18,622
I intend to prove that
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.

1170
01:10:20,557 --> 01:10:22,061
He's crazy, too.

1171
01:10:35,656 --> 01:10:38,134
- Hello.
- Hello, Darling. Sorry I'm late.

1172
01:10:38,169 --> 01:10:41,306
Get your coat. I reserved our regular table
at Luigi's. We're gonna celebrate.

1173
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:43,697
- What are we celebrating?
- Read all about it!

1174
01:10:43,732 --> 01:10:46,398
Gailey throws bombshell
in New York Supreme Court.

1175
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:47,235
Yes, I read that.

1176
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,965
Oh, I didn't see this... front page! Good, good!

1177
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:53,543
- You're not serious about this.
- Of course I am.

1178
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,510
But you can't possibly
prove that he's Santa Claus.

1179
01:10:56,533 --> 01:10:57,264
Why not?

1180
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,497
You saw Macy and Gimbel shaking hands.

1181
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:02,406
- That wasn't possible either, but it happened.
- Honestly, Fred...

1182
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:05,749
It's the best defense I can use,
completely logical and completely unexpected.

1183
01:11:05,784 --> 01:11:07,137
And completely idiotic.

1184
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,171
What about your bosses... Haislip
and Mackenzie and the rest of them?

1185
01:11:10,206 --> 01:11:11,642
What do they say?

1186
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:15,479
Hmm. That I am jeopardizing the prestige
and dignity of an old, established law firm,

1187
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:18,941
and either I drop this impossible case
immediately or they will drop me.

1188
01:11:19,367 --> 01:11:21,026
- See!
- I beat them to it... I quit.

1189
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,779
- Fred, you didn't!
- Of course I did, I can't let Kris down.

1190
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:27,324
He needs me, and all the
rest of us need him.

1191
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,535
Look, darling,
he's a nice old man,

1192
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,955
and I admire you
for wanting to help him,

1193
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,791
but you've got to be realistic
and face facts.

1194
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,441
You can’t just throw your career away
because of a sentimental whim.

1195
01:11:39,476 --> 01:11:41,469
But I'm not throwing
my career away.

1196
01:11:41,504 --> 01:11:45,224
But if Haislip feels that way, so
will every other law firm in town.

1197
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,806
I'm sure they will.
Then I'll open my own office.

1198
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:49,763
And what kind of cases
will you get?

1199
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:53,141
Oh, probably a lot of people like Kris
that are being pushed around.

1200
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,352
That's the only fun in law anyway.

1201
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:59,789
I promise you, if you believe in me
and have faith in me, everything will...

1202
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,073
You don't have any faith
in me, do you?

1203
01:12:05,508 --> 01:12:08,581
It's not a question of faith.
It’s just common sense.

1204
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,885
Faith is believing in things when
common sense tells you not to.

1205
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,039
Don't you see?

1206
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,766
It's not just Kris that's on trial.
It's everything he stands for.

1207
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,391
Oh, Fred.

1208
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:21,253
It's kindness and joy and love
and all the other intangibles.

1209
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,399
Oh, Fred! You're talking like a child!
You're living in a realistic world.

1210
01:12:24,434 --> 01:12:27,470
And those lovely intangibles of yours
are attractive, but not worth very much.

1211
01:12:27,505 --> 01:12:30,793
- You don't get ahead that way.
- That all depends on what you call getting ahead.

1212
01:12:30,828 --> 01:12:33,140
Evidently, you and I have
different definitions.

1213
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,059
These last few days, we've talked
about some wonderful plans.

1214
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,228
Then you go on
an idealistic binge.

1215
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,439
You give up your job,
you throw away all your security,

1216
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,650
and then you expect me
to be happy about it!

1217
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,361
Yes, I guess
I expected too much.

1218
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,530
Look, Doris, someday
you're gonna find out

1219
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,825
that your way of facing this
realistic world just doesn't work.

1220
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,620
And when you do, don't overlook
those lovely intangibles.

1221
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,290
You'll discover they're the
only things that are worthwhile.

1222
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,870
These reporters make me
look like a sadistic monster

1223
01:13:10,905 --> 01:13:13,417
who likes to drown cats and tear
the wings off butterflies.

1224
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:14,708
Why, this old man is...

1225
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:17,525
Oh, Tommy. Go in and get
Mother's scissors, will you?

1226
01:13:18,919 --> 01:13:21,521
They're in the bedroom.
That's a good boy.

1227
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:27,027
I don't want you to discuss this case
in front of him, it would break his heart.

1228
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,696
And while we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.

1229
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:33,742
Mr. Kringle seems to be a nice old man, and I
don't see why you have to keep persecuting him.

1230
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,659
Firstly, I am not persecuting him,
I am prosecuting him.

1231
01:13:37,694 --> 01:13:40,749
And secondly,
I like the old man, too.

1232
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,793
I wish I'd never gotten into this.

1233
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,087
But it's too late now, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

1234
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:49,132
It's up to the State of New York, and I'm just
their duly appointed legal representative.

1235
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:52,260
Kringle has been declared a menace
to society by competent doctors,

1236
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:55,597
and it's my duty to protect the State
of New York and see that he's put away.

1237
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,267
No matter what they may say
about me, I've got to do it.

1238
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:03,814
Sometimes I wish I'd married
a butcher or... plumber.

1239
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:07,684
Well, my dear, if I lose this case, it's very
possible that you'll get your wish.

1240
01:14:20,866 --> 01:14:22,073
Hello, Kris.

1241
01:14:34,611 --> 01:14:36,930
- Your name?
- R.H. Macy.

1242
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:40,267
You are the owner of one of the biggest
department stores in New York City?

1243
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,476
The biggest.

1244
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:45,776
Mr. Macy, if you recognize the gentleman
seated there, will you tell us who he is?

1245
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:47,818
- Kris Kringle.
- Your employee, is he not?

1246
01:14:47,853 --> 01:14:49,748
- Yes.
- Do you believe him to be truthful?

1247
01:14:49,783 --> 01:14:50,819
Yes.

1248
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:54,151
- Do you believe him to be of sound mind?
- I certainly do.

1249
01:14:54,186 --> 01:14:58,130
Mr. Macy, you are under oath. Do you really
believe that this man is Santa Claus?

1250
01:14:58,769 --> 01:15:00,478
Well, I...

1251
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,786
Well, he gives every indication...

1252
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:11,114
I asked you, Mr. Macy, do you really
believe that this man is Santa Claus?

1253
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,293
- I do.
- What'd you say?

1254
01:15:22,328 --> 01:15:23,510
That's all.

1255
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,616
Psychologist!

1256
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,244
Where'd you graduate from,
a correspondence school?

1257
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,330
You're fired.

1258
01:15:45,448 --> 01:15:47,323
Your Honor, I object to this testimony.

1259
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:49,170
It's ridiculous, irrelevant
and immaterial.

1260
01:15:49,205 --> 01:15:51,272
Mr. Gailey is making
a circus out of this court.

1261
01:15:51,307 --> 01:15:53,940
There is no such person as Santa Claus,
and everybody knows it.

1262
01:15:53,975 --> 01:15:56,509
Your Honor, I submit
it's purely a matter of opinion.

1263
01:15:56,636 --> 01:16:00,187
Can Mr. Mara offer any proof
that there is no Santa Claus?

1264
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:01,752
No, and I do not intend to.

1265
01:16:01,787 --> 01:16:03,922
This is not a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court,

1266
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:06,438
and I'll not waste this court's time
with such childish nonsense.

1267
01:16:06,473 --> 01:16:08,964
Mr. Mara seems to have appointed
himself the judge here, Your Honor.

1268
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:11,610
He's now ruling on what
testimony I may introduce.

1269
01:16:11,645 --> 01:16:13,966
Your Honor, we request an immediate
ruling from this court.

1270
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:17,099
Is there, or is there not
a Santa Claus?

1271
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,035
Well...

1272
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,051
The court will take a short recess
to consider the matter.

1273
01:16:35,074 --> 01:16:37,259
I don't care what you do
with old whisker puss,

1274
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,095
but if you go back in there and rule
that there's no Santa Claus,

1275
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:43,241
you better start looking
for that chicken farm right now.

1276
01:16:43,276 --> 01:16:45,558
Why, we won't even be able
to put you in the primaries.

1277
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:50,146
But, Charlie, listen to reason.
I'm a responsible judge.

1278
01:16:50,181 --> 01:16:51,606
I've taken an oath.

1279
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,946
How can I seriously rule
that there is a Santa Claus?

1280
01:16:54,981 --> 01:16:56,695
Why don't you li...

1281
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:01,090
All right. You go back and tell 'em...

1282
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:04,620
that the New York State Supreme Court
rules there's no Santa Claus.

1283
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:06,121
It's all over the papers.

1284
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,957
The kids read it, and they don't
hang up their stockings.

1285
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:12,836
Now, what happens to all the toys that
are supposed to be in those stockings?

1286
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,629
Nobody buys 'em.

1287
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,257
The toy manufacturers
are gonna like that.

1288
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:21,845
So they have to lay off a lot of
their employees... union employees.

1289
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:25,932
Now you got the C.I.O. and
the A.F. Of L. against you,

1290
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:28,018
and they're gonna
adore you for it.

1291
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,313
And they're gonna say it
with votes.

1292
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,858
Oh, and the department stores
are gonna love you, too.

1293
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:38,403
And the Christmas card makers.
And the candy companies.

1294
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:43,783
Oh, Henry, you're gonna be
an awful popular fella.

1295
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,535
And what about
the Salvation Army?

1296
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:50,123
Why, they've got a Santy Claus on
every corner, and they take in a fortune.

1297
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,501
But you go ahead, Henry,
you do it your way.

1298
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:58,462
You go on back in there and tell 'em
that you rule there's no Santy Claus.

1299
01:17:58,497 --> 01:18:00,216
Go on.

1300
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,427
But if you do, remember this.

1301
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,512
You can count on getting
just two votes...

1302
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:07,845
your own and that district
attorney's out there.

1303
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:12,387
The district attorney's a Republican.

1304
01:18:13,306 --> 01:18:14,806
All rise!

1305
01:18:31,982 --> 01:18:33,500
Before making a ruling,

1306
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:37,420
this court has consulted
the highest authority available.

1307
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,843
The question of Santa Claus seems
to be largely a matter of opinion.

1308
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:46,721
Many people firmly
believe in him.

1309
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:48,765
Others do not.

1310
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,935
The tradition of American justice

1311
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:56,749
demands a broad and unprejudiced view
of such a controversial matter.

1312
01:18:56,784 --> 01:19:01,152
This court, therefore,
intends to keep an open mind.

1313
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:05,824
- We shall hear evidence on either side.
- He's crazy, too.

1314
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:09,803
Your Honor, the burden of proof
for this ridiculous contention

1315
01:19:09,838 --> 01:19:11,079
clearly rests with my opponent.

1316
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,896
Can he produce any evidence
to support his views?

1317
01:19:13,931 --> 01:19:15,750
If Your Honor please, I can.

1318
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:19,445
- Will Thomas Mara please take the stand?
- Who, me?

1319
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,280
Thomas Mara Junior.

1320
01:19:32,906 --> 01:19:34,227
Hello, Daddy.

1321
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,231
Here you are, Tommy.

1322
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:46,473
Tommy, you know the difference between telling
the truth and telling a lie, don't you?

1323
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:52,716
Gosh, everybody knows you shouldn't
tell a lie, especially in court.

1324
01:19:53,051 --> 01:19:54,706
Proceed, Mr. Gailey.

1325
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,418
- Do you believe in Santa Claus, Tommy?
- Sure, I do.

1326
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:03,017
He gave me a brand-new
Flexible Flyer sled last year.

1327
01:20:03,052 --> 01:20:06,217
- And this year...
- And, uh, what does he look like?

1328
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,303
There he is, sitting there!

1329
01:20:08,787 --> 01:20:10,188
Your Honor, I protest!

1330
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,558
Overruled.

1331
01:20:15,803 --> 01:20:19,689
Tell me, Tommy, why are you so
sure there's a Santa Claus?

1332
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,650
Because my daddy told me so.

1333
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,165
Didn't you, Daddy?

1334
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:30,576
And you believe your daddy, don't you,
Tommy? He's a very honest man.

1335
01:20:30,611 --> 01:20:34,621
'Course he is. My daddy wouldn't
tell me anything that wasn't so.

1336
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:36,634
Would you, Daddy?

1337
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,710
Thank you, Tommy.

1338
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:46,090
Good-bye, Daddy.

1339
01:20:47,236 --> 01:20:48,259
Your Honor...

1340
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:52,182
Don't forget... a real,
official football helmet.

1341
01:20:52,217 --> 01:20:54,140
Don't worry, Tommy, you'll get it.

1342
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:16,362
Your Honor, the State of New York
concedes the existence of Santa Claus.

1343
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:27,752
But in so conceding, we ask that Mr. Gailey
cease presenting personal opinion as evidence.

1344
01:21:27,787 --> 01:21:30,809
The state could bring in hundreds
of witnesses with opposite opinions.

1345
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:34,514
But it's our desire to shorten
this hearing rather than prolong it.

1346
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:38,893
I, therefore, request that Mr. Gailey
now submit authoritative proof

1347
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:42,605
that Mr. Kringle is the one
and only Santa Claus.

1348
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:48,353
Your point's well-taken, Mr. Mara.
I'm afraid we must agree.

1349
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:57,370
Mr. Gailey, are you prepared to show
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus

1350
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:00,516
on the basis of competent authority?

1351
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,878
Not at this time, Your Honor. I ask
for an adjournment until tomorrow.

1352
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:09,317
The court stands adjourned
till tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.

1353
01:22:14,965 --> 01:22:17,181
Well, I... I guess that's that.

1354
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,101
There's a way, Alfred.
There's got to be.

1355
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,942
Well, it's hard to explain.

1356
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:30,778
You see, they're having, well,
sort of a trial about him.

1357
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,614
You mean like for a murder?

1358
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,949
Oh, no, no. It isn't
that kind of a trial.

1359
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,619
It’s just because
he says he's Santa Claus.

1360
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,538
But I've got a feeling
he is Santa Claus, Mother.

1361
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:43,291
Some people don't believe that.
That's why they're having this...

1362
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,419
But he's so kind and nice and jolly.

1363
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:50,465
He's not like anyone else,
he must be Santa.

1364
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:53,051
I think perhaps
you're right, Susie.

1365
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:56,554
Is Mr. Kringle sad now, Mother?

1366
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,142
I'm afraid he is.
I'm sure he misses you and...

1367
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,354
Then I'm going to write him a letter
right now and cheer him up.

1368
01:24:17,102 --> 01:24:19,595
- Hey, Lou! Come here.
- Yeah.

1369
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,889
Hey, here's a new one.

1370
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:25,351
I seen 'em write to Santa Claus, North Pole,
South Pole and every other place.

1371
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:28,438
Here's a kid writes, "Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse."

1372
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,481
- Can you beat that?
- The kid's right.

1373
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,483
They got him on trial down there.

1374
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:36,154
He claims that he's Santy Claus,
and the D.A. Claims that he's nuts.

1375
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:39,031
Here, read it for yourself,
right on the front page.

1376
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:48,082
Hey, uh... hey, Lou, how many Santy Claus
letters we got down at the dead letter office?

1377
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:51,210
I don't know. There must be
about 50,000 of 'em.

1378
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:55,715
Bags and bags all over the joint,
and there's more comin' in every day.

1379
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:59,302
- Yeah. Hey, uh... hey, Lou.
- Yeah.

1380
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:02,138
Uh, it'd be kind of nice to get rid of 'em,
wouldn't it, huh?

1381
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,557
Yeah, but...

1382
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,934
Hey, that's a wonderful idea, Al.

1383
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:10,229
I mean, after all, why should we
be bothered with all that stuff, huh?

1384
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,815
Why don't you get a couple of trucks
up here... big ones... right away?

1385
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,817
Load 'em with all
that Santa Claus mail

1386
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,737
and deliver it to Mr. Kringle
down at the courthouse.

1387
01:25:18,063 --> 01:25:19,921
Let somebody else worry about it, huh?

1388
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:20,606
<i>Hey, Frank!</i>

1389
01:25:20,641 --> 01:25:21,365
Hey!

1390
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,202
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way...

1391
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:40,384
- Hello, Kris.
- Fred.

1392
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:45,181
Kris, I'm afraid I've got
bad news for you.

1393
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:48,267
I've tried every way
to get some competent authority.

1394
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:51,312
I've wired the governor, the mayor.
I even wired...

1395
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:55,399
This is worth more to me than all
the governors and mayors in the world.

1396
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,527
It's all over, George,
look at him.

1397
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:00,154
He hasn't got a thing.

1398
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:17,797
And furthermore,

1399
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:21,008
the defense has yet to offer
one concrete piece of evidence

1400
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:23,100
to substantiate
this preposterous claim.

1401
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:27,098
Not one competent authoritative proof
that this man is Santa Claus.

1402
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,894
In view of these facts, and especially
since today is Christmas Eve...

1403
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,355
we're naturally all anxious
to get to our homes...

1404
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,408
I ask that you sign the commitment
papers without further delay.

1405
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:41,737
Mr. Gailey, have you
anything further to offer?

1406
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,115
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

1407
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,158
I'd like to submit the
following facts in evidence.

1408
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:48,160
It concerns the Post
Office Department,

1409
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:51,664
an official agency
of the United States government.

1410
01:26:52,451 --> 01:26:55,376
The Post Office Department was created
by the Second Continental Congress

1411
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,212
on July 26, 1776.

1412
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,464
The first postmaster general
was Benjamin Franklin.

1413
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:04,927
The Post Office Department is one of
the largest business concerns in the world.

1414
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:08,133
Last year, under Robert Hannegan,
it did a gross business

1415
01:27:08,168 --> 01:27:10,515
of one billion one hundred and
twelve million, eight hundred

1416
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:12,977
and seventy-seven thousand, one
hundred and seventy-four dollars.

1417
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:16,455
Your Honor, I'm sure
we're all gratified to know

1418
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,681
the Post Office Department
is doing so nicely,

1419
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:20,770
but it hardly has
any bearing on this case.

1420
01:27:20,805 --> 01:27:23,738
It has a great deal, Your Honor,
if I may be allowed to proceed.

1421
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,990
By all means, Mr. Gailey.

1422
01:27:28,515 --> 01:27:30,828
Your Honor, the figures
I have just quoted

1423
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:34,123
indicate an efficiently run
organization.

1424
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:38,085
Furthermore, the United States postal laws
and regulations make it a criminal offense

1425
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,965
to willfully misdirect mail or intentionally
deliver it to the wrong party.

1426
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,427
Consequently, the department
uses every possible precaution.

1427
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:49,555
Your Honor, The State of New York
is second to none

1428
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,807
in its admiration of
the Post Office Department.

1429
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,060
It is efficient,
authoritative and prosperous.

1430
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:56,729
We are very happy to concede
Mr. Gailey's claims.

1431
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:59,720
- Um, for the record, Mr. Mara?
- For the record.

1432
01:27:59,755 --> 01:28:01,487
Anything to get on with this case.

1433
01:28:01,522 --> 01:28:04,281
Then, Your Honor, I want to
introduce these pieces of evidence.

1434
01:28:04,316 --> 01:28:05,551
I'll take them, please.

1435
01:28:05,552 --> 01:28:07,108
<i>I have here three letters.</i>

1436
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:11,410
<i>They're addressed, simply, "Santa Claus."
No other address whatsoever.</i>

1437
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:14,246
Yet these letters have just now
been delivered to Mr. Kringle

1438
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,083
by bona fide employees
of the Post Office.

1439
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,794
I offer them as positive
proof that a competent...

1440
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,922
Uh, three letters, Your Honor,
are hardly positive proof.

1441
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:26,592
I understand the Post Office receives
thousands of these letters every year.

1442
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:29,971
I have further exhibits, Your Honor,
but I hesitate to produce them.

1443
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:32,390
I'm sure we'll be very
happy to see them.

1444
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,477
Yes. Yes, produce them, Mr. Gailey.
Put them here on my desk.

1445
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:40,439
- But, Your Honor...
- Put them here on the desk.

1446
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,234
- Put them...
- Yes, Your Honor.

1447
01:29:12,051 --> 01:29:13,097
Your Honor!

1448
01:29:15,615 --> 01:29:16,767
Your Honor!

1449
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:32,033
Your Honor, every one of these letters
is addressed to Santa Claus.

1450
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,201
The Post Office has delivered them.

1451
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,872
Therefore, the Post Office Department,
a branch of the federal government,

1452
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:40,249
recognizes this man, Kris Kringle,

1453
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,002
to be the one and only Santa Claus.

1454
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:55,389
Uh, since the United States government
declares this man to be Santa Claus,

1455
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,183
this court will not dispute it.

1456
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,853
Case dismissed.

1457
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:12,239
I've gotta get that football helmet.

1458
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:22,500
Thank you so much, Your Honor,
and a very merry Christmas to you.

1459
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,336
Thank you, Mr. Kringle,
and the same to you.

1460
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,296
Thank you.

1461
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,143
- Kris.
- I had to wait to tell you.

1462
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:45,272
- I got your note. It made me very happy.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

1463
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:48,442
We're having a big Christmas party
at the Brooks' Home tomorrow morning.

1464
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:51,445
Breakfast, a beautiful tree and...

1465
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:53,114
I'd like to have you and Susan.

1466
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,660
Oh, thank you. I can't think of anyone
I'd rather spend Christmas with.

1467
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:00,788
Would you... Would you like
to come to dinner tonight?

1468
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:04,041
Tonight? Oh, I can't.
It's Christmas Eve.

1469
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,710
- Oh, I forgot.
- Good-bye.

1470
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,026
- Come in! Merry Christmas.
- Jingle bells!

1471
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:37,283
Oh! My dear Sir. You know
my assistant Alfred, Mr. Macy.

1472
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:39,410
- Merry Christmas, Alfred.
- Mr. Macy.

1473
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,370
Mr. Shellhammer, there's something
here I'd like to show you.

1474
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,789
- Hello, Alfred.
- Mr. Macy!

1475
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:46,542
There's something down here
that might interest you.

1476
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,755
Oh, excuse me.

1477
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:03,517
Kris, all I can say is the State Supreme Court
declared you to be Santa Claus,

1478
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:06,770
and, personally and professionally,
I agree with them.

1479
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,693
But there are lots of presents
there for you, Darling.

1480
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,695
Not the one I wanted.

1481
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,098
Not the one Mr. Kringle
was going to get for me.

1482
01:32:17,124 --> 01:32:20,659
- What was that?
- It doesn't matter. I didn't get it.

1483
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:25,247
I knew it wouldn't be here, but I thought
there'd be a letter or something telling me.

1484
01:32:26,032 --> 01:32:28,292
I don't suppose you even
want to talk to me.

1485
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:31,378
- Something about a present.
- Yes, I know.

1486
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,590
I'm sorry, Susie.
I tried my best, but... but...

1487
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:37,676
You couldn't get it because you're not
Santa Claus, that's why.

1488
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:41,430
You're just a nice old man with
whiskers, like my mother said,

1489
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,815
and I shouldn't have believed you.

1490
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,896
I was wrong when I told you that, Susie.

1491
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,399
You must believe in Mr. Kringle
and keep right on doing it.

1492
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:55,986
- You must have faith in him.
- But he didn't get me the...

1493
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:58,239
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.

1494
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:02,701
Faith is believing in things when
common sense tells you not to.

1495
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,495
Huh?

1496
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:08,813
I mean, just because things don't turn
out the way you want them to the first time,

1497
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:11,210
you've still got to
believe in people.

1498
01:33:12,094 --> 01:33:13,254
I found that out.

1499
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:18,050
You mean it's like, "If at first
you don't succeed, try, try again."

1500
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:21,053
- Yes.
- I thought so.

1501
01:33:25,231 --> 01:33:27,766
- May I drive you home?
- Thank you.

1502
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:30,771
Now, if you’ll go this way, you'll miss
a lot of traffic. I've written it all down.

1503
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,982
See, you go along Maplewood
until you come to Ashley.

1504
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:36,944
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.

1505
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,488
Thanks, Kris, that'll be fine, Merry Christmas.

1506
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:43,730
Merry Christmas to you...
and to you, my Dear, and many of them.

1507
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:45,452
- Good-bye, Kris.
- Good-bye, my dear.

1508
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:48,122
- Good-bye and the best of all luck.
- Good-bye, Miss Walker.

1509
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,791
- Good-bye, Alfred.
- Good-bye, Susie.

1510
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:57,548
This must be the turn here.

1511
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,301
That's right... Ashley.

1512
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:02,553
Now you go straight
for four blocks.

1513
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:07,224
I believe. I believe.

1514
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,188
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!

1515
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,232
Stop! Stop!

1516
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,820
Susie! Susie!

1517
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,073
Susie!

1518
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:27,286
- Susie, where are you going?
- What is she doing?

1519
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,580
- Susie!
- Susie!

1520
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,917
- Susie! Susie! Susie!
- Susie, where are you?

1521
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,961
- I'm upstairs!
- Come right down.

1522
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:39,590
You shouldn't run around in other people's
houses. You know better than that.

1523
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:43,387
But this is my house, Mommy...
the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.

1524
01:34:43,422 --> 01:34:45,220
- Now, Susie.
- It is, it is! I know it is!

1525
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:49,350
My room upstairs is just like I knew
it would be. Oh, you were right, Mommy.

1526
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:53,479
Mommy told me if things don't turn out
just the way you want them to the first time,

1527
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:57,524
you've still got to believe, and I kept
believing, and you were right, Mommy!

1528
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,902
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!

1529
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:03,155
Where are you going?
To see if there’s a swing!

1530
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:06,575
There is one!
There is one!

1531
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:13,665
You told her that?

1532
01:35:23,034 --> 01:35:25,135
The sign outside said it's for sale.

1533
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:28,263
We can't let her down.

1534
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,683
I never really doubted you.

1535
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:35,062
It was just my silly common sense.

1536
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:37,398
It even makes sense
to believe in me now.

1537
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,483
I must be a pretty good lawyer.

1538
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:42,986
I take a little old man and legally prove
to the world that he's Santa Claus.

1539
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:44,988
Now, you know that...

1540
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:57,751
Oh, no! It can't be!

1541
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:01,338
It must have been left here
by the people that moved out.

1542
01:36:01,423 --> 01:36:03,882
Maybe.

1543
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:08,878
And maybe I didn't do such
a wonderful thing after all.
