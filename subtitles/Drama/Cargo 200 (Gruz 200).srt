1
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:41,535
Based on true events

2
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:48,936
Artem, you tell mom that I’ll come to see her…

3
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:51,536
in about two weeks.

4
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:56,736
It’s… I’m just tied up now.

5
00:00:58,337 --> 00:00:59,137
OK.

6
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,537
I am to go to Leningrad anyway.

7
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,737
Will have to attend to some things before lectures begin.

8
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:07,137
You look drowsy, huh?

9
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:09,137
Some troubles in the university?

10
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:11,537
No. Nothing’s happening there.

11
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,137
The usual squabble.

12
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,338
Ah, whatever...
So, how are things at home?

13
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:18,537
All in good health?
Ah, thank God, thank God…

14
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:20,337
I see you believe in God now?

15
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:27,138
Oh look, there is your niece with her fiancé.

16
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,938
Hey listen, how’s your Slavka doing?

17
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,738
Haven’t seen him for long time.

18
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:36,138
Last time I came to see you,
he just left for some tourist camp.

19
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,338
Actually, it is Slavka who troubles me now.

20
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:41,539
You know, Misha, kids are different now,
I just don’t understand him.

21
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:45,739
We did it all ourselves, by the sweat of our brows,
while he is just having it handed on a plate.

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,139
Everything is for him.

23
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:49,739
Yet he doesn’t respect us.

24
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:52,539
Despises even.

25
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:57,340
I forced him in the university,
to save from ending up in Afghan.

26
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,339
And is he studying?
This is how he’s studying!

27
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,140
Parties all day long.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,540
Do you know this word?
Some underground concerts.

29
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:08,339
This damned rock…
Every day I expect…

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,939
a call from militia.

31
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,740
Here, look.

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,940
The recent photo of him.

33
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,341
Look at him…

34
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,541
All my life I’ve been doing what’s right…

35
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,340
and it turns out nobody needs it now.

36
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,741
And nobody needs me.
Though, I’m not that old.

37
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,341
I feel something’s gone forever…
and what is coming I don’t understand.

38
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:44,141
After Andropov died…

39
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,941
everyone started to fidget.

40
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:50,342
In our department,
In the department of scientific communism.

41
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:53,942
In the department of history.
Students too, obviously.

42
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,742
Hello, uncle Artem.
Oh, hi Lisa.

43
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,142
Hello.
Haven’t seen you for ages.

44
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:01,542
The whole two months passed.

45
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,742
Yes.  Will you stay for long?

46
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:06,942
Oh no, I’ll go soon.
Want to visit your grandma.

47
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,542
How is my brother Slavik?

48
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,542
Partying around.

49
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,543
Cool!

50
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:20,143
This is Valery, my friend.

51
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:21,743
Valery Buadze.

52
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:24,743
Half Georgian,
but have never been to Georgia.

53
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,543
Kazakov Artem Nikolaevich, from Leningrad.

54
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:31,743
Okay then, we’ll have some tea
in the kitchen…

55
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:34,343
You know, I have to get up early,
and I still need to pack.

56
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:41,344
Is he really a fiancé?
Oh come on, I was kidding.

57
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:44,144
But I think she likes him.

58
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,544
You know, he is a nice chap.

59
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:48,544
Not some dummy, I think.

60
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:51,344
Every year he enlists to work somewhere in the North…

61
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,544
and returns with good money.

62
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,745
Look, I am a colonel, right?

63
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:01,145
The conscription officer. And he earns
three times as much as I do.

64
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,945
Just a punk, yet owns a car.

65
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,345
And not the kind you have.

66
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,945
So it’s not that simple, Artem.

67
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,545
He is not a student then?
Nope.

68
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:16,946
And why is he not in the army?
Well, he is not local, actually.

69
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,346
He is staying at some old woman’s house.

70
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,145
Says, that’s his grandmother…

71
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,746
So, I’m helping him here and there.

72
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:26,946
You know what’s happening in Afghan now, don’t you?

73
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:33,346
During this time to our shithole alone…

74
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:37,547
26 caskets arrived.
Artem, 26!

75
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,947
Cargo 200 they call them.

76
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,147
And look what’s going on throughout the country!

77
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,347
You be careful, Mikhail…

78
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,747
Who is he, this uncle of yours?

79
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:03,347
Head of Scientific Atheism Department
in the Leningrad University.

80
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,748
He helped me to get in last year.

81
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,147
So, will we go to disco then?

82
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:12,948
I told you I wanted to have a good sleep.
I need to pack too…

83
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:16,148
You said yourself, the earlier we leave,
the sooner we are there.

84
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,948
Look, we’ll just come round.

85
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,949
Valera, no!
Well, whatever.

86
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,349
You’d better have a good sleep too, you are to drive.

87
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,349
It is a long way, and you say the road is bad.

88
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,549
Don’t you worry for me.
I’ve seen worse roads.

89
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:45,550
Thank you for helping Lisa.

90
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,350
Oh, come on, Lisa is a smart girl,
she could enter all by herself.

91
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,150
Where is it she is going to bright and early?

92
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:57,550
To Yara, her friend, a classmate,
has a dacha there.

93
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,951
So, they thought they’d go
to swim, to mushroom.

94
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,951
It’s all right, they are nice kids.
They go just for a couple of days.

95
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,151
I can pick her up on my
way back to Leningrad.

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,550
Come on, she is not some mollycoddle.
She can take a bus.

97
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:13,151
All right then, I’ll call you
when I’m coming back from mom’s.

98
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:18,551
Thanks for the food,
it is such a problem here now.

99
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,952
Is there any left for mom?
Yeah, I’ve got two bags full.

100
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,952
I’ll be off then.

101
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,159
Damn.

102
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,359
Dammit!

103
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,161
Hi.

104
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,362
Where is Lisa?
Lisa? She is a…

105
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:08,761
She thought she’d go to bed early.
We leave tomorrow early morning.

106
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:11,161
Hey, don’t you recognize me?

107
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,361
It’s me, Angelika, Lisa’s friend.

108
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:17,762
It’s my dacha we are going to tomorrow.
Of course I recognized you.

109
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:21,362
Wanna dance?
Sure, just wait a sec.

110
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:23,162
I’ll be back.
OK.

111
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:24,162
Stay here.

112
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:35,763
Hi.

113
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:54,567
Good evening.
Excuse me, are you the boss here?

114
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,366
Excuse me for barging in.

115
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:03,567
I was just going to Leninsk, and my engine died.

116
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,767
I tried to hitch, but no one stopped.

117
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:09,967
And I saw your house.
And thought… Maybe here is someone who knows about engines?

118
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,367
Thank you.

119
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:31,768
Hello.
Are you the boss here?

120
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:42,768
Good rifle. Simpson.

121
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,768
I am a hunter myself, I have granddad’s Simpson.

122
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,768
Vodka?
What?

123
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,769
You see, I am going to Leninsk…

124
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,369
and my engine died on me.

125
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:58,569
No one stopped, so I thought…
maybe you could help me?

126
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,569
I saw your lights from the road.

127
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,570
Tonya!
Sit down.

128
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:04,969
Thank you.

129
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:07,569
Tonya!

130
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,770
Hello.

131
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,770
Where is Sunka?
He was in the bathhouse.

132
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,770
Call him.
And get us something to eat.

133
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,770
How long do I have to wait!

134
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,170
Where are you from?
From Leningrad.

135
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,970
I am going to my mother, to Leninsk.

136
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:33,571
What’s your name?
Kazakov Artem Nikolaevich.

137
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,371
We don’t use patronymics here.
I am Alexey.

138
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,771
You wait, maybe we’ll think up something.

139
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,171
Are you an engineer?

140
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:52,971
No, I am professor
of scientific atheism in the university.

141
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,171
Sunka!

142
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,572
Eh?
Come, the master is calling.

143
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:03,772
Coming.

144
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,374
What comes first, the matter or the conscience?

145
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,773
Marxist-Lenin philosophy denies
the idea of God,

146
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:34,774
as the idea based on the impossibility
of cognizing the world that surrounds a human…

147
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:38,773
No, you scientist just tell me,
does God exist or does he not?

148
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,374
This is exactly what I am trying to explain you.

149
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:45,374
You called me, master?
Go bring us some from the bathhouse…

150
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,574
or we won’t be able to sort it
out with the professor here.

151
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:50,374
All right, master.

152
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:55,174
OK then, come on, professor.
Master asked this… from bath…

153
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:59,575
A buyer?
No, this… professor…

154
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,375
You hear, Ton’? The scientist professor
says here God does not exist.

155
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:16,375
So, no God then?
No.

156
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,176
What is it?
Mushroom soup.

157
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:24,175
Well then, what does exist?

158
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:27,976
There is a dynamic matter that
is given to us in the form of sensations.

159
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,576
And soul? Is there a soul?

160
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:32,976
No, Alexey, there is no soul either.

161
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,176
So, what about my car?

162
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:40,976
Here.

163
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:01,977
So, Artem, no God then?
No soul.

164
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:05,178
There is conscience and matter.

165
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,178
Then where this all comes from?

166
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,578
Conscience, for instance?
Alexey, this is just an idle talk.

167
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:16,578
There is the Darwinian theory,
which is taught at school.

168
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:22,013
You want me to believe that a monkey
grabbed a stick and then evolved to…

169
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,178
abstract thinking?

170
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,179
Let’s drink.
No, I can’t, thank you.

171
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,578
I need to go to Leninsk.
How?

172
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,979
OK, I’ll go.
Wait.

173
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,779
You came, so don’t offend the hosts now.

174
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:46,180
We opened our soul to you,
though you don’t have one.

175
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,780
Good, this is our way, professor.

176
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,180
You eat your soup, eat.
Tonka makes good soups.

177
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,380
Have cucumbers too, homemade.

178
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,781
Sun’, when you’re finished,
get the car keys from the professor.

179
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,181
Check what’s wrong there.

180
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,180
So, Artem, nothing’s there?

181
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,381
You see, Alexey, I am an agnostic.

182
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:26,581
I believe in the cognizability of world,
and I don’t believe in the supernatural.

183
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:34,781
So, will you repair it?

184
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:40,582
It’s… Plug needs cleaning…

185
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:42,581
and carburetor.

186
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:45,982
Give me a cloth.

187
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:49,382
Cloth.

188
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,984
Will it take long?
Half an hour takes...

189
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:29,384
Are you Chinese?
No, I am Vietnamese.

190
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:33,784
And why do they call you Sunka?

191
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:37,584
I Suan-Van-Hey.

192
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,984
It’s in Russian become…

193
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:43,784
Sunka.

194
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:48,385
I was working in big plant.

195
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:50,785
It’s in Leninsk.

196
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:54,586
Then they took me here.

197
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,386
To pour vodka, and work in garden.

198
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:03,785
I like here.
I love garden.

199
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:10,986
I’ll go to the house.
It’s cold here.

200
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:13,186
Here.

201
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:28,787
So, you are a communist.
Yes, I am a member of Communist Party.

202
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:30,187
There is nothing to be proud of!

203
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:33,187
All the evil comes from you, the communists.

204
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:36,587
You want to replace God with your party
and your Lenin.

205
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,787
- Well...
- This is what you get!

206
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:42,988
There’s no God – so everything goes, you remember?

207
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,988
You can kill millions.

208
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,388
And I, when I was a kid…

209
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,188
I killed a guy accidentally, in a fight.

210
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:56,988
And I turned myself in,
because I knew I was guilty.

211
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:59,588
Because they could blame the others.

212
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:01,988
10 years in high security was my sentence.

213
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,388
And I could say nothing.

214
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,189
But my conscience didn’t let me.

215
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,189
God didn’t let me get away with it.

216
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,589
And you want to abolish God.

217
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,589
And invented a science for that.

218
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:18,789
Do you know, Alexey,
that moral standards are…

219
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:22,829
governed by material and
economic relations.

220
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:26,789
Such manifestations, as morality
or sense of duty, conscience…

221
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:32,390
existed even in primitive society,
long before Christianity.

222
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:37,590
Semi-instinctive feeling
caused by the obligation to keep the taboo.

223
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,190
And by the way, the Ten Commandments
that appear in the Old Testament…

224
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,990
originated and were kept long
before they were written down.

225
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,990
That’s right!

226
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,390
God gave us the commandments.

227
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,790
They always were there,
they just were written down later on.

228
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,791
And don’t you try to scare me with
your intelligent words.

229
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:57,991
Taboo!

230
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,791
We read books too.

231
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,392
Now this is the tune,
not some crap they have in the club.

232
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:28,792
That’s it.

233
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:30,592
Done.

234
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:35,792
Valera, it’s late now.
I know a place…

235
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,392
not far from here
where we can get nice booze.

236
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:40,592
Way better than in a shop.

237
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:43,192
Valera, you’ve had enough.
We have to rise early.

238
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,393
It’s very close.

239
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,793
I’ve got a cool car,
we’ll be there in no time.

240
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:53,594
I’ll bring you then right to your door.
Nice and fast.

241
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:02,594
The City of the Sun is
the most shining example of utopia.

242
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:05,393
Campanella is by no means was the first
one to take this path.

243
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:10,994
This is a dream generated
by the class-consciousness, by the way.

244
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:13,195
So your consciousness is not the class one, huh?

245
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:15,594
Look at the sausage you gorge yourself on.

246
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:17,194
I’ve even never seen one like this.

247
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:21,994
You talk crap. You corrupt kids’
souls to gorge yourself on this sausage.

248
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:25,795
You must have reached communism
now according to your party plans.

249
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:29,195
You don’t need the City of the Sun,
but I do!

250
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,195
And I will build it.

251
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:34,196
But not throughout this fucking
Union of yours,

252
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:36,995
but here, on this land.
Everything will be different here.

253
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:38,795
Tonka here will make me kids.

254
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:42,595
People will come, and no longer
will we depend on you, you vultures…

255
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,396
Ready, master.

256
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:51,796
Engine… It’s working.

257
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:58,396
but not go to Leninsk.

258
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:01,396
May not get there.

259
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:04,396
I won’t get there now anyway.
Carburetor need cleaning.

260
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:08,997
Repair needed.
Thank you, Suan-Van-Hey.

261
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,597
Thank you!

262
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:33,597
You said it was close.
This is it, we are here.

263
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:00,799
You stay here, I’ll be back.

264
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
Hello, boss!
Got booze?

265
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Nice life you got here!
Business is growing, huh?

266
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Tell Sunka to bring a good bottle.

267
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,400
I just need some more.

268
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,400
Tonya!

269
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,401
Tell Sunka to bring a bottle.

270
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:37,800
A buyer.

271
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,001
So, how is this city of the sun of yours?
Prospering, huh?

272
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,201
You, townie scumbag!

273
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,201
Don’t you sully my sacred idea!

274
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,201
Come on, man, come on, Alexey…
I’m just kidding.

275
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:21,803
Oh, mommy!

276
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:30,203
Dough is everything, dudes.

277
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:35,603
If you have dough, you have…

278
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,404
You’ve had enough.

279
00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:45,204
Aunty Tonya, bring us some cukes.
Nice cukes you have.

280
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:48,804
And you, Sunka, bring another one,
but pure this time.

281
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:51,604
Aren’t we tough pals, huh?

282
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:53,204
I pay double.

283
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:32,205
I’ve been living with Nenets, at the White Sea.

284
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:36,806
Fishing for salmon.
They all drink pure spirit there.

285
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:41,806
Kids do too.
Do you know how they drink spirit there?

286
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:58,007
Vika! Join us.
Vale…

287
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,807
Sunka, give her a glass.
Valera, let’s go.

288
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,607
Yeah, soon, let me just finish.

289
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:06,207
Look, how they drink spirit.

290
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:21,008
In there… if you don’t have spirit…
you're dead.

291
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,608
You’ll freeze to death.

292
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,408
Where will he drive now?

293
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:28,608
Come here.

294
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:34,208
And Nenets wear kukhlyankas and trubastas…

295
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:36,408
and hide spirit in trubastas.

296
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,809
I have kukhlyanka too.

297
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,009
Pull him off.

298
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,409
It’s…

299
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:57,010
Can’t pull alone.

300
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,610
Very big.

301
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,010
My dad is the head of district party committee.

302
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,611
Close the hatch.

303
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:25,411
- Hot.
- Did you come with this one?

304
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,611
How?
He’s got a car.

305
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:31,611
Do you drive?

306
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,611
Stop weeping, I don’t like it.

307
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:41,011
Tonya!

308
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:44,412
Hide behind the stove, move.
Be silent!

309
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:58,412
Where’s she?
Gone.

310
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,213
Don’t lie to me, Tonya.

311
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:04,413
You won’t get her anyway.

312
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:08,213
You won’t let me?

313
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,413
This how your city of the sun will look like?

314
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:14,413
There are no wives in the city of the sun, all are equal.

315
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:16,013
And kids are common…

316
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:39,014
Have you seen here anyone?
Whom?

317
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:44,215
Sloshed again! No, haven’t seen.

318
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:48,614
Let’s go.

319
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:11,216
Get out.

320
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,016
Now go outside,
there is a bathhouse to the left.

321
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:21,616
Thirty meters from the bathhouse is a shed.

322
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:23,417
Run to the shed, the door’s open.

323
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:26,017
There’s a cow. Don’t be afraid of her, she is docile.

324
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,617
Close the door and hide in the far corner.

325
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:31,217
There’s hay. Bury yourself in the hay, and be silent…
Tonya!

326
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:34,617
I’ll come to you, when everyone’s asleep.

327
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:38,817
I have to go home!
Stop weeping.

328
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,817
She has to! You think first with whom and when.

329
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,217
Go!
Tonya!

330
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:02,421
It’s… master… it’s…
spirit’s running low.

331
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,621
Need… bring some more.

332
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,621
Did you lock the bathhouse?

333
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:12,821
I’ll sleep in the shed.

334
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:14,421
First bring the firewood!

335
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,622
Give me the bath key, I’ll put the shotgun there.

336
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,423
Put the master to bed. He’s wasted.

337
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:50,023
Heavy...

338
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:01,024
Hey you!
Where are you?

339
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:04,024
Who’s here?
Antonina. Move. Quickly.

340
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:05,024
Follow me.

341
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,424
It’s warmer here.

342
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,625
Don’t break anything here,
I’ll let you out in the morning.

343
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,625
Aunty, aunty!

344
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,825
Please, aunty!

345
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:45,425
I have to go home.

346
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:38,628
Sunka!

347
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:45,029
Open the bath.
Eh? In a sec.

348
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:12,229
My dad is the head of district party committee.

349
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:42,230
- Please, no!
Chief, it’s… don’t touch girl.

350
00:35:58,431 --> 00:35:59,831
Must not… chief.

351
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,233
Take it off.

352
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:39,400
Please, I am a virgin.

353
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:41,833
On your fours.

354
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:52,234
My fiancé is a paratrooper, in Afghanistan.
He’s very tough.

355
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:53,634
Do you know ‘Cascade’?

356
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:55,434
Lift it up.

357
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,638
Artem?

358
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:24,438
Let me sleep on your sofa,
my car broke down.

359
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,238
Sure, come in.

360
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,038
Hey, you’re dead drunk.

361
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:33,838
Go to the balcony.

362
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,838
Sleep there on the sofa.

363
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,639
My wife is working night shift.

364
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,639
Take the blanket.

365
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,439
How did you drive here that drunk?

366
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,839
Please?

367
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,839
I left my shoes there.

368
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:26,046
Militia?

369
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,846
Farmyard on the left from Kalyaevo.

370
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:32,046
There’s a body in the bathhouse.

371
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:46,247
Please! I am bleeding.

372
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:31,049
Hi!

373
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,449
Hello, uncle Artem.

374
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,250
Something’s wrong?

375
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,650
Her boyfriend didn’t show up.

376
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,451
Why aren’t you in the office?

377
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,050
Sunday.

378
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,251
Go, have a breakfast.
Katya served there something.

379
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,253
I came back from the night shift,

380
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:09,051
and the kids who were there by six,
already left.

381
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:13,251
Lisa is crying.
Her boyfriend, you know…

382
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,651
It’s just so embarrassing.

383
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:19,652
And then Algelika, her friend,
is missing.

384
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:22,451
Her father called at night.
The head of district party committee.

385
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:24,651
He says: the girl went to the disco
and didn’t come back home.

386
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:30,052
So?
No, nothing.

387
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:36,652
They say there’s been a murder in Kalyaevo.

388
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,653
OK then, I’ll be going.

389
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:49,453
What’s the problem with your car?
Ah… plugs.

390
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:52,053
I’ll get them on my way.
I know a place.

391
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,862
Mom! Mom!

392
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:24,062
Sit down.

393
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:29,062
My dad is the head of district party committee.

394
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:35,863
He will come after you,
and they will execute you.

395
00:47:36,263 --> 00:47:37,863
And there’ll be the demob in September.

396
00:47:38,463 --> 00:47:40,663
My fiancé, senior sergeant…

397
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:44,663
Gorbunov will come back from Afghanistan…

398
00:47:44,703 --> 00:47:46,663
and he will avenge me.

399
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,263
He loves me and will do everything for me.

400
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:56,264
Please, I need to go to the bathroom.

401
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:07,264
Mom, every time I leave…

402
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:12,065
you do it again.
Ah, my Zhurik is back!

403
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:42,666
Drink.
What’s that?

404
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:45,266
I won’t.
Drink.

405
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,067
Sleep.

406
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:08,667
Please…

407
00:49:19,868 --> 00:49:21,868
Tema, you’d better eat something.

408
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:25,868
You ate nothing for days.

409
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:28,468
Mom, thanks, later.

410
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:15,070
Hello, speak.
Katya! It’s Artem.

411
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,670
Hello, Artem.
Is Misha there?

412
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,471
He is still in the office.
What’s taking him so long?

413
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:25,271
There’re some problems again.
Cargo 200 is arriving.

414
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:26,664
Mom!

415
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:29,271
Artem, I have to go now.
Call Misha.

416
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:36,915
When is this cargo arriving?

417
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,471
They will keep us informed,
comrade colonel.

418
00:50:39,511 --> 00:50:42,671
It is only known
that IL-76 is to land on the Leninsk airfield.

419
00:50:42,712 --> 00:50:44,871
Senior sergeant Gorbunov is our guy, from Volok.

420
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:49,872
Senior sergeant Gorbunov…

421
00:50:52,672 --> 00:50:56,072
And do you know, mayor Duev…

422
00:50:56,272 --> 00:50:59,672
that senior sergeant Gorbunov
is Kolya Gorbunov?

423
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:03,272
My Lisa’s classmate.

424
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:06,873
I've known him since he was a kid.

425
00:51:09,073 --> 00:51:10,273
Kolya was killed.

426
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:15,473
Angelika, the daughter of this asshole
Naboev, Kolya’s fiancée

427
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:16,273
is missing.

428
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:19,873
My daughter’s boyfriend is missing.

429
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:23,073
What the hell is going on, tell me?

430
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,673
Mikhail Nikolaevich, there is your
brother on the line, from Leninsk.

431
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:29,074
Put him through.

432
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:37,874
Hello, Mikhail.
Yeah, Artem, hi.

433
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:40,274
How’s mother?
All right. So, will you come?

434
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:43,674
No, I can’t.
Too many problems to deal with.

435
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:46,274
So, did Lisa’s boyfriend show up?

436
00:51:46,474 --> 00:51:48,674
No, her friend’s missing too.

437
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:52,275
Hey listen, what was
there in Kalyaevo?

438
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:56,475
I was on my way to mom,
and the place was packed with militia.

439
00:51:56,515 --> 00:52:00,275
Ah, there’s this local tenant…
He killed a Vietnamese, his worker.

440
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:03,475
He is in Leninsk now, in the prosecutor’s office.

441
00:52:03,674 --> 00:52:07,675
Mikhail Nikolaevich,
there’s Leninsk conscription office on the second line.

442
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:12,675
OK, Artem. I have to go.
There is a call from the district. I’ll talk to you tonight.

443
00:52:17,076 --> 00:52:19,276
Yes, colonel, hi.

444
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:21,076
Listen, will you take the cargo 200 the day
after tomorrow?

445
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:25,876
The day after tomorrow?
You know, to bury an Afghan hero.

446
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,677
So, what do you want me to do?
Well, you help, contact his relatives.

447
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:32,676
He’s got no relatives, none.

448
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:36,277
His father is an alky locked in the nut house.
No one’s here to bury him.

449
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:38,877
How many men do you have there?
Everyone’s on summer leave now.

450
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:41,877
And I have two men.
A car, transportation…

451
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:44,276
Hey, I don’t give a damn about
your summer leaves.

452
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:46,476
He died for his motherland, do you get it!

453
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:48,877
Use your militia clowns,
you’ve got aplenty of them there!

454
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:53,277
Fuck!
Fucking fuck, when will it end!

455
00:52:59,878 --> 00:53:01,278
Tell the sergeant…

456
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:04,477
to make a tea.

457
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,678
Eye, comrade colonel.

458
00:53:12,678 --> 00:53:15,878
Comrade Naboev, we’re searching.
We use all the manpower.

459
00:53:15,918 --> 00:53:17,478
And don’t give a damn!

460
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:19,678
I told you to find her!

461
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:22,679
This is my daughter, you get it?

462
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:27,279
The last time she was seen was
at the disco with the guy wearing a CCCP T-shirt.

463
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:29,879
He’s not local and no one knows who he is.

464
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,079
His name is Valera, but we’re not sure of that.

465
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,279
You’ve got last 24 hours.

466
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,680
If you fail, you’ll be a janitor.

467
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,479
Eye.

468
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,280
He hit me! Do you hear? No?

469
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,480
What floor?
Eh? I don’t know.

470
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,680
Quick Response Group set off!

471
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:36,081
Apartment 87, fourth floor.

472
00:54:37,682 --> 00:54:38,282
Move.

473
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:13,084
What do ya want!?
Smash.

474
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:25,684
Take this one.

475
00:55:26,484 --> 00:55:28,284
Fuckers!
Was it you who called?

476
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:30,684
They are there.

477
00:55:34,684 --> 00:55:35,884
Get up.
Suckers!

478
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:37,885
Asshole.
Up everyone!

479
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:40,485
This is my flat.

480
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:43,485
This is my day off and I’m having good time
with my buddies.

481
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:46,085
With the dough I earned.
I have the right!

482
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:48,085
Up everyone I said!

483
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:51,685
What the fuck are you doing here anyway?

484
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:54,486
Who let these pigs in?

485
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:58,086
Fuck off you all!

486
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:01,086
Move out!

487
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:08,286
Register the resistance to authority.

488
00:56:10,686 --> 00:56:12,286
Take him to the car.

489
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:16,086
What are you doing fuckers?

490
00:56:24,287 --> 00:56:27,687
One word from you,
and we’ll beat him to death.

491
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:58,488
Resting, huh?

492
00:56:59,488 --> 00:57:02,088
My Zhurik is back from work.

493
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:05,289
He works a lot, my boy.

494
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:08,289
He’s got a very difficult job.

495
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:11,689
He will have dinner and come to you then.

496
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:14,089
Wanna have a drink?

497
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,089
I have a stash.

498
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,889
So you don’t want.

499
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,090
Well, rest then.

500
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,890
Your wife is kinda…

501
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,690
She doesn’t love me, mother.

502
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,491
She had a boyfriend before me, a paratrooper.

503
00:57:53,091 --> 00:57:57,491
Right, every woman needs
a man, and you…

504
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,891
And I love her.

505
00:58:23,493 --> 00:58:24,492
Hello.

506
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:31,693
Kolya will come soon and kill you.

507
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:39,692
Please…

508
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:43,893
Let me go, please.

509
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:47,894
I’ll tell no one.

510
00:59:12,295 --> 00:59:15,494
What do ya want?
And what do ya want?

511
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:17,895
Want you to suck my cock.

512
00:59:18,495 --> 00:59:19,494
OK.

513
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:53,296
You…

514
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:56,496
Easy with the balls.

515
01:00:06,096 --> 01:00:09,897
Get him when he is recovered.
We’ll register him as a runner.

516
01:00:11,897 --> 01:00:14,497
Is this Dzerzhinsk station?
Yes.

517
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:18,298
This is colonel Sukhina.
Deputy region conscription officer.

518
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,697
Can I talk to the station chief?

519
01:00:20,898 --> 01:00:23,898
Capitan Zhurov here.
Listen, captain

520
01:00:23,937 --> 01:00:25,698
you have a new cemetery in your district.

521
01:00:25,897 --> 01:00:28,098
We need to bury an Afghan hero.

522
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:30,498
The conscription office will pay all the expenses.

523
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:32,698
Help us out, man, huh?

524
01:00:32,738 --> 01:00:34,698
Listen, captain,

525
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:38,898
Senior sergeant Gorbunov.
He is from the region, from Nizhny Volok.

526
01:00:38,938 --> 01:00:42,498
Listen, he’s got no relatives.
He is a real paratrooper, a hero.

527
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:46,099
Listen captain, we’ll settle up then…

528
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:49,499
You see, I’ve got no men now.
No one.

529
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:52,499
And we’ve got six more 200s on
this flight.

530
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:55,299
What’s the name again?
Colonel Sukhina.

531
01:00:55,339 --> 01:00:57,899
Not yours. Cargo’s.
Ah, this.

532
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,899
Gorbunov, senior sergeant.

533
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,500
When’s the cargo?
The day after tomorrow.

534
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:08,300
26th of August, to our airfield.
Around noon.

535
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,300
Listen, we’ll pay your
transport, captain.

536
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:15,099
All right, colonel. Call me tomorrow
when you know the time.

537
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:40,301
You, girl, treat your husband right.

538
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,501
He is your first one, after all.

539
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,701
Get off!
Do you want a pie?

540
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:50,901
Cabbage pie.

541
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,501
All right then.

542
01:02:18,703 --> 01:02:21,103
Hi.
Hi.

543
01:02:24,303 --> 01:02:25,503
Because of the tart?

544
01:02:27,104 --> 01:02:28,903
She is my wife.

545
01:02:32,903 --> 01:02:35,304
You owe me.
I remember.

546
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:43,904
Don’t touch Antonina.

547
01:03:31,906 --> 01:03:33,306
Did Sunka die?

548
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,108
Look.

549
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:28,309
Leave it here for now.

550
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,309
Three four eight,
do you have all the papers with you?

551
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:49,710
Decorations.
Load it on.

552
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,511
But Alexey didn’t kill him.
He didn’t.

553
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:20,911
Then why don’t you say them
that there was this other man?

554
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,911
Alexey doesn’t want me to.
But why? I don’t understand.

555
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:30,511
It’s Alexey’s business with him,

556
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,912
since prison.

557
01:05:34,712 --> 01:05:36,512
He didn’t tell me.

558
01:05:39,512 --> 01:05:43,712
There was the other guy,
wearing the red CCCP T-shirt…

559
01:05:43,752 --> 01:05:45,712
and a girl with him.

560
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:48,712
Where?
In Kalyaevo.

561
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:50,513
When you left.

562
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:54,712
And where are they?
I don’t know, they left too.

563
01:05:55,313 --> 01:05:58,313
You have to find them,
they'll testify.

564
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:02,513
Will you?

565
01:06:04,313 --> 01:06:05,913
You see, Antonina…

566
01:06:05,953 --> 01:06:09,913
I am the head of department of
scientific communism in Leningrad university.

567
01:06:09,953 --> 01:06:13,513
I am the party member.
If they find out about all this…

568
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:15,513
I’ll be in trouble, you see.

569
01:06:15,553 --> 01:06:17,914
They’ll admonish me,
or even fire.

570
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:20,313
I’m a family man and…

571
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:26,114
the lectures will begin soon.
I just can’t.

572
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:30,314
But if you need anything I…

573
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:31,354
Alexey said:

574
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:35,114
the earlier the Lord takes us,

575
01:06:35,915 --> 01:06:39,114
the less time we have to sin.

576
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:04,316
You blacky, hey, hey…

577
01:07:11,716 --> 01:07:15,516
OK, go now.
Get the cemetery lot ready.

578
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,720
Here’s your fiancé.

579
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:21,722
Dammit!

580
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,526
Mom, she didn’t like him.

581
01:10:43,926 --> 01:10:45,325
And I hoped so much.

582
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,526
She loves her paratrooper.

583
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,726
To convict of…

584
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:10,327
offence under paragraph E clause 102…

585
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:14,127
of the Criminal Code of RSFSR, namely murder

586
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,927
in the first degree
of the citizen of Republic of Vietnam

587
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:21,327
Suan-Van-Hey
with the intention of
concealing the other offence…

588
01:11:21,368 --> 01:11:25,804
and in accordance with the clause 23 of
the Criminal Code of RSFSR
to sentence him to the

589
01:11:25,922 --> 01:11:28,527
exceptional measure of punishment,
death penalty,

590
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:31,528
and seizure of all property.

591
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,730
Belov Alexey Nikolaevich

592
01:11:33,968 --> 01:11:37,128
is to be retained in custody

593
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:41,928
Expenses to the amount of 220 roubles
related to remuneration of experts…

594
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:45,128
are to be collected from the convict
in favour of the state.

595
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,730
Who’s there?
Captain Zhurov.

596
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:28,427
Of fourteenth militia station
of Dzerzhinsk region, town of Leninsk.

597
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:31,930
I need to see comrade Naboev,
I called you yesterday.

598
01:12:34,331 --> 01:12:37,530
Come in comrade Zhurov.
We’ve found the letters

599
01:12:37,571 --> 01:12:40,530
from Kolya Gorbunov to Lika,
but there’s no word of Valera.

600
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:44,531
As I told you comrade Naboev
we had the information that

601
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:48,731
Gorbunov and a certain Valera
who was with her in the disco, were friends.

602
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,732
According to our records,
it was Valera who took your daughter away.

603
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:56,331
That is why we wanted to see the letters
for ourselves. We’ll bring them back to you.

604
01:12:57,131 --> 01:12:58,931
Sure. Sure, comrade captain.

605
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:01,131
Anya, bring the letters.
Yes, yes.

606
01:13:02,932 --> 01:13:05,532
Will you find her?
By all means.

607
01:13:05,932 --> 01:13:07,932
Would you like to come in?
My wife will make you some tea.

608
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:11,532
Thank you, it’s getting late.
And I need to return to Leninsk.

609
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:13,332
Tomorrow’s Monday.
Here you are.

610
01:13:36,734 --> 01:13:39,133
Will you go to the department tomorrow?
No.

611
01:13:40,533 --> 01:13:42,934
I’ll go to Orenburg tomorrow
to get a sick leave.

612
01:13:44,534 --> 01:13:46,334
What’s wrong Artem?

613
01:13:46,933 --> 01:13:49,134
You are not yourself after Leninsk.

614
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:50,534
Lena, everything’s fine.

615
01:13:51,534 --> 01:13:53,734
What happened there, in Leninsk?

616
01:13:57,335 --> 01:13:58,535
You already asked me this.

617
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:02,334
Are you having an affair?

618
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:06,335
Folks!
I’m gone.

619
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,535
Slava, please don’t be too late.
You have lessons in the morning.

620
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:19,340
And who is the visitor?

621
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:23,541
How should we know?
We’ve just been ordered to bring you.

622
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:31,541
Everything’s going to change soon.
Yeah.

623
01:17:31,144 --> 01:17:32,744
Dear Lika.

624
01:17:33,144 --> 01:17:36,544
This is my fourth letter to you
after the boot camp.

625
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:39,144
And I still didn’t get anything from you.

626
01:17:39,184 --> 01:17:42,744
In fact, we move all the time,
and the mail is trying to chase us.

627
01:17:43,144 --> 01:17:46,144
The day after tomorrow
we'll be transferred to the Kandahar area.

628
01:17:46,345 --> 01:17:50,144
I miss you so much,
but it’s another year before I see you.

629
01:17:50,345 --> 01:17:54,745
We had a mop-up operation yesterday
and the dukhs killed two of our guys.

630
01:17:54,785 --> 01:17:57,345
Grisha and I were saved by a miracle.

631
01:17:57,385 --> 01:17:59,745
and our corporal was shot in the ass.

632
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:04,145
The guys were laughing, and I felt sorry for him.
He is a good fellow.

633
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,345
He saved many guys.

634
01:18:06,745 --> 01:18:08,945
I hope, you wait for me.

635
01:18:09,146 --> 01:18:11,346
Send my best to everyone.

636
01:18:11,746 --> 01:18:14,346
I sent you a letter from Kabul…

637
01:18:14,386 --> 01:18:16,546
but the dukhs downed our aircraft.

638
01:18:16,586 --> 01:18:20,346
And I thought, maybe my letter was there?

639
01:18:20,386 --> 01:18:21,746
Please write me.

640
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:25,546
I miss your letters so much.

641
01:18:25,586 --> 01:18:27,547
But most of all I miss you.

642
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:29,747
Kisses. Your Kolya.

643
01:18:58,348 --> 01:19:00,948
Who do you want?
Is captain Zhurov at home?

644
01:19:00,988 --> 01:19:02,548
He’s there, with his wife.

645
01:19:04,348 --> 01:19:05,348
We have flies.

646
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:47,950
Aunty! Let me go! Please!

647
01:21:05,954 --> 01:21:09,153
Excuse me, can I see the Father?

648
01:21:09,754 --> 01:21:12,554
Father Vasily will be here for evening service.

649
01:21:15,154 --> 01:21:19,155
Excuse me, and when is the evening service?
In an hour.

650
01:21:19,354 --> 01:21:20,554
What do you want?

651
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:26,354
I would like to know what are your procedures for christening.

652
01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:29,555
It’s not a procedure, it’s a ceremony.

653
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:32,355
Sit there, pray and wait.

654
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:10,356
Hey, what’s your name?

655
01:22:11,156 --> 01:22:11,957
Slavik.

656
01:22:12,757 --> 01:22:16,557
Do I know you?
Nope.

657
01:22:18,156 --> 01:22:20,957
My name’s Valera.
I saw you somewhere.

658
01:22:21,557 --> 01:22:25,757
Anything is possible.
Cool T-shirt.

659
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:30,357
Listen, let’s booze up after the concert.
I pay.

660
01:22:31,158 --> 01:22:32,157
Sounds good.

661
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,359
This is just the time now
to rake in good money.

662
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:51,958
Take me, I come to Nenets…

663
01:22:51,999 --> 01:22:54,759
and get ten deer fells
for a case of spirit.

664
01:22:54,798 --> 01:22:57,759
And here I have a dude
who pays me loads for them!

665
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:01,559
If we partner up, Slavik,
we’ll make two, three times more!

666
01:23:01,599 --> 01:23:05,159
I’m not a local, you see,
so I need a partner who is the Leningrad resident.

667
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:06,159
I get it.

668
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:23,309
It was the second half of 1984.

669
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:28,310
