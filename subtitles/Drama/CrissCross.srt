1
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:33,240
I know what I did
probably looks like bad news...

2
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,716
but I bet you would do the same
if you were twelve...

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,742
and your life
was as screwed up as mine.

4
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:45,520
My dad was a bomber pilot
in the war.

5
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,962
On one of his missions, he hit
a hospital filled with kids.

6
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:53,796
It was an accident,
but it really freaked him out.

7
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:58,703
That was three years ago,
when I was in third grade.

8
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,072
Mom used to be
for the war like Dad...

9
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:06,170
but that all changed after
she saw what it did to him.

10
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:24,325
Dad came back from the war
and quit the military.

11
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,594
One night, he took me
down to the gulf.

12
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:30,899
We collected driftwood
and burned his uniform.

13
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:33,838
Dad said it was nothing
but a killer's costume.

14
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:40,074
After that, he moved us
from Texas to Key West.

15
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,809
In those days,
he was drinking a lot.

16
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,441
But by spring...

17
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:48,784
he started fasting
and took a vow of silence.

18
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:51,655
Then one day,
he just disappeared.

19
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:59,291
He wrote Mom and said
he wasn't coming back.

20
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,694
I wrote him once to ask,
"What about me?"

21
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,330
He didn't answer.

22
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:22,580
They're goin'
to the friggin' moon.

23
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:24,556
Half my money goes to taxes...

24
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,957
so they can blow away
peasants in pajamas...

25
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:29,427
and fly to the friggin' moon.

26
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:32,961
So, what do you say?

27
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,661
You want to replace Monica
on stage or not?

28
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,565
I don't know.

29
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,096
I guess so.

30
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:43,909
Guess all you want.

31
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,208
Just let me know by tonight.

32
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:50,943
Well, so long, babe.

33
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:53,817
We're gonna miss
your 38s, you know?

34
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:59,217
- Thanks for everything.
- Sure.

35
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,923
Maybe with your tits,
I'll bill you as a 12-year-old.

36
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:08,128
You got a way with words,
Connie. Let's go.

37
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,366
When Dad was with us,
we lived in a house...

38
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,772
and I had my own room.

39
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,970
These were the good old days...

40
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,809
which Mom doesn't like me
talking about.

41
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:24,339
If I do, she says "G.T.F."...

42
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,716
which stands for
"Going too far."

43
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:31,315
This is Mom's ladylike way of
telling me to shut the fuck up.

44
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,121
Hi, Mom!

45
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:47,996
All you have to do
is adjust the straps.

46
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,738
The thought of them touching me
gives me the creeps.

47
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:54,212
You start making five times
what you make bartending...

48
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:57,045
and you won't mind them
touching you so much.

49
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,678
I love you, Tracy,
but it's time you faced facts.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,745
As hard as you work,
you still don't have enough...

51
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,780
for a little house.

52
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,156
If you want a future
for yourself and the kid...

53
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,218
you're gonna have
to bump and grind for it.

54
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:12,860
You're a tough lady, Monica.

55
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,197
I'm not tough. I'm practical.

56
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,076
Good morning, Termina.

57
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,311
You look pretty.

58
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,614
Thanks.

59
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,679
Good morning.

60
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:37,883
Yes.

61
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,892
Don't be late
for the card flip, boss!

62
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,393
OK!

63
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:47,699
Termina, eat your
sunflower seeds, please.

64
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,964
- Yeah, Termina.
- Shut up.

65
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,672
Hey, Snyder!

66
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,085
Come on!

67
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,525
It's OK!

68
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:22,799
Don't you say bye?

69
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,762
Not to you.

70
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,779
Mom and me stayed in Key West.

71
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,787
She took a night job
being a bartender...

72
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,516
to help pay the rent...

73
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:47,185
but pretty soon, we had to move
to the Eden House.

74
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,286
Mom was waitressing there...

75
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,196
so the room only cost us
twenty bucks a week.

76
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:03,435
One 25-pound bag
of yellow onions...

77
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:06,639
I really dig Emmett,
but the way he chain-smokes...

78
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,013
he could drop dead like a fly
at any second.

79
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,211
And if there's one thing
I've learned...

80
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:15,688
it's a total nightmare
to love someone...

81
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,883
and have them cut out on you.

82
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,486
It at least will come back
with something...

83
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,928
for the geologists to study.

84
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,624
I'll call you right back.

85
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,691
Armstrong and Aldrin will
collect more than 100 pounds...

86
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,498
of lunar material.

87
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,976
- Seen Mom?
- Not yet.

88
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,347
When you had a mom,
did she used to work all night?

89
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,113
She only had time to sleep.

90
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:49,417
My father worked nights,
though.

91
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,014
He was a bootlegger.

92
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,787
Would you mind putting
the fish on ice?

93
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:11,610
French toast, pick up.
Swiss cheese omelet, pick up.

94
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,247
Wrong knife.

95
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:26,923
So, where's
the little guy's mom?

96
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,259
Still at her night job.

97
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:31,456
She can't get her tables
set on time...

98
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,090
she gonna have
to find another job.

99
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,430
Be nice to her for once.

100
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,901
She's finally getting
her head together.

101
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:40,770
Oakley, pick up
the fucking omelet, please!

102
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,142
Oakley!

103
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:56,287
Pick up this breakfast
before it's lunch!

104
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:18,243
I'm just going to go set
my tables and get my work done.

105
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:21,042
Hi, sweetheart.
Did you sleep good?

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,604
Better than you, I bet.

107
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,550
I'm sorry, honey.
I had to miss our breakfast.

108
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,610
I had some things
to pick up after work.

109
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,350
I set your tables, so you better
be getting to work.

110
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,914
You better
get ready for school.

111
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,186
I am ready.

112
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,591
- You are not.
- Yes, I am.

113
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,788
No. Come on, put your jeans on.

114
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,956
My jeans are wrecked.

115
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,464
Well, then put on
your green pants.

116
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,330
I outgrew those last year.

117
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,461
Now, I can't have you going
to school looking like a bum.

118
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,563
I ain't no bum.

119
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,097
All right.
Come on back after school...

120
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,269
and I'll sew
your pants up for you.

121
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:54,109
I have food stand after school.

122
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:56,115
Not till 6:00, you don't.

123
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:10,557
If I'd been Dad,
I'd have never left Mom.

124
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,964
My girlfriend Termina says Mom
must be totally blown away...

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,991
from Dad abandoning us.

126
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,232
Termina's
one grade ahead of me.

127
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,177
When we get older,
we plan on living together...

128
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,704
so we can have orgasms.

129
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,274
Termina says orgasms
are something adults get...

130
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,582
after they fall in love...

131
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,853
but Emmett says orgasms are
what make people fall in love.

132
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:42,919
All Jetty says is
I'll find out soon enough.

133
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:47,831
When I asked Mom
what exactly an orgasm was...

134
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,926
she said "G.T.F."

135
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,658
You ready to order?

136
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:20,792
Yeah, I'll take number two...
eggs over easy.

137
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,131
- Anything to drink?
- No, thank you.

138
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,500
Somebody please
pick up on table nine!

139
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,907
More coffee?

140
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:35,712
What do you think...
cheese omelet or sliced fruit?

141
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,648
Well, how hungry are you?

142
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,812
Hungry. I been driving all night
from Jacksonville.

143
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,218
Is that where you're from?

144
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,315
No, I'm from Washington, D.C.

145
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,421
You?

146
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:51,362
I'm from here.

147
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:54,059
Well, actually,
I was born in El Paso...

148
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,499
but I live here now.

149
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,002
No kidding.

150
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,664
I know a guy who played
minor league ball in El Paso...

151
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:00,673
the Sun Kings.

152
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:03,835
My daddy used to take me
to those games.

153
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:08,136
God gave us baseball to make up
for the industrial revolution.

154
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:13,016
I'll have the omelet
and the sliced fruit.

155
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,111
You might have to wait
for that omelet.

156
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,781
All right.

157
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,274
Make way. Coming through.
Hot stuff here.

158
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,802
Make way.

159
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,254
Had to start without you, boss.

160
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,918
Did you flip
any of our singles yet?

161
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,484
Had to. Leaner won't come down.

162
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,018
I hit it twice.

163
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,554
Shoot. Make way. My turn.

164
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,138
- You cheated.
- Hey, take it easy.

165
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:12,644
It's only a game.
Put the knife away.

166
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,407
What's going on here?

167
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,540
Cruz just found this knife.

168
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,311
I'll bring it
to the lost and found.

169
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:22,219
Cruz, the knife.
Bertrand, inside.

170
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,221
Come on, Chris. What do you
think your father would say...

171
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:30,820
if he was told about this?

172
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,728
Not much really.

173
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:36,724
He took a vow to silence.
He's a monk now.

174
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,930
Your father's a monk?

175
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:43,237
Yeah. He lives in a monastery
north of Miami.

176
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,304
When was the last time
you saw him?

177
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:50,440
About three years ago.

178
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,509
I was nine then.

179
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:55,817
What did he say?

180
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,755
You remember?

181
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,281
Yeah. He said that
the purpose of life...

182
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:01,987
is to love everything...

183
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:04,258
even flies.

184
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,597
Chris, did your father ever
consult with a psychiatrist?

185
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:14,766
What for?

186
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,468
He talks to God.

187
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,801
Tell me something
about your mom.

188
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:25,981
Guys her age are always
trying to nail her.

189
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,679
Nail her?

190
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,382
You don't know what
that means? Nail her?

191
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,618
Yeah, I know
what it means, Chris.

192
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,489
Does she work?

193
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:39,623
Very hard. We're trying
to save up for a house...

194
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:43,294
for when my dad gets back.

195
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:46,269
What kind of work?

196
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,432
She's a waitress
and a bartender.

197
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,840
I got three jobs.

198
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:53,471
Hey, Chris...

199
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:56,311
you like her very much,
don't you?

200
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,548
Sometimes.

201
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,110
Anything else?

202
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:05,488
Yeah.

203
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,016
Tell me when
you don't like her.

204
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,620
When she forgets she's a mom.

205
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:19,069
Look, Chris,
I've enjoyed speaking to you.

206
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:22,802
Chris? And I think that
it would probably be...

207
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:25,003
a good idea if we did
this again sometime.

208
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,012
What do you think?

209
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,877
Anything beats
sitting around in class...

210
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,439
with Smethurst the worst.

211
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:33,475
Hey, Chris, no more blades, OK?

212
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,781
OK.

213
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,552
- And send your buddy in here.
- OK.

214
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,293
You owe me one, Fidel.

215
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,308
Run, run!

216
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,834
Move, move, move!

217
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,312
Run, Tracy, run!

218
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:03,178
Run!

219
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:04,706
Go back, go back!

220
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,684
What?

221
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,914
Come on, Tracy!

222
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,415
Out!

223
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:17,859
You dumb son of a bitch!

224
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,195
Will you throw home?

225
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:22,258
Come on, Tracy!

226
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:25,766
Hi, smoothie.

227
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:30,271
I thought you said
I was a hot dog.

228
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:35,306
My mom's team is playing
like a bunch of bozos.

229
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,314
How about a smoothie?

230
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,412
- Sure.
- On the house.

231
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,284
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

232
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,790
My boss is making me
cut back on the fruit.

233
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,043
- How do you like it?
- Delicious.

234
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,044
Oh, please.

235
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,239
This is your first time
in public?

236
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:16,917
Thought if you could wear this,
we could go steady.

237
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,049
I just don't want
all the other guys...

238
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,390
thinking that
you're not my girl.

239
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,230
Hey, ump!

240
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,464
Jetty, what the hell
are you doing?

241
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,245
Come on, Oakley,
move your omelets.

242
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,690
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

243
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:29,388
- How's business?
- It's fine, I guess.

244
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,225
I'd like you
to meet my friend Joe.

245
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:33,094
Joe, this is my son
Christopher.

246
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:36,226
Hello, Christopher. Your mom's
said nice things about you.

247
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,065
Yeah.
That's pretty much her job.

248
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,072
She's my mom.

249
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:44,770
Will you please step back?
I have to put the hatch down.

250
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:51,115
Well, hurry up
so we can scoot, Chris.

251
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,515
OK.

252
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,280
I'll catch you later.

253
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,311
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

254
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,121
Give me a break tonight, Chris.

255
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,632
You mean to start
seeing that guy?

256
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,224
Maybe.

257
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:16,364
What happens when Dad
comes back and catches you?

258
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,105
Catches me doing what,
talking to another man?

259
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,511
Yeah.

260
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,378
Well, I don't think
it'd be any worse...

261
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,883
than having you catch me,
do you?

262
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:28,182
Seriously, Mom.
I want to talk about this.

263
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,848
Honey, the reason your daddy
and I got divorced...

264
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,381
was he couldn't
talk to me anymore.

265
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,360
I figured once I let him
have the divorce...

266
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,487
that I'd be allowed
to talk to other men.

267
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,294
Well, Buggs
and Termina's parents...

268
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,493
didn't talk to each other
for a year...

269
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,594
and they got back together.

270
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:48,164
That's because they were
only separated, Chris.

271
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,971
I mean, when you're divorced...

272
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,276
it means you're just not
interested in trying anymore.

273
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,820
Honey, we talked
about this already.

274
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,254
Well, what's the point
of getting married...

275
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,225
when you can crap out
any time you want?

276
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:12,423
Well, I guess there really
isn't much point.

277
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,296
Come on, Rebel. Come on, boy.

278
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,561
- Bye.
- Come on.

279
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,066
Come on.

280
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,801
Oh, my God. You better get two.

281
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,276
OK.

282
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:08,209
Hey, Emmett,
if Louis shows up...

283
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,620
tell him me and Oakley went
to catch Tracy's new act.

284
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,021
- What act?
- All right.

285
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,787
Oh, hi. I didn't see you.

286
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,133
Get it in the hole.

287
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,799
I'm getting it in the hole.

288
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:35,207
OK. Get it tight.

289
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,306
OK.

290
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:44,784
You up for a little nose action?

291
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,758
- Yeah.
- OK.

292
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,761
- Oh, boy.
- Steady.

293
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,262
Yep.

294
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,525
Oh, man.

295
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,666
Oh, monster.

296
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:58,670
And at one buck a "G,"
for free.

297
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:01,673
- Ready?
- Blast off, baby!

298
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,028
Great!

299
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,090
Isn't she great?

300
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,821
Tracy!

301
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:02,520
Tracy!

302
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:08,095
Turn 'em on, Trace!

303
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,123
Come on!

304
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,942
Oh, great.

305
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:31,500
I was real mad at Mom,
but real sad, too.

306
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:34,603
What made Mom so crazy...

307
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,614
that she'd put a song
on the jukebox...

308
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,775
and moon a bunch of drunks?

309
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:52,157
I hitched a ride
with some lady on a Harley.

310
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:54,188
She told me to hang on tight.

311
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,498
Then she put my hands
on her tits.

312
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:00,596
I kept them there,
but didn't squeeze.

313
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,758
Thanks a lot.

314
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,901
It was all screwed up.

315
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:43,278
Deep down, I wanted just to bury
my head on Mom's shoulder...

316
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:47,775
forget about how we lived
and why Dad was gone.

317
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,661
Hey, mister,
could you give me a ride?

318
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:03,361
- Where do you want to go?
- North Miami.

319
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,199
OK, kid.

320
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:07,228
Thanks a lot.

321
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,306
Man is about
to launch himself...

322
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:57,815
on a trip to the moon...

323
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,181
with the expectation
of landing there...

324
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:03,449
man going to the moon
aboard that Saturn rocket.

325
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:06,013
The rocket will go...
will put the men into orbit...

326
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:09,084
115 miles above the earth...

327
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:10,856
for one and a half orbits...

328
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,921
and then the third stage
will put them...

329
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,556
on their way toward the moon.

330
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,831
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

331
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,241
I'm looking
for a Lieutenant John Cross.

332
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:28,075
He's my dad.

333
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,843
I think you want to talk
to the groundskeeper.

334
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:32,076
Groundskeeper?

335
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,142
He's usually
in the vegetable garden...

336
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,654
at this time of the day,
so just go through the arch...

337
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:38,519
and turn to the left.
You'll find him.

338
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,752
OK. Thanks.

339
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:07,274
Dad?

340
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,414
Dad?

341
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,783
Remember me?

342
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,907
Dad...

343
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,809
I need your help.

344
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:44,812
But you and I know
her stripping's not right.

345
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:51,992
I only know one thing.

346
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,658
The kingdom of God
lies within each of us.

347
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:55,791
When you experience
that kingdom...

348
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:59,361
then you'll know what to do
and how to do it.

349
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:02,271
What does God
have to do with this?

350
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:08,740
- Does your mom know you're here?
- No, sir.

351
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,873
The first thing to do
is to contact her.

352
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:13,851
She's going to be worried.

353
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,479
She'll just be mostly mad.

354
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,421
Will you call her for me?

355
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:23,285
Son, I haven't spoken
to your mother in three years.

356
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:27,128
I'm sure you'd get a lot further
with her than I would.

357
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,315
Mom's coming to get me.

358
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:19,911
I'm going out with this girl
that's a year older than me...

359
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:23,944
and her brother's
my best friend.

360
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:28,858
How old were you when
you and Mom got married?

361
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:32,158
Well, that was my last year
at Annapolis.

362
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,563
I must've been 22.

363
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:39,360
And you met at a party.

364
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:40,871
You were wearing your uniform.

365
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:43,703
She had her white dress on.

366
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:45,300
Right?

367
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:48,578
That's right.

368
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:51,605
And you were happy until
you came back from 'Nam...

369
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,814
and started drinking
and having bad dreams.

370
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:00,825
I'll take this to the kitchen.

371
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:06,756
You sure are
a great gardener, Dad.

372
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:33,652
Your mom's here.

373
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:40,294
I thought we could all
go for a walk and talk.

374
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:48,603
I'm going to say good-bye
to you here, son.

375
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,940
Don't you even want
to say hello to her?

376
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:54,808
I'm afraid there's no point.

377
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:03,783
So, what you're saying, it's
all right for her to dance...

378
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:06,256
and me not to care for her.

379
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,822
I don't know how
to instruct you.

380
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:19,701
I'm sorry.

381
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,775
Perhaps one day
you'll understand.

382
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:40,288
Try to be of good cheer.

383
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,229
It's OK.

384
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:49,791
At least we had a chance
to work in the garden together.

385
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:26,263
Where's Christopher?

386
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:33,535
He's looking for you
at the chapel.

387
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:34,977
You quit drinking.

388
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:41,210
- 2 years, 31 days.
- A long time.

389
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:44,446
Has anything else changed?

390
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,454
Just about everything
has changed.

391
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:54,456
Is this what you wanted?
Are you happy here?

392
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:58,060
It makes sense to me. Yes.

393
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,330
I don't want Chris to hate me.

394
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,503
He hangs on to you coming back.

395
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,876
He worships you.

396
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:13,475
Not anymore, he doesn't.

397
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:20,655
Well, thank God for that.

398
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,250
I'm sorry.

399
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:51,311
Shit.

400
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,733
Bet it's the carburetor.

401
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,766
It's always getting clogged.

402
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,273
What'd you and your dad
talk about?

403
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,575
You must've talked
about something.

404
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:57,213
Isn't that why you came
all the way up here?

405
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:59,951
I wanted to see my dad, OK?

406
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:04,087
Why? What'd you think
would happen?

407
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:06,221
Try starting it.

408
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:29,543
If you thought getting us
all together again...

409
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:31,555
would make things the way
they used to be, Christopher...

410
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,251
I want you to get that
out of your head right now.

411
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,421
Why? Why can't things
be like before?

412
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,364
I want you and Dad
to be back together.

413
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:43,390
No, you don't. You forget.

414
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:44,731
It wasn't any good
when he came home...

415
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:46,896
and it wouldn't be
any good now.

416
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,132
It's better than this.

417
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:50,265
Better than you yelling at me.

418
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,081
Honey...

419
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,851
sweetie, you got to stop
fighting me on this.

420
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:45,926
I'm doing the best I can.

421
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:50,732
Stick with me, Chris.
I need you.

422
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,265
I'm starving.

423
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,774
I packed you a sandwich.

424
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:04,114
Oh, sweetheart.

425
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,538
When school ended for summer...

426
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:37,207
Buggs and me
cooled out at the beach.

427
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:40,581
Mostly it was great
just doing things together.

428
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,483
And after a year
in the same class...

429
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,181
as Smethurst the worst...

430
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:48,090
what we needed to do
was air out our heads.

431
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:27,289
The day before the countdown...

432
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:28,821
Buggs said
we should try something...

433
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:31,926
to help the astronauts
have a safe mission.

434
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:35,268
We decided
everything would be OK.

435
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:39,242
We closed our eyes and pictured
a perfect flight...

436
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:42,838
from blastoff to splashdown.

437
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,814
The scariest part for me...

438
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:48,717
was thinking about
being stuck on the moon.

439
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,881
Buggs said he'd miss his dad
more than anyone.

440
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:53,823
I said Rebel.

441
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,321
But I really meant my mom.

442
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,769
Who put a shark in the tank
in the first place?

443
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:09,136
Louis. He's eating all
of Emmett's favorite fish.

444
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:11,038
So, what do we do
if we catch him?

445
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:13,202
Put him back in the ocean.

446
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:16,270
Hey, you guys.
You're going to miss it.

447
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,339
Hey, I think
"Dark Shadows" is on now.

448
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:19,974
Get away from there, Louis.

449
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:21,006
Louis.

450
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:25,489
T-minus 15 seconds.
Guidance is internal.

451
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:29,550
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...

452
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:31,221
ignition sequence start.

453
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:34,322
Six, five, four...

454
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:37,664
three, two, one...

455
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:39,067
zero.

456
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:40,900
- All right!
- Oh, God!

457
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,235
Liftoff. We have a liftoff,

458
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,764
32 minutes past the hour.

459
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,573
Yeah!

460
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:49,239
Boy, it looks good, Wally.

461
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,645
- Yeah!
- All right!

462
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:51,978
All right!

463
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:06,288
Roger.
You're loud and clear, Houston.

464
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,093
Houston, thrust is go.

465
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:09,463
All engines are looking good.

466
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:37,392
Grab the bow line!

467
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:46,136
Hey, Snyder!

468
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:49,934
What?

469
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,272
Gimme some fish!

470
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,744
He's drunk.

471
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,185
Always.

472
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,419
You gonna deliver these,
or are you gonna screw around?

473
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:14,056
You know how my brother hates
when you're late, now.

474
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:16,191
Snyder's a drunk,
and Jetty's paying him.

475
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,167
You're gross!

476
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:27,136
Echo!

477
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:30,170
Echo!

478
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:33,984
Rebel!

479
00:44:39,156 --> 00:44:41,886
There's some tarpon up here.

480
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:46,124
It's big!

481
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,791
Yeah. Eight-foot.

482
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,801
200 pounds.

483
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,302
Drop it, Rebel!

484
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,965
- This one's had it.
- Wait, look!

485
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:00,273
It looks like someone
stitched it up. That's weird.

486
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:03,474
Watch all the guts come out.

487
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:06,881
Oh, my God. Turn around!

488
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,214
What? What is it?

489
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:11,517
Let's get out of here.
Come on, get out!

490
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,081
Let's go!

491
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:23,092
Termina told me what
was in the fish is cocaine...

492
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:25,193
the drug
people snort up their noses...

493
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:26,567
like they were pigs...

494
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:29,630
and that turned them
into sex maniacs.

495
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:32,403
She said Jetty and Snyder
were just using me...

496
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:34,172
so they could make money...

497
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,202
and I could
only get into trouble.

498
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:40,240
It really bummed me out
that Jetty had lied to me.

499
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:41,444
When Termina asked me...

500
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:44,045
what I was planning to do
with the cocaine...

501
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,215
I said, "Throw it away."

502
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,225
"And the night before that,
I dreamt I was a wigwam."

503
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:50,284
I heard this joke, Louis.

504
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:52,227
It's funny!
I'm not laughing yet.

505
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,823
How come you know
every joke in the world?

506
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,457
'Cause you told me every joke.

507
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,365
I did not!
Did I tell you that joke?

508
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:08,106
Because he dreams about teepees.

509
00:46:08,145 --> 00:46:09,544
I want to give you some change.

510
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,810
Don't sweat the small stuff,
little guy.

511
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,180
Rebel ate one of the fish.

512
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:15,151
Doc says,
"Relax. You're too tense."

513
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,778
What did you say?

514
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:18,049
What did you say?

515
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:22,048
Rebel ate one of the fish.

516
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:25,460
"Relax. You're 2 tents."

517
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:28,021
It is funny! Think about it.

518
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:31,626
Hey, Louis!
Louis, will you stow it?

519
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,971
Tell Tracy it's set-up time.

520
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,442
What do you mean?

521
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:46,375
What do you mean,
what does she mean?

522
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:47,850
Get up there,
and you tell your mother...

523
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:49,250
to get her buns down here.
It's dinnertime.

524
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:52,187
- You got me?
- OK! Yeah!

525
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:54,418
God!

526
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:14,172
Mom.

527
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:19,046
You gotta wake up.

528
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,676
You need to go set up.

529
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:28,684
You feeling OK?

530
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,990
Yeah.

531
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:34,964
Must've had a bad dream,
honey. That's all.

532
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:37,297
Would you give me
my cigarettes?

533
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:38,460
You shouldn't smoke.

534
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:40,493
Oh, hush.

535
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,777
Mom, we need to talk.

536
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:55,580
Mom?

537
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,280
All right. Go on.

538
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:59,653
I'm going to splash
some water on my face.

539
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:02,992
Give me a towel, honey.

540
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:11,294
You do look serious.

541
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:18,772
I saved all my money.
You can have it.

542
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:23,308
Chris, put that money
in your account...

543
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:26,077
and quit worrying about me.

544
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:34,288
If I make as much money as you,
will you quit your job?

545
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:38,455
Don't you think
I'm awfully young to retire?

546
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:44,924
I know what you do.

547
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:49,372
You know what I do?

548
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:57,675
I know you take your clothes off
in front of other guys.

549
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:02,416
How'd you find out?

550
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:05,115
What difference does it make?

551
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:08,949
Honey...

552
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:14,026
I was planning on telling you.

553
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:16,760
I just didn't know
how to do it.

554
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:20,665
'Cause you know it's not right.

555
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:24,103
I know it's not right.

556
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,938
I wish there was
another way, Chris.

557
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:30,879
I just can't find any.

558
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:33,348
Look harder.

559
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:35,711
God damn it, Chris...

560
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:38,153
sometimes there's things
you just don't understand.

561
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:39,280
I understand.

562
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:41,621
Now, turn around here.
Look at me for a minute.

563
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:43,422
I'm making five times
the amount of money...

564
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,519
I would doing that
than anything else.

565
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:48,531
And I'm not equipped
to do anything else!

566
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:50,465
Now, I'm all you've got!

567
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:54,232
And I'm looking out
for your future, Chris.

568
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:58,207
Who cares about the future?
I care about now!

569
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,677
You think I like
taking my clothes off...

570
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:06,740
in front of all those people?

571
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:09,184
It makes me sick to my stomach.

572
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:10,880
Then stop!

573
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:16,683
Honey...

574
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,788
sometimes in life
you gotta do things...

575
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:26,394
that aren't so good
to get what is good.

576
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:32,908
It's gonna be all right,
sweetie.

577
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:38,714
I love you more than anything.

578
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,886
I guess it was like Mom said.

579
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:29,592
Sometimes you had to do
something that wasn't so good...

580
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,625
to get what is good.

581
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:37,902
I knew in my head what I was
planning wasn't exactly good...

582
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:40,808
but I figured
if Dad wasn't coming home...

583
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:43,472
and wasn't gonna help...

584
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:47,280
it was up to me to save my mom.

585
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:31,110
Hell of a time to deliver the
bad news headlines, isn't it?

586
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:40,386
Ladybug.

587
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:44,018
Ladybug, ladybug,
fly away home.

588
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,699
Emmett?

589
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:54,261
How come Mom dances
without any clothes on?

590
00:54:55,872 --> 00:54:59,501
People are very tough
to figure, Chris.

591
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,136
Especially mothers.

592
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,743
Will her dancing
get her into trouble?

593
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:07,079
Hey.

594
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:10,018
She puts her goddamn arms
around you, don't she?

595
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:13,318
So? She puts her arms
around a lot of people.

596
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:16,655
Listen, Chris,
you're gonna be all right.

597
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:18,786
When you get older,
you're gonna find someone...

598
00:55:18,828 --> 00:55:20,853
they're gonna put
their arms around you.

599
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:23,058
As long as you got someone
to put their arms around you...

600
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,090
you're gonna be OK.

601
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:29,467
How come
you don't got somebody?

602
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:31,167
Aren't you lonely?

603
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,833
Yeah, sure.
The only thing worse...

604
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:36,869
than being lonely
with yourself...

605
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:38,608
is being lonely with someone.

606
00:55:52,762 --> 00:55:54,252
Do people use this stuff...

607
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:57,460
because it helps them
become sex maniacs?

608
00:56:00,236 --> 00:56:01,897
Where the hell
did you get that?

609
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:04,805
Rebel brought it home
in his mouth.

610
00:56:04,841 --> 00:56:08,072
Nasty stuff, Chris.
It's cocaine.

611
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:11,569
People get addicted to that.
Dump it right now.

612
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:14,242
- Is it expensive?
- Dump it, Chris!

613
00:56:17,053 --> 00:56:19,180
Crap sells for ninety a gram.

614
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:22,055
You got about ten grams there.

615
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:24,788
- Ninety cents?
- Bucks!

616
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,056
Jesus, my mind's jumping.

617
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:27,927
Go on, go deliver
your newspapers.

618
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,353
Morning.

619
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:57,158
Morning.

620
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:02,158
How you doing?

621
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:05,633
Enjoying my day off.

622
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,098
Soap...

623
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,440
Better separate that stuff.
It's gonna get wrecked.

624
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:17,703
It's already wrecked.

625
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:19,772
I thought you left.

626
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:21,215
I did.

627
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:23,842
Came back.

628
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,024
Where'd you go?

629
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:31,118
Fishing.

630
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:33,789
Did you have any luck?

631
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,024
Not yet.

632
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,635
I was beginning to think
you were turned off...

633
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:43,900
by my work at the bar.

634
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,135
Everybody's got a job to do.

635
00:57:51,147 --> 00:57:52,978
What's your job?

636
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:55,177
I'm unemployed.

637
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,085
No, I just finished
a job up north.

638
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:03,183
I'm a sports writer.
I'm writing a novel.

639
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:04,716
I'm on page three.

640
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:09,259
I used to read at night.

641
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:12,063
Now I just pass out.

642
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:15,003
Thank God for sleep, you know?

643
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:18,036
See ya.

644
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:25,438
Hey, what are you doing later?

645
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,450
A bunch of us are
going down to the beach...

646
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:30,476
and dance and watch
the moon landing.

647
00:58:31,888 --> 00:58:33,253
Have fun.

648
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:37,692
Hey.

649
00:58:38,862 --> 00:58:41,422
Save me a dance.

650
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:36,651
There you go.

651
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:39,951
To tranquility on the moon...

652
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:41,081
and right here on Earth.

653
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:42,489
All right.

654
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:46,759
Chris has been following
the moon flight...

655
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:48,161
for months, haven't you, honey?

656
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:51,565
Yeah. My dad wanted
to be an astronaut.

657
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:54,092
His dad was a navy pilot.

658
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,332
How about you, Chris?
You want to be a pilot?

659
00:59:56,372 --> 01:00:00,206
- Boat captain.
- He'd like to be a boat captain.

660
01:00:00,243 --> 01:00:02,336
To take people fishing?

661
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:05,279
- No...
- He likes whale-watching...

662
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,215
porpoise-watching.

663
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,151
I just like to see 'em.

664
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:13,019
I think he'd make
a terrific marine biologist.

665
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,725
So, you like school?

666
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,989
- I don't want to study...
- He likes school. He does.

667
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:21,121
Mom, shut up.

668
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:22,461
You can't talk to me
that way, Chris.

669
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:23,726
We're havin'
a conversation here.

670
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:27,930
We are? I'm gonna go
hang out with Buggs.

671
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:37,838
He gets a little
jealous sometimes.

672
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,973
I'm gonna go hang out
with Buggs, too.

673
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:55,322
Oh, yeah.

674
01:01:01,204 --> 01:01:02,364
Wow, sweet.

675
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,600
Don't, 'cause he'll wake up.

676
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:07,940
Watch, watch. After I show you
something, I'll do it.

677
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:12,979
Wow. He likes it.

678
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:20,982
Oh, no!

679
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:22,321
That hurt?

680
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:26,658
Oh, man.

681
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:28,186
Here, watch, watch.

682
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:33,398
God damn it.

683
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:42,504
I bet you he don't like that.

684
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:48,113
I bet he don't like
seeing your boogers, either.

685
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:16,597
You guys want
to buy some beads?

686
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:17,970
Beat it, kid.

687
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:38,187
How are you guys doing today?

688
01:03:38,227 --> 01:03:40,821
Listen, don't hassle us
for spare change, man.

689
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:42,524
Get out of here.

690
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:44,795
You want to buy some beads?

691
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:51,136
This ain't no good.
Get out of here.

692
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,741
How about a little...

693
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:57,871
one-on-one action?

694
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,881
You gonna sell us
your girlfriend or what?

695
01:04:07,356 --> 01:04:08,618
What, kid?

696
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,889
Well, stuff that helps
sex maniacs.

697
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:17,063
What do you think?

698
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:19,329
You talking about coke?

699
01:04:19,368 --> 01:04:20,596
Yeah.

700
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:22,160
How much you asking?

701
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,334
One buck a "G."

702
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,235
A buck a "G."
Get the fuck outta here.

703
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:31,143
- A hundred?
- A buck a "G."

704
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,842
Must be fine stuff.

705
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:35,908
It's monster.

706
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:37,249
Monster.

707
01:04:40,122 --> 01:04:44,286
You know, we're gonna
have to score a line.

708
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:46,625
Check it out, you know?

709
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:47,822
No problem.

710
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:49,559
Just hang loose.

711
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,226
I'll be back
in about 15 minutes.

712
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:52,495
Hey, come here for a second.

713
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:54,400
You're not bullshitting us,
are you?

714
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:56,905
- You being straight with us?
- Yeah.

715
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:59,032
- No scam, right?
- Right.

716
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:01,043
Listen,
meet us across the street.

717
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:03,841
- We got a black van. Got it?
- Yeah.

718
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,074
All right.

719
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:51,452
Where you been?

720
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:53,257
I'm trying to sell
this necklace...

721
01:05:53,296 --> 01:05:55,696
to those two dudes
over there in the black van.

722
01:05:55,731 --> 01:05:58,529
OK? So if anything
goes wrong...

723
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:00,661
grab a lifeguard,
bring him over, OK?

724
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:01,897
OK, boss.

725
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:31,698
Those are nice.

726
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,496
Come on.

727
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:56,550
You ever done this before?

728
01:06:57,893 --> 01:06:58,882
Yeah.

729
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:15,502
You got some
fine powder here, kid.

730
01:07:15,544 --> 01:07:17,842
I'll go 150 for 2 grams.

731
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,080
I can't.

732
01:07:21,117 --> 01:07:23,813
Best I can do is 350 for 4.

733
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:28,785
Let's see the four grams.

734
01:07:30,593 --> 01:07:33,153
Give me the bucks first.

735
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:56,979
Pleasure doing business
with you, kid.

736
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:01,580
Yep.

737
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:08,857
We'll see you again real soon.

738
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:13,562
Depends on what my boss says.
He killed a person once.

739
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:15,331
Cute.

740
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:23,671
How'd it go?

741
01:08:23,713 --> 01:08:25,180
No problem.

742
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:28,549
Well, did you sell it?

743
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:29,812
Mission accomplished.

744
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,046
All right.

745
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,192
It really makes you think...

746
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:40,787
we should all be
happier, doesn't it?

747
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,731
What would make you happier?

748
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:45,529
A couple of things.

749
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,598
Tell me.

750
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,771
Talking only jinxes it.

751
01:08:57,546 --> 01:08:59,844
Don't you have superstitions?

752
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:01,179
No.

753
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:21,732
Although the surface appears...

754
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:25,298
to be very fine grain
as you get close to it.

755
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:26,933
It's almost like a powder.

756
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,375
Armstrong is on the moon.

757
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:32,403
Neil Armstrong,
a 38-year-old American...

758
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,939
standing on the surface
of the moon.

759
01:09:36,418 --> 01:09:39,615
That's one small step
for man...

760
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:43,889
one giant leap for mankind.

761
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:47,194
I think that was Neil's quote.

762
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:49,754
I didn't understand it.
"One small step for man..."

763
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,097
But I didn't get
the second phrase.

764
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:54,193
I want to hear that.
We'd like to know what it was.

765
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:56,136
The surface
is fine and powdery.

766
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:59,232
I can kick it up loosely
with my toe...

767
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:03,575
His quote was, "That's one
small step for man..."

768
01:10:03,612 --> 01:10:05,876
"one giant leap for mankind."

769
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:08,475
One giant leap for mankind.

770
01:10:08,517 --> 01:10:10,485
First we go live to Paris.

771
01:10:10,519 --> 01:10:12,680
- I take...
- My hat off...

772
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:15,349
- I take my hat...
- Off...

773
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:16,551
off...

774
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:20,394
Good night, Emmett.

775
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,056
Good night, Chris.

776
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:26,428
I would say it's certainly
the most fantastic event...

777
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:32,731
Beep...

778
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:34,504
beep, beep.

779
01:10:37,046 --> 01:10:40,777
Oh, God. Jesus.

780
01:10:40,816 --> 01:10:42,909
Oh, Joe.

781
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:05,233
You OK?

782
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:07,935
Yeah.

783
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:11,140
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

784
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:17,344
Let me get us
something to drink, OK?

785
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:18,580
OK.

786
01:12:33,495 --> 01:12:34,962
This yours?

787
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:36,658
What is it?

788
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,630
It's not mine.
Throw it on the chair.

789
01:12:42,771 --> 01:12:44,705
You look tired.

790
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,765
Did you get in late?

791
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,277
Not too late.

792
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:55,548
I must've been asleep.

793
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,415
G.T.F., Christopher.

794
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,319
I'm gonna spend the day
with Buggs again.

795
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:03,825
All right. Be home by 6:00.

796
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,349
What for?

797
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:06,918
'cause I said so.

798
01:13:06,962 --> 01:13:08,657
Whatever.

799
01:13:08,697 --> 01:13:10,494
Don't forget.

800
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:27,880
- Hi.
- Hello.

801
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:32,181
- Where is everybody?
- Mom went shopping...

802
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,781
and Dad and Buggs went
to get a new muffler.

803
01:13:37,726 --> 01:13:40,559
- Wanna go up to my room?
- Sure.

804
01:13:51,673 --> 01:13:53,004
My mask.

805
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,976
I thought I lost that.

806
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,023
This is for you.

807
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:19,458
"Dear, Chris, I'm so happy
I'm your girlfriend..."

808
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,492
"and you asked me to go steady."

809
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:23,835
"I love you,
and I hope you love me."

810
01:14:23,872 --> 01:14:25,635
"Lots of love. Termina."

811
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:30,004
Could it be that I love you...

812
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:31,512
and you love me?

813
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:37,210
Chris.

814
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:44,549
It's OK. It's just us.

815
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:53,424
- You won't tell anybody?
- No.

816
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:56,099
OK.

817
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:22,520
You look nice.

818
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:24,589
So do you.

819
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:35,974
It's so much quieter
with a new muffler.

820
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:38,707
- Shit, it's your brother.
- What if he comes upstairs?

821
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:40,374
Then you're dead.

822
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:53,517
Oh, yeah. He says,
"Why do elephants..."

823
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:56,395
What was it?
Why do elephants have flat feet?

824
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,228
Why do pigs have flat feet?

825
01:15:58,267 --> 01:15:59,256
Why?

826
01:15:59,301 --> 01:16:00,962
From trying to be elephants.

827
01:16:04,506 --> 01:16:06,531
Hold on, honey.
I think I got one.

828
01:16:06,575 --> 01:16:08,839
God, they're hard to get.

829
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:13,314
- They run?
- They don't run.

830
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:19,045
Oh, come on.
Be still. It's almost done.

831
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:21,385
- This stuff stinks.
- I know it stinks.

832
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:24,525
I gotta touch it. Door's open!

833
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:31,155
A gentleman drops by
to offer a lady a ride to work.

834
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,760
Well, a lady
gratefully accepts.

835
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,269
Splendid.

836
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:38,696
How you doing there, Chris?

837
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,833
Mom and me are trying
to have a heart-to-heart.

838
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,977
I'll see you downstairs.

839
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:50,848
OK, honey.

840
01:16:50,886 --> 01:16:54,481
Listen, wash that stuff off
in ten minutes, all right?

841
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:55,547
OK.

842
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:58,355
Look how much I've saved, Mom.

843
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:03,961
Now you can quit
that awful job.

844
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:06,399
Chris...

845
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:09,700
Honey, we've talked
about this before.

846
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:12,229
I'm real proud of you,
but that money is yours, OK?

847
01:17:12,274 --> 01:17:14,071
So you keep it.

848
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:22,550
Just don't forget,
Joe's only on vacation.

849
01:17:24,519 --> 01:17:27,488
You get a good night's
sleep tonight.

850
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:12,232
Hey, what a day?

851
01:18:12,267 --> 01:18:13,825
Just another day in paradise.

852
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:16,099
Yeah, that's sort of what
we want to talk to you about.

853
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:18,106
- You got a minute, don't you?
- Yeah.

854
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,631
- You still in business?
- Maybe.

855
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:22,143
We want to make another deal.

856
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:23,974
Look, man,
we're hitting the road, OK?

857
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:26,503
We want to make
a big score this time.

858
01:18:26,548 --> 01:18:30,040
Listen, can you handle
two grand?

859
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:33,577
The boss trust you
with 2,000 bucks, kid?

860
01:18:33,622 --> 01:18:34,953
Let me think about it.

861
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:38,118
Think about it fast,
because we ain't got much time.

862
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,596
Yeah, because we're out of here
day after tomorrow.

863
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,824
OK.

864
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,492
Here's our number.

865
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:49,060
Give us a call
if you can swing it.

866
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:50,264
OK.

867
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:55,208
Hey, who do I ask for?

868
01:18:55,243 --> 01:18:56,767
Ask for Bobby.

869
01:19:15,397 --> 01:19:17,797
Nice shot.

870
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,994
How do you like the shrimp?

871
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:21,332
It's great, boss. Thanks.

872
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:23,634
So, you guys got
the plans straight?

873
01:19:23,672 --> 01:19:25,765
No problem, amigo.

874
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:26,933
OK.

875
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,443
Let me go make a phone call.

876
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,070
Take over for me.

877
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:34,108
Fifteen ball, corner pocket.

878
01:19:37,753 --> 01:19:39,311
Good shot.

879
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:58,469
Hi, Bobby. This is Rebel.

880
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:02,273
Meet me at Garrison Bight
at 9:30.

881
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:06,054
OK? Yeah,
I'll bring the goodies.

882
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:24,331
Have you seen Mom?

883
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:26,061
Taking a nap.

884
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:32,365
I guess you guys
are going hot and heavy.

885
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:37,805
Yeah.

886
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:45,613
I'll try and be
a bit friendlier...

887
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:49,317
if you and Mom
are doing more...

888
01:20:49,357 --> 01:20:52,258
than just putting
the moves on each other.

889
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:54,717
OK.

890
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,767
I got to work now.

891
01:21:08,977 --> 01:21:14,938
But if you want to talk later,
I'll take you out on my boat.

892
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:17,417
I got a fish run tonight.

893
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:18,817
OK?

894
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:25,784
OK.

895
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:29,796
What time?

896
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:35,961
I'll knock on your door
about 7:30.

897
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:53,081
Pretty neat?

898
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:55,021
You like boats?

899
01:21:55,056 --> 01:21:59,117
Hate 'em. I was in the navy.

900
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,527
Did you ever go to Vietnam?

901
01:22:02,564 --> 01:22:03,861
I was there.

902
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:05,594
You were?

903
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:08,831
Did you ever meet
Lieutenant John Cross?

904
01:22:10,972 --> 01:22:12,371
No.

905
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,341
He's my dad.

906
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:30,855
Hey, Snyder!

907
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:34,290
Who's Snyder?

908
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,354
Snyder's a shrimper.

909
01:22:44,839 --> 01:22:46,864
I'll be right back.

910
01:22:59,854 --> 01:23:01,185
Hey.

911
01:23:01,222 --> 01:23:02,746
Hey, delivery boy.

912
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,656
Where's Snyder?

913
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,821
He got too wasted
and racked out.

914
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:12,124
I'm here for a pickup.

915
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:15,398
Oh, well...

916
01:23:20,175 --> 01:23:21,767
Shut up.

917
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,378
You shouldn't smoke that stuff.

918
01:23:33,421 --> 01:23:35,446
It turns your brain
into oatmeal.

919
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,253
That's the point, honey.

920
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:39,351
Take care.

921
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:12,418
Smells like a party going on.

922
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,826
You smell shrimp.

923
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:18,826
Right.

924
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:23,832
They friends of yours?

925
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:27,330
No. I just work for them.

926
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:34,812
You going to be leaving soon?

927
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:38,848
A couple of days.

928
01:24:40,822 --> 01:24:42,542
Give me that fish,
or I'll stick you, amigo!

929
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,949
- Make a move, and I cut him!
- Take it easy!

930
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:49,020
- Come on!
- Don't hurt me!

931
01:25:01,209 --> 01:25:02,198
Wait up!

932
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:13,913
You OK?

933
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:15,445
I can't believe this.

934
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:19,387
Well, it's pretty unbelievable.

935
01:25:19,427 --> 01:25:20,826
Yeah.

936
01:25:22,897 --> 01:25:26,389
- Come on.
- Thanks.

937
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:33,800
You expect me to believe
you didn't even see them?

938
01:25:33,842 --> 01:25:36,640
Do I look that high to you?

939
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:39,647
Well, they both
had a mask on 'em.

940
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:41,706
Right?

941
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,808
Pillowcases.

942
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:50,754
Cuban kids with a switchblade
and a golf club.

943
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:55,855
Well, it was totally dark,
and they jumped us by surprise.

944
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:57,159
And you didn't even try
to fight them off?

945
01:25:57,198 --> 01:25:59,132
Just for some fish?

946
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:00,930
"Just for some fish?"

947
01:26:04,672 --> 01:26:05,661
Come here.

948
01:26:11,179 --> 01:26:14,012
Don't fuck with my head, kid.

949
01:26:14,048 --> 01:26:16,448
Don't want to have to hurt you.

950
01:26:16,484 --> 01:26:18,349
Don't fuck with my head.

951
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:23,616
But I didn't do anything.

952
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:26,183
Hey, peace on Earth
and all that good shit.

953
01:26:26,227 --> 01:26:27,489
Get off my case, ace.

954
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:29,121
Hey, I ain't gonna let you
hurt a kid.

955
01:26:29,164 --> 01:26:31,029
What the hell's
the matter with you?

956
01:26:31,065 --> 01:26:32,498
Mellow out, guys!

957
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:35,503
Hey, stick a steak knife
in this asshole's ear!

958
01:26:35,537 --> 01:26:38,062
Yeah, right.
What, am I psycho dishwashing?

959
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:40,006
Come on, man,
you're fucking up your karma.

960
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,030
My karma's cooking!

961
01:26:41,075 --> 01:26:43,373
Now look!

962
01:26:43,411 --> 01:26:45,038
I'm on vacation.

963
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:46,706
I'm starting to get pissed off.

964
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:47,976
Yeah, well,
I'm getting ripped off!

965
01:26:48,016 --> 01:26:49,108
It's fish!

966
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,242
There's a lot of people
in this town...

967
01:26:50,285 --> 01:26:52,082
who would kill
for a piece of good fish, pal.

968
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,849
You hear what I'm saying?

969
01:26:53,888 --> 01:26:59,224
Hey! Look, I know where
the kid's going.

970
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,091
I'll take you there.

971
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:03,427
But calm down. We'll get
this all straightened out.

972
01:27:03,464 --> 01:27:04,692
Just calm down.

973
01:27:04,732 --> 01:27:06,996
Jetty, man, here.

974
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:08,730
We'll just do it, all right?

975
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,067
If this guy's
pulling your chain...

976
01:27:10,104 --> 01:27:11,731
then you get violent,
all right?

977
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:13,001
You want some?

978
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:14,838
Is it local?

979
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,241
- Yeah.
- No.

980
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:21,806
OK, let's let's go find
Benedict Asshole.

981
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:25,848
All right, now,
I'm not taking you anywhere...

982
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:27,821
if you don't behave.

983
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:42,925
Hey, glad you could
make it, Chris.

984
01:28:42,964 --> 01:28:44,761
How'd you guys know my name?

985
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:46,733
You told us on the phone,
remember?

986
01:28:46,768 --> 01:28:51,205
No, I didn't.
I said my name was Rebel.

987
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:53,537
You know what? I think the kid
is going paranoid on us...

988
01:28:53,574 --> 01:28:54,939
before the big sale.

989
01:28:56,678 --> 01:28:58,009
Hey, so...

990
01:28:58,046 --> 01:29:00,480
So, are we going
to make a deal or what?

991
01:29:00,515 --> 01:29:02,346
You guys got the bread?

992
01:29:02,383 --> 01:29:05,147
Yep. You got the goodies?

993
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:07,416
Yeah.

994
01:29:07,455 --> 01:29:08,786
Let me see it.

995
01:29:12,393 --> 01:29:14,861
I'll go get the cash.

996
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,101
What the hell? Fuck off!

997
01:29:31,145 --> 01:29:32,373
Cough it up.

998
01:29:32,413 --> 01:29:34,904
Where's the rest of it,
you little scumbag?

999
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:36,974
I'll give you to three.
Where's the rest of it?

1000
01:29:37,018 --> 01:29:39,953
Cough it the fuck up!
Where's the fucking rest of it?

1001
01:29:39,988 --> 01:29:41,080
I ain't got no more!

1002
01:29:41,122 --> 01:29:42,111
That's it. Let's go.

1003
01:29:42,156 --> 01:29:44,647
Come on!

1004
01:29:44,692 --> 01:29:46,956
All right, police!
You're under arrest!

1005
01:29:46,995 --> 01:29:49,395
Get down!
Get down on... freeze!

1006
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:57,295
I can't swim! Help!

1007
01:30:10,251 --> 01:30:12,515
Hey, kid, what are you doing?
What are you doing here?

1008
01:30:12,553 --> 01:30:13,577
Where's Mom?

1009
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:15,418
Thought I'd let her off early.

1010
01:30:15,456 --> 01:30:16,821
When?

1011
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:18,792
I don't know.
An hour or so ago.

1012
01:30:32,673 --> 01:30:34,140
Mom, we got to talk.

1013
01:30:34,175 --> 01:30:35,175
What's the matter, honey?

1014
01:30:35,176 --> 01:30:37,974
We got to talk, Mom!

1015
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:39,707
Joe?

1016
01:30:39,747 --> 01:30:42,682
You sold cocaine to Joe?

1017
01:30:42,717 --> 01:30:44,981
He didn't look
like a policeman.

1018
01:30:45,019 --> 01:30:47,852
None of them did.

1019
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:51,256
But all of a sudden,
they had guns and badges.

1020
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:57,891
- Who the hell are you?
- You want to let me explain?

1021
01:30:57,932 --> 01:31:00,423
Explain what?
How you used me and my son...

1022
01:31:00,468 --> 01:31:04,029
to bust a bunch of idiots?
You think I'm stupid?

1023
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:05,630
I'm not stupid, mister.

1024
01:31:05,673 --> 01:31:07,106
You're not paying a hell
of a lot of attention.

1025
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:09,405
You knew he was in trouble,
and you didn't say anything.

1026
01:31:09,444 --> 01:31:13,141
How could you sleep with me
and not say anything?

1027
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:14,148
I couldn't.

1028
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:16,480
What? You couldn't what?
Tell the truth?

1029
01:31:16,517 --> 01:31:18,314
You had to endanger
my son's life to do your job?

1030
01:31:18,352 --> 01:31:21,810
Well, screw your job
and screw you!

1031
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:26,724
I got to take him
to the sheriff's office.

1032
01:31:26,761 --> 01:31:27,801
Don't you get near my son.

1033
01:31:27,829 --> 01:31:28,796
He's got to go in now.

1034
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:30,195
Yeah, well, I'll take him in.

1035
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:31,664
Can you pay attention
long enough...

1036
01:31:31,699 --> 01:31:33,530
I ain't going to jail!

1037
01:31:33,568 --> 01:31:35,832
Christopher,
we're in big trouble!

1038
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:39,306
God, please open the door!

1039
01:31:40,508 --> 01:31:42,806
- Chris...
- I'm not opening it!

1040
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:46,036
Chris, we got to talk.

1041
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,775
I don't want to.

1042
01:31:47,815 --> 01:31:52,479
Honey, I want you
to listen to me.

1043
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,920
This wasn't your fault.

1044
01:31:54,956 --> 01:31:58,722
It was my fault, honey.

1045
01:31:58,759 --> 01:32:02,217
I thought I knew
what I was doing, honey...

1046
01:32:02,263 --> 01:32:05,824
but I was wrong, and...

1047
01:32:08,236 --> 01:32:10,602
I'll quit my job...

1048
01:32:10,638 --> 01:32:14,233
and we'll start over.

1049
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:17,733
You just got to come
out of there, honey.

1050
01:32:17,778 --> 01:32:20,838
Please.

1051
01:32:20,882 --> 01:32:23,282
Are you listening?

1052
01:32:23,317 --> 01:32:24,841
Chris?

1053
01:32:28,055 --> 01:32:30,853
What am I supposed
to tell them?

1054
01:32:32,994 --> 01:32:36,361
You know the answer
to that, Chris.

1055
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:41,795
You listening, Chris?

1056
01:32:55,049 --> 01:32:56,812
The truth?

1057
01:33:08,062 --> 01:33:10,826
Let's get this over with.

1058
01:34:08,289 --> 01:34:11,315
Apollo 11 has made it.

1059
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:15,458
Splashdown should be just now.

1060
01:34:15,496 --> 01:34:17,964
X-Y-L-7-2-0-4.

1061
01:34:17,999 --> 01:34:19,967
Just write it down.

1062
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:21,866
Landing in the Pacific Ocean...

1063
01:34:21,902 --> 01:34:23,699
southwest of Hawaii.

1064
01:34:23,738 --> 01:34:26,673
Apollo 11
is back from the moon.

1065
01:34:26,707 --> 01:34:29,574
It's hard to be tough in jail.

1066
01:34:29,610 --> 01:34:34,172
I tried not to show it,
but I was scared.

1067
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:36,775
What I did was bad news.

1068
01:34:36,817 --> 01:34:40,344
They locked me up for the night
to think about it.

1069
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:45,250
Mom said that drugs
ruin people's lives...

1070
01:34:45,293 --> 01:34:47,784
just like the war
had ruined Dad's.

1071
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:52,827
I got put on probation
for a year.

1072
01:34:52,867 --> 01:34:54,266
I was lucky.

1073
01:34:55,403 --> 01:34:58,270
Jetty, Snyder,
and Louis were sent to prison.

1074
01:34:58,306 --> 01:35:00,035
Careful.

1075
01:35:00,074 --> 01:35:01,473
You got two big ones there.

1076
01:35:01,509 --> 01:35:03,238
Yeah.

1077
01:35:03,277 --> 01:35:06,303
The day after Mom quit
her dancing job...

1078
01:35:06,347 --> 01:35:08,815
we moved out of the hotel.

1079
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:12,943
Joe's here.

1080
01:35:12,987 --> 01:35:16,115
There we go.

1081
01:35:16,157 --> 01:35:17,818
OK.

1082
01:35:17,858 --> 01:35:21,760
Tracy, you got company
over here.

1083
01:35:21,796 --> 01:35:23,320
Come here, Chris.

1084
01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:39,437
I did what I think is right.

1085
01:35:48,055 --> 01:35:49,682
Is your name really Joe?

1086
01:35:53,461 --> 01:35:56,021
Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:36:00,134 --> 01:36:03,126
So long, Joe.

1088
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,580
Emmett had a long talk with me.

1089
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:22,350
He said he loved me,
but that I was a wise guy.

1090
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:26,156
He told me wise guys die young,
and I should quit being one...

1091
01:36:26,193 --> 01:36:29,162
if I wanted to become
a normal adult.

1092
01:36:29,196 --> 01:36:33,326
I said I'd rather die young
than become a normal adult.

1093
01:36:35,035 --> 01:36:39,495
But I learned my lesson,
even if I didn't act like it.

1094
01:36:40,674 --> 01:36:44,576
Where we moved wasn't exactly
what we'd hoped for...

1095
01:36:44,612 --> 01:36:48,412
but it was what
Mom could afford.

1096
01:36:48,449 --> 01:36:52,215
It was a rush
seeing Mom happy again.

1097
01:36:56,557 --> 01:37:00,687
The astronauts sure seemed happy
to come back to Earth.

1098
01:37:00,728 --> 01:37:03,822
I think because they've been
to another place...

1099
01:37:03,864 --> 01:37:05,354
they know
better than anybody...

1100
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:08,664
the Earth's
our only real home...

1101
01:37:08,702 --> 01:37:11,296
no matter how screwed up.
