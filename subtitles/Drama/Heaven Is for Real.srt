1
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,929
<i>Is heaven a hope?</i>

2
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,281
<i>Or as real as the earth and sky?</i>

3
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,123
<i>I once asked my grandfather that question.</i>

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,647
<i>And he said by the time he knew the answer
it would be too late for him to tell me.</i>

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,164
<i>The day would come when
I asked that question again,</i>

6
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,447
<i>staring into the eyes of my son.</i>

7
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,643
- Mighty quick.
- I don't get paid by the hour.

8
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,087
I'm afraid you don't get paid by cash, either.

9
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
- Are you sure you're okay with the carpet?
- Times are tough.

10
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,530
Your business improves, mine will, too.

11
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,962
- Why don't you grab a hose?
- Did you rob a carpet store, Todd?

12
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,044
Unlike you guys, I actually have a job.
Look at these bums.

13
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,885
And he's got five of them.
Do you want some help?

14
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,642
You know, if you keep accepting
things instead of money,

15
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,246
eventually, you're going to run out
of things and money.

16
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,926
Yeah, I have to downsize, man. Downsize.

17
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,487
You ladies just keep your seats.
Todd and I got this.

18
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,211
- Yeah, don't help. Not necessary.
- No problem.

19
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,006
Longhorns, let's go! Line it up!
Show me what you got!

20
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,765
Coach is late!

21
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,521
Go, go, Burpos, Burpos!

22
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,165
Let's go, Davidson! You were slacking
last week. These ladies are watching.

23
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,208
That's it, that's it.
That's what I'm talking about right there.

24
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,850
I want you and you up.

25
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,328

<i>Sung by flaming tongues above</i>

Hang on, hang on, hang on.
We gotta work on that pitch, ladies.

33
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,482
- Well, it's a little bit pious.
- Shall we try it one more time?

34
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,162
<i>Come, Thou Fount of every blessing</i>

35

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,284
Okay, once more.

<i>Come, Thou Fount of every blessing</i>

40
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
- There's my guy
- Daddy!

41
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,967
How are you? What's happening?

42
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,451
How are you doing?

43
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,083
How was your day?
What's going on in there?

44
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,644
Mom has a house full of women
and Cassie thinks she's one, too.

45
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,923
Oh, no. They're singing.

46
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,440
<i>...tongues above</i>

47
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,445
Todd's home.

48
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,644
All right, how about boy's night out,
we go get some pizza? Pizza Palace?

49
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,563
- Really?
- What do you think?

50
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,165
What do you think?

51
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,647
Does that sound good?
What kind are you going to get?

52
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,165
- Cheese.
- No, you're not.

53
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,163
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

54
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,330
What's wrong, Dad?

55
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,923
There are some people over at the hospital
and they want me to come by.

56
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,640
<i>...to sing Thy grace</i>

57
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,241
<i>- I'll</i> go with you.
- You're going to go with me?

58
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,209
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

59
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,001
It might be a little sad or a little scary.

60
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,642
That's all right.
If I'm with you, I won't be afraid.

61
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,530
You're coming with me, then.
Hospital and pizza. Hospital and pizza.

62
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,764
Let's go.
You know what we say when we're hungry?

63
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,529
There's the doctor.

64
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,770
- Reverend Burpo.
- Todd.

65
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,001
- Todd.
- Yeah.

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,046
My name is Lee. My father asked for a pastor.

67
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,207
- Would you mind talking to him?
- Sure.

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,401
- Great.
- Sure. Are you okay, pal?

69
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,210
He's in here.

70
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,565
My name's Todd.

71
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,003
I'm here to pray for you.

72
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,882
Is there anything you're sorry for?

73
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,925
Everything.

74
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,848
I believe God forgives.

75
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,126
And if he forgives anything,
he forgives everything.

76
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,886
Our Father who art in heaven,

77
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,851
hallowed be Thy name.

78
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,691
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

79
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,127
on earth as it is in heaven.

80
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,124
<i>"And then said to the lion, 'Of all the deaths</i>

81

82
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,645
Take your blanket.

83
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,801
- Night-night.
- Dad.

84
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,331
- Yeah?

When Jay offered us a house
as a part of my salary,

89
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,922
he never mentioned the rail road.

90
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,691
I like the rumble. It's romantic.

91
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,089
- How tight are we this month?
- No, don't talk about money.

92
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,202
Slim Forrest couldn't pay for
those garage doors.

93
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,961
He donated some carpet
for the church instead.

94
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,689
But he said he had the cash
when he placed the order.

95
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,571
Things changed.

96
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,208
You had a rough day, didn't you?

97
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,728
As long as I'm with you, I'm not afraid.

98
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,325
You're good.

99
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,083
But let me tell you something.

100
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,848
The next time I'm practicing your
favorite hymn and you howl like a dog,

101
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,241
I'm going to whip you like a dog.

102
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,765
Do you hear me?

103
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,362
Doesn't sound so bad.

104
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,607
Stop.

105
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,850
<i>For I love the little children of the world</i>

106
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,842
<i>I will take you by the hand
Lead you to a better land</i>

107
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,524
<i>For I love.</i>

108
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,446
Do you think Mom realizes
how funny she looks when she does that?

109
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,920
No. And we're not going to tell her, are we?

110
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,249
<i>All the children of the world</i>

111
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,448
<i>Red and yellow, black and white

112
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,531
<i>Jesus loves the little children of the world</i>

113
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,490
High five. Really good. Really good, Douglas.

114
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,088
Voices of angels, right?

115
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,611
Well, this morning I want to talk to you about
what sort of commitment makes a marriage,

116
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,806
makes a relationship, makes up a life.

117
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,084
Last night, I stood in the bedroom where
our children sleep

118
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,642
and I listened to their mother read them
a bedtime story.

119
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,088
And in the final saga of this wonderful land

120
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,405
where animals talk with humans
and a great lion leads them all to love

121
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,689
and faith and courage.

122
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,243
In the last chapter of this great story,

123
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,608
written for children just like me
and Mrs. Davis over here,

124
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,531
all of the lion's enemies have swept away
his followers except for two,

125
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,080
a bear and a unicorn,

126
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,931
who are trapped in a cave with the lion.

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,846
And because
the entrance to this cave is narrow,

128
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,846
the wave after wave of soldiers that
the evil king sends in

129
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,769
to try and kill them can't do it.

130
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,526
The lion, the bear, the unicorn,
they fight them off.

131
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,125
So finally, the king sends in a messenger.

132
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,730
He says, "Look, the one that we really want,
the one we're interested in, is that lion.

133
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,168
"Give him up and the rest of you will live.

134
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,891
"The unicorn, we're going to cut his horn off.

135
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,282
"We'll make him pull a cart
for the rest of his life.

136
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,610
"The bear, we're going to put in chains
and shackles, make him dance in the circus.

137
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,809
"But both Of you Will live.

138
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,723
"All you have to do is give up that lion."

139
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,084
Finally, the lion looks at his friends with
that look in his eyes,

140
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,924
"What are you going to do?"

141
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,562
And the bear and the unicorn, they just smile

142
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,247
and they say,
"Of all the deaths that we could have died,

143
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,402
"this right here is the one
we would have chosen."

144
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,164
But the bear and the lion and the unicorn,
they weren't looking for an easy road.

145
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,847
I don't think Jesus was either
when he accepted the cross.

146
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,528
There's a lot of people,
they don't believe that story anymore than

147
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,444
the one about the lion, the bear,
and the unicorn.

148
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,207
I'm here with you all this morning
because I believe in them both.

149
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,281
And I'll never give up that lion.

150
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,202
- Rosa.
- Sonja.

151
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,930
- How are you?
- I'm good.

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,682
I have something I wanted to give you.
It's just something small.

153
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,125
Thank you.

154
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,043
Oh, Sonja, this is too beautiful.

155
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,441
No. Not for her.

156
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,410
- I'll see you guys next Sunday.
- Yeah. Take care.

157
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,326
Look, baby. Sonja gave it to us for Lucia.

158
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
It's gorgeous.

159
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,888
You're great when I'm there to inspire you.

160
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,850
If you want to inspire me, you get a hit at
that softball game this afternoon.

161
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,490
Outstanding. I will.

162
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,242
- Watch that ball like that.
- Embarrassing.

163
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,522
- He's a good batter.
- Embarrassing.

164
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,491
All right, Jay!

165
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,167
Hold up.

166
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,441
- Let's go, baby.
- Come on, Sonja!

167
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,206
- Come on, Mama!
- All right! Let's go, Sonja!

168
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,645
Two more!

169
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,168
- Come on, Mama.
- Go!

170
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,726
Go! Go, go, go!

171
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,484
- No!
"Out!

172
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,202
- No, he knocked it loose. He's safe! Safe.
- There you go.

173
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,322
- You can't do that, man. That's dirty.
-Or what? ls there a problem?

174
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,050
Is there a problem?

175
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,325
I'm all right.

176
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,483
You just got me warmed up, baby.
You got me warmed up now.

177
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,846
Come on, baby.

178
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,844
Yeah, let's go. Easy out.

179
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,208
Yeah, Todd!

180
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,329
- G(), Sonja!
'Yés!

181
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,404
- Come on, Todd!
- Safe. Safe.

182
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,921
Michael, Michael! It's bad, it's bad!

183
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,524
Hold on, let me look. Don't move.
Get my bag.

184
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,443
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you okay?

185
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,289
Todd, just stay still, buddy.

186
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,204
- We have to cut your pants, Todd.
- Don't touch it!

187
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,122
- It's a spiral fracture.
- Is it going to heal?

188
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,170
It'll heal, but he won't be climbing
any ladders soon.

189
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,890
Todd, just stay still, buddy.

190
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,884
I'm going to put some pressure on it,
Todd, okay?

191
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,522
Todd, we gotta lift it up, buddy.

192
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,971
We gotta lift it up.

193
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,648
As many of you already know,
I was hurt sliding into third.

194
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,407
- I was safe.
- No, he was out.

195
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,930
Okay, I was out.

196
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,170
I had a great teacher early in the ministry

197
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,484
who told me that
we'd have good days and bad days

198
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,570
and we'd seldom know at the time
which is which.

199
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,486
But a few Sundays ago, as I was sliding
into third and I heard the crack of my leg,

200
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,166
I had a pretty good idea which was which.

201
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,927
So, the Bible talks about adversity.
The Bible talks about

202
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,526
all things working together for the good.

203
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,840
Todd! What...

204
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,284
Okay, I'm all right.

205
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,162
-It's my back.
- Are you all right?

206
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,841
Don't move.

207
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,444
- Lie down.
- I'm on it.

208
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,127
- It's Pastor Todd. He's fallen.
- Nancy, sing Amazing Grace.

209
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,731
- Don't move, don't move.
-It's just a spasm.

210
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,802
It's my back. It's my back.

211
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,042
<i>Amazing Grace</i>

212
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,643
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

213
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,248
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

214
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,522
<i>Like me</i>

215
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,084
-it's kidney stones again.
- Yeah.

216
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,323
All we can do is give you painkillers
and lots of water and let you pass them.

217
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,562
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

218
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,924
You're going to be all right.

219
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,925
- Jay!
- Hey.

220
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,931
Todd's passing another stone,
so Colton and I, we're going to the park.

221
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,161
All right.

222
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,130
- Giddyup, horsey!
- Horseys bite. Did I tell you that?

223
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,929
How's he doing?

224
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,921
Todd?

225
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,281
Todd?

226
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,205
I'm passing another one!

227
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,363
Todd, it's Jay!

228
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,444
How are you doing, buddy?

229
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,930
Can I do anything for you?

230
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,490
- What, do you want to try and catch it?
- No. That's not what I had in mind.

231
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,641
- How many have you passed?
- I've passed seven, Jay! Seven!

232
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,563
That's a bunch.

233
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,725
I think they usually say you gotta pass
about 14, 15 to make sure they're gone.

234
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,810
What do you want?

235
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,163
Well, you know, we're sort of wondering

236
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,090
when you think
you might be able to preach again.

237
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,323
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

238
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,567
- From the prison ministry.
- Giving is a good...

239
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,608
He's used to captive audiences.

240
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,761
- Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit.
- She's from the seminary.

241
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,686
If Todd isn't back soon,
I'm going to kill somebody.

242
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,448
And I'm going to start with you.

243
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,921
- Holy Spirit.
- Use an anvil.

244
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,329
We need to get out of town.

245
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,685
A family getaway.

246
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,691
I know a great place. Denver.

247
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,041
Denver?

248
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,601
We can bring the kids, go for a weekend.

249
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,804
- When?
- I don't know. Soon.

250
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,886
No, honey. I have to focus on work.

251
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,480
- We need it.
- We've got to get some bills paid.

252
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,971
You need it.

253
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,042
- All right, well...
- There's no way, I'm telling you.

254
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,045
Okay. I'm just saying, if you did,

255
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,490
I would...

256
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,560
Now?

257
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,160
Okay.

258
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,849
Not now. If you say we can go.

259
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,763
Kids, we're going to Denver!

260
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,163
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

261
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,764
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

262
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,209
<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

263
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,045
<i>Could we sing We Will Rock You?</i>

264
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,366
<i>Buddy you're a boy
Make a big noise</i>

265
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,603
<i>Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man some day</i>

266
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,042
<i>You got mud on your face
You big disgrace</i>

267
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,964
<i>Kicking your can all over the place</i>

268
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,250
<i>Singing "We will, we will rock you"</i>

269
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,963
I wouldn't want to eat a monarch.
They taste so bad.

270
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,771
- You wouldn't want to eat it?
- Yeah, for sure.

271
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,727
- He's coming home with us.
- Do you see his eyes?

272
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,125
- He wants to...
- No, he wants...

273
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,085
There he goes.

274
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,164
Dad, speed up.

275
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,000
Look!

276
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,087
- Here's a butterfly.
- Yeah, look at that one.

277
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,491
Oh, my gosh.

278
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,323
Look! They've got a place where
you can hold a tarantula.

279
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,640
There's one.

280
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,241
- A butterfly.
- Pretty good, right?

281
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,807
Let's follow that guy.

282
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,209
- What do you think? Is she soft?
- Yeah.

283
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,208
- I did it, I did it!
- You sure did.

284
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,123
I want a sticker.

285
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,965
If you want a sticker,
you have to get in there and hold Rosie.

286
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,567
- Colton, why don't you try?
- No.

287
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,968
<i>Hello, Doctor, it's Sonja Burpo.</i>

288
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,407
<i>Colton started throwing up
on the way home in the car.</i>

289
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,641
<i>Cassie!</i>

290
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,561
No, I don't. Cassie. Cassie. Honey.

291
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,526
Yeah.

292
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,040
- Todd!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

293
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,164
- His temperature is 103.
- Keep it in there.

294
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,402
- And Cassie is throwing up now also.
- Don't get any in your hair.

295
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,811
Don't get any in your hair.

296
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,769
- Honey. Thank you. Thank you.
- Those are chunks.

297
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,444
You've got to chew your food.

298
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,525
The doctor says that
the flu's been going around and... Todd!

299
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,765
Hey, this is Todd Burpo,
Overhead Garage Door, Imperial, Nebraska.

300
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,689
That's right. Right.

301
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,684
I got that big order for the 591 series doors.

302
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,402
B-U-R-P-O. Okay, I'm sending in that deposit.

303
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,683
I'm going to pay that in full
with the job completion, all right?

304
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,525
Okay, thank you very much.

305
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,605
His fever's up.

306
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,167
- I thought it was holding steady.
-It was.

307
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,040
It's now 104. It's been four days.
Cassie is fine.

308
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,602
I mean, could it be appendicitis?
You had it in college. I've had it.

309
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,125
Maybe this is the beginning of it.

310
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,009
- I'm going to try to call...
- No, I already tried.

311
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,368
We've got to take him
to the medical center. Now.

312
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,521
All right.

313
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,770
Cassie!

314
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,122
Todd, we need to hurry.

315
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,880
Faster, Todd.

316
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,007
He has a ruptured appendix.
We need to get him to surgery right away.

317
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,286
Call the OR.

318
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,245
- Daddy, don't let them take me.
- I'm right here, buddy.

319
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,403
- Ruptured when?
-It looks like days ago. He's very sick.

320
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,562
Dawn, run ahead, get everybody ready.

321
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,450
- But how can that happen?
- The blotches on the X-ray are infected.

322
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,602
It exploded all through his abdominal cavity.

323
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,841
But he's going to be okay, right?

324
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,845
We're going to get in there
and clean him out. You'll have to wait here.

325
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,601
Stay right there, please.

326
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,210
Are they ready for us in OR?
I need his status ASAP.

327
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,884
<i>- I'll</i> come with you.
- No, no, I just need a minute.

328
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,091
You've made me suffer. And I took that.

329
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,091
You made my family suffer and I took that.

330
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,089
You're going to take my boy?

331
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,290
Don't you take my son.
Don't you take my son!

332
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,522
His blood pressure is falling.
We're losing him.

333
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,961
Sonja.

334
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,770
How's Colton?

335
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,122
We're in trouble here.

336
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,930
He's...

337
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,806
He's not... He's not doing well.

338
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,282
He's worse. He's <i>much</i> worse. And I...

339
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,641
No. No.

340
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,411
Will you call some friends

341
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,607
and ask them to pray for him?

342
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,406
Of course, I will, honey. Right now.

343
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,808
I'll pray for you, too.

344
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,571
Thank you.

345
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,364
Jay, we've got a problem.

346
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,920
Please help us watch over this little boy.

347
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,845
He's very precious.

348
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,367
I've heard him say so many times
what a fine young man you are.

349
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,086
I have a favor I'd like to ask.

350
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,042
For our brother, for his family, for his boy.

351
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,488
<i>Rosa, it's Nancy from the church.</i>

352
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,723
<i>Colton Burpo is in the hospital
and he may not live.</i>

353
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,369
Our Father who art in heaven...

354
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,962
Mr. and Mrs. Burpo.

355
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,366
Colton.

356
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,167
Hi.

357
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,930
Hi, buddy.

358
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,526
Hi.

359
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,201
Dad, I want to hold

360
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,848
that spider.

361
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,081
Wow.

362
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,562
I think it's amazing.

363
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,131
- How is it?
- Fun.

364
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,241
- Now you have to do it.
- I'm not going to do it.

365
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,560
- Do it, do it!
- I'm not doing it.

366
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,880
- Do you want a sticker?
- Get the kid a sticker.

367
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,007
Okay.

368
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,809
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

369
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,970
That's fun.

370
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,530
I've been here.

371
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,409
Here? I don't think
we've been here before, pal.

372
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,769
- Guess what.
- What?

373
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,644
- I like spiders.
- I saw that!

374
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,044
You got a sticker. You're not afraid anymore.

375
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,042
We don't ever have to be scared.

376
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,209
Is that why you wanted to come back,
to show me you weren't afraid?

377
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,725
It's important.

378
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,324
What about the hospital?

379
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,927
How do you feel about that?
Does that scare you?

380
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,890
No, that's where the angels sang to me.

381
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,368
The angels sang to you?

382
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,887
Yes.

383
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,566
When?

384
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,771
During the operation, when Mom
was in one room talking on the phone,

385
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,402
and you were in another room yelling at God.

386
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,604
How did you know that?

387
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,683
Because I saw you.

388
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,965
When did you see me?

389
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,890
I lifted up and I looked down
and saw the doctor working on me.

390
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,206
<i>And I saw you and Mommy.</i>

391
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,810
You saw...

392
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,402
<i>- Hey-
_H€Y-</i>

393
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,084
<i>A storm's coming.</i>

394
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,566
<i>Are you setting records?</i>

395
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,047
- You got a sticker, huh?
-It's a record.

396
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,802
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

397
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,931
How was the trip?

398
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,566
- It was good. Fine.
- Just fine?

399
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,687
It was amazing, actually.

400
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,286
Colton held that spider like
he was holding his Spider-Man.

401
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,486
Come on.

402
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,371
Did he ever mention this idea to you
of hearing angels singing?

403
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,007
Not unless you're talking about
you and me in the shower.

404
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,481
Todd, these bills, they are coming through.

405
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,404
- How bad?
-$23,000.

406
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,970
I mean, do we have any receivables,
anything we can collect at all?

407
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,930
These utilities, we can put those off.

408
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,805
Now this one, I have to pay Jack Martin
for those truck tires. His wife is sick.

409
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,963
We've got a medical bill
coming in as well. $34,000.

410
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,724
- I thought this was part of the $23,000.
- No.

411
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,600
That's just what we owe with
medical supplies, living expenses, taxes.

412
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,160
- I'm going to have to get a job.
- I don't want to do that.

413
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,368
But you can't work any harder than you are.

414
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,171
- We need you here.
- You have to pay the doctor.

415
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,405
Of course, honey. We're going to find
some way to take care of that.

416
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,087
We've got to pay him.
He helped me. I saw him.

417
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,526
- Is something wrong with Colton?
- Why do you say that?

418
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,251
Because sometimes he sounds weird.

419
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,402
He says Jesus has a horse.

420
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,644
Well, all sisters think
their brothers are weird.

421
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,604
That's just the way it goes. Okay?

422
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,211
All right.

423
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,848
Okay, so, your dad's a preacher.
He knows a lot of things,

424
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,083
but he didn't know that Jesus has a horse.

425
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,965
Didn't know that.

426
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,243
It's beautiful.

427
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,687
Yeah? What color is it?

428
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,529
It's all the colors.

429
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,649
All the colors of the rainbow are in heaven,

430
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,327
except they're all more.

431
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,882
- More what?
- Just more and brighter.

432
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,526
How do you know about this horse?

433
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,443
Because I saw him in heaven.

434
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,482
You were in heaven?

435
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,282
Dad, can we talk about this tomorrow
because I'm getting really sleepy.

436
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,566
Okay.

437
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,085
Dad, can I sleep in your room tonight?

438
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,247
No. No, we're going to go ahead
and sleep here.

439
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,322
It's late, guys. Come on.

440
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,406
- Open the door!
- Sorry.

441
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,931
Are you asleep?

442
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,287
Colton just told me he went to heaven.

443
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,449
What? When?

444
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,411
Just now.

445
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,129
No, when did he go to heaven?

446
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,488
He said that during his operation,
he left his body,

447
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,246
and he looked back on the operating table
and saw himself.

448
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,083
He has a very beautiful imagination.

449
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,531
I'll do it, too. I'll have the same thing.

450
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,649
Hi, how are you, Rosa? Can we get...
What do you think?

451
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,961
Milkshake.
- Two milkshakes, please.

452
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,802
- How is everything?
- Okay, great.

453
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,450
So, Colton,

454
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,330
I want to ask you about
when the angels sang to you.

455
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,561
Sure.

456
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,801
<i>I was alone, but I wasn't scared.</i>

457
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,124
<i>I was at the church.</i>

458
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,365
<i>The door was closed.</i>

459
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,329
<i>I opened it.</i>

460
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,043
<i>And I saw something wonderful.</i>

461
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,002
<i>Hallelujah</i>

462
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,562
<i>Hallelujah</i>

463
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,162
<i>I saw angels and they were singing to me.</i>

464
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,051
<i>Can we sing We Will Rock You?</i>

465
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,003
Colton, do you know who I am?

466
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,125
You're not afraid?

467
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,487
Nobody here wants to hurt me.

468
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,684
That's right, Colton.

469
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,728
And nobody here ever will.

470
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,005
There are some people here
who want to meet you.

471
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,489
So, what did they sing?

472
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,131
I asked them to sing We <i>Will Rock</i> You,
but they wouldn't.

473
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,687
And they laughed just like that.

474
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,650
Milkshake.

475
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,483
<i>Moreland University,
Department of Psychology,</i>

476
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,686
<i>Chairman's office.</i>

477
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,809
<i>- May I speak with Dr. Slater, please'?
-Are you calling for an appointment?</i>

478
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,248
<i>Yeah. ls there any chance
she could see me today?</i>

479
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,127
- Dr. Slater?
- Yes.

480
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,084
Hi. I'm Todd Burpo.

481
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,481
Yes, please come in.

482
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,887
Thanks for seeing me on short notice.

483
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,885
"Burpo". Are you a minister over in Imperial?

484
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,247
Yeah. Yes. How'd you know that?

485
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,529
My late husband was religious. Please, sit.

486
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,482
He had heard about a speaker
named Burpo who was very interesting

487
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,040
and he kept badgering me to come hear you.

488
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,566
You're not?

489
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,201
- Not what?
- Religious.

490
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,286
No. Is that a problem?

491
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,567
No.

492
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,890
No, you might offer me a harder opinion,

493
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,248
help me find a more rational
understanding for something.

494
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,690
I have a son who's extremely smart.

495
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,410
And he's sensitive.

496
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,927
And?

497
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,045
He went to heaven.

498
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,324
And then he came back.

499
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,609
- Your son had a near-death experience?
- No, he didn't die.

500
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,411
We checked his surgical reports.

501
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,966
His heart never stopped,
his brain activity never flatlined.

502
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,961
- So, why do you say he went to heaven?
- Because he says he did.

503
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,808
At the point near death,

504
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,130
the body releases hormones
that can induce a state of peace, even bliss.

505
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,329
Our brains fill in the blanks.

506
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,405
Christians see Jesus, Jews see Moses,
Muslims see Muhammad.

507
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,725
Yeah, I read your article, but my son
saw things that I can't really explain.

508
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,282
He saw me praying. He saw me

509
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,810
shouting at God. He saw his mother
in another wing calling friends,

510
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,282
asking them to pray for us.
All the while, he was in surgery.

511
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,327
- Reverend Burpo...
- Todd.

512
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,086
Todd.

513
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,281
Is it unusual for your wife
to call friends in a time of crisis?

514
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,844
No. No, it's not.

515
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,601
And is it unusual for you to pray?
Or become passionate when you do?

516
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,048
No. No. Of course not. But I know my son.

517
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,564
And when he talks about heaven,

518
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,968
it doesn't sound like something
he's making up.

519
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,690
He's very specific. He's four.

520
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,049
- And he's extremely smart.
- Yes. Both of my kids are.

521
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,646
Reverend...

522
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,046
Todd, I don't mean to discount
whatever magic it is

523
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,205
you derive from all of this,
but there are many explanations,

524
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,328
even for extrasensory knowledge.

525
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,444
Is it really easier to believe in that

526
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,970
or clairvoyance or telepathy
than it is life after the physical?

527
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,530
Believe in miracles?

528
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,885
I've found such concepts to be a bit circular.

529
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,161
Even before I watched my husband die.

530
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,848
Let me ask you,
did you come here today because

531
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,891
you were wondering about my faith?
Or were you wondering about your own?

532
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,770
Thanks for your time.

533
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,771
You're welcome.

534
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,526
What if you have an encounter so far

535
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,969
beyond your own experience that it's

536
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,800
irrational?

537
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,480
What then?

538
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,361
This looks like trouble here.

539
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,807
- Todd, we're so happy about Colton.
- Thank you.

540
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,327
Thanks. Thank you very much.
See you later. Good.

541
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,521
There he is.

542
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,602
- How are you doing, buddy?
- Good. How are you?

543
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,361
How's that Colton doing today?
Is he back to torturing his sister?

544
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,487
Yes.

545
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,766
I need some advice, smart advice.

546
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,011
Well, I am not smart,
so you came to the right guy.

547
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,127
I know that.

548
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,761
Nothing but clumsy,
inaccurate advice available here.

549
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,888
I've been expecting to see you a little sooner.

550
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,170
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm your banker.

551
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,009
I didn't come here for a loan.

552
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,408
Not the bank's money,
just from a friend to a friend.

553
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,245
Let me help you out, okay?
Nobody would have to know.

554
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,481
I'd know.

555
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,526
I never wanted to be the guy
who stands up there in the pulpit

556
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,331
asking people to give to charity
when all he does is take it.

557
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,883
It's not charity.
It's a loan from a friend to a friend.

558
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,930
I know you need the help.
It's what real people do.

559
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,240
I don't.

560
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,371
Well, then you didn't come here
for smart advice.

561
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,960
I don't think the church has kept
your salary in line with

562
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,362
the new members that you've brought in.
I think you deserve a raise.

563
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,046
Let me talk to the board, see what I can do.

564
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,521
I didn't come here for a raise, either.

565
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,202
All right. Good. I didn't want to ask them.

566
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,564
What can I do for you?

567
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,086
It's Colton.

568
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,086
He's been talking about this...

569
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,328
We ask these kids to believe this stuff

570
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,210
and I don't even know
if I believe it myself, Jay.

571
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,327
What?

572
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,009
Colton is what I'm trying to tell you about.
He's been saying things I don't understand.

573
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,731
He's talking about these conversations
in heaven.

574
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,370
I used to go out with a flight attendant

575
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,887
whose son had extensive conversations
with Barney the dinosaur.

576
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,205
- Do you know how irritating Barney is?
- Yeah.

577
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,726
- He's purple.
- Exactly, exactly.

578
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,644
The Bible tells us to believe his children.

579
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,288
What my child's telling me
will get me laughed out of this town.

580
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,931
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know what to preach.

581
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,445
I don't have anything to say.

582
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,410
Just speak from the heart, Todd,
like you always do.

583
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,970
<i>What about fear do we struggle with?
Is it confusion?</i>

584
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,641
Is it doubt? Is it questions?

585
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,445
I got questions.

586
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,080
We all do. Maybe we ought to just...

587
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,965
Maybe we ought to try that today.
Justseeitn

588
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,929
Do you want to try questions?

589
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,289
- Hey, Todd.
- Yeah?

590
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,600
- My family and I prayed for you a lot.
- Thank you. Thank you, Michael.

591
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,201
We're just wondering, how bad was it?

592
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,842
"How bad?" it was awful.

593
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,482
I mean, a lot of us heard that
Colton died during the operation

594
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,211
and prayers brought him back to life.

595
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,724
No, he didn't die on the operating table.

596
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,001
He, you know, came mighty close,
but I think it was the doctors,

597
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,449
through God and all of your prayers,
that kept him alive

598
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,966
and so thank you all for that.

599
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,570
- So, how did you handle it?
- Not well.

600
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,601
But the important thing is that
the Burpos faced a significant challenge

601
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,081
and they came through it. Amen.

602
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,207
Amen.

603
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,366
That's the thing, though.

604
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,047
Thank you for that, Jay,
but I don't know that I did come through.

605
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,323
Colton's experience makes me wonder.

606
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,562
About what, exactly, Todd?

607
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,565
He's just been telling us about
his experiences, talking

608
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,206
about them.

609
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,047
When he was in the operation,
Colton visited heaven.

610
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,360
But you said he didn't die.

611
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,365
He didn't, but he saw heaven.

612
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,690
- He saw Jesus and angels and...
- But how?

613
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,166
I don't know.

614
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,765
- Reverend Burpo.
- Todd.

615
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,367
Todd. Some of the hospital staff have said,
off the record,

616
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,001
that your son was not expected to survive
and used the word "miracle".

617
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,961
- How would you explain that?
- I haven't even tried to do that.

618
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,441
Can you try?

619
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,166
If he didn't die, how could he see heaven?

620
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,129
I don't know, but he did.

621
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,202
Do you believe he was in heaven?

622
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,809
I know he saw something.

623
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,923
It sure sounded like heaven.

624
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,720
Good Lord,
what's happened to our preacher?

625
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,082
Well, I thought that went well, huh?

626
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,805
Nice view.

627
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,009
I love being up so high.

628
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,008
Colton! Hey!

629
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,811
I thought I asked you
to stop playing with that!

630
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,400
- I'm sorry, Dad!
- I told him not to, Dad!

631
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,241
Half the church wants to stop feeling
and start thinking.

632
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,961
And the other half,
they want the exact opposite.

633
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,325
This is Todd.

634
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,567
Yeah.

635
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,290
Let me call you back.

636
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,964
That was the newspaper.

637
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,809
They want to do an article about heaven.

638
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,807
And?

639
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,442
And they want to interview Colton.

640
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,841
And you think that's a good idea?

641
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,408
So, Colton, a lot of people
were praying for you.

642
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,925
I guess.

643
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,650
Well, that must feel good.

644
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,485
Come over here, buddy.
You're being interviewed.

645
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,601
Thank you.

646
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,085
You were very sick.

647
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,208
What did it feel like to die?

648
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,560
- I didn't die.
- But you went to heaven?

649
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,762
That's a little off-topic.

650
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,650
It's beautiful.

651
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,730
You saw heaven?

652
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,844
What does it look like?

653
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,526
Like here, but even more beautiful.

654
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,725
And you saw Jesus?

655
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,847
Yeah.

656
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,083
He's very nice. I sat on his lap.
He has markers.

657
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,966
Markers?

658
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,888
Yeah. Right here and right here
and right here and right here.

659
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,926
Can I go swing on the swing some more?

660
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,407
Yeah.

661
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,650
So, Jesus has a horse?

662
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,001
There are lots of animals in heaven.

663
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,531
They don't believe me, do they?

664
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,086
Some people might be afraid to believe.

665
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,968
- What are they afraid of?
- I don't know.

666
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,251
Maybe they're afraid that there's no heaven.

667
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,201
Or maybe they're afraid that there is.

668
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,009
You believe me, Daddy, don't you?

669
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,090
I believe God loves you. And so do I.

670
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,522
Can I get your picture?

671
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,327
- What's that?
- Can I take your picture?

672
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,527
Yeah.

673
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,171
And...

674
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,970
Thank you.

675
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,007
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Jay. Have you seen this?

676
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,282
<i>Yeah, I read it a couple of times.</i>

677
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,164
It's quite an article.

678
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,971
<i>I love Todd, but I love our church, too.</i>

679
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,840
And I really can't stand to see it
turn into some kind of circus.

680
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,047
<i>- Why don't we get together?
- Yeah,</i> I <i>think that's</i> a <i>good idea.</i>

681
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,804
<i>- Okay,</i> thank you.
- Okay.

682
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,803
- Bye-bye.
- All right, bye-bye.

683
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,649
No, that's okay.
Actually, I'm going to get out of here.

684
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,483
No, no. It's on me, buddy.

685
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,130
- What do you mean?
-It's on me.

686
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,521
- No. No. No. No. lgot this.
- No. It's on me.

687
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,207
Sonja gives Rosa clothes for Miguelito
whenever Colton outgrows anything.

688
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,841
And she gave Lucia a baby dress that
an angel would wear.

689
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,810
- A pink dress?
- Yeah, beautiful.

690
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,491
So, please, give me the gift of giving back.

691
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,728
Okay. Thanks a lot.

692
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,444
- All right.
- Bye. Bye, sweetie.

693
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,806
Say bye. bye.

694
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,403
Hey. Hey, Burpo.

695
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,051
Hey, next time there's a fire,
maybe you should tell Jesus that

696
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,045
instead of walking on the water,
he could just dump it all on your fire.

697
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,527
Right?

698
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,727
Come on. You gotta see the humor in it.

699
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,968
Kayla, pass it to me.

700
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,324
Come on. Yeah.

701
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,569
Hey, Cassie, did your brother
really sit on Jesus' lap?

702
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,563
Did he ask for a new bicycle

703
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,763
or a magic DOW?

704
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,403
Hello. This is Todd.

705
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,047
Yeah.

706
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,962
Well, I'm surprised to hear that.

707
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,440
Can you hold on?

708
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,126
Honey, did you punch
a kid in the nose today?

709
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,642
With your fist?

710
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,405
In the nose?

711
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,807
Yep.

712
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,604
But not one kid. Two.

713
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,168
What was the reason, honey?

714
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,521
She hits good when she wants to.

715
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,682
I'm sorry. Can I call you right back?

716
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,843
No, honey.
I think we should talk about this right now.

717
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,528
If you punched somebody,
there must have been a good reason for it.

718
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,251
They were making fun of Colton.

719
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,608
They made fun about him
sitting on Jesus' lap.

720
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,483
Honey, you know you should have
turned the other cheek, though, right?

721
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,609
I did turn his other cheek. When I hit him.

722
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,647
Is Cassie going to get a spanking?

723
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,485
Heck, no.

724
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,201
I'm just going to teach her to hit
without hurting her knuckles.

725
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,641
Hey-

726
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,522
Are you having trouble sleeping?

727
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,642
No. Are you?

728
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,566
Yeah.

729
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,963
It's pretty cool what Cassie did today, huh?

730
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,010
Yeah. It's pretty cool.

731
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,845
Do you want to talk?

732
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,247
Sure.

733
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,887
Great. I like our talks.

734
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,364
Can we talk about heaven?

735
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,283
What would you like to know?

736
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,129
What did Jesus look like?

737
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,601
He's kind of hard to describe.

738
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,966
I'll bet.

739
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,645
Did he look

740
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,040
maybe like a picture you've seen?

741
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,285
How about...

742
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,251
- Did he look like that?
- The clothes. Not the face.

743
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,211
This one?

744
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,847
- This?
- No. Jesus has light eyes.

745
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,411
What color?

746
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,126
Bluish or green.

747
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,850
Bluish-greenish.

748
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,210
- Here.
- Hey.

749
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,170
- Did you get enough sleep?
- Not much.

750
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,606
So, he says that Jesus has light eyes.

751
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,164
Greenish blue.
Yours are green, mine are blue.

752
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,409
He's seeing us.

753
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,722
It's quite a compliment, really.

754
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,205
In college, I read something about

755
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,524
our own personal concept of God
comes from our feelings about our father.

756
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,850
I sure hope not. Mine had issues.

757
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,171
If our kids, they grow up believing that
they are loved the way you love them,

758
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,648
the luckiest kids alive.

759
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,971
- We've got a fire.
- We sure have.

760
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,970
I'm going to take care of that one,
come home, and add to this, all right?

761
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,166
I'll be here.

762
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,321
- Get two hoses on that car!
- No, no, no.

763
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,084
- They're in there!
- Who?

764
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,844
My family, they're in there!

765
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,922
- You've got a search?
- Yeah, he's saying they're in there.

766
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,243
Todd, you're in.
Let's go, let's run another one.

767
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,084
Here, you'll need this.

768
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,400
Keep him back.

769
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,885
Let's go, let's go!

770
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,691
- That's hot! That's hot!
- You can't go in there!

771
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,651
Hello? Is anyone here?

772
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,926
Hello?

773
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,002
It's clear! It's clear!

774
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,684
Charge. Clear. Shock.

775
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,768
Charge. Clear. Shock.

776
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,127
Colton, this is just a visit,

777
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,409
but before you go back,
I want you to meet someone.

778
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,042
I heard you gave Michael and Rosa
a baby present.

779
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,331
Yeah, I thought they could use it.

780
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,205
- Let's go out.
- What?

781
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,727
Yeah. Call Sheila. She'll watch them.

782
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,006
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

783
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,411
Honey, no, we can't afford it.

784
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,131
That charity auction last year, dinner for two.

785
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,884
Maple Grove restaurant, your favorite place.

786
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,689
- We used that already.
- No, we did not.

787
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,969
- We did. What are you doing?
- No, we did not. We did not.

788
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,289
The darker the night, the brighter they are.

789
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,411
Like you.

790
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,444
Yeah, you're good.

791
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,244
It's my best stuff.

792
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,849
It's getting darker, though.

793
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,924
We're out of money.

794
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,529
We're out of credit, too.

795
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,685
And the church board called me today.

796
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,249
They want to sit down with you
and talk about where we're at as a church.

797
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,209
Why didn't they call me?

798
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,289
I don't think they wanted you to think that
they were putting you on the spot.

799
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,040
Because they are putting you on the spot.

800
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,721
Todd, we're prepared for you
to have all kinds of struggles,

801
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,610
and we're here to support you
during those times.

802
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,130
We've extended a leave of absence.

803
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,208
- Twice.
- Twice, right.

804
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,841
So, I think you're aware
the church is not doing very well without you

805
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,200
and so we need to know
what to plan for in the close future.

806
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,084
The question for me isn't whether
you're preaching, it's what you're preaching.

807
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,847
Colton's trip to heaven disturbs
a lot of people. it disturbs me.

808
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,003
Do you take it as a literal event?

809
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,003
Well, for him, it's not imaginary.

810
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,927
It's not a metaphor or a feeling. it happened.

811
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,766
And I take that seriously. I just
don't know what to make of it. You know?

812
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,730
What about it bothers you so much?

813
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,283
What is it? I mean, I want to talk about it.
I need to talk about it.

814
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,091
All right. I don't like that it feels like

815
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,610
some fairy tale,

816
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,004
just a simple, easy explanation of life.
I don't like that.

817
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,761
Okay. So, because it appeals
to simple people?

818
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,326
No. No. Yeah.

819
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,887
Okay. I don't like how it makes our church

820
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,930
a magnet for everyone who
wants to take the brain out of their head

821
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,365
and beat it to death with the Bible

822
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,808
and then seem to want to show off
how much they believe.

823
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,441
Heaven and hell have always been concepts

824
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,490
that have been used to control
and frighten people.

825
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,851
That's one way to look at it, but

826
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,841
all Colton's ever talked about is heaven
and how it's a beautiful place.

827
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,325
Todd, what do you plan on preaching?

828
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,370
All of us have times when we lose our way.
That's when we look to leaders.

829
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,326
If you're going to lead this church,
you've got to make a decision.

830
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,686
All right.
I say that we give Todd a little bit more time.

831
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,004
One more week.

832
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,370
But in the meantime, we need to start
planning for the future of our church

833
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,761
and looking for someone else.

834
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,001
Here you go. B-U-R-P-O.

835
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,605
Yeah, we've got everything ready
to settle your account today.

836
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,686
I can't do that today.
I had an unforeseen situation.

837
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,603
- You're not going to settle today?
- Not today.

838
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:48,002
Well, you are aware that we have
extended your accounts twice already.

839
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,321
- I think it's been one extension.
- No, it's been twice.

840
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,607
And they are going to collections
as we speak.

841
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,968
Okay, but the collections
is not something that...

842
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,725
Hey, Colton.

843
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,447
Hospital policy demands that I tell you
your account is going to collections.

844
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,925
Colton.

845
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,086
Colton!

846
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,884
Hey, come here.

847
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,041
Colton!

848
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,567
- I need to tell them. Please.
- Come here.

849
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,890
Yes, sweetie.

850
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,725
They don't look like that.

851
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,208
It's all right. No one will ever hurt you.

852
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,083
Come on, guys, WW UP-

853
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,322
Mom's got a music conference today.

854
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,401
Hurry, hurry-

855
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,485
Hey, you didn't tell me
how the church board meeting went.

856
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,926
They've started looking for somebody else.

857
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,525
Guys, let's go, come on. Go brush your teeth.

858
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,207
Well, we'll figure it out.

859
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,645
You didn't come to bed
until it was almost dawn.

860
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,520
I was researching near-death experiences.

861
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,603
- Are you all right?
-It's fine!

862
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,283
- It's fine. I mean, don't you think that...
- Hey! What?

863
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,160
...we need to be talking about this life?
Not the next one.

864
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,368
I'm right here.
What do you want to talk about?

865
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,604
We need to make sure
our children are safe and they are happy.

866
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,008
- And that they are normal!
- Happy, yes! And normal! I agree!

867
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,006
I have to go out to that service for that loner

868
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,527
who died after the fire in his motor home.
He didn't have any friends or next of kin.

869
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,365
- You've got Colton today.
- I'm going to take him with me.

870
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,566
Great.

871
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,410
He's never been freaked out
in those situations. He's a lot of comfort.

872
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,403
For the dead man or for you?

873
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,926
Touché.

874
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,925
Touché. Touché.

875
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,922
Our Father who art in heaven,

876
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,729
hallowed be Thy name.

877
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,646
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

878
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,764
on earth as it is in heaven.

879
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,003
Give us this day, our daily bread.

880
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,922
Aim. Begin.

881
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,442
- You had a grandpa named "Pop", right?
- That's right.

882
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,804
Was he your daddy's daddy
or your mommy's daddy?

883
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,283
He was my mom's dad.
He died when I was about your age.

884
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,370
He's very nice.

885
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,724
You saw Pop? You saw my grandfather?

886
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,845
You saw him?

887
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,645
- Where did you see him?
- In heaven.

888
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,811
I loved my grandfather very much.

889
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,724
He was there with me
when my father couldn't be.

890
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,090
He taught me to weld.
He gave me that slingshot.

891
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,721
I know. We play with it.

892
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,321
That's right. And he was a good man.

893
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,327
He was a really good man,
but I don't know what he believed in.

894
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,244
None of us did.

895
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,526
I think

896
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,090
he's one of the reasons
your dad became a minister.

897
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,411
I was hoping he would get a break
getting into heaven then.

898
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,046
You don't have to worry, Dad. He's there.

899
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,529
He came up to me and told me he was
your grandfather and you called him "Pop".

900
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,809
And he held me in his lap just like Jesus did.

901
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,850
And he told me everything was all right.

902
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,247
Okay, look at this.

903
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,807
Is this him? Is this the man you saw?

904
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,962
No. That's not who I saw.

905
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,011
Okay, but just look. Are you sure? Colton?

906
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,448
Nobody wears glasses in heaven.

907
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,688
Can I go play?
Because when Mom gets home...

908
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,603
Are you sure that's not him?

909
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,810
- It's not him.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

910
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,645
- When Mom gets home...
- Mom will be home in a second.

911
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,722
Just wait one second. Wait.

912
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,126
Colton?

913
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,164
That's him. That's Pop.

914
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,966
In heaven, everybody's young.

915
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,603
Are you okay, Dad?

916
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,407
An awful lot happened to you in heaven.

917
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,801
Yeah, it was amazing.

918
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,563
Todd, dinner is going to be ready in five...

919
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,730
Are you okay?

920
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,404
Colton saw Pop.

921
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,928
In heaven. My grandfather.

922
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,082
I don't know what to make of this.

923
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,766
Well, I don't have the luxury
of not knowing, Sonja.

924
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,320
I don't. Everything he tells me,

925
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,561
it hits me, you know?
And I want to believe him.

926
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,845
Okay, I want to believe him. He's four.

927
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,651
He's four.
He's so innocent, he can't be making this up,

928
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,326
but everything he talks about is impossible.

929
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,447
It is a massive adventure that he's created.

930
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,922
He's talking about Jesus,
seeing Jesus' horse.

931
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,890
He talks about choirs of angels
and my grandfather.

932
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,762
It would take weeks or days,
but, "For God a day is a thousand years."

933
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,049
"And a thousand years but a day."
I'm just saying that's scripture.

934
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,202
It's scripture. There's no clock.

935
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,601
There's no clock.
Einstein talks about the same thing.

936
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,520
-"Some reality is beyond time."
- Why can't it just be a mystery?

937
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,009
Because I think God might be
trying to reach out to us through Colton.

938
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,127
That's what I think.

939
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,125
What Colton is telling us, Todd,
is an echo of every story,

940
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,568
every song, every image
he's seen since he was a child.

941
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,650
Why does this have to be a myth? Why?

942
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,369
I don't know. I don't know how to move on

943
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,805
with my life.

944
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,324
Tell me what to do.

945
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,925
I don't know.

946
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,641
All I care about is if my husband
and my family know that I love them.

947
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,923
I'm sorry I can't help you with any of this.

948
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,483
Well, I'm here.

949
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,325
Where are you?

950
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,203
Please accept this flag
as a symbol of our appreciation

951
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,045
for your loved one's
honorable and faithful service.

952
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,567
Your son was a hero. He died a brave marine.

953
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,321
You.

954
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,926
I always figured it was Jay leaving

955
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,083
flags and flowers here on my son's grave.

956
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,163
I failed you, Nancy.

957
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,410
The worst moment of your life,

958
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,525
loss beyond comprehension, and I had...

959
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,170
I had nothing for you.

960
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,290
No comfort.

961
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,206
No hope.

962
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,205
No peace.

963
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,124
- I should have maybe...
- No, you didn't let me down.

964
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,443
You couldn't take my pain away
and I didn't want it gone.

965
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,241
For a while, pain was all I had of him.

966
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,326
You don't have to save the world, Todd.

967
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,646
I believe that's already been done.

968
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,122
Since that meeting at the church

969
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,724
where I was the bitter woman
I swore I'd never be,

970
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,210
I've been thinking.

971
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,010
It's not the people of the church I'm mad at.

972
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,322
And it's not you. Not your son.

973
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,685
It's God.

974
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,163
Why God would give you your son back
and take mine away.

975
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,682
When Colton was in that hospital,

976
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,164
I saw he was dying

977
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,602
and some part of me broke.

978
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,446
Some part that still hasn't mended.

979
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,170
Nancy, you don't ever
have to apologize to me

980
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,561
for any broken part you carry.

981
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,804
Do you think...

982
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,930
I have to ask.

983
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,771
Do you think my son went to heaven?

984
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,041
Do you love your son still?

985
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,885
Of course.

986
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,608
- Do you think I love mine?
- I know you do.

987
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,767
Do you think I love my son
more than you love yours?

988
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,640
No.

989
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,487
Do you think God loves my son
more than he loves yours?

990
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,044
Mommy?

991
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,645
Yes, Colton.

992
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,643
Did you know I have a sister?

993
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,290
Yes, Colton, of course,
I know you have a sister.

994
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,325
I didn't know.

995
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,011
You didn't know that Cassie is your sister?

996
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,681
No, I have two sisters.

997
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,123
You had a baby die in your tummy,
didn't you?

998
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,450
Honey, who told you
I had a baby die in my tummy?

999
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,570
She told me she died in your tummy.

1000
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,609
What does she look like?

1001
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,365
Like Cassie, but a little smaller.

1002
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,728
And hair like yours.

1003
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,846
In heaven, this little girl came up to me
and she wouldn't stop hugging me.

1004
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,967
Honey, what did... What was her name?

1005
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,527
She didn't have a name.
You guys didn't name her.

1006
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,127
You're right. We didn't. We...

1007
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,646
We didn't know that she was a "she".

1008
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,567
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- Yeah.

1009
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,202
We lost a baby, sweetheart,

1010
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,042
just a few months before she was...

1011
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,881
Todd.

1012
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,086
That's our baby. That's our little girl.

1013
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,765
She's okay.

1014
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,211
I don't want to be late for school today
and the phone's ringing!

1015
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,691
I'll get it.

1016
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,087
- H <i>i.
- Pastor Todd Burpo?</i>

1017
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,241
This is Todd.

1018
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,243
<i>Great. We're live on the air with Todd Burpo.</i>

1019
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,527
<i>Can you tell us about
your son's adventure in heaven?</i>

1020
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,125
- On the air?
- Dad!

1021
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,607
<i>Everybody here in Imperial
followed the story of your son's sickness</i>

1022
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,001
<i>and people all over town
were praying for his recovery.</i>

1023
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,845
<i>Now we're starting to hear of
an amazing trip he took to heaven.</i>

1024
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,127
<i>Can you tell us about that?</i>

1025
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,931
Come by Crossroads Wesleyan Church
on Sunday.

1026
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,122
I'll tell you all about it.

1027
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,888
<i>Here's my heart now</i>

1028
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,441
<i>Take and seal it</i>

1029
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:09,044
<i>Seal it for Thy courts above</i>

1030
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,042
<i>Here's my heart now</i>

1031
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,723
<i>Take and seal it</i>

1032
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,171
<i>Seal it for Thy courts</i>

1033
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:28,648
<i>Above</i>

1034
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,165
I love you.

1035
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,403
I'm standing here today with
wounds that are still healing,

1036
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,047
fears that are still echoing

1037
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,926
and in that way, maybe some of you
are sitting here this morning exactly like me.

1038
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,686
I can say truthfully that
the pain that I suffered,

1039
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,609
it was nothing compared to
watching my son that close to death.

1040
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,841
So, now we've got a question.

1041
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,929
Was Colton in heaven?

1042
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,206
Yes.

1043
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,360
He was in the heaven that God showed him.

1044
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,204
Is heaven real?

1045
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,767
'Cause, if heaven is for real,

1046
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,489
we'd all lead different lives, wouldn't we?

1047
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,131
Would we?

1048
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,010
Really? Haven't we already seen heaven?

1049
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:48,927
In the first cry of a baby,
the courage of a friend,

1050
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,685
the hands of a nurse or a doctor,
the love of a mother or father.

1051
01:25:53,760 --> 01:26:00,166
Haven't we already had a glimpse
of heaven and so often chosen the hell

1052
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,244
of hate and fear?

1053
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:09,162
Is heaven for real? Every single
one of you has asked that question.

1054
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,164
All of us have. And for me, the answer...

1055
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,245
It's "yes."

1056
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,969
I see it, so I believe it.

1057
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,604
And what we believe
changes what we perceive.

1058
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,288
And I believe that God, he's love.

1059
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,684
Ten thousand times I've been here
and I've talked about

1060
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,728
"On earth as it is in heaven."

1061
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,130
And I don't know that I ever listened to that.

1062
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:47,002
And my son, he saw something.
He saw heaven.

1063
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,168
He'll tell you all about Jesus.

1064
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,042
How about that name? "Jesus."

1065
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,291
"Jesus?

1066
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,211
It creates so much hope in so many of you,

1067
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,641
so much distrust in so many others.

1068
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,530
That's okay.

1069
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,090
I believe God asked me to be a pastor.

1070
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,484
Did he insist on my vision
being the same as yours? Or yours?

1071
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:22,131
Of course not.
Did he make me one those heroes like

1072
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,761
that lion and the bear and unicorn
I preached about?

1073
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,845
No. That's what I wanted.
God had a different plan.

1074
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,567
God crushed my pride.

1075
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,084
He opened my heart

1076
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,570
to love.

1077
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,248
And all I have to do,

1078
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,608
the one thing this love requires

1079
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,445
is that I let others know they're not alone.

1080
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,968
So amazing.

1081
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,121
Welcome back. Good work, buddy.

1082
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,082
It's good to see you.

1083
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,400
Hey, Randy.

1084
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,404
Are things okay over there?

1085
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,649
What? What? What was that?

1086
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,411
- Hey, thanks very much, John.
- You're welcome.

1087
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,887
Thanks. You, too. I am.

1088
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,290
Hey, Ray.

1089
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,722
<i>She picked up the brush
when she was just six years old.</i>

1090
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,210
<i>But the visions...</i>

1091
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,288
- Mom, can I have some lemonade, please?
- Of course.

1092
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,601
<i>...started when she was just four.</i>

1093
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,490
- Look <i>at this on</i> CNN.
<i>- She's</i> a <i>self-taught painter.</i>

1094
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,562
It's about a girl on the other side of the world

1095
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,166
who had an experience a lot like Colton's.

1096
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,882
She saw visions of heaven.
Look at this. Angels.

1097
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,285
<i>She began to describe to her mother
in great detail...</i>

1098
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,771
Look at this, honey. This is incredible.

1099
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,569
<i>...her visits to heaven.</i>

1100
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,411
-It's nice, honey, but I have got to talk to you.
- Okay.

1101
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,931
Okay, but she's...

1102
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,005
At the age of four,
she began to describe her visits to heaven.

1103
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,521
See?

1104
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,843
Colton? Are you okay?

1105
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,690
That's him.

1106
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,245
That's...

1107
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,405
But... Colton.

1108
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,089
That's him?

1109
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,683
That's who you saw? Colton, come here.

1110
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,889
- I've got to talk to you.
- Come on. This is...

1111
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,291
Hey, I want to talk to you.

1112
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,801
He told me that painting back there
that girl saw is what Colton saw.

1113
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,963
Todd, you know that little baby-blue
outfit we keep in the drawer?

1114
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,611
Todd, we're going to need this.

1115
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,926
Really?

1116
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,450
- Really?
- Yeah.

1117
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,164
- Wow.
- I know.

1118
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,484
- Wow, when did you find out?
- Yesterday.
