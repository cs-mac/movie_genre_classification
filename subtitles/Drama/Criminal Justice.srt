1
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:06,709
Don't you even think about it!

2
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:08,319
Back it up.

3
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:18,779
Everybody, down!

4
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,748
Everybody, down!

5
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,879
I think I said watch it.

6
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:41,792
I said watch it!

7
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,675
Please, don't.

8
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,842
Over the past two months,
the L. A. Field office has been tracking

9
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,941
a series of 4 bank robberies
in the L. A. Metro area.

10
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,481
It's one individual wearing
a black ski mask.

11
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:09,931
He's highly skilled.
It's his unique M. O.

12
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,336
that put him squarely in our court.

13
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,123
This happened two days ago.

14
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:19,221
He's making them undress?

15
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:21,590
He takes their clothes
and locks them in the vault,

16
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:22,941
then he goes for the cash.

17
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:24,042
Smart.

18
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:25,973
Nobody's going to run
after him butt naked.

19
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:28,283
It's also a psychological
advantage.

20
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:30,231
Make the captives feel exposed,

21
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,551
intimidated, and much less likely
to fight back.

22
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:34,661
That, and the mac-10
he's waving around.

23
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,730
- Boy's got a lot of firepower.
- But why is this case for us?

24
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,890
Because in the last robbery,
two things changed.

25
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:43,020
One, he beat the security guard
nearly senseless,

26
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,831
and two, after he made
everyone undress,

27
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,951
he forced two pairs of victims
together at gunpoint,

28
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,553
then he made them
simulate sex with each other.

29
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:58,832
It's remarkable.
By utilizing a practical M. O.

30
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:00,972
The unsub has stumbled on to
a psychological signature.

31
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:03,651
- It's fascinating.
- He's a sex offender now.

32
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,661
Fueled by violent rage.

33
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,391
Only our unsub doesn't know it yet.
If he did,

34
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,573
he wouldn't be robbing banks anymore.

35
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,371
So, he's a violent sex offender
in denial.

36
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:25,291
And a sexual predator
who's just escalated his crimes.

37
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:27,423
He's a serial killer in the making.

38

Criminal Minds Season 2 Episode 4
"Psychodrama"

39
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:09,710
Hey, what are you doing here?

40
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:12,353
Your cell phone kept going
straight to voicemail.

41
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:14,441
Yeah, no, I was in a meeting.

42
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,110
Is everything all right?

43
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,653
Going out of town?

44
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:20,522
Yeah, we gotta go to L. A.
I was going to call you from the car.

45
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,161
What is it?

46
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,111
You really don't know
why I'm here?

47
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:29,231
Honey, I'm sorry,
we're running late.

48
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,833
I just got back from
the hospital.

49
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,640
- Jack?
- Oh, my God, the tests.

50
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,263
- What happened?
- He's got a condition.

51
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:47,131
It's treatable
and he's going to be okay.

52
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,332
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:52,951
How was he?

54
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,331
Scared.

55
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:58,162
They put those electrodes all over him and
he was wondering where his daddy was.

56
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:03,741
- Babe, you promised you'd be there.
- I know.

57
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,113
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,360
Where is he now?

59
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,241
At home with my mom.

60
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,171
I didn't want him here
while we were talking.

61
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:18,351
Look, I know this job
is important to you,

62
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:22,080
- but we're important, too.
- You don't have to tell me that.

63
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,032
I don't want you to wake up
some day in some random city

64
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:29,632
and realize that you don't know
your own son.

65
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,850
They can go without me.

66
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:37,802
No, they can't.

67
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:39,730
It's okay.

68
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:41,343
Go.

69
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,613
We'll talk about it
when you get home.

70
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,701
I'm so sorry.

71
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:55,953
Sorry

72
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:06,382

"Stripping bandit."

76
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:17,512
That's terrible. That makes it sound
like the bandit's doing the stripping.

77
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,771
What would you call him?

78
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,291
- Pervert.
- Scumbag.

79
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,350
- I'd call him an ass
- Hey, focus, please.

80
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:25,363
We have the details of the 4 bank robberies
to learn before we get to Los Angeles.

81
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,611
At this point is he more a bank robber
or a sex offender?

82
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,863
Seriously. What's he going to do next,
rob a bank or rape somebody?

83
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,253
I'd say we need to know more about
how he robs the banks

84
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:36,432
- and who he chooses to victimize.
- Why these banks and why these victims?

85
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:39,731
Pairing these specific people
together is a fantasy.

86
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:41,732
If we can figure out
the nature of that fantasy,

87
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:44,152
we may be able
to predict his targets.

88
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:49,461
In the last robbery I don't see any photos
of what he made the victims actually do.

89
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:52,291
There is a problem with this surveillance
system. We're working on it.

90
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,520
We should hit the ground running.
How should we break it down?

91
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:57,953
There's got to be a pattern to the banks.
We should run a geographical profile.

92
00:05:57,965 --> 00:05:59,063
That's yours.

93
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:02,232
And for the sexual aspects, we need
to look at the specific victimology.

94
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,912
You and I can go
with the victim reports,

95
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,600
see whatever surveillance footage
they've got.

96
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,241
Leaves the unsub himself.

97
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,052
We'll need his perspective.

98
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,540
Crime scene.

99
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:43,853
The suspect entered around 2:00 P. M.

100
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:46,762
And a witness said he saw a man
on a motorcycle with a backpack

101
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,283
speed by a few minutes
after the robbery.

102
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,102
Freeway's just a few blocks
that way, right?

103
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,262
Actually, we're within
a half-mile of 3 freeways.

104
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:54,871
This is a perfect location.

105
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,823
If he's on a bike, he's got no trouble
getting out of here.

106
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:59,003
Well, first he's got
to get to his bike.

107
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,792
- Where's it parked?
- It could be anywhere.

108
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,462
No! No.

109
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,992
A guy this good wouldn't risk his bike not
being anywhere near when he comes out.

110
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,533
He'd park illegally. Probably not
in the parking lot, but

111
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,712
further down the block,
maybe, or

112
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,763
or right across the street here.

113
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,152
We need to know if any of these places
have security cameras

114
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:15,700
that might have caught the bike.

115
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,673
Ready?

116
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,032
Let's go rob a bank.

117
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,013
Basically,

118
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:25,801
we assume the suspects will hunt
close to where they live,

119
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:27,701
but far enough
to remain anonymous.

120
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:30,070
Each one of these data points
represents a bank that he hit,

121
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:32,963
and this area
where the lines intersect

122
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:35,572
give us the best estimate
of the unsub's home.

123
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,783
So, how many does
that narrow it down to?

124
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:40,763
Couple hundred thousand.

125
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,250
Oh.

126
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,551
Witness statements.

127
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,013
Not planning on seeing any of the sights
this afternoon, were you?

128
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:51,942
I've already seen the Hollywood sign,
been to the Getty center,

129
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,022
I'm not really interested in
John Wayne's footprints,

130
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,722
so I guess that covers
the sights of Los Angeles.

131
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,633
Let me guess, New York?

132
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,013
Now, what would make you say that?

133
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:02,493
Is this all the video equipment
you've got?

134
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:04,003
That ain't Quantico.

135
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,073
I need to set up a link
with our tech back there.

136
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,683
We got another bay as crappy
as this one down the hall.

137
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:11,313
- You all right?
- I just need some popcorn.

138
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:12,493
Have fun.

139
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,630
So, he enters

140
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:20,094
and he walks right to this spot.

141
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:25,156
Pulls his weapon out and shoots
into the ceiling right there.

142
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,253
That gets everyone's attention,
let's them all know he's dead serious.

143
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:30,543
Efficient.

144
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,292
This is the best spot in the bank.

145
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:34,972
I can see all the tellers,
the front door,

146
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,893
and that's the back office
over there.

147
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:42,003
- So, he knew exactly where to go.
- He had been here before.

148
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,053
Next.

149
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,193
Next, he turns,

150
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,023
<i>- aims the gun at the guard.
- Don't you even think about it!</i>

151
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,270
<i>Back it up.</i>

152
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:55,093
Disarms the guard
and handcuffs him to the base.

153
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:58,650
So, where's the threat?

154
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,471
The guard's disarmed and chained.
How's he a threat to the unsub?

155
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:02,843
He isn't.

156
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:05,141
Then why did he take
the time to assault?

157
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,440
He's got control,
he's obviously got skills,

158
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,513
the very thing
that he doesn't have is time.

159
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,670
He didn't assault the guards
in the previous banks, why?

160
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,163
What's changed?
What's different about this guard?

161
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,882
Maybe this guard
reminded him of somebody.

162
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:20,342
What were the guards
in the previous robberies wearing?

163
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,062
Uniforms?

164
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:23,792
Black suits.

165
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:25,422
That's it.

166
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:26,990
That's all.

167
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,470
Our boy's efficient,
he's determined.

168
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,302
This ain't his first picnic.

169
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:36,150
He's got his trade down cold.

170
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,990
Something about a guy in uniform
triggers an emotional response.

171
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,132
- Army?
- No

172
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,370
Army, you're conditioned to work
with people. This guy,

173
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:44,813
he don't trust anybody.

174
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:45,983
Prison.

175
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,033
Best trade school in the country.

176
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:52,023
I got access to 4 bank robberies
with security footage.

177
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,091
<i>- What do I get to do with them?
- You know your...</i>

178
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:56,901
digital perspective
whatever software?

179
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,373
<i>- Digital perspective analysis rendering?
- Yeah.</i>

180
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,630
Honey, not only do I know it,
I helped develop it.

181
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,320
Good,'cause I want every physical
dimension of the unsub:

182
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,233
Height, waist size, inseam,
everything that you can give me.

183
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,292
Honey, if he opens his mouth,
I'll give you the length of his teeth.

184
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,730
Just keep it clean
and don't call me honey.

185
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:17,771
See anything interesting?

186
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:19,440
Maybe.

187
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:21,733
<i>He took his time,</i>

188
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:23,333
<i>he looked at me,</i>

189
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,642
<i>then he pointed his gun at me.</i>

190
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,862
<i>And you were all naked
at this point?</i>

191
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:29,831
<i>Yes.</i>

192
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:33,881
Bank manager's wife.
She stopped by to pick him up.

193
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:36,473
They were going to celebrate
their son's 16th birthday.

194
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,280
The son was with them?

195
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:39,863
Daughter, too.

196
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,150
He knows the kids are theirs?

197
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,401
Witnesses said he checked
their wallets first.

198
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:52,000
He would have seen their names.

199
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,423
So, of all 13 people,
he puts together

200
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:58,101
woman in her 60's, guy in his 30's,
married couple in front of their kids.

201
00:10:58,966 --> 00:10:59,793
Why?

202
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:02,742
Maybe they were the most inappropriate
couples he could think of.

203
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,251
He's sadistic.

204
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:07,613
Would explains
why he brings them here.

205
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,432
He could have taken them
behind the teller windows,

206
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:11,870
he could have taken them back
into the vault, but he chooses here.

207
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,362
It's the most exposed place
in the bank.

208
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:17,930
Like a stage.

209
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,011
Like, it was as important for them to see
what was going on as it was for him.

210
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,450
Public humiliation.

211
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,373
I said, watch it!

212
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:37,120
Robbery wasn't about the money.
It was about getting off

213
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:39,891
on what he made
these people do on this spot.

214
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:43,183
Forcing others
to squirm and watch.

215
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:45,603
We got to know what exactly
they were forced to do.

216
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:48,053
We need to see the fantasy.

217
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,523
Did you ever get
a hold of the security videos?

218
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,851
Yes, but they were mostly erased.

219
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:57,950
That's Henderson,
the bank manager.

220
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,391
Said he was so flustered
after what he had been through,

221
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,470
that when he was gathering
the tapes for us,

222
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,643
he hit the wrong buttons
and erased part of them.

223
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,980
- You believe him? - No. I told
him I thought he was embarrassed

224
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,261
about the tapes getting out
and he erased them on purpose.

225
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:11,182
He denied it.

226
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,613
You rule out the possibility
he was in on it?

227
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:16,400
Why would he be involved in a robbery when
he had to go through something like that?

228
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,153
Maybe he didn't know what was gonna happen.
Maybe he was betrayed by the unsub.

229
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:21,772
Or perhaps he was coerced.

230
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,720
There's been many
documented cases of robbers

231
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:26,421
forcing bank managers to assist them
with their crimes.

232
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:29,413
None of that is consistent with
the M. O.'S of the other robberies.

233
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,473
Maybe there's a reason this last one
was different from the others.

234
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,683
- A call from Quantico on one.
- Thanks.

235
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,261
Garcia, it's Hotch.

236
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,321
<i>Are we ready for something
completely weird?</i>

237
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:40,401
<i>- How weird are we talking, Garcia?
- The security footage Hotch gave me,</i>

238
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,361
<i>- I ran it through my software 3 times...
- and?</i>

239
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,973
And there are weird height issues.

240
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:49,413
I. e., the unsub in the first
three robberies is 6 foot 1

241
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:53,020
and the unsub in the last robbery,
he's 5'10".

242
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:55,381
So what? In the last robbery
we're dealing with a different unsub?

243
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:57,671
An unsub who is somehow
able to erase tapes

244
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:00,052
that show exactly
what happened at that bank.

245
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,212
An unsub who may have possibly had
inside help.

246
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:06,441
I think it's time we sit down
with the bank manager.

247
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:10,921
Look, I already told
the other agent

248
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:13,871
that I was nervous.
I screwed up.

249
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:16,593
What else do you want me to say?

250
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:20,291
It took you 9 minutes to call 911
after the robber left.

251
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:23,422
I was collecting the tapes.
Before you called 911?

252
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,320
You think I had something
to do with this?

253
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:29,422
You think I'd put my family
through this?

254
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:30,432
No.

255
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:38,262
I don't think you'd put your family through
letting those tapes get out either.

256
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:43,012
You were the only one who had access
to those tapes, mr. Henderson.

257
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,371
Now, at best, you erased them
because you were embarrassed,

258
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:47,710
and at worst, because you had
something to do with the robbery.

259
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,782
Now, which would you rather
have us think?

260
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,352
You got to understand.

261
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,290
We were raised baptists.

262
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:57,450
It's hard for us to talk
about this kind of thing.

263
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:00,142
It's hard for all of us.

264
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,903
The thought about anybody
seeing those tapes,

265
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,722
even the police...

266
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:15,393
No.

267
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:21,263
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:24,492
I didn't think it would matter.

270
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:33,353
I think it's pretty clear
what this is about.

271
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,292
Shame and humiliation.

272
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,791
<i>Everybody, down!</i>

273
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:42,642
<i>I said, watch it!</i>

274
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,291
<i>Watch it!</i>

275
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,082
There is nothing wrong
with my software.

276
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:52,141
My software is perfect,

277
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,740
isn't it?
No, it isn't.

278
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,603
Why must your beauty be so

279
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,041
painful?
God!

280
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,953
<i>- Yeah?
- Pals, don't be ticked,</i>

281
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:16,162
<i>but I think I may have missed
the sort of glaringly obvious here.</i>

282
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:19,721
<i>How would you make yourself taller
without being a different person entirely</i>

283
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:22,002
or having some sort
of weird chinese surgery?

284
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:22,923
Heels.

285
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,333
<i>Right, sunshine,
but would have seen heels,</i>

286
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:28,192
<i>unless the unsub had them hidden
inside his shoe.</i>

287
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,242
<i>The point is, lifts.
- Lifts.</i>

288
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,250
Lifts, all hidden up
inside his boot.

289
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:36,253
<i>With a little fancy footwork,
pun emphatically intended,</i>

290
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,071
Garcia here managed to dig him out.

291
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,133
Thanks, girl.

292
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:42,022
He's trying to throw us off,
hide his real height.

293
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,541
But why would he take the lifts out
just for the last robbery?

294
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:45,721
Maybe he's getting careless.

295
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,662
Which means he's also getting
more dangerous.

296
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,801
At least we know we're only dealing
with one unsub.

297
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,913
Based on the knowledge that spending
a significant time in prison

298
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,702
stunts emotional growth
while increasing professional skills,

299
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:09,842
we can estimate this unsub went to jail

300
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,970
between the ages of 18 and 22 and spent

301
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,332
between 5 and 10 years inside.

302
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,192
That puts him at the approximate age

303
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,880
between 23 and 35.

304
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,052
This guy's much more than just
a bank robber though.

305
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,652
What started out as a practical M. O.,
stripping his hostages,

306
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:32,523
triggered a deep
psycho-sexual response.

307
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:35,043
In other words, when he found himself
in front of a bunch of naked people

308
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,211
under his control, he snapped,

309
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:40,600
- then he decided to manipulate them.
- And better, or just getting worse,

310
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:42,561
he's attacking banks
earlier in the day

311
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,270
when more and more
people are present.

312
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:47,672
This sounds like he's sacrificing the safety
of having just a few hostages to contain,

313
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,053
for the satisfaction of having
more subjects to control.

314
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,471
He'll be less interested in money
and more interested

315
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,661
in sadistically manipulating
his captives.

316
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,531
In all likelihood,
he'll be high on drugs.

317
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:04,123
It would be wrong, however,
to write this guy off as crazy.

318
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:05,762
Bank robbing is an ambitious crime

319
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,892
and it takes time and planning
to pull it off.

320
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:09,982
What makes this unsub unique

321
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,390
is his fractured psyche.

322
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,522
On the one hand,

323
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:17,082
a cold, organized bank robber.

324
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:18,680
On the other,

325
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:21,500
a disorganized sexual sadist

326
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,372
full of bottled up rage.

327
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:28,332
<i>Freeze!</i>

328
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:29,571
<i>Drop it!</i>

329
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,982
<i>- No.
- Come on now,</i>

330
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,942
<i>just put it down.</i>

331
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,891
<i>I got a mac-10.</i>

332
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,401
<i>One shot.
You got one shot to kill me.</i>

333
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,551
<i>Even if you kill me,
I'm going down shooting.</i>

334
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:03,253
The two parts of his psyche have

335
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:05,600
just begun to bleed together,

336
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,723
now when they finally converge,

337
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:10,223
we're talking about a criminal

338
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,142
with the skills and efficiency

339
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,181
of a master bank robber

340
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:17,360
and the rage of a suicide bomber.

341
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:19,202
He will explode.

342
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,523
Take them off.

343
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:51,112
- I said take them off.
- No.

344
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,841
Take... them... off!

345
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,282
Sir,

346
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,700
bank robbery in progress.
Corner of Washington and Sepulveda.

347
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:03,392
Kid in the back room
called 911 on his cell.

348
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:05,921
Said the suspect's started making
people undress.

349
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:10,241
<i>L. A. air 8, requesting immediate
air support, Washington and Sepulveda.</i>

350
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:34,453
How far are we from the bank?

351
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:37,371
- Without traffic, 10 minutes.
- Let's avoid traffic.

352
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:54,082
Do I have everybody's attention?

353
00:20:04,728 --> 00:20:05,671
How we doing?

354
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,851
- About 8 minutes.
- Make it 3.

355
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,403
Please?

356
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:25,483
Less than a mile.

357
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,233
Just around the corner.

358
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,191
Is this your bike?

359
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:54,263
- Call E. M. S.!
- F. B. I.

360
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:55,112
- He took off.
- Where?

361
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,022
- I don't know.
- Ma'am. Ma'am, Can you hear me?

362
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,622
- She's unconscious.
- Medics are on their way.

363
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,501
Gideon, he may be headed your way.

364
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:04,800
You know what the odds are of catching
a motorcycle with a car in L. A.?

365
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:06,873
Try not to think about it.

366
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:11,092
There.

367
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,393
Damn it. Go.

368
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:38,813
It's the first time he's made
so many mistakes.

369
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:41,592
Hit the bank in the morning,
more people around.

370
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:44,012
Didn't clear the back room,
parked his bike right out front.

371
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:47,030
- Didn't bother taking any money.
- Did almost everything you predicted.

372
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:50,952
Sometimes it sucks to be right.

373
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:53,660
Witnesses said he refused
to take off his clothes.

374
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:57,673
- Damn.
- That's enough.

375
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,232
It's not the kind of rage
you bottle back up.

376
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:06,803
This could be the beginning
of a spree.

377
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,261
How's JJ doing on that suspect list?

378
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:15,100
I'll call her. I'll call Reid and Elle
and get them on it, too.

379
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,390
You don't think he's going to rob
another bank?

380
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:21,553
No.

381
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,501
He doesn't care about money anymore.

382
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,300
Whatever he's after,

383
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,971
he'll hurt anyone
who gets in his way.

384
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:52,761
- You call Elle and Reid?
- Yeah.

385
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:56,733
- What's that?
- My son's first steps.

386
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,340
I was out of town
and Haley sent me the file.

387
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:00,760
It's nice.

388
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:04,060
It's 5 months ago. I haven't loaded
anything on here since.

389
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,613
Okay. So you film a new one
when you get home.

390
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:14,062
So, you're sure this is it?

391
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:15,861
Yeah. Based on all the parameters,

392
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:18,001
age, armed robbery charge,

393
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:19,381
time spent in prison,

394
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:21,410
approximate location
of home address based on

395
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:22,983
geographical profile.

396
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,103
It's about 360 names.

397
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:27,872
these guys aren't sweethearts, but
there's only a handful with sex crimes

398
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,472
on their rap sheets
and none are sexual sadists.

399
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:34,030
That's not surprising. Bank robbers and
gun nuts aren't typically sex offenders.

400
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,162
That's what makes this unsub unique.

401
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:37,560
What about a pimp?

402
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:41,372
Roland Lynch, 32 years old.

403
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:44,002
Pimps are characteristically sociopathic

404
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:45,800
and, in many cases, sadistic.

405
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,793
Helps control their employees.

406
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,113
Well, this one started out
robbing convenience stores

407
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,943
before working his way into pimping.

408
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,970
That's unusual.
Pimps typically violate by proxy,

409
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:56,720
forcing others to do the work
for them, whereas,

410
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:59,581
bank robbers usually operate
in pairs or alone.

411
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:01,070
So, he's sexually sadistic

412
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,352
and has experience
with armed robbery.

413
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,443
Along with fitting
all other parameters of the profile.

414
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:08,203
All right. I'll get in touch
with his parole officer.

415
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,511
You're Lynch's parole officer. When
was the last time you talked to him?

416
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,933
Haven't talked to Lynch
in a month.

417
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,613
What can you tell us about him?

418
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:17,511
Roland?

419
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:19,352
A real peach.

420
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:22,742
He used to punish his girls by raping
them in front of their little sisters.

421
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:27,020
- He got a habit?
- Which one of mine doesn't?

422
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:30,171
If I'm not mistaken, he probably has
about a 10 rock a day monkey.

423
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:32,230
If Lynch is our guy,
he's going downhill fast,

424
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:34,561
but if he's tweaking,
he's going down even faster.

425
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,012
His latest drug test isn't back yet,

426
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:38,902
but I'm betting
it isn't going to be clean.

427
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,652
You got a line on him?

428
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,253
Give me a break.
You know what my case load is like?

429
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,500
Hey, come on, man.

430
00:25:44,507 --> 00:25:46,660
He might have beaten a civilian
to death with a mac-10,

431
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,271
caved in a meter maid's face,
and that's just the beginning.

432
00:25:49,495 --> 00:25:51,141
That make the top of your list.

433
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:53,892
- I'll make some calls.
- Thank you.

434
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:03,113
F. B. I. I need Roland Lynch.

435
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,631
talk to me, Roland Lynch.
Roland lynch?

436
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:08,222
- Hey! Roland Lynch?
- Quoi?

437
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:10,162
Don't even think about it.
Don't move!

438
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,041
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

439
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,900
You know I can count about 16 different
ways you've just violated your parole.

440
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:21,051
They send in feds for busting parole?

441
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:24,110
We're here for the bank robberies
and the delivery man you killed.

442
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:26,200
I don't rob banks.

443
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,592
You violated parole,
we've got you on possession,

444
00:26:28,608 --> 00:26:29,851
you're going down.

445
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:32,532
You think I'm gonna roll over'cause
you're waving 3 to 5 at me?

446
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,531
I took beating's that lasted
longer than that.

447
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:35,640
If I were you,

448
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:37,920
I wouldn't even worry
about the murder charge.

449
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:41,030
I'd worry what happens to you
when word gets around you're a pervert.

450
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,942
Yeah, well, I made my living
being a pervert.

451
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,203
You can tell them that.
Oh, this is different.

452
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,250
Went after little old ladies, kids.

453
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:51,471
Witnesses say you got off
when the old lady took her shirt off.

454
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,732
Old ladies, kids, inside,
think about it.

455
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:58,481
Hey, Roland,

456
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:00,912
you're high out of your mind
right now, aren't you?

457
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:03,210
- Get him in the car.
- Take him back to the field office,

458
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:05,232
spend a few hours with him,
he'll sober up.

459
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:08,281
Give me a pot of coffee and I'll go all
night with this fool. Get him out of here.

460
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:30,591
<i>- Hey, Morgan.
- We got him.</i>

461
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:32,291
<i>This guy's a hardcore prison rat.</i>

462
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,822
- Elle.
- Hang on.

463
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:36,021
We just got another call,
restaurant in the south bay.

464
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,791
Guy came in in a ski-mask,
started making people undress.

465
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:41,101
- He just shot a 14-year-old kid.
- When?

466
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:43,132
- 10 minutes ago.
- What'd she say?

467
00:27:43,137 --> 00:27:44,380
Hardcore or not,

468
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:46,420
you've got the wrong scumbag.

469
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:51,451
According to witnesses,
he came in and

470
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:53,251
fired into ceiling.

471
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:58,901
He separated all the kids
from their parents.

472
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:09,750
Then?

473
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:15,141
He's forcing the sons to
hit their mothers.

474
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:16,531
He started to.

475
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:19,582
When he tried to get the first one
to hit his mother harder,

476
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:22,003
he refused, and

477
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:24,943
when he refused...

478
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:30,491
it doesn't make sense.
They're children.

479
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,061
He's playing out a fantasy.

480
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:36,720
Yeah, but it's his fantasy
and someone else's children.

481
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:39,082
They're surrogates of some kind.

482
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:40,851
No. You don't do this

483
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:43,743
to someone else's kids to get off.
You just don't do it.

484
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:56,601
It just doesn't make sense to me.

485
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,663
You internalize violence.
You take it out on other people.

486
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:01,201
Why force somebody else to do it?

487
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,930
Why force children
to act out your rage?

488
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:07,450
He didn't make the children
do anything at the bank.

489
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:10,890
Manager said
he put the parents together.

490
00:29:11,136 --> 00:29:13,972
So, why is he so focused
on the kids now?

491
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:16,873
I want to talk
to the bank manager again.

492
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,060
I don't know what else I can tell you.
I've already gone over it 3 times.

493
00:29:25,855 --> 00:29:27,960
What we need to know is
if there's something in that tape

494
00:29:27,997 --> 00:29:29,911
that you don't want us to know about?

495
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:34,892
There were 12 other people in that bank
who were forced to watch.

496
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:37,030
What could I possibly be hiding?

497
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:46,031
This is about
your children, isn't it?

498
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,882
We're sorry.

499
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:01,883
Mr. Henderson,

500
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,970
this is very important.

501
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:07,090
He's already killed 2 people
and he's not going to stop.

502
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:12,243
God!
Go ahead.

503
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,780
Why don't you tell them
what he did to us,

504
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:16,891
what you let him do?

505
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:18,651
He had a gun.

506
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,160
He was going to kill me.

507
00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:34,062
Come on.

508
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:48,132
They took my family from me.

509
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,723
We can't even look
at each other anymore.

510
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,872
I don't know how a family
gets over something like that.

511
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:07,470
They don't.

512
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,123
Excuse me.

513
00:31:12,027 --> 00:31:14,761
Is it true he would have killed my father
if he tried to stand up to him?

514
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:18,320
There's no way to know, Darren,
but your father did the right thing.

515
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,990
Is there some reason
you doubt that?

516
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,420
It's just...

517
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,460
the robber said something afterwards.

518
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,171
He said he was sorry.

519
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,761
He apologized.

520
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:41,221
Sadists don't apologize.
They gloat, maybe,

521
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:44,053
- but they don't apologize.
- Our guy's not a sadist.

522
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:46,522
We got that part
of the profile wrong.

523
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:49,873
He doesn't derive any sadistic
pleasure from these fantasies,

524
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,713
they're more like a compulsion.

525
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,551
Compulsion that's literally
life or death?

526
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,810
I mean, if anyone interferes,
he kills them.

527
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:58,940
It's like he's compelled
to direct these fantasies

528
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:00,691
using these people as actors.

529
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,621
Actors on a stage,
it's a play.

530
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:04,423
It's a psychodrama.

531
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:07,480
What's that?

532
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:10,083
It's a form of psychotherapy
whereby actors serve as surrogates

533
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,151
for actual people in the patient's life.

534
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:15,121
Incorporates many elements of theatre,
including an audience.

535
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,213
There's a very famous pilot program
at the San Luis Obispo county jail

536
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,371
in the mid-nineties.

537
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,911
Isn't that just a couple hours
away from here?

538
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:24,051
Let's go over the suspect list and
see how many of them

539
00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:26,261
did time in San Luis Obispo.

540
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:27,923
The answer is 4.

541
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:30,152
<i>Come on. Tell me you narrowed it down
a little more than that.</i>

542
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,892
Only two live in state,
but only 1 lives in L. A.

543
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:34,601
Ha, that a girl.

544
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:36,501
Caleb Dale Sheppard,
last known address

545
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:39,262
- 236 Harbor Lane, Inglewood.
- Thanks, mama.

546
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,273
That's only 1.6 miles
from the last restaurant that he hit.

547
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,092
I've been studying
a lot of L. A. Maps.

548
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,703
If he's been attacking that close
to home, he's given up any interest

549
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,072
in protecting his identity.

550
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:51,470
We need to all go down there
and split up, half to his address,

551
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:54,501
half patrol in the area around
the restaurant in case he's on the hunt.

552
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,442
Mrs. Sheppard, do you know
where your son is?

553
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:26,641
Dale doesn't live here anymore.

554
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:28,713
Where is he, mrs. Sheppard?

555
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:30,761
He's a grown man.

556
00:33:32,036 --> 00:33:34,740
You have any idea how much trouble
your son could be in?

557
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:35,993
Jail?

558
00:33:36,408 --> 00:33:37,783
He's a good boy.

559
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:39,761
Lost his way a bit, that's all.

560
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:42,371
Well, that's one way to look at 12 years
in and out of prison.

561
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,472
You've never made a mistake?

562
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,391
Your son spent time
in a juvenile home?

563
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:49,842
He was out of control,

564
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:52,292
even attacked
his own sister once,

565
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:54,272
but his father died.

566
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,001
It wasn't his fault.

567
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,290
Was it yours?

568
00:33:58,165 --> 00:33:59,421
What?

569
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:01,443
Was it your fault?

570
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:06,941
How many of these
did you take today, mrs. Sheppard?

571
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:08,533
I had...

572
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:11,123
back problems my whole life.

573
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:17,962
She's completely
out of her mind.

574
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,921
She's so lonely
she'll just keep talking to us.

575
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:23,183
I doubt she'll tell us
where he is.

576
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:25,532
That was Garcia.
Apparently Sheppard's sister died

577
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:26,973
12 years ago,

578
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:28,463
suicide.

579
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:31,671
Lady sure did a number
on her kids.

580
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:35,653
She's probably lonely after
the husband died and on painkillers,

581
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:37,010
not in her right mind, and

582
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:39,392
nobody there to turn to but
Sheppard and his sister.

583
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:42,031
So, now he's symbolically
punishing his mother?

584
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,830
He's playing out a fantasy.

585
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:46,812
Sons gaining total control
over their mothers.

586
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,460
We got something.

587
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:52,543
"Dale daybreak hotel."

588
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:12,972
Sheppard,

589
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:15,431
- F. B. I.
- Key?

590
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:17,752
No, I got one.

591
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:28,271
Clear!

592
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,591
Yeah, it's clear here, too.

593
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:45,313
Morgan.
Crystal meth.

594
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:48,963
Oh, he's got to be halfway
out of his mind by now.

595
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:51,103
Which would explain
why he left this behind.

596
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,861
Well, it looks like he's on foot.
Here's his bike.

597
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:02,141
I'm calling Hotch.

598
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:18,812
<i>- Yeah?
- Look, he's not here.</i>

599
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,501
From the looks of it,
he just left.

600
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:21,971
<i>Hotch, he's tweaking.</i>

601
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:23,731
<i>He's unmasked
and he's probably on foot.</i>

602
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,962
All right, stay there.
Call if there's any sign of him.

603
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:26,870
Okay. You Too.

604
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:29,213
If he's on foot, he must still be
in the neighborhood.

605
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:30,873
How do we find him?

606
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:33,892
At this point, he'll probably hit the
first thing that catches his attention.

607
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:36,080
- Families.
- A public place.

608
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,711
If the trend continues,
he'll look for a bigger audience.

609
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,202
Public place with families.

610
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:41,990
Guys, there's a public park
not far from here.

611
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,901
- Where?
-. 6 miles from where we are now.

612
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,900
. 9 miles from the hotel
where the unsub's staying,

613
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:48,573
which we'll actually pass
if we take a right at the next light.

614
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:24,363
There's no sign of him.

615
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,481
We've got cruisers everywhere.
Where could he be?

616
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:32,140
There's only a few blocks
between here and his hotel.

617
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,530
He's got to be really close.

618
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,260
- Do it.
- No.

619
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,122
- I said, do it.
- No.

620
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:06,970
- Do it.
- It's okay.

621
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:09,102
- Come on, you can do it.
- No, no.

622
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:11,342
Please, just do
what he says, please.

623
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,460
- I said do it!
- Please, do what he says.

624
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:15,702
It's ok, sweetheart.

625
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,473
Mommy says it's ok.

626
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:22,742
Put it down.

627
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,152
Drop the knife.

628
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:27,313
It won't fix you, Sheppard.

629
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,122
It doesn't matter
what you make them do,

630
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:31,313
how many people
are watching you.

631
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:38,800
- Oh, my God.
- Got him.

632
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:41,840
It's okay, baby.

633
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:48,261
Look at these people.
Look at them!

634
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,400
They're children.

635
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:52,851
They're children,
for god's sake.

636
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:02,391
I need something that kills.

637
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,482
Give me something.
I need something.

638
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,071
You shot me!

639
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:10,171
You had a hunting knife
to a little boy's throat.

640
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:12,510
Just give me something
for the pain,

641
00:39:12,526 --> 00:39:14,023
you son of a bitch!

642
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:18,620
- She did it!
- Who did?

643
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,023
My mom.

644
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,503
You don't know
what she did to me.

645
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:23,752
Did you really think you were going
to get back at your mom

646
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,363
by attacking all these other people?

647
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:27,063
The bitch deserved it.

648
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:29,691
Except you didn't go after her,
you went after all these other women.

649
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:31,503
- So what?
- You went after children.

650
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:33,273
They're gonna have to learn
sooner or later.

651
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:36,203
What are they going to have to learn?
That no one's there for you.

652
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,662
He's a drug addict. He's detoxing.
I don't care what he asks for.

653
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:42,711
- Don't give him anything.
- Come on.

654
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:45,340
He's not a doctor.

655
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:49,140
He's right. I'm an F. B. I. agent,
and he killed a 14-year-old boy today.

656
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,842
<i>"The basis of shame</i>

657
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:06,322
<i>is not some personal
mistake of ours,</i>

658
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:09,421
<i>but that this humiliation
is seen by everyone."</i>

659
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:12,152
<i>Milan Kundera.</i>

660
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,910
You okay?

661
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:33,391
I was showing those trainees
around the offices the other day.

662
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,620
They all want to be in the BAU.

663
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,382
I told them what a great job it is.

664
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:44,081
And they even applauded
when the tour was over.

665
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:47,412
I heard.

666
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:49,092
Yeah, but I didn't really tell them
the truth.

667
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:51,770
I didn't tell them what it's like
to spend your days in this hell.

668
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:54,023
It's fun, huh?

669
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:57,350
I mean, who's to blame
for somebody like Sheppard?

670
00:40:58,536 --> 00:40:59,653
His mother?

671
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,151
Broken home?

672
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:04,443
Society? All of it?
None of it?

673
00:41:06,668 --> 00:41:09,002
It gets worse and worse
with each case.

674
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:13,060
Save one life,
we save the world.

675
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,130
Yeah.

676
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:21,700
Well, the one thing
I didn't tell the trainees.

677
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:24,701
- What's that?
- We do not get paid enough.

678
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,273
You got that right.
